three of their last four and hes played 35 or more minutes in their last seven games so he will be the proverbial straw that stirs the drink for first year coach Kenny Payne meanwhile cannot say enough how important Saturdays winning Atlanta was for Jeff Capel but he reminded his team today it just gets us back to where we want to go Dan as a basketball team well they lost games to Clemson and to Duke and so those arent bad losses and thats what you have to do is when youre playing uh in college basketball youve got to get as many good wins as you can and avoid bad losses Burton out of the left corner three rims away and the rebound for Jalen Withers the cards go with their fifth different starting lineup Bradley Huntley Hatfield not available or Brandon Huntley Hatfield by the way not available tonight for Louisville for a second straight game with a foot injury so they go with Kamari lands The Freshman from Indianapolis on the floor tonight and here is curry who was challenged by his coach to have a big game and he follows his own Miss and Louisville takes an early lead thats a really nice job by Louisville to move the ball and create that situation inside Im not sure Federico has the ball to handle Kern and there is a foul on Curry as Burton attacked on the dribble good crew here tonight Lamar Simpson Tim clockerty and Doug sermons who whistles the first on the Fort Wayne Indiana senior Sydney Kurt and keep one thing in mind Wes if youre Curry you cant play if youre in foul trouble and thats what Burton does Burton attacks you and puts you in situations where you might foul Blake Jensen here is Nelly Cummings lots been discussed about Pitt and the composition of this roster heres Henson on the spin put it up got his own rebound and his threerack was knocked out of bounds last touched by the car and Wes none of that hit the rim none of those attempts hit the rim so the Panthers have four and a half seconds left to shoot the ball Cummings will put it on play Burtons looking for the lob against Ellis spot throwing on the Baseline and here is Burton on the long inbounds and an offensive foul on jamaris Burton thatll be his first number one on the Panthers and Jeff Capel 48 years of age Fayetteville North Carolina native now in season five and well you can kind of sense the consistency a little bit of continuity is developed in this Panther program after a lot of stuff had to be done in the first previous three four years now well hes done a nice job building the program I think hes got a team that he really likes yep Curry threw it away lands was standing out on the wing in an unforced error for Kenny Paynes club and L Ellis is talking to Lance I think Curry threw the ball where Lance was supposed to be but Lance wasnt there Blake Henson here is Elliott hes a transfer from Marquette this is Burton no surprise on the touch each time offensively Henson hesitates tried to score and hes going to draw a cardinal foul on the drive Applause Withers draws his first its a second on Louisville 67 235 Junior transfer from Iowa State to the line theres Kenny Payne looking for his first ACC win Louisvilles lost 11 straight ACC games their last Conference win was February against Clemson free throw by Henson heres the first point of the night for the Panthers Wes one of the things that you saw Louisville do on that last defensive series is curry left Federico to double team Burton and I think thats what youre going to see Federico is the guy whos not heavily involved in the offense and youre going to see Louisville leaving him taking some chances defensively a sophomore from Finland Federico Federico foreign toman defense and heres where Federico is going to struggle Curry did he travel double dribble says Doug sermons so another Cardinal turnover Dan well but fortunately for the Cardinals that wasnt a transition turnover West Pitt has to take the ball out of bounds you dont want to throw it ball to the other team and give them as what Tom izo calls turnovers for touchdowns skip across Cummings an open three and Miss is recovered by lands on the rebound interested to see Kamari lands with this opportunity to start on the floor tonight for Kenny Payne threeball Withers Music Applause Pittsburgh and trailing 52 Jalen Withers 21st three of the year he started the ball game last Saturday against Carolina after coming off the bench the previous three Burton tries to answer can I missed on the backside and Withers the rebound for Louisville well this is a guy who can shoot the three started out a little slowly this year but in ACC play hes come on a bit heres Lance Withers thought about it out of the corner Mike James Curry had a shot at the rebound heres Cummings in Pittsburgh Burtons tell him to hurry up Elliott thought about the three step in two is good for Greg Elliott the Third his first point s the cards operating with a onepoint lead here in the first three and a half Applause listen how often do you go the first three and a half minutes of the game until well thats the point I was kind of waiting to see if Ellis is going to create hell take it on the drive turn it over to Burton Here Comes Cummings three on two into the corner Elliott tees up a three and its good and therell be a foul on Henson he knocked I believe Withers to the deck the three ball is going to count Elliotts got five in a row well Wes and this is this is the kind of turnover that you cant have really nice job getting the ball up the court and the officials that ball has to be out of Elliotts Hand by the time the foul occurs and the officials are very comfortable making that call if he still has the ball in his hand when his teammate commits a foul then that doesnt count Burton comes out of the Ball Game Nike savandy who is terrific in Atlanta against Georgia Tech with 21 points he is the Sixth Man traditionally for Jeff Capel and hes onto the floor here with just better than four minutes gone first half theres some Bandy defending against James on the drive trying to feed Curry knocked away James recovers hell draw the foul on Federico itll be his first and it will be the third on Pittsburgh so free throws for the cards when we come back but Pitts got a twopoint lead and were underway with these type of usage percentages Wes not that I recall look at that he has more assists than everybody else on the team combined he has twice as many field goals attempts as anybody else on the team he has twice as many threepoint attempts as anybody else on the team he has nearly twice as many free throw attempts as anybody else on the team thats like 31 percent of the team threepoint attempts and 27 percent of the team field goal attempts that is amazing well heres Mike James whos going to the line and L Ellis has been terrific free throw by James a 73 freethrow shooter is good now lets also say this too hes had to earn the confidence or those guys have had to earn his confidence James being a principal guy absolutely Wes with the L Ellis you know he gets the point where hes got to trust his teammates and hes done that pretty well he hadnt attempted a shot and he has an assist here Earl tied at seven not court pressure offered by the cards here is Savannah Federico stays on the floor by the way after committing the foul with Elliott Cummings Henson Applause Louisvilles done a nice job keeping Pitt out of the lane yeah and theyre in a zone now Music eight to shoot sabandi launching from the right and scores well Nike some Bandy was three of six from three on Saturday in Atlanta and he hits his first offer there West hes made more than 200 threes in his career this is a guy who came in two years ago and suffered a torn ACL took him a while to recover and now hes playing the way the guys from pit thought he would be able to pull up three ball from Ellis in the answer at the other end when Jeff capels upset he thought that was an illegal screen by Roosevelt wheeler yep wheeler jocking with Cummings nonetheless ball game tied at 10 well keep an eye on that in the next offensive possession for the cards because thats one of the things we noticed in Louisvilles preparation today was emphasis on those bigs setting the good screen to allow for clean looks perhaps by Kenny Paynes offense here is sabandi right corner Elliott had five in a row a moment ago hell leave it for hits on a three shot clock violation it will go to the pan or go to the cards on terrific defense by Louisville Wesson a screen has to be stationary and this is what Jeff Capel is upset about number four wheeler you know he and hes banging around there with Cummings and if youre going to give Ellis that much time room and Cummins wasnt trying to right but if youre going to give Ellis that much time in the room hes going to hurt you Lance and here is El Ellis and again theres the wheeler screen and now the foul on Wheeler yep gotta hold your position right well you have to Hold Your Position Wes and I think a really good way for a defensive player to attack that screen is if you run into the guy hip to hip its going to look like an illegal screen every time costs Louisville their fourth turnover but again theyve only had one transition turnover Henson turning and over Hinson or rather over a Wheeler couldnt score the basket Panthers have struggled shooting the ball three of their first nine Ellis with that high dribble skip across Withers thought about it beat Henson to the point now they move it for lands his three off the right Withers terrific fouling Jalen Withers now Music a little confidence could go a long way for Withers Dan who really flourished at the end of last year for the cards absolutely Wes and when you get that kind of ball movement you force the defense to scramble not only do you create open shots but you create offensive rebounding opportunity and heres a steal by Withers to the basket and the follow by wheeler Applause seven nothing run by the Ville ninth field goal of the year for Roosevelt wheeler and Wes the Panthers are a team that create an awful lot of offense by getting the ball into the lane and they simply havent been able to do that very well tonight heres Cummings a little short Runner wheeler the rebound Ellis heres Withers boy he thought about it lands will shoot it Federico kept it alive for Cummings Panthers have to try to get some easy baskets almost turned it over so Mandy runs it down now right back in Withers Cummings cut through feeds Federico up strong cant score it right in between lands or James and Withers it looked like for the sophomore Federico that was a pass he had to pick off his shoe tops West and thats really hard for a big guy particularly one that doesnt have the bulk inside to force his way up Ellis wiring through traffic heres Lance little Runner and some Bandy in Pittsburgh try and see Theres an opportunity here Henson pulls his way into the lane and draws the foul thatll be the second on Blake Henson its the fourth on Pittsburgh itll take us to a timeout a seven nothing Run for the cards and a fourpoint lead for you can do right and for Jalen Withers we equate some of that more you can do to scoring and while hes been good at that man its details too that are paying off but this is he makes a nice pass and gets himself back in bounds and comes right at the basket a second chance point for Louisville and now here he is he gets the steal now hes not going to score but look in the middle Wheelers running down the middle and he gets the basket Pitt gave up 24 offensive rebounds in their loss to Duke Louisville already has three offensive rebounds tonight theyve scored six points as a result of those offensive rebounds and Jalen Withers has been very inconsistent and it appears that hes on his way to having one of his good games tonight Whaler off the floor and Sydney Curry has come back for Coach pay we get our first look off so at JJ trainer who had a couple of points and a start against Carolina on Saturday but boy against Clemson Wake Forest the two prior games had averaged eight points coming off the bench so thats where hell start the ball game from tonight and that time James forced it up against Guillermo Diaz Graham last touched by the Panthers you can see one of the things Louisville wants to do and that is they want to post up the pit guards and Diaz Graham came over and did a really nice job helping out west but he could not control the ball so here is another Second Chance opportunity for Louisville six to shoot for the cards Ellis against Burton pretty good match up here Ellis a little pull up missed everything its a shot clock violation not that youd want to clear the other guys off the floor but L Ellis and jamars Burton thats pretty good now if youre Louisville thats the matchup you want to have with the shot clock running down but good defense by Bert yep now Louisville back into mantoman Santos hes a guy that could provide a spark off Caples bench and so can some Bandy well here are threes in the first half for Nike sabandi the way sabandi has been playing over the last four or five games West particularly the way hes shooting the three you have to find him pit snapped the drought Music heres Curry tried to dump it to James too hot to handle and a turnover on the uh cards that will be their sixth of this first half sobandi does such a good job West moving without the basketball finding open spots and Wes you can see right there when he catches the ball hes ready to shoot him you dont have to shoot it every time but when you catch it you better be ready to let it go Nikes hit a couple of Threes And he wanted to make sure Louisville moves after the second one so Louisvilles back in the zone and this is a deep three might have yep get ready three double figures in his last four games and Nike sabandi from Indianapolis Im sure he needed a ticket or two tonight Ellis working against sabandi all the way through and therell be a foul called on the Panthers and it is on the Miami of Ohio transfer Nike symante who has raced to the scoring lead for Pitt with three triples here now sabandi a little over aggressive that time when LLS gets down in the lane like that he has help he doesnt have to be bodying him quite so much right so a new 20 for the Ville after Pitt took the lead on the Savannah Detroit LLS has something to say to Dougs sons and trainer squeezes up and scores first field goal for the junior for Bardstown halfway home and half number one here at the Yum Center and Louisvilles back in the mantoman Elliott now sabandi out front and James tries to defend him Diaz Graham from in front Guillermos third three of the Year Dan went out the pit coaching staff will tell you that both he and his brother can shoot the three very effectively theyre just sort of getting some confidence playing at this level of college basketball seven foot freshman from the Canary Islands pushes the lead to three again Ellis tries to tie and the rebound Elliott had it Diaz Graham kept it alive heres Burton sabandi want another one yes sir hes got a dozen in the first half four threes for Nike sabandi and all of them are clean Dan my goodness theres by a half dozen rod 22 Nike sabandi sabandi brother Dan four for four from three hes got a dozen rest of the teams got 10 on three of 11 and Wes uh another you know you see Diaz Graham there he has a three as well the Panthers shoot the three very well but they are not that heavily threepoint dependent and against the Bandy hes the guy who scored a lot at Miami of Ohio and he is you know hes finally healthy after a long comeback with that ACL rehab they only have one twopoint goal of their seventh field goals wow Music Ellis rubs from the curry screen trainer offensive foul JJ Trainor its his first its the fourth of the bill Wesson were talking about Nike sibandis game on the offensive end but you can see hes the guy they have matched up against L Ellis so the pit coaching staff a lot of confidence in sabandis defensive ability they also trust him that he wont pick up a foul because hes got one the knee no he doesnt have a five little Blake Hensons got two hes on the bench heres a kick out Santos can also stroke it and does Nate Santos is 43 of the Year sophomore from Geneva Illinois has pushed this lead to nine its a nine nothing run in all of its behind the line Ellis thats Santos first three at ACC play was out of the corner Withers tries to answer hit the side of the glass heres Burton and a foul in the back door against the cards its going to be on Jalen Withers and its his second the tough part about that for Kenny Paynes team thats their leading scorer with 8 16 to play and quite frankly I got five minutes ago in terms of game time was playing as well as anybody on the floor well Wes thats part of the problem when youre struggling and youre on the bad end of a run everybodys trying to make a play and that was not a good shot when you take a bad shot thats the same as a turnover it allows your opponent to get out and go Devin Reed checks into the ball game he is a freshman from Jackson Mississippi played briefly in Saturdays loss to Carolina sabandi lines another one up he has Graham pulls away an offensive rebound for Pitt a little give and go with Santos and the Panthers turn it over heres Ellis all the way to the basket Santos blocked it Diaz Graham pulls it away quick Outlet to Burke ahead for Santos back for jamaris Burton short jumper good first points of the game for the grad student from Charlotte thats really a nice fast break a good Outlet pass by Diaz Graham its 11nothing Dan in the run its 172 in total and almost turned over and was turned over last Touch by Curry and now all of a sudden Nike seband hes got friends welcome Nate Santos to the proceedings tonight weve been talking about Pitts threepoint offense West but their defense has been solid during this or watch this play by Burton he goes to the low post he stops Curry from getting an easy basket and that results in a turnover as DS Graham gets down there and knocks the ball away but Burton makes an outstanding play to go cut off that opportunity for curry on the inside well and now if the Panthers can manage to find the defensive Rhythm to equate what theyre doing offensively here in the floor especially as weve noted most of it behind the threepoint line Pits on 11nothing run the last two and a half minutes and what Jeff Cables got to feel pretty good about the start after his team cow settled in here in the first six months once the Panthers dont have any points inside yet and thats where they make their living there is Ellis Music out front Kamari Lance so Bandy trying to keep Ellis in front tough challenge there heres Lance with the shot clock winding down and cummings goes to the floor to get the rebound then rolls it out to Diaz Graham thats called an outlet roll not an outlet pass Diaz Graham thought about it and turned it over trying to drive from the wing cards in transition lands had it blocked by savandy and it will stay with Louisville is doing about everything here so far he does a really good job going straight up in the air and when he brings his arm down he brings it down behind the body of lands so theres no chance that hes going to hit lands with that arm Im telling how many people hopped on 65 for the ride down to Louisville out of the corner Ellis launches backroom Miss and Burton cleans it up and here the Panthers trying to get an advantage in transition some Andy working on Reed Burton Applause oh Diaz Graham has got five Dan Wesson Ben Pitt does not post up their big guys but their big guys get involved with offensive rebounds and plays like that coming off the screen and roll the way theyve been shooting the threes you got to get out on the guards and that leaves Diaz Graham alone 13 in a row for Pitt 192 is the Run and all of a sudden the Panthers have a 13point lead as Reed tries to answer cannot Curry the rebound right back for the cards Sydney Currys second field goal a welcome basket for Kenny Paynes team but what a flurry and here is Diaz Graham he put it up as he draws the foul and Guillermo will go to the line the foul is on re the 68 freshman from Jackson Mississippi its his first its the sixth on the cards and Guillermo Diaz Graham oh well not get free throws here itll be a spot throw in on the Baseline for Nelly coming after a really good start early the cards have had a tough time getting back on defense Burton slipped I think he was the intended receiver of the inbounds play and so Cummings had to offer and now collect and heres Santos a long three that missed everything that might have been a heat check for Nate Santos and then turned over in the backcourt here is Elliott to the basket slashing through its all going pittsway here Dan with five and a half to go who was he trying to throw that ball to was that Withers he just wasnt looking right really a work play by Burke Applause exactly what he is yeah Curry skips out for James and thats an offensive foul on Mike James first on the redshirt freshman from Orlando that is seven now on the bill with 5 12 Play Chris Curry is underneath the basket and hes running up the court you dont throw the ball in bounds to Curry for heavens sakes so that was Withers who made the pass but youre looking for one of your guards youre not looking for your post guy to an inbounds pass promise you Sydneys not looking for it right well and he proved that saying Paynes gonna check in the ball game thats not Currys fault no no thats when youre a big guy the ball goes in the basket your job is to get up the court yeah Withers checks out and Zan Payne comes on he is the grad transfer from Kentucky and the son of the Louisville head coach and Louisville back into the Zone yeah and it was good to him early Dan yes it was really forced Pitt to think about what they were doing and then the Panthers warmed up from the perimeter and now all of a sudden theyve missed a couple from behind the line but have a 13point lead but theyve gotten the 13point lead West making threes but you dont want to forget the character of your team and thats getting the ball in the lane James cut off on the Baseline here is Payne looking for space inside and cant score it Santos the rebound thats a good tough Rebound in traffic Burton spinning away from Ellis in the corner Cummings a three too strong and they battle for it Diaz Graham to the floor saves it for Cummings hell launch with nobody home inside Nellis the rebound heres Ellis feeding the drive and trainer follows his own Miss second bucket for trainer boy Pitts letting it Fly arent they Wes my goodness LL Ellis almost have a oneman fast break a moment ago well Louisville was making a living on the offensive boards thats whats keeping him in the game yep thats a cautionary tale to pit after last Wednesday nights loss in Durham into Dan yes it is Burt along two two strong Diaz Graham tried to keep it alive James collects feels like a big three and a half going home yeah its a really important three and a half minutes West because Louisville you get the sense that theyre crawling back in trainer missing on the three Curry gonna get ticketed here Sydney Curry is going to draw his second he and Withers with a pair each 18 foul scored on the season 341213 in those points off turnovers and in the ACC its a little worse in terms of points per game and Kenny Paynes guys 10 of their 20 points have been Second Chance points so theyve done a nice job on the offensive boards theyve been able to attack Pitts weakness but it doesnt work if youre going to throw the ball to the guys in the gold shirts so Kenny Payne knowing full well I thought that was a misprint yeah on the school I dont know Bobbys blankenships running the show tonight thats true absolutely that makes it uh more likely to be a misprint or not no no Im saying that Bobby confirmed the data okay all right then presented it to us Dave did it well we had a lot of we had a staff Dan our SEC network staff we have a staff put that together for us yeah were getting a little uh game management going on here during the break uh uh a foreign substance of sort has reached the basketball so Dougs sermons hes asking for that ball to be swapped and that ball is not just being swapped that is being scrubbed yeah a little shammy action on the ball and you may say sitting at home well dont they have another basketball but Dan you know in the rule book the ball in play is the ball in play right and the coaches would go crazy if they switched out the ball well if you and I both know that but and it is in the rule book that the ball in play is the ball in play unless that ball somehow is no longer able to be used for a variety of reasons Guillermo Diaz Graham now 10 of 18 is the line missed the front of the one who won you know a guy can shoot threes with the stroke that he has you figured he could make free throws but hes 59 coming in I missed the front end there Ellis caught in the air Payne heres trainer now for Ellis wheeler calling for the ball five to shoot heres Ellis back for James hell drive Baseline Diaz Graham challenged kept it alive recovered wheeler theyll go to the deck and Diaz Graham tried to call the timeout aint got it home laying on his stomach Guillermo Diaz Graham has done some little things in this first half to help pick Graham with his team up 11 fighting underneath Dan and go all the way to the floor and can I get a timeout loose when the West thats what guys do an awful lot but Ill tell you something I think Id rather have that time out for later in the game particularly when your team has the possession error and so had that been a held ball Pitt would have gotten it anyway they didnt have to take that time out Chef capels team up 11 inside three to go Louisville back to the zone and again the Panthers have not been able to score on the inside yep the points in the paint totals 124 in favor of Louisville Federico and again Wes thats not a postup move he just puts himself inside in an open Spot and The Zone forgets about him because hes not really a big threat in there Music Applause side Ellis to James and Applause and I think he was out of bounds yep Mike James out of bounds oh its great illegal screen sorry 10 turnovers the foul is on Wheeler his second he becomes the third card with two well I have to say wheeler has been very aggressive setting those screens 19 fouls and no flyer no free throws on player control Elliott trying to get in the game on threes and theyll be a foul on Federico thats his second six on Pitt man with 204 to go west and Elliott is a guy who comes in from Marquette with the reputation as a threepoint shooter but an ACC play he has struggled he comes into the game only nine for 35 26 percent from Beyond The Arc Dan hes only got one double figure game in his last five and thats an 11 Point effort against Clemson ten days ago at the Peterson Events Center 13point lead for the Panthers a part of that has been that sabandis been playing so well three from shames is good thats a big basket five for Mike James the redshirt freshman from Orlando 19th three of the Year quest with the way this first half is gone I think if Louisville can get to the locker room under 10 they should be happy here is Burton flashing little twopointer Will Roll in for jamaris Burton thats what he does as well as anybody in the conference he can get it in there he can score against size hes got nice touch and he makes the lead a dozen 3523 in the final 65 seconds trainer launches knocks it down seventh for trainer he caught a vibe in backtoback games against Clemson and Wake Forest hes had a nice first half for Kenny Payne hes got seven the lead is nine now Diaz Graham back for Elliott heres Burton skipping for sebandi Guillermo another three backroom Miss Santos trying to keep it alive and Louisvilles going to have a chance for potentially the last shot of the half so heres Ellis with some Bandy there and a region on Nike sabandi will be his second seventh on the car on the Panthers with 18 seconds to go here in the first half Wes Bandy did a really nice job poking at the ball and he forced Ellis to pick it up now Ellis is in trouble hes standing at half court and he doesnt have his dribble and then sabandi bailed him out by pushing him free throw by Ellis hes good Applause L Ellis now with his fourth point 77 percent freethrow shooter Applause Wes really nice job by Louisville to stay in this game they looked you know they took a heck of a shot from pitt on that 172 run but they have hung in there theyve got this thing under double figures eightpoint lead for the Panthers and Ellis going to try and make it seven and does hes got five Music Elliott will put it in play and here is Burton a little backcourt pressure offered by the car just trying to make him run some time off the clock back in the mantoman here is Burton on the drive right corner Elliott hell slash and hang at the horn and knock down a two Elliots got nine and Pittsburghs going to take a nine point lead to the locker room 3728 for Jeff capels team Music stay tuned coming up off to our ACC Network Studios Dan Jordan Cornett standing by and ACC hoops man Eric McLean tackling through if you will of uh the offense for Jeff capels team and Louisvilles going to get the ball to start second half Lanz will play with L Ellis of course Mike James Sydney Curry Jalen Withers out there for Kenny Payne and very quickly Withers against Henson who was quiet in the first half I thought for the Panthers hell roll into the lane feed Curry Up strong against Federico and then Withers punched it away from Frederico one of Hensons problems in the first half as he picked up too early sure did so he didnt have a chance to be effective and Withers had a real good start to the game then he picked up two fouls here is Cummings in the Panthers Nelly Cummings pretty quiet in the first half too and thats an offensive foul it appears to me Wes that Nellie Cummings is a little bit bothered by the Panthers by the uh Louisville size at the guard position now they list him at six feet tall and I think that must be with him standing on a chair but so so hes a very effective player and hes very strong but he just doesnt hes not very tall and in some respect it just shows you how the progressive scouting reports go right because Duke was physical with the perimeter last Wednesday night Dan from a defensive perspective in Durham yes absolutely why you have to be physical with this pit team because theyre a bunch of big strong guys and if youre not knowing if youve got your head handed to you Allison traffic tried to get it to Lance he could hang on to it and Louisville will turn it over seeing again thats not a transition turnover West but that ruins an opportunity for you here you have an opportunity to score and you dont take advantage of it yeah so they avoid the live ball tournament nonetheless here are the Panthers nice pass and Frederico Frederico right there at the rim for his second field goal that was too easy well I dont think anything I dont know that they want Curry to jump out on Burton like that hes not quite the threat from three and even if they do theyve got to have somebody back in the lane to help out that was just a defensive breakdown Lee jumps to 11 on the first points of the second half Withers seven to shoot heres James now to Curry four to shoot Curry turns into a double team blocked by Federico and theres a shot clock violation on Louisville it was tough Dan it looked like it went from bad to worst though on the entry pass well you see nobodys down in the lane I think maybe they wanted lands to be down in there because hes the one furthest from the ball but that you know if youre going to leave Federico or Diaz Graham thatll that wide open then the Panthers are going to throw them the ball Federico slipped again off that screen theyll whip it to the right side back out front heres Henson teeing up a three that spins out some Bandy whos coming to the Ball Game to replace Cummings a moment ago challenge for the rebound but Ellis has it for the cards on the drive and fouled by Federico Applause so the sophomore from Finland born in Egypt draws his third itll be the second on the Panthers and free throws upcoming for the cards here with Albert Ellis III a couple of free throws for L Ellis and the first one is good dont forget tomorrow night womens basketball takes over the ACC Network this week some good ones Miami and NC State going to start our coverage tomorrow night at six Jim Hildreth and Debbie Antonelli will be at Reynolds Coliseum and then Cara Lawson and Courtney Barnhart and Carmichael Arena for number 13 Duke number 17 Carolina thats eight oclock on acc Network and always for you on the ESPN app Haley Cavender of Miami Dan that is right 41 from three for Katie Myers team seven for Ellis answer by Henson over the edge of the back door thats technically out of play so it will belong to the cards you know Wes Henson has shot the ball pretty well this year but he hadnt shot the ball well at all tonight and Im not sure that thats exactly the shot that Pitt was looking for in that situation you know if it goes in you say oh okay but that Im that early in the shot clock that long a shot I dont know feels like the Panthers might be putting a crack in the door can move a step through a little bit here Dan well Louisvilles just got to hang in there and keep this game competitive and then see if they can get a little spurred at the end James misses the long three here is sabandi whos red hot in the first half and an offensive foul called on savandy as that time Withers steps in to draw the charge from Tim Fogertys whistle third on savandy well heres the Bandy hes trying to take it to the basket and Withers you establish initial guarding position both feet on the floor facing the dribbler then you are allowed to move youre allowed to move backwards youre allowed to move laterally or as the rule book says obliquely uh you cant just cant move toward the guy and when youre moving laterally or backward and that guy hits you in the chest with his with his elbow his shoulder then thats going to be a charge Oh What A Catch a dunk by trainer I think he took this off the hands of Diaz Grail West youre right Diaz Graham was trying to tip it away but trainer just goes up over the top and gets it Diaz Graham thought he had it that is you cant throw a better law pass than that wow wow what a play the foul on Guillermo will be his first its four on Pitt and the threepoint trip for JJ Trainor well Wesson just like that its a sixpoint game and now Nellie Cummings is back off of Jeff Caples benching into the ball game the Panthers shot selection here in the second half has been sort of problematic is it to Burton so heres the double team hell skip it for Elliott three from the corner good and jamarius Burton threw up the three fingers before Elliott ever cut it loose a dozen for Elliott on his second three oh Wes thats the risk you take you drop down inside cover up Diaz Graham and theres an offensive foul at the Louisville end of the floor and the fouls on Mike James both of these teams need to get in the lane but youve got to be careful when you get in there you need to jump stop you dont want to be running over people but Elliott was open for that last threepointer because that time Louisville guarded the screen enrolled and that ball got kicked by Withers off the inbounds of Elliott now he wanted to go to Bert and theres the Quick inbounds Pass and now Cummings out of the double team Elliott into traffic Diaz Graham underneath bounces Applause Music when Elliott wanted Henson to cut into the lane and Hinson didnt nope Jeff Capel knows now Applause the thing every coach talks to us about Louisville Dan hey look theyre good theyre getting better theyre not reflective of their overall record here is James of three Applause and an outlet and this is Cummings for Bert who will score just the third field goal only six tonight for jamaris Burton great defensive pressure by Burton on that three and then he just took off down to the other end Ellis on the drive with a score with a right hand second field goal for L Ellis hes got nine and its a ninepoint game and theres a foul that will get us to a timeout itll be on the cards JJ trainer his second but Pittsburghs got something going here Elliott out of the corner a moment ago and the panther lead is nine Music botter West Durham at the Yum Center in Louisville the host cards trailing Pittsburgh and Nike samandi 4435 here early in the second half sobandi and uh Greg Elliott have been part of the barrage they have 24 combined with nine of 11 now among that nine Dan is uh five threes four for sabandi Im sorry six threes four for some Amanda and two for Elliott well part of the problem for the Panthers is sabandis now on the bench because hes got three personal fouls here is Henson whos had a tough night scoring forced it up he has Graham couldnt finish the first time second time it got blocked wheeler got him on the arm and a foul on Wheeler will be his third and its the third on the cards West Diaz Graham has done some really good trades in the game tonight he does a nice job nobody blocks him out but he cuts hard to the basket West and when he gets a little stronger thats going to be a dump but hes got six rebounds hes got five points hes got a block shot six points yep the older of the twins now twin brother Jorge is on the bench Guillermo I like the way theyre named Guillermo is born first thats a g Jorge born second is a J from Tenerife in the Canary Islands and the second one Falls away so its a 10 point Pittsburgh lead now the Panthers have been in mantoman the entire game here is Ellis on the drive and Diaz Graham commits the foul and L Ellis another marker on the board six in the half 11 in the ball game for the senior from Durham you know it doesnt matter how tall the defender is once LL Ellis gets in there and he makes up his mind he can he uses his body very effectively gets right up against the shot blocker and then just gets the flip up there that is a really good shot he creates that with his quickness and then he scores it with his strength Ellis is uh nearly 18 a game almost five assists steal and a half and now hes got seven in the half and a dozen in the ball game to go with five assists tonight the lead is seven its been as narrow as six here in the second half for Pittsburgh now the key for Louisville is the cards are hanging around five minutes in on the second half heres Cummings Baseline all the way through Henson from the corner its not his night Dan from the floor I think Wesleys now over seven in fact he hadnt scored a field goal tonight hes made two free throws thats right heres Ellis and he turned it over to Burton hes got Cummings with him and that ball got deflected by Louisville thats a nice piece of officiating by Doug sermons well hes right on top of the West sure was that was an impossible bounce pass though Im not sure that even if the ball doesnt hit the Louisville player on the foot the Cummins can catch that one ball hit trainers foot here is Henson he lost it again through traffic heres Burton inside against trainer thats only the fourth field goal for jamarius Burt but Burton has has been impressive tonight West because he hadnt tried to force anything hes drawn an awful lot of defensive attention but hes sort of just sort of letting the game come to him Alice with 15 to shoot runs off a Wheeler screen works his way into traffic on Diaz Graham and A Little Fall Away falls off that fall away over seven footer is not an easy shot man hes got all the shots doesnt he I mean just understanding where the shot comes from how to get the ball to a competitive spot Burton misses the three well Wes we showed you that graphic earlier he dominates this offense theres James he lost it on the dribble and ultimately turns it over well and again Wes Louisville is theyre not turning over so Pitt is going down and scoring easily but they have opportunities here to cut into this lead and they just they just turn it over 15 turnovers now for Kenny Paynes team a little backcourt pressure offered Pittsburghs got to push it into the four Court Nate Santos has come back on the floor were number five for the Panthers now theres only 15 seconds left on the shot clock so the Panthers do not have a lot of time to operate theres Cummings trying to pick up off the double team into the corner Burton hell take it on the drive five you shoot rolls into traffic with a right hand easy bucket for Burton whos now in double figures you know I think if its me I play off Burton and let him shoot that three because if you try to get too close to him hes going right by you and he doesnt try to go all the way to the basket he uses his strength to get that midrange shot and hes almost impossible to stop seven minutes gone here in this second half Withers trying to fight through quickly they move with the trainer now to Ellis hell streak into traffic feed wheeler put it on the ground and then the dunk followed by trainer another offensive rebound for Louisville and again thats created by good ball movement you get that defense to move around you get them chasing drivers and you get some offensive rebounding opportunities career high tonight for trainer hes got a dozen Elliott now heres Burton with Withers defending and hell just back it out use the Diaz scream free Elliott for three got it wow you know Greg Elliott had only been double figure scoring one time in the last five games and that was 11 against Clemson hes got 15 tonight at the by the way first of two meetings in the regular season with the Knolls and the Panthers and then Dan Bonner and I will be at Smith Center in Chapel Hill for this thing called State Carolina Wes that is just a wonderful rivalry those games are so much fun yep and presented by Subway were looking forward to being in Chapel Hill for a very interesting game if you go to the NCAA net because you know whos in search of a quad one win North Carolina well theyve got what I read they only have one this year thats it yeah Music lets see Jeff Capel and his staff working through this time out and Beyond here trying to set up a what looks like a little counter pressure to what Louisvilles tried to do to pit here Dan theyre trying to keep the ball away from Ellis make him run some time off the clock in the back court still more than 12 minutes to go and a 12point lead for Pittsburgh whos won three times already on the road in the ACC this year inside is James well hes stuck yep trainer gets it right back to Withers six to shoot and thats a long three and it spins out and it got knocked loose last Touch by Pitt and that will get us to a timeout theyre going to reset the clock to 20 Jeff capels team up 12 Pittsburghs got a nine and Joe Lunardis daily projections practology as it is well Wes were still two months away from the selection but this is this is an entertaining piece everybody wants to know where does my team stand and Joe helps us out here every day every day I think hes got Pittsburgh in as a nine seed now Virginia Tech in his considered category theyre in a very tight game right at the moment against Virginia Wake Forest in the next four out and that is after the home win against Clemson how about a uh Virginia Wake Forest game as a part of your ACC basketball Saturday this weekend too heres Ellis with Withers now Withers around Santos gets all the way to the basket and will draw the foul and I believe its on Burton and it is itll be his second I point out the Wake Virginia game we touched on Carolina and state on acc Network Miami is it Duke damn well theres some great I mean this weekend is like Im telling you now thank you a couple of shots here for Withers no Wes were starting to get into the time of the year where all these project projections start to have a little bit more meaning because were getting closer right thats the first Miss at the line in the second half for Louisville and Jeff capels team has done some good things four and two on the road theyve got three Road wins in the ACC eler by Withers gives him a half dozen tonight now well heres the backcourt pressure again into Burton and hell get it to come Federico Federico back on the floor Santos is out there instead of Henson else wise starters for Pitt Burton Cummings Elliott here is Santos nice move and score by Nate Santos Wes when you drop your guys into the lane to defend that screen and roll you leave that guy on the wing open and Santos did a really nice job creating some space and getting the basket and you talked about creating space and getting a basket nine and a half 14 in the ball game for L Ellis still an 11 Point pit lead under 11 to go and at six feet three Ellis doesnt post up too many guys but he posted up Cummins that time sure did and now were gonna whistle and I believe Roosevelt wheeler yes itll be his fourth and with 10 43 to go its the fourth foul of the half of the Cardinals Here Comes Sydney Curry back to replace the sophomore from Richmond Virginia who pauses to visit with his head coach here well wheeler has been playing hard West but hes sort of been a bull in the china shop kind of guy tonight hes got four fouls Burton and threw it beyond the reach of Santos well thats where he wanted to go it was a very good job by Burton to see what the defense was doing he just didnt make a good pass yeah and I think Santos was lining that up for a shot took his eyes off the ball a little bit foreign ER heres Ellis rounding around the screen and what a tough shot fun to watch we are now in the part of the game where it looks to me like LLS has decided hes got to take over Music Pittsburgh lead is nine eleven points in the half 16 in the game for L Ellis Cummings a long two off the rim rebounded by Withers and Cummins hasnt made a field goal tonight either in fact Cummins hadnt scored a point here is Ellis again dumps for curry Federico was there Curry had it fall off the front iron Burton Applause trying to square up James Cummings a three ball got it apparently all you had to do was talk about it well Cummings is one of those guys Wes who he may not make all the shots he may not even make a very high percentage of the shots but he has this uncanny way of making big shots 103 of the night for Pitt all right lead is back to 12 on the triple from Nelly Cummings Curry against Federico Bulls inside cant score it over the sophomore its really good defense by Federico just get his hands up Cummings picks up on the dribble Burton for Elliott fakes the three will settle for the two and weve seen Elliott do that a couple of times tonight West he doesnt have to be so totally reliant on the two he didnt really get a clean catch of that ball and so he gave the fake and stepped inside the threepoint line for the midrange thats a nice play 14point lead for Pitt on the basket by Elliott who now has 17 in the ball game jamarius Burton has got eight assists its a season high for him tonight well as you said Wes Burton isnt doing a lot of scoring tonight but he has sort of orchestrated everything the Panthers are doing out there we saw that one replay earlier where he made the great defensive play he said he said we said before the game hes the table setter for these guys we get weight caught up in projections here I said at the top I think hes having an allacc year Dan I mean if you were cobbling together Five Guys to call him halfway of the conference season here next week or so is all ACC this guys got to be there well hes got to be there I agree with you but you can see here hes he still scored 10 points tonight you know we weve still got eight and a half and almost nine minutes left in this game hes working on a double double but tonight early it felt like he realized once they start going from behind the line in the first half his job was to get the ball to Savannah get the ball to Elliott and those guys carried him to what was a nine point halftime lead and now his back up to 14 after being as close as six in this second half boy Cummins and Elliot are really John at one another and Ellis hit the deck thats a travel weve seen a handful of guys go down tonight Kenny Payne believes that Federico had something to do with that slip and hes having a visit with Tim clockerty and here is Burton into the four Court and Louisville drops back into the zone this is a real danger zone for Louisville here sabandia triple background bounds away and trainer going to let that go out of bounds I think if youre pit you take that shot a wide open three yeah as well as hes been shooting the ball nice cooled off but Louisvilles got to get something going here theyve turned it over a couple times recently theyve missed some shots at the basket and its hard to come back if you dont score 15 to shoot Withers going to work Louisville needs somebody other than Ellis Jalen Withers couldnt score inside Henson on the outlet heres Cummings hell skip it into the corner so Mandy races to the rim and that got blocked by Ellis I think he was passing the ball West I think if he shoots it then he gets it up on the rim at least heck of a play by Elle Ellis at the defensive end stole it out of the air and here are the cards sure did thank you Ellis over the top of Burton and they scramble inside Hinson goes to the deck to control and a hell ball will award it to the Panthers we get a break in the action Pittsburgh by 14 looking for their third has the respect on the national scene that they deserve look Im gonna offer you that I thought Jeff Cables comments post game last Wednesday night in Durham about where this league is from a competition standpoint were incredibly appropriate and spot on tan about where this leak might take itself as we go down through the month of February and into early March gonna be really interesting heres Cummings a three out of the timeout and Federico the rebound and tried to get it back to Cummings and Nelly couldnt hang on over the inline all right West can I ask you a question sure why is your seven foot guy right down under the basket passing the ball to the six foot guy but coach I dont know okay I thought there must be a rational reasons no theres no rational for that and you know you knew the answer before you asked the question heres Withers a fall away and a foul gonna be on Cummings so Nelly Cummings will draw his second its the seventh on Pitt it was 707 to play and thatll bring Jalen Withers a couple of free throws for the Junior from Charlotte Doug sermons was waiting on something to award Withers the basketball for the first of these two well Tim clock and he and Jeff Capo were having a discussion there we go dont forget Thursday nights 10 oclock Eastern following our womens basketball doubleheader Kelsey Riggs Kelly grahamlink the Hall of Famer Muffler McGraw nothing but that on the ladies side full highlights analysis of every womens game look ahead to some of the best games on the schedule comes your way on acc Network in the ESPN app that follows a terrific womens double header tomorrow night West Louisville still has a chance to make a late push here the this game isnt Out Of Reach Henson finally gets one to go from the perimeter Dan well you have to say that he was not discouraged by his earlier misses largest lead of the night now for capels team what did he miss his first eight yep I think thats right Applause only three there heres trainer hanging shot is good boy thats a tough play right there 14 for trainer West the amazing thing about that is he went straight up in the air if hes moves forward he picks up a charging call but he goes straight up in the air and somehow gets it over the outstretched hands of Federico that is a really nice play Federico inside and a foul will be called against the Cardinals and its going to be on Kamari lands freshman from Indianapolis his first its the fifth that is a good job by Federico to hang on to that ball long enough to get the foul call you normally dont see the Panthers throw it into Federico in that much traffic Federico Federico is now 13 of 24 at the line this year well they have a really nice rotation going in there with Federico and we saw Guillermo Diaz Graham but uh Jorge Diaz Graham is part of that rotation too second one is good six minutes to play in a 14 point lead if its mantoman has been really good for the most part tonight the drive Ellis inside Curry and blocked and affected by Federico West Currys got to do a better job getting position under the basket so when he catches the ball you can just take it right up he catches the ball close but then he has to take one dribble and that allows the defense to collapse five and a half to play Burton and the Panthers heres Elliot hesitates on the three nice pass Federico the layup four in a row for Federico Federico and hes I mean hes just going to the basket and hes ready to catch the ball hes ready to rebound it offensively nice pass by Ellie 6549 three Ball Trainer spins out Elliott the rebound Panthers are in no hurry now Wes nope inside five to go you dont want to take your foot off the gas but you dont need to scramble down the court on every rebound and Louisville has lost 11 straight ACC games Applause theyve lost seven straight total and the better part of a month in fact its been 32 days 31 days since their last win December 17th and thats a foul thats created West really by Burton Federico gets the foul for setting an illegal screen but Burton has to use the screen better than that four fouls on Federico player control on the eighth against Pitt theres a three from out on the left by Devin Reed 6A freshman just his fifth attempt from behind the line this year if youre pit I think you want to keep attacking us you dont want to be doing crazy things but you dont want to be slowing the game down enough that you sort of lose your momentum Bert now lost it and rolled it on the ground it might have gotten away with a double dribble in some books Henson misses badly from three here is Ellis now trying to benefit from the wheeler screen James slides Baseline and cannot score it how about that heres some Bandy bringing it up the floor Elliott left open three spins out we had a good look right behind his shooting arm and I thought that was him yep sort of down 16point game inside of four to go Ellis into traffic 15 to shoot l Ellis from in front knocks down all three a long three with Federico Federico right in his face 19 now for Ellis in the ball game hes had eight games of Music hes had 20 or more in three of the last four here is Elliott out of the corner he cant answer its a 13point game ahead of three minutes to play and Dan back to your thought a moment ago here well Louisville still has a chance here goes three more and trainer tried to compete with it last Touch by the cards thatll get us to a timeout Pittsburgh by 13 three minutes to play in the middle actually was on my mind yeah no well dont worry Dan itll be open again in May the portal Williams thats very exciting the lead the lead for Pitt is 14 never sleeps Dan does it no nothing anymore here is Burke so now you got to get after him you have to create turnovers Henson three how about that by the way thatll be another three for Blake Henson they awarded you may have gone away and said wait a second they gave him a point yes the hits in three the first shot he hit was scored originally at two they credit him with the three and now he knocks down another one to make it a 17 point pit lead with two and a half to go and knocked out of bounds and it will stay uh 13th win sixth in conference play a little line here well Wes the reason this is important is when youre up for an NCAA at large bid theyre going to look at your strength of schedule the quality of the teams you beat where you beat them that kind of thing and thats what the quad system is about the Panthers have three wins in Quad One games theyre two and four in Quad two but the important thing is they have not lost a quad 3 or quad 4 game yet and thats one of the reasons why this is such an important game for them a loss today would be a quad four loss and that could really come back to bite them at NCAA tournament selection time yep heres Henson setting up another one that spins out ahead of two minutes to go and again Wes I think the Panthers and Clemson are sort of in the same kind of position that a lot of people dont believe in them right and the numbers the numbers are such theres an offensive foul you remember Providence last year Providence was a team that all they did was win games and everybody said well yeah theyre winning games but their numbers arent any good and Providence was able to get a bid to the NCAA tournament they won a couple of games in the tournament yeah a lot of people felt maybe a little bit like Notre Dame might have been on that Rim as well they won a couple games Notre Dame wins 15 games last year in the ACC and they they get in and put the first four yeah thats what I mean as youve said before a lot of this gets written in November and December when people arent locked in you know from the outside world of college basketball right well West most of it gets written in November and December because and thats when teams are trying to build up you have you have to go in and not only you but every team in your league if youre one of the power leagues you have to win every game youre supposed to win and then you have to win a representative number representative number of the games that are considered tossup games against equal teams boy Elliotts had a big night three threes in the half four in the ball game hes got 20 now and you look at the teams around the country with the good net rankings and thats what they did and your net isnt nearly as important as your opponents net by the way jamarius Burtons got his first DoubleDouble of the Year tonight 10 points 10 assists Dan theres Percy Miller on the follow Ing and Diaz Graham in the backcourt Pittsburgh by 18 theres jorgeous yeah thank goodness we have jerseys Jorge 31 Guillermo 25 if youre with us here in the last 40 seconds Elliott another one sure 23 now for Elliot and another assist for Burton yeah 11 assists tonight for Burton and thats two off the career high of Greg Elliott he had 25 as a Marquette Golden Eagle and that ball tipped away with 21 seconds left Jeff Capel is going to say boys thatll be it Applause and into the front Court comes Burton and Hershey Miller is going to let jamarius Burton and Pittsburgh dribble this out Dan Panthers are going to win for the seventh time in the last nine games to go to 136 and 62 in the ACC another road win Wes and this again as we said this was a win they had to have and a very a very aggressive performance a lot of threepoint shooting guys stepping up particularly Elliott and sabandi big ball game coming up on Saturday at home for the Panthers Florida State visits for the first of two Louisvilles off until next Wednesday when they travel to Boston College great to be with Dan
