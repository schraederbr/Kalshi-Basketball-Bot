starting lineup first time this year that has been the case he practiced yesterday just fine went through shoot around today just fine so we dont know if he is available or how much he might play but we do anticipate seeing him here tonight so for the first time this season Syracuse has a different starting five and they have two different starters who are out nahem McLoud it was announced earlier tonight is sidelined with a foot injury so a whole lot of new faces out there to start things for Syracuse yeah thats huge news though Judah men obviously uh his 19 points per game not in the starting lineup and so JJ Starling brings it up fader Copeland for the basketball he gets the start and also Malik Brown the two of them have been devastating coming off the bench now in a starters rooll first three points by Chris Bell the sophomore from conquered California and Doug thats huge uh him getting his confidence going early thats a breakdown for Boston College hes the one guy you cant give him that much ear SCE thats a great start for Chris Bell and Syracuse so now without McLoud does post post up down low hes now 0 for two from the floor the defensive assignment on that possession went to Malik Brown and here is Brown at the other end Hopeland keeps the pivot foot back out to Taylor well the two guys who have been struggling shooting the basketball lately have knocked down their first threes here tonight meanwhile for BC Jaden Zachary is the man that makes them go from the point Harris weve already talked about QP number 12 in Gray Quinton post is a tremendous player the stats hes putting up again this year Malcolm are as good or better than anybody in the ACC they are but I think right now Boston College issues handling uh the ball against Syracuse uh Syracuse is very active in the passing lanes and then when theyre on the ball theyre just trying to poke the ball away I think the key is is how they defend Quinton post I think they need if youre Boston College let him get a couple touches in the paint play through him see if Syracuse doubles and then go from there there is that combo Copeland with the no look pass and the throw down by Brown well if youre red ay you cannot ask for a better start 80 and its been the quality of looks and their defense right now theyre just getting high percentage shots Pell Harris Jr no fight for the rebound comes to Applause Taylor Taylor walks into another three a little strong that time Boston College with Jaden Zachary the Junior from Salem Wisconsin at the point and the offense always runs through number 12 post is kind of that modern big for BC off the deflection Harris finds Zachary everything perimeter jumpers for Boston College early El no well again Judah mints not starting tonight we dont know why and we dont know if he will play tonight but in uniform and so that certainly changes the rotations around for red ay first two points scored for BC Devin mlon has been playing so well lately and thats where Boston College needs to attack well we talked about it N thecloud Out Jud Dem men out right now to start this game off if youre Boston College dont settle for jumpers on the other end Syracuse keep doing what youre doing and getting good ball movement Bell into the lane five on the shot clock Starling puts it Applause out Zachary is denied by Brown they kept it in bounds and here comes the orange the other way another block This Time by BC thats two defensive plays on both ends first of the block and then Boston College returns to favor post lost it Taylor another three fast paac and thats something speaking with the uh Boston College uh coaching staff they need to do a good job in transition defense mainly dont turn the ball over but try to keep Syracuse out of the transition game on the other end they got to try to attack the Applause paint five on the shot clock Alig Bay has it knocked away and thatll take us to our first media timeout well its been all Syracuse early on Doug Copeland with the beautiful find uncontested dunk Syracuse rolling Music early Syracuse leads the ACC this year in both blocks per game and steals per game and we have seen that disruption in the early going here tonight Doug its been impressive to start this game off Boston College having issues just dribbling the ball right here you see the block theyre very active with their hands and the passing Lanes theyre just trying to get deflections and youre right theyre being very disruptive to the flow of Boston Colleges offense and quader Copeland is as disruptive as anybody coming off the bench the first 14 games of the year starting tonight and I asked coach ay after practice yesterday do you guys track deflections and I think he I was thinking about deflection rate deflection percentage because in Fairly limited minutes off the bench he is especially has been disruptive and I thought coach autrey gave an interesting answer he said no unlike coach patino and some of the others we dont track deflections hes afraid that it would turn into a competition between his players to lead the team in deflections and they would not be as good defensively in terms of being sound in their role hey with look theyre first in the ACC in those categories so I wouldnt change the thing either in terms of tracking it but just watching this game uh its showing up and the pressure that theyre putting on Boston College early on Taylor up against the timer doesnt get the roll Starling was Up Above the Rim and thought better of trying to tip it in Harris great move right to the bucket for his first two and thats a beautiful screen off by Quinton post right there again he saw that Claude L Harris had an angle and he just basically set a little rub screen made it look like he was posting heads up play by Quinton post the clear the lane for Claude El Harris and Harris is always locked and loaded coming off a 26point performance Saturday at Georgia attack Bell travel dragg the pivot foot BC gets the ball back down by four and theres the first year head coach of the orange the former point guard here at Syracuse some three decades ago class of 94 51y old native of Harlem and uh you know at 10 and four they havent suffered any quote bad losses this year the games they have lost they were supposed to have lost where do you think Syracuse is right now in the first year of Coach Entre well its so interesting speaking with longtime Sid Pete Moore and I asked him the differences obviously between the Hall of Famer and Coach arrey he said look uh coach ARs had a plan and it shows up in their preparation uh weve seen them in practice and shoot arounds and I think that plan uh really uh is a big reason why theyve had this start and not had hiccups and any of those bad losses so again phenomenal job by Red ay uh but also a big credit to his staff as well too again those guys do a great job getting these guys prepared and game ready double zero Chaz Kelly thei third is into the game for the first time for BC theres another deflection it goes out of bounds BC will keep with seven to shoot and again theres the deflection theyre very active Boston College right now what theyre going to have to do when youre playing against a team this aggressive in the B passing Lanes ball fake and get some back door cuts to try to loosen up this defense draws a double team mlon who has been on fire misses from long range Here Comes Taylor Syracuse has missed its last six from the floor scoreless for going on four and A2 minutes Copeland perhaps got away with an extra step kept the balance and got the ball to go and something that may not show up on uh the stat sheet the blockout by Malik Brown on the previous Boston College possession uh he kept hes given up a lot of size to Quinton post but hes doing a good job putting a body on him making sure he doesnt get offensive rebound Here Comes Starling driving on Kelly who pokes it away VC back the other way little midrange pull up off the window no good for Donald Han Jr works his way down the lane takes on the big man misses on the fade away physical game and early on well this is kind of the pace and Tempo we anticipated between Boston College and Syracuse tonight Taylor from the corner he made his first he has not made one since and right now if Im Boston College Im slowing it down and try to get Quinton post established a down low on the block again playing fast plays into the favor of Syracuse and try to get him a touch right there but its got to be a better pass swing that ball to the wing and let him post up off the brown steel the hammer at the other end by Bell Doug I think he is The X Factor for Syracuse him hitting his first shot in this game I think is huge uh you see hes playing with a energy Brown the block Here Comes Bell Again Taylor joins him Kelly with another steal quick hands for dble zero left alone in the corner good looking stroke for Donald Han Jr the red shirt freshman from Virginia Beach and that is a beautiful transition offense off of great transition defense and thats fine when youre running opportunistic you have the imbalance you have the advantage thats a nice dribble drive and kick to the corner for a wide open three somethings got to give tonight Syracuse unbeaten at home this year 70 Boston College actually is 3 and0 in True Road Games first time theyve done that since way back in 0405 and now Boston College clamping down defensively and forcing Syracuse into some tough contested jumpers BCs only three of 14 from the floor post has it poked away again its brown and again its Bell a little windmill well if youre not familiar with bows a game his hops are on display right here they have been active in the passing Lane and you are going to see a windmill Syracuse continues to Music roll NBA Music Wednesday Syracuse 14 Boston College 7 here at the JMA Wireless Dome and this was the anticipated backourt matchup coming in claudell Harris averaging 15 a half a game for BC and Judah minz over 19 per game the third leading scorer in the ACC but for unknown reasons he was not the starting lineup tonight whatever message has been sent from coach ay he now comes into the game after sitting the first 921 well see what Judah has in store for us tonight yeah obviously though right now the story of this game the defense of Syracuse early on Doug they have six points off of turnovers and theyve been very disruptive with their activity uh in the passing lanes and getting deflections Mason Madson has coming into the game number 45 five in Gray for BC Zachary around and out and without nahem McLoud munir hea is playing for just the fourth time this year number 55 in white Kyle cup has also come in which was something coach aey alluded to yesterday after practice Malcolm that we likely will see more of Kyle cuff not just because of the injury to McLoud just that he has earned more playing time best way to get on the court show coaches in practice and they get the game and do your job certainly though with the its a much uh needed thing for Syracuse in terms of depth Benny Williams also into the game for the first time for Syracuse Zachary has it taken away by cup here comes the Kansas transfer with numbers fouled and he will head to the free throw line to shoot a pair well Doug the first thing when we talk with the DC coaching staff was keeping Syracuse out of transition they said how you do that take care of the ball thats been problematic right here again in transition off of a turnover in Boston College early on in this game six turnovers which has led uh to six points off of turnovers early and thats a number that were going to track throughout this game there is Kyle Duff Im guessing hes heard the stories about the old Big East days his father played at St Johns and this kind of has a old Big East flare feel tonight between Boston College and Syracuse kycu Jr makes one out of Music two Armani Mighty with the basketball in for post who has now gone back to the scores table he is still scoreless more than halfway through this first half off the bounce hand good close out by hea fight for the loose ball it went out of bounds and will stay with Boston College well Earl Grant Jr in his third Years head coach at BC a former point guard at division 2 Georgia College back in the late 90s and hes got this program trending in the right direction I think the identity is a tough defense and then obviously you have a star in Quinton post PC out of bounds Syracuse will have it but youre right he definitely has done an outstanding job assembling this team and and getting a program going in the right direction and this is a huge game Doug we talked about it uh theyre coming off a win where they won at Georgia Tech both these teams uh looking to improve their resume yeah coming from behind is nothing new for Boston College this year they had their third largest comeback in BC program history the last time out down 16 early in the second half to beat Georgia Tech and four of their 10 wins have come after being down by double digits mins foul and hell head to the free throw line for the first time he lives at the foul line for Syracuse and its tough to crowd him because he is a person that does a great job drawing fouls and Doug thats one thing you have to do try to keep him off the free throw line hes one of the best in college basketball in terms of drawing contact and getting to the free throw line averaging 19 points nearly four assists two and a half steals per game chance for his first point Off the Bench tonight well heres Saturdays basketball triple header number 21 Clemson host Boston College at little John to start us off at three Eastern then 11th rank Duke host Georgia Tech at Cameron indor and finally Miami and Virginia Tech Square Off in blackburg should be a great afternoon and evening of Hoops on the ACC Applause Music Network Al League Bay he is now two for 21 on the year from threepoint land Benny Williams spins into the lane and gets hacked and he will head to the line the foul against leue Bay and thats a tough uh position right there for a league Bay again Quinton post trying to establish position in the post there and Le Bay elects to shoot a jump shot and youre right you look at the percentages probably maybe try to enter that one into the post again I think thats the issue right now early on for Boston College settling for contested jumpers or deep threes and not that you were ever left alone because you shot it well enough but I always think its got to be really hard to turn down the open shot when clearly the defense is not respecting you but you have to do other things yeah absolutely and I think in that situation right there again uh he clearly uh had an advantage that time in the post again if its off of a dribble Drive In transition or in half court and youre wide open thats one thing its your first look probably not what you want to do auson college with another extended drought been 3 and 12 minutes since scoring fell behind early eight nothing Harris with an air ball tff had a hand on it and it goes out of bounds to Boston College Earl Grants team on the road looking to stay perfect away from Chestnut Hill this Music season hit what I would consider the most memorable shot in program history to beat your Boston College Eagles I I tell you what it never gets old certainly a heartbreaker uh for Boston College what a great video and that never never gets old right there and pearl one of the alltime greats love watching him operate and so many great memories and so many great battles in this building between these two programs and that probably right there is one of the uh most memorable ones right there that half court shot by the Pearl and the uh the thing that I think is most interesting about it after the fact is when the you watch that the next time pay attention to Pearl he never broke stride he just ran right into the locker room and as this place erupted he just went in called his M as many times as Ive seen that as you take a look at Boston College breaking down the Zone Syracuse went Zone that time I never knew that I never really watched the end I just eyes were always focused on the shot and then the crowd coming in afterwards so Im certainly going to have to take a closer look next time I see that as Pearl running straight to the locker room thats a great story heres Judah Mintz looking for his first field goal coming off the bench for unknown reasons he sat the first 921 of tonights game I imagine we will get some answers after the game from coach Applause autrey a league Bay couldnt save it but it is Boston College Applause basketball well their last bucket Boston College has it I think that call was overturned and now its saying its going to be Syracuse ball uh but Boston is last bucket against the Zone was in the paint I think thats going to be the area they have to continue to focus on right now theg one of 12 from the threepoint line Boston College be percent Oakland and brown back in along with bell who started off the game so HW Chris Bell with seven points to lead all scores seven minutes to go in the first half Benny Williams from the head of the key another deflection for number one in white Boston College right now again you just have to know theyre trying to deflect or trying to get their hands on any pass or anytime you dribble set up some ball fakes try to get some back door Cuts every Thursday well have a womens basketball double header for you right here on acc Network in the ESPN app this week Kiki Jefferson and number 15 Louisville are in Pitts B to take on the Panthers then at 800 Elizabeth kitley in 11th ranked Virginia Tech hosting Miami in blackburg we are in Syracuse New York with Malcolm Huckaby on Doug Sherman Boston College playing from behind another deflection This Time by Mint here come the orange again Benny Williams on the Run had it poked Applause away Harris to the streaking Zachary Benny Williams pinned it against the glass Bell for three and pulls it down for Boston College you can see the orange have cooled off after making their first two threes of the Night Benny Williams another block shot iy know red arrian staff dont track deflections and blocks but Id have to say and this first half theyre probably nearing the 20 number in terms of deflections but they it seems like every time Boston College has tried to reverse the ball dribble make a post entry pass a Syracuse player has gotten their hand on it and again I go back to my playing days anytime youre playing against a aggressive defense like that ball fakes set hard screens and you got to get some back door Cuts cuz theyre just trying to shoot the Gap and get their hands on any pass that Boston College is trying to make right now now come down Benny Williams takes a seat Justin Taylor back in Bell with a clean look when he sets his feet its a pretty good bet that shots going in we got a couple of NBA Scouts in the building tonight and we were talking to them prior to this game and Belles name came up certainly hes a guy thats very athletic and one of the better Shooters certainly hes got it going early on in this game meanwhile the other headline Malcolm of this game is that Quinton post is still scoreless whats going on there is it something BCs not doing or what is Syracuse doing defensively couple of things the deflections and then anytime theyre trying to pass the ball again you take a look another deflection theyre just having issues trying to enter the ball into the postum or just make a simple reversal but theyre doing a good job of being disruptive to the Boston College offense its as simple as that under 10 to shoot minz pulls the trigger Jud Min with his first bucket and the sophomore from Fort Washington Maryland makes it a 14point orange lead well the offense is quicking but red ay has to be pleased with how his team has defended thus far in this first half thats really I think whats spurred their offense their defensive pressure that theyre putting on Boston College really uh had has put them in a situation where theyre getting some high percentage shots in transition or off of turnovers six nothing cuse run to take their largest lead of the night Zachary lost it on the inbound Browns pass a dangerous one comes to Copeland dancing his way to the bucket for two more that is a young man who is an Entertainer coming into his own as a sophomore from Southwest Philadelphia and thats Syracuses thirdd point off of turnover another turnover forced its an offensive foul against Applause Music Applause post Judah minz gives to copelan talking to him yesterday he specifically says hes from Southwest Philadelphia hes not from Philadelphia hes from Southwest and he says his Flash style of play stems from the neighborhood he represents and he grew up going every day to King cesing Park countless hours playing ball it was a 10minute walk for him he and his friends didnt have phones they just knew everybody was going to be there every day so Nair Harris is his best friend they spent endless hours just playing ball thats old school right there I love that that they didnt have the phones thats a great thing and guys just out there playing ball and you can tell early on that flare in particular with his passing really has been impressive in this first half and again the game changes for Syracuse for the better when poeland and brown are in there well look at this right here hes made a couple of passes like this where hes made his guys and put them in Opportunities where all they have to do is go up and try to catch and finish hes played a great game thus far in the first half for Syracuse 12 Boston College turnovers copelan by the way says he wears uniform number 24 to honor his best friend naier Harris he says hes like his little brother who was diagnosed with a rare heart condition ending his playing days back in high school Q wears number 24 because of that was Nairs number naer is able to come up and see his buddy play here in the dome frequently but he just cant play ball anymore thats a great story certainly a great way to the honor of that young man but right now Earl Grant talking with the refs I think the biggest adjustment theyre going to have to make again sound like a broken record but they got to do a better job taking care of the ball is it simple as that that was a key for them coming into this game uh right now you have 12 turnovers which have led to 13 points for Syracuse its got to be better with the ball another steal and another run out for a dozen points for The California Kid Boston colle nothing going right for Boston College as the orange defense just continues to produce points Chris bell with a dozen to lead Music SU Music Applause spe welcome back to Syracuse with Malcolm Huckaby Im Doug Sherman and the orange defense has been the story so far with under four minutes remaining in the first half Su repeatedly with the takeaways the deflections and how about this play right here Malcolm well right here Boston College again they have to do a better job identifying right here freeze it you can tell hes already B looking to shoot the Gap this is a hard cut up to the top of the key and then back door if the other guy on the bottom side helps you have to skip to Matson but you have to do a better job ball faking if youre Boston College thats the only way to loosen up this defense of Syracuse thats being very aggressive in the passing Lanes the last five games for Chris Bell coming in he was averaging under four points per game hes got a dozen to lead all scores BC coming out of the break with a good look but the RedHot Devin mton missed no BC player has made more than one shot so far tonight wer Copeland is fouled by claudell Harris as you can see its an 110 run put that together with the 80 start and the orang is Led right from the start well they dominated this game and it starts with their defense again theyre just active in the passing Lane theyve been disrup Boston College has not been able to run one set and then theyre just getting turnovers and getting out in transition getting high percentage shots Bell has it blocked good energy there but then the foul on the floor after the play by Mason Madson well Earl Grant told us earlier today that the number one key for BC tonight was to shrink the court so a what does that mean and B why hasnt that worked so far tonight so shrinking the court basically first and foremost uh they got to stop turning the ball over so theyre out in transition hard to shrink the court when youre twoonone at a disadvantage cuz youre turning the ball over and then the half court the guards in particular mints uh you want to strengthen Court keep him out of the paint and show bodies in front of him and that has not happened at all in this first half that has got to change for Boston College coming off the bench tonight for the first time this season for unknown reasons fodell Harris buries the three hes got five points hes the one guy Syracuse get and we highlighted him four for four in his last game against Georgia Tech where he had 26 points shooting 45 from the threepoint line you cant give him airace if youre Syracuse Elijah strong grabs the Chris bell Miss try to establish mton big size Advantage left it short Copeland snares the rebound mince what a bounce pass the foul came on what looked like a pass not a shot but how about the look from mintch and thats the area and the feedback of that Judah men got from the NBA Scouts again can he play like a true point guard again you know he can score but hes a guy that can score but his passing ability I think thats the area they wanted to see Music Improvement so Quinton post comes back in for BC he is still scoreless which is really remarkable averaging 18 points per game the only player in the country last year who put up 5040 and 80 as a shooting line 54 shooting from the floor well we are super excited about gymnastics on acc Network Friday and Saturday night 900 eastern time its all part of three quad meets were featuring the first one here Friday with North Carolina Arizona boisey State and Nebraska the teams will be competing in four skills bars beam Vault and Music floor and so with post hes doing it again this year hes averaging better than 50 from the floor 40 from three and better than 80 from the line BC now starting to cook a little bit its claudell Harris with consecutive baskets and thats the area again continue to attack the paint dont settle for jumpers L it comes off dribble drive and the kick and its an open one thats fine Bell Harris doing a great job picking up right where hes left off beautiful midrange game and thats set up because he shoots the ball so well from the perimeter you have to respect his Applause jumper Min thought about it heres JJ Starling back into the game Kyle cff also back off the Syracuse bench got to the basket just couldnt finish and one on second effort the orange with two more Harris uses the screen look out he can put points up in a hurry again he is one of the higher scoring guards s and the ACC midrange pullup game thats a big time rejection of the screen right there and pull up for three by Claude aleris much needed bucket for Boston College Benny Williams off the front rim that Rim by the way caught the attention of Earl Grant when BC walked into the building for the first time this afternoon for shoot around he walked right to it apparently does that every building they come into he looks at both rims to see if they truly are 10 ft and he loved the rim to our right because he said theres a paint chip off the front and he said thats a better visual thats what Im shooting for how about that detail that a coach is thinking about 5 hours before the game thats pretty impressive right there and Ive never heard that one before but right now uh they have uh its been a struggle for them to find points but again this last 3 minute stretch theyve been getting better looks and this is what you want if your Earl Grant try to close the half out on a positive note going in and then try to regroup Williams to Starling Taylor turns down the three cuff puts it Applause up been a quiet night so far for Jaden Zachary averaging over 12 points per game he had a rough trip a year ago into the Dome he sets up Madson I wonder about that now come on what could be the final possession of the half does that carry over from year to year when you have either a good game or a bad game in the building no that probably not again uh so many but a red arery right now happy with how his team has performed defensively 20 seconds left in this first half lets see what he draws up at Bs head we live for delicious Boston College his first half claw Harris has started to eat up 10 points most of them in the last 5 minutes pull up three we talked about his midrange game and right here again this is what makes him a difficult matchup theyre going to need more of that though in this game but claudell Harris again he has been the lone bright spot for Boston College in this first half yeah hes cut what was a 19point deficit back to 13 Syracuse trying to hold for a final shot B into the hands of Judah Min has it knocked away BC with it 3 seconds to go 2 seconds Here Comes Madson lets the defender go by and a huge close to the first half for the Boston College Eagles well if youre Earl Grant although youre going to go in this half uh in the second half and certainly for Boston College Im sure the discussion was around taking better care of the ball to start this second half off another deflection by Brown post continues to be Applause sty quader Copeland on the bench after starting the game with mince in the lineup and again the first time this season Syracuse has not started the same five because nahem McLoud is also out with a foot injury Bell wide open long rebound track down by Prince aligue Bay the sophomore from Minneapolis who dribbles up for BC post trying to carve out space inside he and brown battling as Harris is now cut off into post cant get the roll Taylor tracks down the rebound and had it taken away by Jaden Zachary Zachary to the rim and a leag bay missed it Bell lobs to the rim Brown has to come down with it and lays it in thats a missed opportunity for Boston College again looked like a lead Bay was going to get a wide open alley off the steal from Zachary but a miss a layup leads to a transition of opportunity for Syracuse ml passed out of bounds its another Boston College turnover well apparently the foot injury that is plaguing McLoud right now has been coming for a while there was not a particular injury or moment in time and so hes going to see a foot specialist in the coming days to determine the extent of the injury so they really dont seem to have any idea whether hell be out a short span or for a long time well a couple things obviously the depth thats an issue how long hes out and then obviously hard to replace his size in particular again some of these bigger front courts in the ACC theyre certainly going to need him but this guy right here has been impressive Chris Bell has been very good and I think the key thing is he hit that first shot to start the game off and his energy and also confidence has not waivers from there well we saw him get on a heater against togate for a career high 25 points when Syracuse came back from 24 down the biggest comeback win in program history Devin mlon with his second field goal well if Im a grant Im going back to that same formula whether it becomes from a high L like that last play or swing the ball to the wing get paint touches I think thats the key for Boston College mince right to the rim haded block mton comes up with it for VC Music post hes a very good threepoint shooter nearly 50 on the year mton pulls down the Miss 10 to shoot claudell Harris uses the screen pulls the trigger Al Le B with another offensive rebound mints poked it out of bounds the Eagles will keep it its just been really I have not seen anything like this and Ive seen other teams aggressive in the passing Lanes but it feels like the Syracuse is getting their hands on pretty much every possession a pass a dribble now into his Zone on the Baseline out of bounds the Eagles get an open look for Zachary hes still scoring tell you what Devon mton has been playing real good basketball of late against ACC opponents Malcolm 19 points a game nearly eight rebounds a game and making 72 of his shot and I like how hes attacking the offensive glass creating extra opportunities thats his great hustle work by mlin coming off a careerhigh 30 points last time out in his homecoming game in Atlanta against the yellow jackets Taylor hangs in the air banks it in against one of the best shot blockers in the ACC Taylor able to finish thats great great body control youre right post has it poked away again by Malik Brown Taylor Rises up now thats a missed opportunity on that previous possession for Boston College Quinton PO is has to know of theyre trying to poke the ball away you got to Chin that if youre a big get that ball into your body dont get it away from your body and allow it away B blocks the shot it goes out of bounds BC will keep it and have it when we come back the orange have built the lead back

was 10 years ago when Syracuse was ranked number one in the country then undefeated and the Eagles in overtime took down the orange 6660 to take down U for the first time and uh that illustrates as does their four come from behind wins this year from double digits down you dont count out the Boston College Eagles well in particular anytime these two teams get together but right now this one right now if boxing college is going to win this game on the road Quinton post their star player theyre going to have to get him uh better opportunities uh to catch the ball in the post where he can do some damage but right now zero points and a key number six turnovers in this game for Clinton post Syracuse leads the ACC and steals at nine per game a league Bay gets to the basket the orange already have 14 Steals and post six turnovers so hes got more turnovers than shot attempts tonight JJ Starling has been quiet on the offensive end those are the first two points from the sophomore from nearby Baldwinsville New York M lton on Taylor got him off his feet seen a lot of Devin mlon this year the last couple of years what is his greatest strength Malcolm well I think that right there he got versatility hes shooting the ball well from the threepoint line but then that time they identified a smaller Defender a matchup they wanted they just iced him on the wing put him down low on the Block and then let him go to work but the consistency really I think thats been the biggest thing for Earl Granton staff uh hes been very consistent and he went off in their last outting 30 points as you said on the road against Georgia Tech well you know Devon mlon could have played division one football he was offered as a tight end by UMass by Kent State by Grambling he was first team All State in Georgia and hes also the nephew of Chester mlon former first round pick out of Clemson there is Judah minz getting to the line once again he has a knack for it he seeks it out and he is a good free throw shooter taking advantage of it lead back to 13 and thats something the coaching staff of Boston College talked about how they must keep him off the free throw line Odell Harris off the bounce tried to use the window a lead back hes got a physical presence inside hell head to the free throw line the league Bas 67 225 a sophomore out of mini haa Academy where I know its been talked about before hes a very Tour player Beyond his years but uh he was a high school teammate of Chad hren and Jaylen Suggs a couple of top five picks in the NBA draft I feel bad for those teams that were playing against that uh group right there Percy Miller also on that team the Louisville Reserve guard how about that for a group on a high school team well the one area in this game Doug Boston College has had an advantage on the offensive glass right now they have nine offensive rebounds to one to Syracuse theyve done a nice job on the misses in this second half in particular to start off early getting some Second Chance opportunities a league bang at the end of shoot around this afternoon hes the one who hit the half court shot to end it any carryover ever when somebody hits a half court shot to end the uh the game day practice I think me and you need to start doing that now have a little announcers half court shot see if we get out of here we might be here for a while yeah that could be let me let me scratch that Bell Noah League Bay with another rebound BC down by 11 6 minutes gone in the second half Harris steps into the three boy thats a pretty stroke even with a hand in his face and a quick release and that right there the communication for Syracuse if youre the big or Wing you have to be up there on that little handoff claudell Harris again shooting 45 from the threepoint line and hes got a quick release well he joined the 1000 Point Club against Lehi last month when he scored 29 of course most of that thousand as Taylor gets the easy layup post comes away hobbling and calls to the bench saying hes got to come out thats certainly not something you want to see if youre ear GR in Boston College on that previous play though that play by Judah men simple as it is again last year uh he would have tried to shoot that shot himself gave it up uh for a better look for his teammate again the decision making for judment I think thats the key to his game another Syracuse steel this is Taylor taking on mlon who blocked it B your Copeland into the game comes up for the basketball trying to find Brown on the mismatch and hes fouled by Zachary who was given up 4 five in in that matchup and thats great recognition by Syracuse again they realized they had a matchup that was favorable space the floor out and then just let him try to post up in the paint Jaz Kelly comes in for the first time here in the second half for BC it was a nonsh shooting foul and so the inbound comes from Judah Min Taylor off the curl rising up badly missed it its another rebound for Prince Elite Applause Music Bay Harris couldnt make it two in a row from the same spot long rebound comes to Kelly Harris will try again hes got it 16 points for the junor from hanville Louisiana well the close out of that first half he was the one bright spot again for Boston College and he continues his hot shooting Brown is fouled and will head to the line personal against Armani Mighty who was in for the injured Quinton post and there is post on the uh end in the second row of the Boston College bench as red ay who in Syracuse history does Malik Brown remind him of and he said CJ fair and the way he goes about his business kind of unassuming but just affects winning in a positive way and I think a key thing in this game hes had a couple of blocks where he could have easily tried to punch it out of bounds similar to a guy that used to play rest of Soul Conrad McCrae uh but hes kept the ball in play and I like that where hes kept possession and started some fast breaks again his defense in this game in particular on post has been Applause huge Mighty travel no Malik Brown just seemed to wait for the turnover to come defending holding his ground and its another forced turnover by Malik Brown of the orange Syracuse 47 Boston College 38 orange sophomore Malik Brown continues to be a force defensively his defense has been huge in this game Quinton post still has yet to score in this game 0 point six turnovers and that last play right there Doug pretty much sums up his defensive pres presence uh in this game for Syracuse nine points three blocks and three steals he has been active for Syracuse Brown is 68 of 222 lb sophomore from Paul Pepper Virginia he has really been a revelation here is a second year at Su J Min attacks didnt get the call he goes to the floor and here comes BC with an advantage five on four Madson takes advantage and has a big smile for the Boston College bench and thats what you want to do be opportunistic in your transition game that time uh imbalance judment not in the mix beautiful find that time uh in transition by Ja Chaz Kelly Malcolm this is the closest its been since six nothing quader copelan tough shot how did he get that up and over the defender it looked like Armani Mighty was going to block that into the second row and thats great body control Im not sure he even saw the rim on that one still able to finish high off the Applause glass Applause oh thats another great block out that time by Brown off the long three wraparound pass Brown goes to work again Benny Williams is into the game for Syracuse it goes out of bounds and BC the last to Applause touch now post will come back in you got word from the VC Sid about what happened with the injury yeah they had to ret tape his ankle and certainly going to take a look at that looked like he tweaked it a little bit so they raped his ankle and certainly theyre going to need him to finish this game out Williams mishandled the pass thinking about a dunk K cuff missed the three chz Kelly at the point for bton college Kelly keeps the dribble gets to the basket I like his floor game and thats twice now Quinton post heads up play again he wasnt getting the post but he cleared the path of for Chaz Kelly and again Boston College with n Music Applause six Copeland with post now on the switch now hes going to attack and he missed the layup out of bounds Boston College basketball heres Saturdays basketball triple header number 21 Clemson host these Boston College Eagles at little John to start us off at three Eastern then number 11 Duke will host George Tech Cameron and finally Miami and Virginia Tech in blackburg should be a terrific afternoon and evening of Hoops here on the ACC Network Applause here goes Kelly able to get to the basket again Boston College within four and thats two beautiful drives by Chaz Kelly under control through traffic and just like that Boston College with N4 the Eagles once down big right back in Music it its hard to believe this auson college offense is the same one we saw score only nine points in the first 16 minutes of the game they got it rolling now and I think a lot of it Second Chance opportunities in the second half quell Harris continues to be shooting the ball well but I think Chaz Kelly he has played really well in the second half for Earl Grant right here capped off by another dribble drive and finish through traffic and again back to my point Boston College in the second half nine second chance points alone theyve done a good job on the offensive glass Chaz Kelly ck3 Chaz Kelly II third really was BCs best player on their trip in August to Italy so he has shown it in flashes and we are seeing it in a Flash here in the second half coming out of the timeout Syracuse has mince get fouled by Applause post is third and the fifth against Boston College so a non shooting foul Starling mince Copeland Williams and brown the five out there for BC Madson Kelly post Al League Bay and Donald Han Jr the five out there for Boston College here in crunch time the key thing ball screen coverage for Boston College in particular with Judah men again we talked about his ability to get to the free throw line you have to keep him off the line but also trying to keep him out of the paint I think thats going to be key uh to close this game out for Boston College four of BCs 10 wins this year have been games where they have trailed by double figur they were down by 19 in the first half this is the closest theyve been since 4 nothing and Quinton post is just picked up his fourth personal foul well if you would have told Earl Grant that youre only going to be down four on the road and your best player Quinton post has zero points in this game uh probably wouldnt believe it but thats whats going on right now not his best night credit of Syracuses defense in particular brown but Boston College again still doing a great job hanging around in this game and so the sophomore from Toronto mighty comes in second opportunity for Syracuse another offensive rebound mince had it knocked away and Syracuse was the last to touch its Boston College ball 5050 ball right here again Boston College three people around mens now again couldnt tell from that angle right there but thats a big break for Boston College Madson what a great set for BC the Eagles are within one Matson and also clell Harris if youre not there on the catch forget about it they both have quick releases and just like that its a onepoint game Hopeland Williams double team has it knocked away Boston College ball the Eagles get it with a chance to take their first lead of the night well the the quick release right here Matson off the pin down too late Boston College within Music one PGA live on espg right now Boston College trailing by one but so much goes into The Scouting Report right here JJ Starling he needs to know the Scouting Report Mason Matson shooting 45 you need to be locked in locking and trailing that time you lose track of him and he comes off at pend Down clean and makes you pay onepoint game and again that cannot happen Matson and also claudell Harris both those guys shoot 45 from the threepoint line Alik Bay guarded by Music Williams for the lead the Eagles have it for the first time this evening and thats facing set up by Matson again you cant double off him on that side and thats great recognition just isolating a league Bay that time on the Block beautiful spin move back to his left hand cuff tries to convert to the left hand cant do it Kelly a league bang and its a tie up on the held ball itll be ser use possession thats pretty good transition defense that time the league bit trying to push the pace again sh goes out excuse me Bell back in remember he had the hot hand for Syracuse for 12 in the first half only three so far here in the Applause Music Applause second the BC defense is not allowed a point in 4 and 12 minutes five to shoot Bell puts it up and in and the Boston College bench was yelling to Prince of League Bay hand up hand up we can help him hear him for over here thats a breakdown again both teams need to understand The Scouting Report cannot have their hand down against Bell Syracuse Applause basketball mton in Mighty will take a seat Benny Williams out Taylor back on for the orange right now quadell haris Jaden zachory and also Clinton post on the bench for Boston College pooping Applause Brown Malik Brown now into double figures the orange lead is back to four Applause Madson with a terrific find inside from mcglockton hes got double figures for BC and thats all set up Matson hits a three now they chase him he brings two Defenders with a nice little slip pass Copeland was fouled on his way to the basket foul 17 foul against Boston College Syracuse has been called for just one foul here in the second Music half Vader Copeland at 73 on the year cant get the roll on the Music first tomorrow night at T Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens team and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week thats coverage you can only find in one place right here on acc Network and the ESPN app well dou now the question becomes how long does Earl Grant go with Harris Zachary and also post on the bench and having trouble keeping the ball able to get to the basket mton hell have a chance for three de mcglockton the red shirt sophomore from coming Georgia coming off his careerhigh 30point performance playing big here down the stretch tonight hes got a double double uh 10 points 11 boards and none bigger than that one right there another offensive rebound and putback he has been relentless on the glass uh tonight for Boston College for the Applause tie under 5 minutes left in regulation its been a decade since Boston College came into the Dome and beat the orange that was an overtime Malik Brown off the pretty feed from quader Copeland last four games coming in Malik has been averaging 17 point7 rebounds a big performance again here tonight he has been huge uh nothing bigger than though his defense in this game tonight for Syracuse Madson got a good look just couldnt bury it Jud to Mint and the whistle comes a foul against Kelly BCs only been to the line for three attempts so far tonight meanwhile Jud de Min going back to the line and again keep in mind he did not play the first m 9 minutes and 21 seconds of this game for unknown reasons but he has played starters minutes since also Benny Williams has just returned from the Syracuse locker room and will rejoin his teammates on the bench the 78 foul shooter rattles one home it is indeed clutch time hard to be better than 100 from Malik Brown round Judah Mintz at 69 in the final 5 minutes try to make it two out of two here tonight he does and the lead is back to four mton with a great fee nice catch and finish by a league Bang threading the needle that pass zero room uh a margin for era it was a perfect pass catch and finish thats beautiful offensive set by Boston College the Eagles have made Seven of their last nine shot attempts Copeland dumps it off theres that combo again sophomore to sophomore give Malik Brown 15 points and brown thats just too easy if youre Boston College credit Syracuse but if youre Boston in college try to force Syracuse to shoot outside the arc dont give Brown uh uncontested dunks hand in the paint cleaning it up once again is Devin mton I would say the same for Syracuse again you got to put a body on mlon again he is just uh crashing to offensive glass every time cannot get him that much space Oakland to Brown again weve got a whistle and a foul underneath that will send Brown to the free throw line when we come back well Malik Brown continues to get dunk but this right here pinpoint passing by Boston College and then on the other end beautiful F by Copeland another dunk we got ourselves at ball Music game when you you get your next big idea this game for Syracuse look at his statline 15 points six boards three blocks and three steals but for me Doug its been his defense in particular on Quinton post one of the better bigs not just in the ACC but in college basketball uh he has dominated both ends Quinton post has yet to score in this game and Malik ground has dominated the paint area for Syracuse its been an impressive performance on both defense and you got a sense there why he is a 72 career shooter from the floor highly efficient doesnt seem to stray from what his strengths are and I think thats a key thing right there know who you are and his strength really has been his defense and activity as you take a look Boston College now gets back in uh there a big three claudell Harris Quinton post and also Jaden Zachary but Applause well after his career high 26 last time out against Duke thats 17 points for brown the lead back to four poting Zachary back on the floor for the Eagles back door pass Harris tries to come down with it couldnt do it the dish from post was a little too tall and it was its all set up though by great defense again not getting beat on the back door they broke that play up another turnover for Boston College 21 hard to win a game when you turn it over like that but BCs right Music Applause Music Applause there Brown gives it back to mince five to shoot on the switch hes got post defending mince gots it up and he is fouled so a perfect position possession if youre Syracuse you use 296 seconds on the shot clock and this is all set up Judah me so Shifty and really no need again his hands on his arm right there qu post youre a sevenfooter just use your length and we talked with coaching staff of Boston College one of the things they were concerned about Jud de mens ability to draw fouls you just cant bail them out in the situation like that shot clock winding down four into a difficult Runner overlength and so the fifth leading score in the ACC Quinton post has fouled out having been held scoreless on only four shot attempts just remarkable well the only good news for Earl Grant is that youre still within Striking Distance of this game when your star player has really not Applause performed 65 59 blocked in the dribble handoff and a foul as Copeland tried to break it up just the third team foul against Syracuse in the second half and Doug right now Syracuse the communication needs to be on point with the bigs and wings Boston College they run a lot of actions for their guards coming off dribble handoffs or pin Downs uh you must either hedge hard or have communic where guys are not coming off for clean looks League Bays had a big second half not that time Taylor good defense and the Applause rebound now Copeland dribbling again a minute 38 left in regulation his mom Pamela Parsons is number one fan watching home in Southwest Philly here goes Q behind his back lost it it went right to Brown had it blocked shot clock at one b as he beat the buzzer looks like theyre going to take a look at this a Doug from First Look I think he may have gotten that one off but looks like the refs are going to take a look right here again Boston College almost comes up with the steel lets see if its still in his hands again cant see the buzzer from that angle right there now well take a look with the clock embedded yeah he definitely got that off in time and and thats a big break for Syracuse looked like Boston College was going to come up with the Stop and instead and now ser use pushes the lead to eight minute 19 to go and certainly do not need a three right now if your Boston College comes off dribble drive and kick thats fine but minute 19 still some time but you got to get into your offense quick six straight points for Syracuse over the last minute 45 Kelly turns the corner hangs in the air swatted Away by Brown out to mlon In and Out and Brown clears another rebound you got to think about trapping right now if youre Boston College you dont want to just let a Syracuse run clock see if you can try to get the ball out of this guys hands now M penetrates goes to the left hand mton pulls it down for BC the Eagles have led just for a moment tonight Harris snow long rebound secured by Syracuse well perhaps falling behind by 19 was just too much for the eagles they came all the way back to lead it briefly 5049 with seven to go but it looks like the orange are going to hang on with a good counter punch down the stretch Doug the story of this game for Syracuse 26 points off turnovers and thats pretty much of the ball game Syracuse set the tone with their defense uh in this game and really tough to overcome that on the road if youre Boston College red ay has to be pleased with how his team performed in particular though Malik Brown his job what hes done on Quinton post or one of the best bigs in college basketball holding him scoreless in this game theres your exclamation point Brown the steel and the slam hes got 19 points and we talked at the top what a big game this was for both of the teams both 10 and four both one and two in League Play and its the orange that prevails 6959 your final9 well impressive uh win by Syracuse
