Row in the series The jackets looking for their first win here in Charlottesville since an overtime win back in 2018 the opening tip controlled by Virginia in the white Georgia Tech in the old goal Virginia coming off the win at pit on Monday they shot 56 of the team its a season high for shooting in an ACC game and Tom you Virginia very much is a rhythm offense team and thats one of the things Georgia Tech talked about is trying to take them out of it thats roie for three to start the scoring for the Cavaliers yeah picking right up where they left off at Pittsburgh and done nice screen that time you can get him a good look and uh thats where a lot of their offense is going to come from George with an awkward shot that bounces out of bounds and its Virginia basketball talking about that win Monday Mike the Cavaliers made 10 threepointers on their way to the 7357 win a 170 run in the first half and they led by 15 at halftime on the road to piit MC nes got another one ripping the ropes for Virginia same spot on the floor swinging around to his right hand side Georgia Tech just late getting out tried to actually challenge that shot from behind 69 made threes on the season for Isaac mcney that is the best on the team nobody makes more nobody takes more Powell trying to come out of the corner TR to musle his way through picked off by the Cavaliers as they run it up to roie thats a mismatch inside its a shot po probably should have taken with ro on him 11 and 12 on the season for Virginia 4 and eight in conference play McNeely get fre and hits another one Dam Damon sty is just just shaking his head right now nine nothing two minutes to go in the game McNeely launched at Mike and then turned around and headed back the other way inside they get the jam Georgia Tech High percentage Suare Applause and thats where Tech may have a little bit of an advantage inside with Dongo and Suare but uh you know they well you got to figure Virginias not going to keep up this pace but you know theyre not going to be able to match three for two ases in the corner shock loock is inside of 10 he spins gives it to duanan trying to attack the rim and he lost it on the way up to sware this is Nate George averages close close to 12 points per game had 28 points at Clemson in the triple overtime Victory Up and Under And it spins off the rim for Dongo good take on the Baseline side Dongo had a double double Mike in that win at Clemson 18 points 13 boards sixth double double of the Season things have really calmed down for Virginia since that guy Ro has taken over the primary ball handling Applause Andrew roie the Junior from Milwaukee Wisconsin that ball fumbled away in the paint Georgia Tech on the Run Two on Two Dango trying to get all the way to the rim and he does so successfully how about showing his versatility there getting uh getting the turnover and then taking it all the way you know Daman cyar talked about his emergence in the last six games and you look out up 13 steals for him in that stretch outstanding for a guy whos 69 showing off the handles driving up the court creating contact so Kofi leaves for Virginia Anthony Robinson enters the lineup for the Cavaliers with nango at the free throw line 60 on the season that right there Mike was his 100th free throw ATT attempt of the year to complete the old school threepoint play now Virginia made those first three threepointers Georgia Techs come back with Five Points yeah just you know you could survive that first punch in the mouth good sign there ases tried to drop it off to Buchanan thats a tough catch for the big man yeah hes just kind of threw it never really bounced up above his shins Im always going to be an apologist for the big guy in that situation if if he deserves it it was a tough catch a little bit low on the Run Ron Sanchez first year is the interim head coach is Tony Bennett stepping down a few weeks prior to the start of the Season Sanchez has head coaching experience at Charlotte for Five Seasons damid star in his second year on the Georgia Tech bench fire away from the corner and miss from Applause Sutton mcney thought about it quick close Terry defending Ro drops it low Robinson had it rejected and sent back down to the court by Dango he runs the floor Gets behind the defense cant spin it in never got his feet Underneath Him the try to get it up on the Applause rim muray misses back iron number 10 Kane Murray into the lineup for Virginia its going to be a battle of pace too in this game Georgia Tech really wants to push it youve seen it here early Virginia more deliberate and thats a thats a guy whos really been a big part of Georgia Tech coming on later in the season Powell has been terrific for this ball Club he can shoot the three Mike 34 from Beyond The Arc at his 26 made three of the year 19 points in that win in triple overtime against Clemson McNeely two bounces on the rim Buchanan struggling with nango it goes out of bounds and it looks like Virginia will maintain possession they made those early threepointers coach sters team responding it is a onepoint game Virginia scored the first nine points on three made threes theyve missed their next two attempts from Beyond The Arc eight straight points by Georgia Tech weathering the early storm you know what was nice about that too I mean Damon slomar kneeling on just wow what a great what great execution on underneath out of bounds Georgia Tech falling a little bit of sleep defensively there Terry roie defending him mismatch inside Dango drew the double Powell hes made a three in this game driving to the rim canans over the top of Powell he somehow got it back in a foul was Applause call yeah you get the mismatch and you know that Virginia is always going to come with a big across on the double team and actually do they do a nice job recovering across but this is Powell can shoot the three youve got to honor that and then he does a nice job getting his own board so Buchanan picks up the foul for Virginia Robinson is back into the game Buchanan remains in the lineup Powell is at the free throw Applause line 66 on the season for Duncan Powell and you know its you know its its funny with this team too Tom we talked about it that you know theyre five and seven in the league they only a 36o difference with their opponents in that stretch a lot of close games last four games for Georgia Tech Mike and six of their 12 ACC games decided by single digits their five and seven in League Play Ames Up and Under shuffles it off the glass we talked about the pace and a little selective that time Ames thinking he had a little bit of a seam to the back basket George who leads the ACC an assist per game 63 got it back hell cycle through again shot clock is down to 10 hes only taken one shot so far Sutton kicked it over to Powell tries the other side and hes got another three hes working both sides of the Court he been over on the left side for a little bit of that first half switch sides got a good look and then Nathan George not doing a bad job either not forcing his offense hes been a distributor here early Powells the reason they went to the first overtime against cson they try the alleo they go up top for Virginia and Robinson drops the hammer and hes seen his role expand over the last few games too uh with Saunders being out a little bit hes seen some more time Anthony Robinson on the business end of the alley he chipped in with nine points and six boards coming off the bench in the win at pit on Monday for Virginia they do get Saunders back in this game which is a nice lift for them hes out on the floor now Mari back to Saunders Elijah Saunders the Miss for the junior up ahead play off on the rim is sort to te get aggressive and that will fall in with a little soft t t for Suare Suare wanted the offensive rebound uh George doesnt get the assist that was a very risky pass though but in transition Tech has taken that chance in this game throwing lobs to big guys they got lucky in that instance there Mike STM was working that sideline saying look for the high percentage passes at the moment and Virginia has come back to earth with their threepoint shooting after that three for three start yeah now three of seven from long distance with the Cavaliers after making their first three threepoint attempts inside of 12 minutes to go in the first half George stepping back and knocking it down just playing nasty from Nate George not great at 30 on the year but I I think that was a sense of I need to get I need to get into the Rhythm a little bit offensively and he got a little room and thats I think you have to do with with George is to make him prove himself from the outside first Robinson lost it on the way up Suare tries to grab it it goes out of bounds near his own bench itll be Virginia basketball so George Tech has come back to take the 175 lead on CW court side Saturday oh were sitting here two minutes gone in the game it was 9 nothing Virginia looking like this was was going to be another Runway nice recovery by the yellow jackets remember the yellow jackets on Tuesday played triple overtime Nate George played 55 minutes in that game aim stepping around the defender day day for two Mike a careerhigh 27 points at pit on Monday he was 11 of 16 from the floor and he made three threepointers for DayDay thats George around the edge tapped around and to ases and thats a shot that hes been finishing too you saw against Clemson he gets to his right hand on the drive and he made some really spectacular finishes MCN got the defender in the air MCN rattles it home and thats thats a jump shot that youll live with with him that midrange if you can drive him off the threepoint line I think youd be happy with that he is the leading scorer this season for Virginia just over 13 points per game that was Ames and Dango getting mixed up on the play a foul coming up heres the look theyre chasing him off the screen nice pump fake and uh you know good finish for him hes hes got beautiful shooting for only had eight points Mike at pit on Monday had a couple of Threes they didnt need him rest of the team chipped in for the big win on the road at pit off the inbounds bo Suare really had a great screen on that underneath out of bounds to get Terry free Lance Terry red shirt senior College Park Georgia a transfer from Garder web spent three years in that program a able to reather shot clock winding down for roie side rim and he had some time there was about 8 seconds to go he settled for a three with uh a little bit of time left on the clock Terry driving to the rim and Buchanan has other Applause ideas heres the look you see the screen right there it was kind of a show but uh his guy got hung up and there was a clean look Dongo gliding down the lane for two and Virginia wants a timeout coach Sanchez demanding more intensity from his team Dongo Mike just slicing his way to the basket and really Mike whenever I see him playing I always think of the game that we did last year in December of last season we saw Georgia Teek in Damon stms first game in the ACC at home against number seven Duke and Georgia Tech pulled out the Victory and Dango was a huge hug part of that and thats the game that he got my attention and uh really as you know in the last six games has been a factor you know four double figure rebounding during during that during this latest stretch and really has shown me in this game so far an ability to put the ball on the floor um its gotten to the rim uh their bigs have really done a nice job of getting some mismatches inside and getting the ball deep Buchanan is now hes headed toward the locker room uh I dont know what happened to him on that last play but uh hes he he has left the bench area hes going to go hes going to go back and hes actually getting on that exercise bike hes going to Pedal around a little bit keep ey on Buchanon in the hallway that leads back to the locker room for Virginia Kofi tight Applause quarters this is uh this is where actually the the uh the emergence of Robinson really helps him because he gives them a size and a shot blocker out there you know Buchanan has been terrific for him this Applause year Howell again and he lines it up and hits Applause it so thats down towards the tunnel going back underneath the stands with beanan trying to stay loose on the stationary bike the Suare gobbles up that rebound yeah this is a a Virginia team thats not going to really hurt you they rely on their shooting theyre not going to get a lot of Second Chance points George Up and Under flips it off the glass bounces out he has struggled so far today uh hes and hes gotten some decent opportunities inside two of six now from the floor McNeely leads the way with 10 points for Virginia they drop it off Kofi not high enough second effort Suare got it he got a piece of it hope he stays with it onepoint game and you know what thats thats pretty good mental toughness right there because that the first one should have been easy um miss it stayed with it a couple times and got the basket inside of eight minutes to go in the first half George on the dribble drawing a lot of defensive attention and it looked like Robinson tried to help out and committed the foul so weve got a onepoint game Georgia Tech has the lead here in Charlottesville 756 to go just not real happy with those numbers Virginia has missed its last six threepoint attempts Mike theyre three of nine but remember they made their first three right at the start of this game George is standing at the free throw line for Georgia Tech Nate George sophomore from Toronto Ontario Canada its a 78 free throw shooter for his seconde head coach David stmy we had a great chat with Coach STM he was looking for an effort to keep up the intensity that they displayed against Clemson where they just kept up the pressure mik even into that third overtime and their conditioning really paid off in that triple overtime game yeah they they looked the more fresh team in that third overtime Ro got bumped on the Applause Baseline and that was that was the thing that that Damon star wanted George to work on I mean he he felt like he really wore down of course a lot was put on his shoulders last year as he became the starting point guard but he really needed him to step up his condition in and hes answered the call he can play 55 minutes in a game isan Sharma is also into the lineup for Virginia number nine with the shot clock down to five for mcney he count it down hell try to drive it switch to the left hand not high enough on the Square and run down by Georgia Tech and Lance Terry really good defensive sequence for Georgia Tech to get this shot clock which is not new for Virginia but they force a drive Dongo forced error as it rolls out of bounds Dongo Mike scored the last six Georgia Tech points in the third overtime and he played 52 minutes and had 18 points in the 13 boards for the double double his fourth in an ACC game well and five the Five Guys played from the 10minute Mark in the second half all the way through to the end of the game Sharma nowhere to go against Nate George defending number one for Georgia Tech you Canon rising and slamming from the stationary bike to a double fisted rib rocker I got to find out what kind of bike that is and get one for the house Ill tell you who will like that is Tony Bennett who will be honored tonight the head coach who stepped down prior to the start of the season for Virginia he does the pelaton thing Mike he watch Buchanan go for the bike to the rim running the court Sharma Kofi ran into Sharma regroup for Virginia well they are really checking out hard on outside the threepoint line and and one inside heres the look and its heres this is just a really nice nice pass by roie and Buchanan being ready to receive in the Finish inside and this is the one thing what if if Virginia can get Dongo in foul trouble that will be a huge lift for them Kofi shoots 81 from the line and completes the threepoint play roie had the pretty assist Mike nine assists that pit for roie a career high on Monday hes defending on George Dango with the slip to the rim spins off second effort and it spins around and goes down theyve been able to get on the offensive glass theyve missed a few and actually McNeely bothered him with a little bit of a late rotation but uh Dongo just quick off his Applause feet VI NE Catch and Release and its money kic Neely and that actually pretty well defended by Terry that time had a hand up just a better shot his third made three and 13 points to lead all scorers for Isaac mcney we know that Georgia Tech will not go very deep on that bench they flip it crosscourt Dongo thought about three Suare saved it just a second left as Terry got the shot away and Lance Terry their leading scorer has not scored in this game yeah Lance Terry for the season Mike 156 points per game thats the best on the Georgia Tech roster Saunders is back in for Virginia number returns late substitution for Georgia Tech and Lance Terry Mike just mentioned has not scored hes out sharmas out Ames is back in look like a hockey game is breaking out here guys hopping over the boards well it may look like Georgia Tech is substituting a lap but its six guys its you know its a sixman rotation right now they certainly proven they can handle it George long distance three ball Nate George who leads the ACC in minutes per game close to 38 per game in ACC contest for n George yanan weak side got tangled up with Suare that foul is going to go against George attack when you shoot when you play 55 minutes its going to tick up that average just a little bit thats true he played 55 Terry played 52 Dongo played 52 as well inside looking for Saunders couldnt connect George directs a little Music traffic try to get by Roy yeah theyre giving now theyre giving po a little respect out in the perimeter he sees hes got a smaller player somebodys open with the double howwell flips it the Sutton Suare had it at his shoes scooped up Saunders MC Neely hesitation and drive just that hesitation made his Defender rise up that was great defense down the other end of the floor they had a mismatch they came over they got Buchanan to switch onto him that was a nice sequence defensively to lead to that break 15 points now for McNeely ases got a piece of Nate George on the way up so there will be a Timeout on the court Virginia has built a threepoint lead late in our first half McNeely has dropped 15 against the jackets Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands we just left a thriller at the Dome were here in Charlottesville Virginia for Georgia Tech and Virginia the 90th alltime meeting we thank you for sticking with us here on CW Courtside Saturday after Syracuse defeats BC 9586 in triple overtime so weve seen two triple overtime games in the ACC mik in the span of 5 years Georgia Tech involved in that game on Tuesday against Clemson that was an awkward fall McNeely hoping it looked a lot worse than it turns out to be mcne helped up thats nango who is still down for Georgia Tech and actually because of the way they fell it probably worked out not too bad for both of them and it looked like in Dongo got well he got the worst he got kind of kicked in the head but was pushed from the back I dont know that Ames might have gotten called for the foul on that with pushing in the back Mike there was a foul on Ames thats his second yeah that was thats how when thats how Dongo went to the floor he got pushed from behind ases went to the bench for Virginia that shot comes up short for Nate George mcney is the leading scorer so far for Virginia and on the season on average as well hes got 15 in the game so far Virginia made its first three threepoint attempts T Murray on the handle hes guarded by suton shot loock is inside of 10 m Neely trying to make his move this is a deep three money mcne yeah I mean theres not much youre going to do defensively against that mcne just kept backing up and uh you know terrific job by Georgia Tech they done a nice job defensively overall in the first half against the three MC nearly from about 20 7 ft away and then just beyond the line for Nate George for three punch counter punch hes actually been more effective from three than he has been in the lane in this game you know they were worried about him getting inside and being disruptive but hes been tough from the Music perimeter shot clock once again inside of 10 the game clock is out of 2 minutes in our first half muray scooping and scoring now see that I mean thats the type of game I think that Damon ster Mar wants to live with is a twopoint game in the paint with you know Virginia scoring that way if theyre going to score Virginia shooting 55 so far as a team in the first half Suare lost it on the way up Buchanan was there so was roie good sportsmanship to help up Suare and Suare kind of jumped into the block that time he had a little bit of room to make the shot went right into Buchanan Ron Sanchez is the in room head coach for Virginia does have head coaching experience at Charlotte certainly a longtime assistant in two different stints for Tony Bennett here at Virginia coach Bennett stepping down prior to the start of the Season he will be honored at halftime some of his former players are in attendance tonight interesting match up with Powell on roie Virginias 11 and 12 on the season 4 and8 in conference play three pointer from Saunders is a Miss Powell now hes knocked down a couple of three so far for Georgia Tech Mike yeah and theyve given him a lot more respect as this half has gone along Dongo tries the other side of the rim and it spills off hes missed some makeable shots inside that was a good quick move but he couldnt finish Dongo with seven points so far for Georgia Tech Nate George Leading The Way with 12 Powells into double digits with 10 thats roie on target for a three ball and know Buchanan slid just enough to give him a good look at it it was pretty subtle borderline moving screen but uh gave him a good look six points for RO 20 seconds to go in the half timeout taken by Georgia Tech and the lead by eight the lead is up to eight for Virginia 184 seconds remaining in our first half thats going to say 41 points uh pretty stout first half offensively for Virginia not bad for the lowest scoring team in the ACC of course they are second best in scoring Defense 3 seconds 2 seconds and a threepointer right before the horn from Nate George George just lined it up back in Clemson in Clemson South Carolina went triple overtime Georgia Tech is no stranger to Long games if you go back Mike to November of 2020 they lost the game to Georgia State a quadruple overtime in the longest game in Georgia Tech History well and this a very cleanly played game only five turnovers combined for the uh two teams so ball handling pretty good and there I said it and right out the uh yeah right out the window as Dongo pass a little too much for Suare a very cleanly played game only six combined turnovers for both teams still pretty good last lead for Georgia Tech was at the 755 Mark of the first half they LED 2523 roie played almost the entire first half hed fit in really well on the Georgia Tech side of things yeah aims the only one for Virginia in any kind of trouble hes got two fouls George up ahead and Dongo runs it down and lays it in thats been a theme throughout the game their bigs have been running the floor really well Suare and Dongo really getting up and down the middle of the Court third assist for George thats on net for Rod and three no hesitation in that shot either for him Andrew roie whos a threepointer seventh made of the game for Virginia as they produce a turnover and that just a lack of concentration by George just a caress Music pass so the lead is six was as large as nine in the first half for Virginia Roy puts the head down against Terry shot clock is at four stepping back ases as hits a three see you know Virginia is very comfortable with the clock under 8 seconds and theyre used to playing that way theyre used to Long possessions that ases was out for a little bit in that first half that gets him in some Rhythm now try to get it inside the Dongo heres the look and this is a really nice catch and finish by him too he just outruns everybody and the look ahead and then this is just this is just catch and shoot this is thats uh and then you know he gets the switch he gets he drives him back a little bit to switch the big on small and he look you know drives him back and gets a good open jump shot George drops it low Dongo all the way AC cross Terry explodes out of that corner in midair Kofi caught him and thats you know maybe he gets in some Rhythm now L Terry goes hes the re hes their leading scorer and doesnt score in the first half lets take a look at that Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Melo yeah no points for him and uh good take there that actually all set up by the crosscourt pass out of the double team it just and I you know Terry is holding his wrist and I think on that follow through on the dunk he might have hurt something yeah he is holding his wrist there and uh he really went at the basket hard and that shot that that did not look good at all so Terry comes up empty from the free throw line McNeely he misses the three Powell had the position Kofi took it away Powell gets it back adjust the headband and flips it over to his teammate Nate Applause George Dango trying to drive on Applause roie so they got it into nango foul was called and they talked about that today on the on the pick and roll for the bigs if you catch over the top to not put down the ball on the floor for a Dongo because theres going to be help coming from the weak side to just either look for your shot to get it up or pass the ball Lance Terry is going to the bench for Georgia Tech favoring that wrist this is George got to switch again double team Powell thats his first Miss from long distance Buchanan run on the floor Dongo got back pinned on the backboard theyre going to score the Applause bucket and there is a Timeout on the court Virginia out in front of Georgia Tech on CW Courtside Saturday the two Elder Statesmen in the league um so you know nobody with a uh nobody with a national championship left in the league couple of ACC tournament titles for Coach Hamilton and the most wins in school history at Florida State 23 years on the sideline for the nolles well and you know with um with with Lance Terry hes out of the ball game now I dont know where the points come from you know he hadnt really he hadnt scored in the game Powell and George are really going to have to step on the gas and Dongo inside too in the paint yeah and hes hes had some trouble finishing inside big Collision there Howell and McNeely got the ball back in the paint Virginia has a 10point Advantage right now Mike 22 to 12 thats what they did against pit as well to lead them to the big win and you know they get this type of lead they get very deliberate and a 10point lead for them is bigger than a 10point lead against most yanan shock clck inside a five front rim Suare Dango Kofi and it finally comes out to Nate George of course eight made threepointers also helped the cause for Virginia Georgia Tech has made seven and theyve got roie on Powell which is an effort to keep a smaller guy and keep threepoint shot down on him and hes forced to take a long one there GES spins away roie lays it in from a Powell was caught a little in between that time and uh Georgia Tech also went for the long rebound came up with it and AES nice look ahead and the 10 Run for the Cavaliers up by 13 largest lead roie hits the deck weve got a whistle at a timeout Virginia on the run on CW Courtside Saturday with the lead against the jackets the second half Virginias two of four so coming on strong there and for the Cavaliers control Nate George control the point uh 15 points first half none here in the second half they need and they need to lock in on him and I tell you what if Lance Terrys uh wrist is an issue they can really lock in on him from the corner Ro misses batted around to Sutton and uh Sutton is the guy who uh you know wouldnt normally be in the rotation but pretty nice play Applause there so theres Lance Terry hes got that braz to the right wrist hes going to come back and give it a go he is moving to the scorer table still only six guys have been in the rotation for Georgia Tech roie around Suare trying to recover defensively M Canon pleas up the best well with that drive he uh he he got everybody concentrating on the ball and Buchanan really had nobody to check him off the offensive glass six points for Blake new Canan sophomore Center thats what he averages on the season per game howwell bounces it low Dongo skillful into that Rim Mike W it was a great move because he spun to the Baseline away from where the help was coming and if you know youre getting help from the top you cannot give up the Baseline three Georgia Tech players into double digits led by Nate George with 15 Kofi grabs it bit of a misim jump for Suare goes out of bounds to Georgia Tech return tomorrow on CW womens HS rank teams Collide number 14 NC State thats the tallah take on number 22 Florida State the top 25 Showdown you dont want to miss tomorrow 2 pm Eastern 1100 am Pacific only on the CW Mike jinsky Ill be there with Kelly d to call the action and uh the ACC women have uh theyve been showing out this year that should be a fantastic game between those two teams NC State is 101 in conference play Mike Florida state is 92 right behind him in the standings and noted aim is undefeated in conference play 11 Applause and0 so roie picked up the foul mcne is going to come out well heres the the bad news is for Virginia is theyre two away from putting Georgia Tech in the bonus the bad news is for Georgia Tech is theyre not a great free throw shooting team so again with uh with their leading score injured and not really playing well um theyve got to if they get into the bonus they must take advantage of it so Georgia Tech for the game m is three of7 from the line they shoot 66 as a team thats at the bottom of the rankings in the ACC yeah and lets keep a well keep an eye on Lance you know for him if he can try to you know as close as he can get to the basket you know if he can get layups or get something inside you know I Ive got to imagine is hes even massaging that wrist right now and hes standing over in the corner right in front of his own bench there Dango puts the shoulder down and he travels Roger SS right on top of the call hes joined by Lee Cel and Mark Schnur probably had a shot but just wanted to just improve his position a little bit too much even with the turnover Dongo 13 points in the game for Georgia Tech Virginias won three of its last five games two Road wins a Pitt Miami and a home Victory against Boston College first Zone weve seen out of Georgia Tech in this game shot clock to five you can in free throw line rims out Dango over the top of the board yeah we may see more of that now uh you know its funny the coach will change defense theyll see how it goes in the first possession they may come out of it quick lets see how long they stay with it out of the corner Applause Sutton its only his third attempt on the year and he has yet to hit one this season hes only got one made field goal for the Freshman from St Louis Missouri ases stops and hits that really disciplined midrange shot its tough for a you know for a lefthanded player to go right and pull up Ames has nine coming off a career game at pit on Monday with 27 points Dongo to Sutton and thats exactly the play they worked on in in shoot around today the catch over the top the stop and then hitting the other big guy cutting in Sutton with that last bucket for Georgia Tech into the box score Sharma curl too strong Robinson cant run it down Virginia says that Georgia Tech touched it well check on it Ames is first with the pullup hits at the other end Dongo off the pass to Sutton who lays it in an 11point game gamec Player of the Year thats National Player of the Year final four in 1981 yeah and uh just an incredible career and played against him in the pros as well the original Twin Towers at Houston with Elijah Juan um probably he was a point center before they even knew that was so Virginia by 11 they have outscored Georgia Tech 14 to8 here in the second half after leading by five at halftime 4136 shot clock at five aim Slams on The Brak suround Terry Sutton has the rebound 15 points for Nate George he leads the way for Georgia Tech Music Terry still has not scored for the yellow jackets George will take it all the way and Miss close range Sharma you know I was watching him and Ames has given George a or uh hes given Terry a little respect but not as if he were healthy did have a brace on that right wrist for a moment took it off got right back into the game but has struggled 0 for three for the floor right good Virginia is just really grinding down that offensive shot clock Murray end of the clock Powell and Buchanan leap for it Powell runs it down trying to take it all the way to the rim and he did it boy Po and their bigs have done a nice job getting out in the open floor and finishing I I really Ive really been impressed with Duncan Powell yeah hes in the double digits again M last 10 games before tonight averaging 15 points and six rebounds and his his versatility too be able in first half stepping out knocking down threes shot clock is at five again Sharma this time its too strong you can and has it ases reloads and Ill tell you what in this game Virginia has been as good as on the offensive glass as Ive seen them too I mean its not a strength of theirs but that time it gets him second look into a three thats now nine of 22 and 41 from Beyond The Arc for Virginia fourth best threepoint shooting team in the ACC by percentage and thats going to go the other Applause direction heres the look and me you want to get a good look at a three get it on the offensive glass everybody is scattered defensively Applause and this was something actually that Virginia did very well at pit rebound the ball and theyre a plus 10 in this game 30 to 20 over Over Georgia Tech they out rebound of the Panthers 33 21 allowed just 21 rebounds in the win by led by 15 at halftime in that game went on to wi Applause it Kofi just picked up the foul dont forget next Saturday Infinity Series at Daytona following our CW Courtside Saturday double header the hardwood and the track Canan will come out of the lineup for Virginia well right now it is 60 fouls against the home team Virginias been to the line once tonight threepointer from George and he has hit some very opportunistic threes at the end of the first half he gave them a nice boost and they needed that three so 18 points now for George adding that threeo Applause cornner shot clock Applause again winding down for McNeely hanging and scoring thats a tough cover hes got Sutton whos 68 on him and uh you know this is Terry George teas up another three Kofi the Applause rebound 20 points for Isaac mcney unselfishly into the corner for as mcne roie ases three from a hockey assist and the largest lead George hits the three at one and MC Neely with the answer and a 14point lead celebrate the national championship coach Tony Bennett who stepped down prior to the start of this season his trusty assistant Ron Sanchez taking over the program trying to win their fourth in their last six games McNeely Robinson rocking the stenin another you know you shot clock winding down the Miss three and then to just an offensive rebound for a dunk and I tell you what I mean Anthony Robinson I think is playing himself into some playing time here over the last few games George missed it long rebound Saunders runs it down couldnt handle it lost it out of bounds lets take a look at that Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Melo heres the look I mean you youve done all you can right there offensive rebound you you know you get the shot you want and Robinson right there and this is what he does well he blocks shots he protects the rim but uh red Shir freshman doing some work inside Four Points in the game for Anthony Robinson Powell quick shot 545 to go in regulation after leading by five at halftime for Virginia remember Georgia Tech went triple overtime on Tuesday on the road to Clemson for a threepoint Victory against the Tigers ases that was their first road win of the Season unlike tonight that game went back and forth 23 lead changes and 14 ties against the Tigers Powell trying to Chisel his way to the rim and how about Clemson losing that game and then having to play Duke and Carolina on a Saturday and a Monday back to back at home Applause this is roie way behind the line I dont know if Ron Sanchez another offensive I dont know if that was a shot that Ron San has wanted a long three that early in the shot clock now for the Tigers Mike that was just their second home loss of a year for Coach Brownell 12 offensive rebounds for Virginia right now Saunders and Robinson cannot collaborate four and a half minutes to go Powell trying to go down Broadway with the left hand lays it in good finish for him hes really been hes really shown nice handle in the open floor 16 points for Powell George has 18 leading scorer for Georgia Tech tonight nes got 20 Robinson bumped by Suare close to the rim third yeah thats again the mismatch inside hes hes going to be able to take McNeely right there and then boy nice handle off of roie to finish with his offand well traving from North Carolina but uh played at North Carolina AT and then Sacramento State and finding his way to Georgia Tech the CWs number one show is back and its all new Monday dont miss allamerican Monday 87 Central right here on the CW so glad that youve joined us for CW Courtside Saturday game three Tom wormy alongside the AllAmerican from two Mike jinsky theres a few of them in the building tonight too they are scattered all over the place come back to honor their coach and some who played before several members of the 2019 national championship team including NBA Applause teammates and by the way the Cleveland Cavaliers who are well represented here tonight arent doing too bad in the east in the NBA either DeAndre Hunter Ty Jerome Powell seems to be the goto man here hits a roadblock in Kofi Falls away Suare is trying to fight for the board and he might have picked up his fourth personal so well take a time out Hunter and Guy Courtside aing Financial Security for nearly 160 years yeah and this of course at Virginia you talked about the 10 threepointers they had against spit and uh you know equaling that Mark here 10 of 26 and you know actually Georgia Tech not bad at eight of 18 and uh but theyve quieted down a little bit in the second half actually a lot one of seven so thats not been quite the weapon that it was in the first half but in in all fairness and you know this team is playing six guys basically and with uh Lance George or Lance Terry sorry uh scoreless in the first half and then getting hurt and and basically not being a factor in this game that thats just a lot to overcome for them y favoring that right wrist hes 0 for four from the floor and hasnt Applause scored Isaac mcney has 20 points 20 or more for the fourth time this season late the shot clock F interception George had it taken away by Kofi who got back yeah they really have not had many rushes up the floor and a good Pursuit from behind that time defensively by Applause Virginia Canon looking for the one armed rebound tangled up with power for the foul so with just inside of three minutes to go in regulation Mike Virginia closing in 70 points scored since 2010 their record is 174 and 12 when they score 70 or more Ames thats 70 yeah we got a while to go but remember they had 41 in the first half so you know Big Boost there but you know a lot of that too is theyve been a lot more deliberate in the second half in their possession so theyre really they were theyve been really grinding the shot clock down largest lead of the night after leading by five at halftime George trying to weave his way Neely will pick up the foul boy he just he just gives them you know I I was just I was looking at the numbers you know you see a guy if youre pit and well get back to that thought in just a moment the rafters former players all over the building two free throws from Nate George yeah I was talking about ases uh handling the ball ball now you know going in the pit game hes averaging six points a game and you know on The Scouting Report youre not expecting a guy to have you know have a game where hes four and a half times his scoring average against you but I think now going forward I he may be moving up hes got to be moving up a little bit farther up on what who youre looking at at this team this time he dumps a loow to Buchanon shot clock winding down for Kopi in the jam your point about Ames Mike 18 points tonight four of six on threepointers yeah this is third straight game in double figures he it was 11 before that pit game and you know Dango other side of the rim I will say Mike I just noticed in the box score that roie has nine assists yeah he had nine assists in the game at pit on Monday too to set a career high so hes died it yeah and thats been a big big thing for them and and Ro was really put in that position last year and really went through some Growing Pains at the position but he has settled in at the point guard this year and uh got some great size to him makes good decisions like that one yanan was trying to stuff that one aord on the way up well defended foul was called in the process I mean as a team theyve got 20 assists only seven turnovers fabulous numbers for a team assist the turnover ratio they had 20 assists on Monday as well in the winded pit so substitutions coming in for Virginia and thats Tonys son Eli number 25 Junior practice player same number he also played for Coach Sanchez and Charlotte too and uh yeah Tony War 25 as well War 25 with the Applause Hornets solid game from Buchanan in the center position well there was certainly a lot of emotion in the building for the banner for Tony Bennett going up in the rafters and the players that he entrusted to Ron Sanchez came through big time tonight with fly colors Micha yep no its a great great win great celebration of Tonys career here yeah this this his dad who he played for Wisconsin Green Bay who he coached with at Wisconsin Green Bay and also Washington State took over for him at Washington State and then came to uh came East to V Virginia for 15 years in that national title in 2019 Heres the final 25 seconds Virginias going to move to 12 12 on the year 5 and8 in conference play theyre going to win four their last six games Eli passes it up Roberts trying to finish it hockey assist for Eli and he got the steal I think hes in the box score and that caps the night for Virginia and their head coach Tony Bennett celebrated this evening Ry Sanchez and Damon star sharing a moment and uh look at Tony Bennett just so proud of his son and
