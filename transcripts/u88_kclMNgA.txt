ACC coach of the year and this is a dangerous team because of their depth their length their style they are no fun to play against and yes Carolina beat Florida State in both of the regular season matchups but in the first game the seminal led by 14 early in the second half in the second game by eight but couldnt close the deal in either one Carolina actually put on a fullcourt press when they were down 14 and that was the difference in the game LLY lost it but it will stay with Florida State 10 on the shot clock as we show you the starting lineup for the seminal and again they are very deep Leonard Hamilton used nine yesterday and that was tightening up the rotation Watkins is the guy but Darren Green Jr he had a quiet day just one made three against Virginia Tech yesterday but he is liable to go off at any time Baba Miller with the first bucket of the game just a little Flex cut a little cross screen down screen action and Baba Miller came off that and did a great job of posting up Harrison Ingram and I dont think Ingram can go for that steal there hes got to stay between Miller in the basket make him score over him and right now Watkins is on Kad back cut by RJ Davis missed the layup it hit his foot and it winds up in the hands of cormack Ryan who misses the three Armando Bott with the offensive rebound and he cant convert well it looked like there was a lot of contact on RJ Davis when he went up for that shot and hit the dech and this is what Watkins did so well yesterday against Virginia Tech but a good job by kdo making that tough on him making it tough there was a ton of body contact there this has been an interesting start with no whistles on those two plays Florida State switching almost everything so youre going to get all kinds of matchups right now green is on RJ Davis the leading score in the league Theo into de Baka triple teams theyll give kadu the three and Miller the rebound Florida state did a great job of getting into the paint against Virginia Tech in yesterdays game they had 48 points in the paint they need to continue to attack that lane and put pressure on this North Carolina defense floater from the Baseline wont go for warley and about come the heels in transition really good job by Ellie kadoo to stay in Applause front what a magnificent year for RJ Davis better than 21 a game off the glass he banks it home against Florida State its really difficult to run offense because they switch one through five and they switch to deny but RJ Davis hes an individual playmaker so he can take the defense on on his own and in the two games they played he averaged 252 points 27 and 24 in the two games Miller and to Corin but hes out of bounds all right take it take a look at Baba Miller here where is he I cant find him there he is right there he comes off that little cross screen and then theres a down screen for him and he gets that low post position youve really got to communicate on that defensively and North Carolinas been a great defensive team all year long theyve got to continue that in the postseason top five in the country an adjusted defensive efficiency per kenpom a good offensive team as well but its the defensive numbers that jump off the page at you Harrison Ingram the transfer from Stanford what a great year he has had for the heels Davis always in motion finds an open Ingram and he buries it and what a great find by Elliot Kau to The Cutting RJ Davis that Drew the defense and Harrison Ingram just positioned himself on the opposite side of the threepoint line that was excellent offense and now were having an issue with one of the baskets some is hanging by a thread literally it appears down from the basket from the the bottom of the backboard and thats going to create a delay Im not sure exactly what it is or what needs to be done with it but were going to have a bit of a delay here looks like a microphone doesnt it a microphone that became dislodged with the the contact or the or the ball going through the basket and now people are on phones Jay trying to find find the person who can fix it dont you have a piece of tape you can run out there with come on Dan well get on it during the break 52 Carolina Music early and that brings about some really great memories because his father spent 35 years working for the Department of Education for the US government but it also brings back some really sad memories of taking his mother for doctors appointments in chemo therapy and radiation before she passed from oral cancer when he was just 16 but the Bittersweet homecoming also reminded him that the last time the ACC tournament was here in DC it was 2016 and they won and our own Joel Barry uh now doing a great work on the ACC network was the most outstanding player of that tournament back in 2016 great stuff Jess thank you 52 Carolina Early Dan shman Jay bis Jess Sims and Baba Miller ties it with a corner three hes got all five early for Florida State all right he was wide open North Carolina more concerned with the lane than they were the threepoint line with Miller only shoots about 29 from three but youre going give him one that wide open hell hit it gdau trying to get it inside to Bott he does and Bott has it stripped that great position in a fabulous angle thats Florida State they can knock that ball away average nine steals per game that leads the Music ACC there Aaron green Jr misses the three Davis down with a Applause rebound green a 39 threepoint shooter on the season cormack Ryan had his heel out of bounds when he caught that pass North Carolina trying to pack the paint Harrison Ingram just comes in got caught a little bit in no mans land worried about getting a block out and look at that angle that Armando Bott had but just a terrific Strip by Darren Green Jr so the State could take it the other way you have to be so strong with the ball against these guys because they are athletic when they switch they will reach and they go for the ball to get Steals and they get a lot of it but Jay with them switching one through five at times Bott like there will find himself with a smaller player on them do you expect Carolina try to go into him whenever they can in that situation well youd hope so I I think they want to go into him in every game and establish themselves inside out because Carolina wants to get to the free throw line and youve got to touch the paint to do that whether its getting it into Bott driving it that free throw Advantage the Carolina had in the first two games these te teams played was instrumental in Tar Hill victories the first game was way back on December the 2nd the second one on January the 27th uh Steels as J mention turnovers forced blocks per game third in the league uh they get their hands in the passing lanes theyve got a lot of length like every Leonard Hamilton coach team does but oddly enough not a great defensive rebounding team Florida State Watkins wound up on the deck but Carolina cant take advantage and they turn it over for the third time already surprised Withers a little bit when that ball was thrown to him he was really good in that game against Duke warley with a floater that wont go Withers the Louisville Transfer down with it off to Seth Trimble who has checked into the game as well for Carolina Trimble can really attack off the dribble especially with a right hand drive they trying to make it tough on Davis and they do a block by warley green with the three and Withers getting back to rip down the rebound Darren Green Jr last couple games really struggled but hes a good shooter man and how about when Harrison to bot runs the floor he gets some easy buckets it just puts so much pressure on your transition defense when big guys run did I say Harrison Bott when Armando Bott runs the floor but imagine if you put Harrison Ingram and Armando Bott together and made them one play that be pretty good Armando Bott getting down the floor second Team all ACC this year and the midrange choer for cam Corin to tie it up for the semal cam Corin is really coming along going into that Virginia Tech game in his last four games he was averaging 15 points and shooting over 60 from the field had some really good minutes in the game against the hookies this is a seol team not under consideration for the NCAA tournament at this time obviously theyve got a lot of work to do as Trimble knocks it down but if they can pull off an upset victory over a potential one seed kind of team the fourth ranked team of the nation that is a step in the right direction for Florida State they theyre dangerous here this Applause Music week that shot by Seth Trimble hes a guy that really Embraces his role Big Time Defender Bott knocks it away Corin gets it back you saw Carolina playing off warle he is not a threepoint shooter but he can get to the rim and he can follow his own Music Miss tied up at Music nine knocked away from behind Corin TI It Away warley out ahead of the pack and he lays it in as Florida State takes the lead but Carolina is coughing the ball up and you give credit to Florida State for the pressure the active hands but Carolinas got to do a lot better job protecting the ball its like telling a running back you go through the line you better protect that thing because the defense is punching at it to knock it Loose Corin switches out onto Davis Davis cant get rid of him trying to get by him and you know what you tip your cap to Davis on that one if youre the seminal yeah talk about great offense being just a little bit better than outstanding defense they made him work for that a quiet start for jir Watkins who was in anything but quiet yesterday against Virginia Tech a Florida State ACC tournament record 34 points 14 of 17 from the line not a good shot air ball by Miller Watkins puts it home boy Corin just reached around Armando Bott to knock that away Bott had great position and Florida State turned nothing into something because of it Bon Baseline to the jam yeah thats the kind of strength that Carolina has to play with against this Florida State team cuz the seminal are attacking good start to this one tied at 13 8 and 12 in speaking of attacking tipped up but basket interference called it on Miller wave it Music off and a Timeout on the floor 1313 here in quarterfinal number one of the ACC tournament heels and one thing Jay that you and I everybody else who follows North Carolina has seen for 5 years is Armando botts going to run the floor about as well as any big guy around he does run and this isnt a dead Sprint obviously but he runs right down the middle of the floor actually jayen Withers beats him down there but nobody from Florida State picks him up and you North Carolina in its history has always been Relentless in running they run the floor their transition is really dangerous and when your big guys run it really makes it difficult on opposing big guys and it has a cumulative effect it can wear you out but thats where Florida States depth really helps the seals because they play so many different guys theyre not going to wear them out as easily as you can see botts on the bench Davis is on the bench Jaylen Washington is into the game for Carolina extremely productive in limited minutes playing behind Bott number 13 in white and Leonard Hamilton has made three substitutions including jayen gainy a 69 sixthe player coming in what a lefthanded scoop that was beautiful by kdo Kau has really been attacking hes not a perimeter shooter but everybodys going to play for the drive and still when he catches it he can drive and get to the Music paint coming off a baseline screen getting open but missing the shot is primo Spears who had 15 uh in the win yesterday Trimble kicks it out Ingram now with green on him but Trimble is such a versatile player he can really go out there and play the point for you hes a great matchup to have on jir Watkins as a Defender cuz hes strong great play thats no good basket interference and Withers cant believe it he could see it wasnt going through the basket he kind of hung on the rim didnt know what to do and an easy two comes off the board B Bowen got caught ball watching and how did that not go completely through well theres a transfer from Louisville only getting about 12 minutes a game but a good player an experienced player and hes using his athleticism hes been playing really well of late I thought he was really good in that game against Duke I think he had eight rebounds in that one Watkins kicks to a wide open Taylor B bowan who knocks down the three and then Watkins goes flying at midcourt he got caught up with Harrison Ingram doesnt take much when two teams have played each other twice already in the regular season and that doesnt happen as often as it used to with conferences getting bigger but uh teams tend to get tangled up a little bit more when they meet for the third time no love lost a Subway push Midway through the first half Florida State the nine seed with a onepoint lead do Washington lays it in what a great job by Jaylen Withers to set a little screen there to help free up Elliot Kad a member of the ACC all freshman team kdo and he had a very good game against Florida State January 27 16 points and six assists green does not get the bounce in the rebound down to Ingram who led all players in rebounding during ACC games even better than bacock that was a big time rebound by Harrison Ingram and when he grabs it he can rip and run but take a look here at Elliot Kau now a good job by Jaylen Withers to just bump both Defenders and he gets all the way to the rim and gives it to Jaylen Washington this drive he just drives the close out gets right by B Bowen and thats a spectacular finish with the left hand Ingram into the back court to run it down Kad and Trimble the guards right now for Carolina Carolinas playing with really good Pace offensively just a tackle oh you could hear the slap all the way over here as Withers got fouled a smart cut out of the left corner by Jaylen Withers I think Hubert Davis has to be really pleased with the pace at which North Carolina is playing we talked to him before the Duke game on Saturday they wanted Cameron sweeping the regular season series and boy was Hubert happy with his team one of the things we asked him how a lot of new faces in a tough year last year how long did it take uh everybody to come together and he said like less than no time he said as soon as everybody showed up you could feel the bond he gives Ingram a lot of the credit for that uh RJ Davis took off had a a wonderful season obviously youve got a great player alongside him in Bok cormack Ryan coming over from Notre Dame and fitting in and this group Blended together seamlessly it seems very early well the blending together is an important factor but Im amazed frankly at how theyve embraced defense to this level you know its been a long time since you talked about North Carolina the lead story was defense its not that they havent been good defensively they have but its just their offenses always been so powerful that was the lead story you know this year you talk about Carolina and how good they are you go man this this team can really guard you know they are gritty defensively warley trying to back down kadoo got a big size advantage on him too strong off the glass its still loose its a Rugby scrum and its a shot clock Music violation where the Carolina fans are cheering for that like theyre Virginia fans now dont get crazy dont get carried shot violations are standing Laughter Os think seven of the 10 players were in there battling for Applause it you saying the other three were Laughter cherry Applause B Bowen will back off as Kido brings it over Davis has returned Bott has returned the horn set two up top two in the corners and thats just going to get Armando Bott isolated in the low block boy Withers spun and kind of backed into B Bowen he didnt even know he was there and B Bowen is shaken up B Bowen is a little bit slight of frame and he got the worst of that hes trying to to get around Armando Bott to get in front because he was being just held off got his arm around Bott there was no call there but he got the foul another way Florida States been called for two fouls Carolina yet to be whistled for a foul almost 12 minutes into the game Davis again with size on him and B Bowen got him in the air and draws the foul thats an Up and Under move thank you and he left the floor what a tough cover for Bowen to have to guard RJ Davis and Davis has been really aggressive putting the ball on the floor theres the up theres the under that is a term of art Sports Center anchors its not just a guy going around to the other side of the basket and at the line Carolinas alltime career leader in free throw percentage 86 RJ Davis 89 this year Applause and as mentioned off the top of the show the ACC Player of the Year and hes in some pretty good company isnt he well just being a player at North Carolina puts you in some pretty good company but thats Elite company I would have thought though thered be more than five with all the great players that North Carolinas had but you know this has always been a a team program Carolina switching one through three Florida State switches one through five Watkins strong again a foul on Ingram and the basket will count jir Watkins was magnificent yesterday against Virginia Tech with 34 points and 11 rebounds and talk about strength he just went right into the neck of Harrison Ingram to get that bucket see him shoot that is great stuff Jess thank you so much for that as Darrens biggest fan looks on here in Washington and as she well knows he can shoot the ball what a beautiful family he can really shoot the ball you really cant leave him and he gets it off so quickly and especially in transition hes the first guy you have to find thats where Carolina wants to see him he sitting over there Watkins at the line and again he made a living at the line yesterday 14 of 17 hes a difficult guy to say okay thats the player I want on him is it Ryan is it Trimble you put Ingram on him for more size what do you think the best match up is I think the best matchup for him is Seth Trimble now Carolina is going to switch one through three so youre going to have different guys on him but Trimble because of his strength how he gets down in a stance he is really difficult to get by good pass and Bot another bucket coren got caught on the high side trying to one discourage the pass but also extend it make bacock catch it further out from the elbow and he just back cut him nobody in the middle because he had two players in the corners in that horn set Miller with a height advantage on Ingram this is tipped Away by kadoo but Jackson has it for the Applause Seminoles Spears he got caught in the air and he turned it over great defense by forat Bryan kdo flying down the court and laying it in how about that inair adjustment made by Elliot Kad and give credit to cormack Ryan he was weaking that up at the top meaning forcing the ball handler to his weak hand and that was a big part of it Spears who can be instant offense Off the Bench for the seal with a midrange jumper the spears didnt play in the first game between these two but had 10 points in the second and he provides a level of explosiveness that I think Florida States going to need in this again Leonard Hamiltons gone nine deep so far he can sometimes go 11 or 12 went nine yesterday Bott wants goal tending but Miller credited with a block Carolina using that horn set to really spread out this Florida State Defense and Spears missing the three hes just 26 from out there good deep position by bacon and a foul on Corin his second great job by cormack Ryan to send the ball ball to the left Primo Spears made to go to his left and what an adjustment in air to get past Spears and lay it up off the glass thats just absolutely beautiful now heres kdo like Corin gets caught on the high side I dont know why he was guarding it that way but he just gave a lane to the basket and a simple pass for an easy bucket hes really I mean he was a very good player when he showed up obviously but hes really improved and developed over the course of his freshman season well hes attacking but a guy that really doesnt shoot it you he hasnt even hit 10 threes on the season so youre not youre playing him as a driver he still drives it Ingram with a size advantage on Spears but Spears gets his hands in there makes it tough Ingrams trying again and well go to the line they decide not to double him and weve seen this all year long with Harrison Ingram he will just back down a matchup that he likes and Hubert Davis will isolate him on either side but he shoots that turnaround jumper very effectively and unless Spears gets a hand on it hes not big enough to really bother Applause that 122 points better than nine rebounds per game this year coming up at 500 pm Eastern its ACC pm and then tonight at 1130 Eastern after all four quarterfinals have been settled then nothing but net crew will have a complete breakdown of todays ACC tournament games Carolina wants to live at this foul line the free throw line is the most efficient place to score on a basketball court Dean Smith identified that earlier than anybody he was really the first to use what they call analytics now points per possession Spears gets free on the Baseline thats one of his spots this really came off a low screen and Ryan tried to go over the top and GAP it and spar has just faded more into the corner hes wide open Bott now being defended by Jaylen gainy corins gone to the bench with two fouls again theyre making Davis take tough twos Bott had it lost it and its Miller in Florida State but not for long the foul called on Baba Miller another great play by Elliot kdo an alert play like Florida stayed so active in knocking the ball away they knocked it away from Bott but just a great move on the ball in order to take it away from Miller Miller just with a little grab otherwise Bott would have had a Applause layup when the glasses come off its getting real for Hubert Davis hell put him back on but very conservative sport Co Choice today by H Gs been diving all over the floor and uh he may have to change the leggings at halftime got a little blood on his right KNE Applause too now hes driving tiit back up and in by Ingram and thats a vulnerability for Florida State they are not a great defensive rebounding team but when RJ Davis came off a screen to the left that just opened up the middle and Kau took advantage of it yeah you wouldnt think but they are to your point they are last in the ACC in defensive rebound percentage this season and part of it is the switching you get caught in some matchups that arent favorable for rebounding the Carolina very good offensive rebounding team not as powerful as in the past look at that hustle are you kidding again its kadoo what a first half hes had hes everywhere but that thats how you tell thats how you demonstrate one to Florida States bending at the waist and North Carolinas diving on the floor what a great play by Elliot cadoo you look at the box score it says Four Points two assists that does not tell even a small part of the story of how well he has played so far here today just raises the energy level a Carolina program thats only won the ACC tournament once since 2008 we talked about it Joel bar the most upstanding player 2016 mean they won it not only can they cut down the Nets and and win a championship here this week also have a chance at a one seed you would think if they were to win this and theyve now got their largest lead of the game I just love the way theyre playing if this is an elite program with a blue collar attitude thats a great combination green no tremble the rebound and theyre running again botts running again and going the line you know what really made that was Harrison Ingram really running the floor he cleared some space for bot to come behind him cor Ryan now watch this this is an Up and Under move ladies and gentlemen how do you get how do you get that to go hes on a heater man hes been playing great 31 Saturday against Duke and now theyre dealing with that Bloody right knee that kados got didnt you love it after the the Duke game when Harrison Ingram was interviewed talking about cormack Ryan he said yeah it was great those 31 points matched his Laughter age for those wondering hes actually only 25 year at Stanford transferred to Notre Dame three years there and now a grad transfer year with Carolina and boy has he been impactful ninepoint lead as theyre stretching it out a little bit here in the late stages of the first half tough two and a foul called on Ryan caught him on the Music arm I think the players sometimes get bothered by the fact that the whistle is late but the referees just it seems like this year theyre just taking an extra beat to let the play be Determan and when he wasnt straight up and down Im not sure actually whether there was arm cont there but you when it looks like a foul theyre going to call it Watkins at the line the VCU transfers surpassed a th000 career points in yesterdays game thats a mark of a great college career J bis 1062 career points to do many of them on up and unders I understand yes y I kind of got to let that go dont I I think could pass that play and he made him both as well as Carolinas playing and I agree with you its a sevenpoint Music Applause Music game theyre making RJ Davis work for his too he does have six points three assists in the game but theyre trying to deny him and no matter whos guarding him its a guy with a good Mobility good reach a lot of length oh but the attention he draws opens things up for Applause others and a foul called which Music one itll be Armando bot at the free throw line for one and one when we come back kind of set the energy tone for Carolina here today yeah hes got double figures and floorb burs minutes of game time but the energy giving has been really significant Bott at the line for Carolina a much improved free throw shooter this year boy I really I really laid the Jinx out there right youre not one of you dont believe in that I dont believe in the Jinx I talk about no hitters and free throw percentages youre not a baseball announcer you can talk about no hitters all you want no I thought it was for any anybody its only announcers yeah well The Players dont dont mention it they dont mention it the for no hitters right is it like an Unwritten rule B everybodys different yeah if it was that much of a rule they should write it down Music Applause exactly tough turnaround and it will go for Deonte green well he had 12 points against North Carolina the last game they played thats a tough one arm B was on the all defensive team in the accr Im still shocked he wasnt First Team all leag the pass fake Ted back out and Ingrams got it again Ryan is open on the wing and knocks it down a credit Armond Bott for knocking that ball back out to Ingram and Ingram could have shot it but passed it to Ryan for the better shot largest lead of the game for the Tarheels the Trimble is sticking right with Watkins Davis sticking right with Darren Green Jr good decisions tipped away by Davis and he is in all alone Leonard Hamilton has seen enough North Carolina is imposing its will on Florida State and theyre doing it on the defensive end it has been five playing as one for the baby blue one has all kinds of ramifications First Team all ACC performer blank Hinson and the pit Panthers taking on Wake Forest no matter where you look Joey brackets who you talk to these are two bubble teams this is a big big game as the pit coaching staff looks on I cant wait for this one they split two during the regular season pit one early uh in Pittsburgh and then wake blew him out later on in the season on their home court it should be an absolutely fascinating and very very intense basketball game the buff coming into the building was the only time that Blake Hinson isnt in range for a three 106 threes I believe it is this year leading the ACC Kos back into the game for Carolina wow Davis pulls up from three and hes into double figures now with 11 what a career hes had nowhere to go for Baba Miller needs help and kicks it back out 12 to shoot but Carolinas defense has been stifling communicating protecting the paint and every shot has been challenged Watkins for three it rattles out and its down to the heels and is Ingram Ingrams upset thought he might have been shaken up a little bit but he looks okay as he walks away in transition RJ Davis is looking to attack and how do you guard this youre trying to stop the drive because he is ultra quick and Roy Williams his wife Wanda enjoying that you hear Roy Williams say some of the some of the early games he went to he would start shouting at the players from the stands and he goes jeez Im not coaching anymore he is at a lot of games obviously an incredible career Hall of Fame career and he coached RJ Davis and Daviss freshman season he coached Armando Bott for two years right this is Huberts thirdd year and I think the officials are looking at the contact between Miller and Ingram Ingram obviously getting the worst of it I think it was between green and K now watch Green here that there yeah you know Kad kind of had an arm wrapped around him and green took him to the ground they have to Institute the three knockdown rule in this game for every foul called there have been three that should have been so nothing there but there was a common foul called on Miller so Ingram is back at the line told the story Saturday at the Duke game but when we asked Hubert Davis what do you like the most about Harrison Ingram Hubert just burst into a big smile and Hubert Davis might have the best smile in college basketball burst into a big smile and said everything and then he told us about six different things that he likes about him some of them were on the court stuff and some of them were off to intangible things the only thing I think he doesnt care for with Harrison Ingram he says his musical tastes are all over the place he said you should hear his playlist you cant make any sense out of it tell you Hubert but like a lot of the rest of us were getting a little bit older my friend maybe you are Im still culturally relative that is thats a debatable but more than I am we can agree on that Watkins has to kick it back out again Florida State having trouble getting into their offense they cant run anything theyve barely been below the free throw line Watkins taking matters into his own hands and its another shot clock violation well North Carolina hasnt been good defensively theyve been great just great and theyre shooting 58 from the field and theyve scored 44 points in 19 minutes theyre playing well at both ends but you know I think those things are connected I I think the defensive energy and the way theyre playing on the defensive end translate first of all it starts their transition theyve done very well in transition but theyve had Florida State no pun intended on their heels for quite some time not a bad bacock spinning the reverse wont go and look whos got it Ingram Bott kept it alive again great second jump Ryan no and Bott has another one now Ingrams got it boy they are dominating on the offensive glass Bott has it and finally it pays off Bott had his jersey pulled he was grabbed he was fouled five times on that possession uncalled and he never quit well to bring back something you said earlier in this game this is an a topnotch program that is playing with a blue collar attitude right now and what exemplifies you better than this possession this big time by North Carolina and look arms wrapped around him at the beginning of that play the first shot his Jers he was being pulled didnt complain just kept playing through it amazing final seconds of the first half nobodys needed halim more in a game than Florida State needs it now Carolina with lots of fouls to give thats just the third team foul here in the first half or the celebration of the outright ACC title is over Carolina came out in this game to take a swing at somebody Watkins in the corner swings it to Spears and hell hit it what a pass a bullet the three right at the end of the Applause half low to state with the first possession of the second half the winner into the semifinal tomorrow night against the winner of our next quarterfinal today wake and pit turn around Watkins and Ingram down with it for Carolina its now threw it off the bottom of the backboard and its still loose and Florida States got it and now Florida State Watkins and green Jr are a combined three of 13 in this game the defense that Carolinas played on those two outstanding scores has been stellar shot clock to 26 shot clock reset to 26 as the seols Music inbound lower to State the nine SE 10 and 10 in the league 17 and 15 Applause overall warley gets into the paint and will go to the free throw line again a big size advantage over a guy like kdo and both Watkins and warley very effective at backing down a smaller Defender yeah k was reaching for the ball early and then tried to get vertical but just caught him with the body as he was going up but Carolinas doing a great job of getting into ball handlers theyre really crowding ball handlers and making it difficult for Florida State to get any sort of straight line drive so jir Watkins got the headlines yesterday for Florida State but as you pointed out a couple of times during their win of Virginia Tech if there was a best supporting actor award given out yesterday Jaylen warley would have gotten 18 points couple of steals four assists he was terrific as a playmaker he has really good Vision but that Vision has been taken away by Carolinas defense in this one now Florida State going to put on full court pressure this a hard team to press because theyve got so many ball handlers even Ingram with the four spot can help out Applause exactly great look Ingram finds Bott they just got Bott stepping out to set that ball screen and he immediately sprinted on the roll to the basket they threw out of it and he was wide open it was a heck of a catch though they had to go through some traffic to get Applause there green to warley would T to shoot now Music Applause Watkins and a foul on cormack Ryan take a watch at Armando bot here he gets a screen from Harrison Ingram they just throw out of this in order to get the angle to catch him on the roll just a great catch through traffic that was a needle threaded this really smart offense by North Carolina just spread out this Florida State Defense and then attack but that was a planned thing to throw out of that ball screen action to be able to get the rooll Carolina finished the regular season having won six in a row including the win at Duke on Saturday Watkins at the line again for the Music seals early in the season a Carolina lost an overtime game to Villanova and then backtoback losses two good teams Connecticut and then Kentucky so in December you looked up and they were seven and three at one point not that theres anything wrong with that but they certainly appear to have taken their game to another level I think more if anything more youve talked about the defense but it feels like they really know who they are theyre very consistent game in and game out in trying to accomplish the things they want to accomplish well especially seemingly the last 10 games I mean they had a little bit of a i call it a lull maybe a hangover after the first Duke game at Carolina they lost a couple games after that that I would imagine Hubert Davis and the team thinks they should have won but they theyve been very consistent with highlevel effort of late I mean this is an outstanding team that can beat absolutely anybody biggest thing Im sure theyd love to accomplish this week is win a championship cut down of banner but as we mentioned they they figure to still be in contention for a one seed everybody knows and believes I think Houston Purdue Yukon theyre going to be one seeds is the fourth one still up for grabs and of note on that board right there they beat Tennessee earlier this season you never know if that could be a tiebreaker if it comes down to those two teams it very well could be I I think if Tennessee sweeps through and wins the Southeastern Conference tournament theyll probably get it even with the headtohead if Carolina were to win the ACC tournament and a three goes down for Darren Green Jr and Florida States gotten back within a dozen just shot behind that little hand off action and RJ Davis got held up but youre not going to youre not going to completely shut off Darren GRE Jr cor M Ryan how much fun is he having in his last year of college basketball hes been shooting the ball so well over the last seven or eight games that was a big time shot fake and S side step Baba Miller spinning on Ingram and Ingram gets called for the Applause foul cor M Ryan just spotting up in that right corner and just gave the shot fake let Baba Miller fly on by and then thats a really good little handoff and screen by warley and the green junior family loving Music it Miller at the line for Florida State six 11 sophomore from mayorca Spain averaging just under eight points five rebounds per game Millers only 19 years old as a sophomore and if he sticks with it and continues to develop hes got a ton of potential and a ton of talent develop his game get stronger both oh for sure both I would say get stronger one because he hes very skilled now hes going to get more skilled and get better but I think strength is the big thing for him the go out to Davis in and out Miller the rebound and you can see 611 look at how he can bring the ball up the floor offensive foul though called on Miller as Ryan takes the charge great positioning by Ryan just that off arm came up Im not sure it was enough to knock him down but it doesnt matter he was there number three on Baba Miller Kau got grabbed twice yeah they could give it to either guy theyre going to give it to Watkins Im not sure any running back in the NFL is taking a beating like kads taken today two fumble recoveries for him had a bloody knee in the first half they cleaned that up gave him and new leggings hes definitely had a leggings change yes Ron Watkins so bit of foul issues for Florida State although theyre very deep but Watkins is one guy that cannot afford to lose good pass good do in the corner misses the three and nobody boxes out on the weak side and Ryan says thank you very much and thats where some of the switching T mess up Florida State and blockout responsibilities but its sort of more of the same from in the first half just not able to get any rebounds man down five on four Davis saves it but cannot find Ryan and Carolina turns it back over it just too early to give it up to Armando bot now watch watch corac Ryan top of the key and Watkins just stands and watches and Ryan gets all the way to the rim so that wasnt a switch it was just a a lack of effort from jir Watkins if youre at a just about any teams practice youll hear over and over find somebody hit somebody which is the the coach of the defensive team saying dont look at the ball hit first then go get the ball well but you know if Watkins had gone after the ball thatd be one thing but he didnt do either Gau coast to coast and lays it in with the left Bo he playing with a lot of confidence at this point of the Season hes an attack guard and hes doing all this without really shooting the ball from the perimeter its even more impressive that look at him fight against Miller inside hes getting around fronting sitting on his legs now switches off Ryan takes him Green from 17 how quick is that trigger my Applause goodness Ryan shoes Kad away wants a twoman game with a Bott it looks like now off to Davis nobody puts Kad in the deep one Davis short long rebound to Ingram Ryan and its all Carolina right now you credit Carolina for that rebound but you have to ask yourself right now wheres the want to for Florida State which is not something you ask about a Florida State or a Leonard Hamilton team very know and I think Leonards going to be asking that question in film session too to Davis count it lots of smiles for the guys in the white jerseys right now and why not time out Leonard Hamilton North Carol Ina is getting whatever it wants the drive to the basket in transition with the lefthanded finish after the offensive rebound cormack Ryan wide open for the step in three and then RJ Davis just drop it behind and hell drop it in the 16th ACC Player of the Year from North Carolina mens tournament presented by tro price this is the first of four quarterfinals and the next one has all sorts of implications the four seed pit making its debut in this tournament wake beat Notre Dame yesterday to get here what is it all mean well this is a double bubble kind of game Joey brackets has wait for his first four out pit next four out these are and you and I have both watched these teams a lot this year they both feel like really good teams as Hunter Salis First Team all ACC for the deeps comes into the building they both feel like really good teams with a pit staff looking on but they both appeared to be on the bubble was watching one of the evening games last night Joe lardy came on and said I dont call it a play in game I think of it as a play out game in his opinion Jay whoever loses will not make the NCAA tournament and whoever wins will be in good shape but hes not willing to commit to them getting in however you want to slice it its a do its an important game and theyre two good teams two fun teams that can beat just about anybody when they play their best hit one at Duke this year wake beat Duke this year I mean theyre both very good teams the rebounding Advantage for North Carolina in this game is stunning its 298 Davis with a floater theyre not missing many and the ones they miss theyre generally getting those back theyve missed 18 shots and gotten 12 offensive rebounds thats crazy thats ridiculous more offensive rebounds than Florida state has total rebounds I dont think Ive ever seen this kind of thing happen to a Florida State team 29 to8 a block is called on jayen Withers and we have a time out on the floor 1321 to go in the second half Carolina up large right now here in quarterfinal Number One bns exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principle let our expertise round out yours and 911 season premier tonight at 87 Central on ABC stream on Hulu all Carolina in this one for more heres Jess Sims armano Bott said coach Davis sends out a thought of the day and yesterdays was the time to measure success is when all is said and done not when there is more to be said and more to be done and guys the performance today shows that the Tar Heels have fully internalized this thought it feels Jess thank you like they have come into this game as if losing this game would end their season I mean that the talent is obviously there but the uh the want to the determination all that stuff has been off the charts for them today well a after coming off that emotional game in Cameron indor stadium and beating Duke and winning the outright ACCC regular season Championship you might think there would be a let down or a a hangover effect no way I mean they came out ready to take a swing at somebody and right now Florida States on the canvas and has to get up Withers down with a rebound it feel and Hubert talked to us a little bit about this at Cameron on Saturday everybody knows who they are everybody knows their role the rotation is clear theyve got the five starters and then Trimble Withers Washington come off the bench they dont lose much theres not much drop off there look at this feed another great cut and theres Trimble to Withers bench player to bench player like everybody is contributing right now for this Carolina team and it seems like every player Embraces his role without complaint and that sounds like it should be a given but its not you know Trimble comes into the game and he just gets down in stance and defends and if a shots there hell take it but hes been outstanding of late Primo Spears with another midrange jumper for Florida State but its still a 20point game and Florida State still has not cracked double figures in rebounding for the game Harrison Ingram and Armando Bott individually without the other one have each outrebounded the entire Florida State team Washington gathers and has it rejected that was a heck of a catch and then Withers the Applause Music Applause foul Seth Trimble comes into the game great defender but hes also a point guard a little step back and a great cut by Jaylen Withers using the other side of the basket to Shield off the block shot thats not an Up and Under you know C and lets pay particular attention to Kansas State at the bottom V Texas last night Joe lonardi has them first four out so if you are a pit or wake fan getting ready for that game if K State were to beat Iowa state that boost their resume a little bit so a lot going on all around the country right Applause Music now to oain right in front of Watkins Watkins initiates the contact and is called for the offensive foul but give credit to Kad he switched out on Watkins and to your point stayed right in front Seth Trimble staying on Darren Green not letting him breathe number four on Watkins Trimble and he draws the foul he was looking to get on sports center right there wasnt he hes such a powerful athlete its almost like defensively he was born in a stance just a sophomore and goes off two feet double clutches gets the foul from B Bowen Two Shots coming for Trimble the sophomore from the nominee Falls Wisconsin as Watkins and his four fouls will head to the bench Chandler Jackson is in and now Baba Miller is going to take the spot of Taylor B Bowen who just picked up his Applause third 22p point Applause lead look how far out Florida state has to go just to run offense thats Spearss gain the the midrange pullup but he cant knock down that one and here comes Trimble again Bob with the offensive rebound but we got a foul going against Carolina and it is on Armando Applause Bob thats one way to keep Carolina from Gra having an offensive rebound the officials have the been the only one keeping them off the glass first game of the tournament for Carolina as the top seed all the four top four seeds earn the double bu Florida State of course played yesterday so Hubert Daviss team this is their initial game and even this with this being a Thursday afternoon as you and I look around this arena there is a lot of Carolina blue in this house here in Washington right now and theyve had a lot to cheer for in this one Florida state has overtaken B 9 to8 what an effort cam Corin getting ready to go to the free throw line and Carolinas over the limit with 11 13 to go I know Ive been harping on this a lot but I just I cant I cant remember a time in any game Ive ever been to where weve gotten to the middle of the second half and a team hadnt had double figure rebounds line for number three k cor shooting one and one Trimble the rebound youre right he gets up in the air so effortlessly it looks like hes a big time athlete kdo again the driving lefthanded layup what a game hes having he just has another gear and hes had his foot on the gas the whole game his energy level diving on the floor Miller trying to go to work on Ingram cant get it to go tipped out to kadoo Ryan oh and a good recovery by Jackson but then he stepped out of Applause bounds just goes through the legs and just takes off gets through two Defenders just a minimal effort there from Baba Miller to try to get a hand in there but kadoo was just gone and youd think well you want to try to force him left but hes as comfortable going left as he is going right and he does it with such a burst of speed and thats been really the difference I think in Elliot kdo as the season has gone forward is you know hes not only picking his spots but hes changing speeds hes doing everything a point guard should do I mean the only thing he doesnt do hes just not a reliable perimeter shooter but that thatll come hell continue to get better in that area but you know the scou forces play him as a driver okay and then he drives by anyway Ryan will sit getting a nice Ovation and Paxton woic a grad transfer from Brown checks in for the first time today he actually started the first three games of the season for the tarel Spears gets where he wants to get and knocks down another one hes really been the only offense for Florida State got 13 10 in the last game against these two hello I mean impressive as anything but if youre Leonard Hamilton youre saying way too easy well youre trying to make something happen with fullt pressure but Carolinas attacking that pressure to score for Carolina is executing in every single facet of the game here today and Florida state just looks shell Applause shocked got a switch theyve got calling for it kept it alive and hes fouled Chandler Jackson had no chance to block him out another step on the ladder there for Seth tmle so powerful off two Applause Music feet that is full send wow looked even cooler in slow motion roix Music open t to shoot tremble left it short and Miller has it for the Applause seminal took until the 925 Mark to get the 10th rebound and a Florida State foul will go on cam Corin who has been limited due to foul trouble today hes going to come out Jaylen gayy checking in Jaylen gainy was the ivy league defensive player of the year when he was at Brown Tor his ACL last year his right knee triple shooting one and Applause one well its getting closer and closer and weve got you covered on selection Sunday it all starts at 6 Eastern with sports center on ESPN Reese and the guys look at the mens field of 68 as the brackets are announced followed by Bracketology with a breakdown of each region and at eight the women field of 68 is revealed with Bracketology and a complete breakdown as well Im going to ignore that Reese and the guys thing Reese ignores the guys sometimes doesnt he he does but I dont think you can blame the writers of the promos on this look one of the guys is sitting over there just staring daggers at us right now Jay will you dont want to be one of the guys Jay will be one of the guys no Jay will doesnt want to be one of the guys Professor Williams in that turtleneck surprised hes not smoking a pipe over there back in 30 Jay bis Jess Sims and the North Carolina Tar Hills are putting on a clinic here this afternoon at both ends of the floor they beat Florida State by 8 and by seven in the two regular season matchups trailed in the second half of each they have never I mean it was it was 1313 if memory serves a few minutes into the game but since then they have never been threatened they are up 26 right now and here they go again oh good play though by Spears he prevented what likely would have been a dunk theyre going to get Ingram with a foul here I think that might have been the first time Dan gainy was first to the floor there me Dove on the floor that might have been the first time all game long that Florida state has beaten North Carolina to the floor for a loose ball and he appears to be grimacing and maybe limping a little bit as he goes to the free throw line at the line for Florida State number 33 J shoting Leonard Hamiltons had a remarkable career 22nd season in Tallahassee 36th season overall as a division one head coach Oklahoma State Miami before that won the ACC tournament Championship in 2012 and the seminal were awarded the title if you will in the co year the first the initial year when everything was cancelled in March they were the regular season Champs but I mean what he has done for the program and for the sport on and off the court should never be forgotten just an amazing person and an amazing basketball coach one of the alltime greats not only in this league but period kept alive seols first to the floor again Spears and gy puts it home I think it was about 5 years ago Music I was with sha MCD doing a big Monday game in Tallahassee and Leonard Hamilton presented us both with a razor kit so we could shave our heads I remember that and he was uh he was trying I think he was telling me to surrender like the little bit of coverage I had is just what I really wanted to know is sort of his you know youthful skin care all the things he must sleep in a hyper bear Jamber he looks like hes 45 years old hes 75 Roi count it with the ball movement and the unselfishness has been exemplary for North Applause Carolina warley the drive and lays it in couple of heels had their backs turned to the ball so that was an easy one for him but look at them get down the floor theyve been doing this all day Davis hell launch it Washington comes up with it for the Applause heels under seven and a half to go Carolina looking to move on to the semis up by Applause 22 Davis got it back and hits it why not unbelievable and he just put Baba Miller into the blender Applause Applause Spears to the free throw line not this time and kads got it for Carolina and hes got help with Applause him shovel pass to wji and now Davis will slow it down lots of time on the shot clock and the clock is their Ally at this point misses the three Chandler Jackson the rebound for the Applause seminal what a block by Washington after the no call on the contact gainy over Washington and Washington will wrap it Applause up Applause again no rush yeah its good decision you know you look at Washington playing behind Bott obviously limited minutes but hed kind of be on the short list I would think of potential breakout candidates next year hes got a ton of talent more of a face up big guy hell catch the ball down into the post and give an inside pivot hes got a really nice shooting touch and impact shots at The Rim two warley the Miss Here Comes Ingram pass roic in transition draws a Applause foul 536 to go Carolina cruising here against Florida State we will have more on the impact of Leonard Hamilton when we come back first round picks 19 draft selections well with the seven OLS of the and you ask Kanas coach Bill s the most influential person in his coaching career hell mention Larry Brown but hell really be effusive also about Leonard Hamilton who hired him at Oklahoma State Bill self alma mater that is quite a list of Legends that Leonard Hamilton is among and if youre uh sitting down with a coach and you like coaches who can reminisce and tell wonderful stories about you know anything related to college basketball Leonard Hamiltons a one seat in that discussion He is unbelievable a very thoughtful first Applause yeah they wrap up Washington thatll be a tieup and the possession arrow will keep it with Carolina again wake and pit still to come in the next quarterfinal that is a huge game for both programs who both appear to be sitting on the bubble right now Trimble the floater oh hes had a good game too just came off a little screen when he goes off two feet which he almost always does incredibly powerful RJ Davis is on the bench Armando Bott is on the bench and you know Hubert Davis thinking ahead a little bit theyre going to play again tomorrow hes hoping they play three times in three days hell get some of the the guys who have logged heavy minutes a few more minutes off right Applause now Music under five to Applause play to do the only starter in the game right now for Applause Carolina Darren Green Jr steps into a three nice rebound by Watkins whos really been limited today by foul trouble after having that incredible game yesterday against Virginia Tech are in the house boopy Miller Fon Reed the third and others cam hildr there this is a potentially explosive offensive team they split their two games with pit during the season the four five matchup with lots of implications cam hildr is going to be a big factor in that game against Pittsburgh he spent a lot of time guarding Blake Henson and did a really good job on him in one of the in the game they played against each other and hes going to be key in this one pits fun to bub Carrington outstanding freshman year for pit a member of the ACC all rookie team hon First Team all ACC performer almost 19 points per game two good Applause teams 25point lead for the tar Hills its been that way for a while and a turnover here to give it back to Florida State Here Comes warley green is open in transition and a foul underneath going against Carolina I believe yep Jaylen Washington team foul 10th team foul Two Shots number three King cor at the line for fla state shooting on the list of things that I didnt think would happen today a 25point blowout or Florida State was probably number one on the list I thought this would be a grind because Florida State can make you very uncomfortable with the depth and the length and the switching and boy Carolina just has played great this Applause afternoon but to me its not just that theyve played extraordinarily well its just how hard hard they played Jaylen Withers for three Withers hit over 403s last year for for lisal he was more of a lead dog on that team but he looks more and more comfortable as we get toward the the very end of the season tipped around Washington gathers it in again Watkins comes up with the steel and warley will lay it in for the seminal timeout Leonard Hamilton with 329 to go and Carolina on its way to the semis ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by tro price invest with confidence and in part by Liberty Mutual insurance only pay for what you need expert moves brought to you by principal and Elliot CAU has certainly had a lot of expert moves Jay in this game Elliot Kau not only set the tone he raised the level of the North Carolina effort talk about first to the floor there was no way he should have been first of that ball yet he was whether it was passing steals penetrating and finishing Elliot Kau did everything today he was really the engine that started this North Carolina train that ran over Florida State youre painting quite a picture there well done uh hes out for the last 329 of the game just went to the bench Zaden High has comeing to the game a freshman from San Antonio Leonard Hamilton still has a number of his starters in the game Hubert Davis does not have any of his starters in there right now thinking about tomorrow Withers tried to save it winds up jumping over the first row of seats and Landing right almost in the laps of the folks in the second row and now Jaylen Washington sits down James aono comes in transfer from West Virginia under three to Applause play nice crossover by Watkins and hell lay it in Watkin hes had to work hard for his dozen points today he really has and theres been very little what a nice play by Seth Trimble right down the middle of the floor to set up that lob a cono with the Applause flush and a turnover here come the heels again Carolina set a season high for Fast Break points in this ball game almost had a couple more right there the reverse for Zaden High everybodys getting in on the Applause fun when you feel for Florida State there this has not been the seols day but you just have to credit the amazing effort that North Carolinas put forth today they will take on the winner of our next game wake and pit in the first semifinal tomorrow evening bottom half of the draw two more quarterfinals coming your way including Duke and Virginia each making their first appearance of the tournament Seth trimbles having a heck of an afternoon started it out with defense and I really think early on did a great job on jir Watkins tough jumper that will go for Josh nickelberry whos just coming in the last couple of minutes and he can really shoot it hadnt had the great the greatest of shooting years this year but hes a terrific shooter and Hubert Davis calls the timeout just to bring some more bodies in there as Rob Landry has checked in Dewey Ferris and Kon Lio the son of assistant coach Jeff Lio everybody wearing Carolina blue has to be impressed with what

Z high again that was a big reason he went to North Carolina you had quite an impression obviously you showed him a great time that weekend Tom house into the game for Florida State Spears is still in there and still knocking down shots hes got 17 and now whos going to get the shot on this trip Dewey Ferris over in the left corner his mother Blair Ferris is the style Guru of Charlotte North
