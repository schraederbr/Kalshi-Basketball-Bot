Music but what he did you cant deny it its been a long goodbye its been a forgettable season no question but coach Bray will be remembered for being Notre Dames alltime winning as coach for winning a 2015 ACC Championship for getting to two Elite eights and what his team is hoping and what will be the best crowd theyve seen all year here in his forgettable season to provide a moment for Coach pit on the other side theyre trying to hang a banner and get into the tournament for the first time since 2016 they aint here for the emotions this is the ACC on ESPN Pitt coming into this game knowing a win guarantees them a double bind the ACC tournament and at least a share of the ACC regular season title the Panthers ranked 25th in the AP poll first time in more than seven years that Pitt has cracked the AP top 25 Nelly Cummings the fall away and rolls out rebound tapped up into the hands of Nate lasheski this Notre Dame team comes in having lost seven in a row obviously theres going to be a motion in the building tonight for the home team how do they Channel it just try to keep within themselves play for each other can you get back to what this team was supposed to be being efficient and in that first sequence Dane Goodwin with his back to the basket is exactly that thank you Applause starting five for Pitt all five starters scored in double figures over the weekend against Syracuse javarius Burton knocks down the jumper he flirted with a triple double over the weekend they had Nelly Cummings who handed out 13 assists for Notre Dame no JJ Starling tonight the Irish without their star freshman battling some knee soreness Marcus Hammond the Niagara transfer into starting lineup live ball turnover numbers for Pitt Here Comes Burton pulls up and hits Burton so cerebral in the open floor its like the game slows down for him never rushed composes offers with the little float game and hes developed a rhythm here early Applause from three in his last seven games a light pit playing fast trying to get up and down even off makes trying to challenge and test the athleticism and the defensive fortitude of an Irish team that struggled to guard all year long Henrico sets the screen for Burton lob down low Federico Federico able to Corral it drops it off for Henson dont foul and here comes Goodwin for the Irish youd love to see Federico with the advantage on Ryan keep the ball high and finish it hands not as sturdy as youd like them to be for the sophomore Hammond lines up three back iron rebound Burton Irish arent sending guys to the backboard offensively more concerned with getting back Burton no good offensive rebound Henson battling down low lost the ball hell fire from the corner its good he hits six of those on Saturday at 22 points in that game and we get a whistle of foul is going to be assessed on Pitt its going to be a technical on Jeff Capel and it might be words from from Greg Elliott here were trying to figure out some confusion is John Gaffney on the call Coach Capel not happy gets the crowd ignited an otherwise quiet crowd to start this ball game lets see Henson gets bald knocked away from him composes delivers from three and I dont know if it was Henson that had words hard to see but Greg Elliott came running over the officials coach Caples pleading his case well try to figure this one out but it was clearly something verbal that came from either Henson or Elliott stay tuned as John gaffneys making his way over now the foul is called on Henson Music Choice language from Blake Henson John Gaffney always all over and said the last thing he wanted to do was call whistle early on in this game but when Blake Henson uses language that is not acceptable right in front of an official thats whats gonna happen trying to laugh it off Goodwin hits the two free throws Music Trey Works has scored in double figures the last two games had a mismatch on Federico now its Ryan open three good back to that reason threes format Ryan and its 107 Notre Dame and failing to communicate Federico tentative to get out there and guard Ryan advantages to be had for an Irish group playing Five out with Nate luczewski on the floor now theyre gonna get Hammond with a foul as he got tangled up and this is all day quarterback Rider shoots about 36 percent from three Cummings late getting out thats the first delivery from Ryan and then he gets another one a sequence later starting to heat up the Irish who Alliance share of their work Beyond The Arc much like the Panthers Anson using his size down low gets the basket plus the foul Music thats just toughness lets play kids insane a bigger Im faster Im stronger hes bully balled down on a low block Henson so skill Beyond New York but with his body type you can do a little bit of that too good one just over matched its becoming a tired and refrain hes got a typical pit forward body type yes these are old bodies these are old guys that know how to play with him what Gods given to them and theyve been taking advantage this groups having a great year these are grown men on the floor right now both of these teams amongst the oldest in college basketball Applause over him skip pass amend got Federico in the air and knocks down the pullup again Federico being uncomfortable having two on the swing pass close out that allows the guard Marcus Hammond to attack sand closeout and pull up for the midrange these are ideal matchups early on for the Irish essentially a five out lineup for Notre Dame lashesky 610 when he plays more on the perimeter Burtons three offline works the rebound Applause Ryan wanted his third three and he is fouled three shots coming the foul on Greg Elliott the Irish playing a little inspired early on they lead Pitt by three metal home game is Notre Dame head basketball coach including a broadcast partner tonight Jordan cornet and Irish great I I dont know if were in fact you want to go in the Irish grave you want to go with that I just call it Irish player was what I was but some some talented guys Robbie courage next to me there Troy Murphy on hand Maddie Carroll Dave Graves Turin Francis Rick Cornett Colin Falls Kyle mcalarni Pitt fans even recognize some of these names because Pitt going back to the Big East with the Irish there was an enjoyable rivalry versus the Carl krausers the Chris tafts the sevi troutmans the Ontario lets you know those were some fun rivalry games back in that that Big East now talking to Mike Ray at shoot around he said the emotions of tonight didnt get to him until he saw all those former players yourself included at shoot around yeah its been pretty cool a lot of guys who spend you know the 23 years with Coach did a lot of winning with him in you know every program theres a Brotherhood I mean the pit Panthers share that same thing that camaraderie is what college athletics are about be able to share that on Coach praise last night as much as its about Coach its equally about the program over those 23 years and the relationships cultivate Mike gray built something special he inherited an had been relatively dormant for a decade Matt Doherty in his one season started to get things turned around Ray comes in his first three years you were there for season two three NCAA tournament births and they had been a consistent winner for most of his tenure kind of the same page of what coach capels got going on right now build an old group and win with those old guys Notre Dame couldnt do that this year with an old group but traditionally thats what prey has done coach Capel has taken that to Great Heights this season with a lot of old guys whove come from other winning programs and brought a culture here to Pitts Pitts uh pits program wild layup by Cormac Ryan and now its Emily operating the other way Henson backing down words almost traveled its tipped and a steal thats thats a great matchup for Nate lesevski with Federico having to defend outside gets him out of bounds finds good when high percentage look gotta be able to complete those if the Irish are going to be upsetminded this evening Music caused by the irishs struggles Goodwin misses the shot salks getting back Burton waits for nobody thats a winning basketball player that takes full advantage Here Comes Goodwin Baseline Drive Nike sbandi in there for Pitt then Alan Lubin coming off a career game and there for Notre Dame worse Drive kick good wins three there is a foul call down low and its away from the ball on Notre Dame and works Nelly Cummings a fantastic job of reading that words was coming with momentum stood in there positioned himself offered his body up to the basketball Gods the head of Colgate transfer making plays defensively foreign Music Im a man hes a gunslinger and knocks it down and hes been doing that all season long its like you in the weight room theres no warmup rep whats a weight room whats a workout Hammond from the corner of the Niagara transfer twotime first team on Metro Atlantic kind of what we expected early on Anish whole lot of offense two teams that you know can be vulnerable defensively Pitt obviously a better defensive Squad but when theyre struck on a separate their defense is lagging and its struggled to defend some of these threepoint Shooters this evening backing down Hammond a turnaround too strong and the rebound by Ryan the threetime captain 24 years old Hammond down low a little bit blocked at The Rim gets him back and puts it in then Allen Lubin has a chance if he stays the course here in Notre Dame to be a special player incredibly raw but has the physical attributes the ceiling is very high battled some ankle injuries earlier this season Henson left it short rebound to Federico Cummings offline and comes to Goodwin moving last time out 19 points in a season High 32 minutes and it rushed it it comes to Henson above 50 from the field good ball movement sabandi the open three no good but a good look look if youre not a threepoint shooter you dont have to go home but get the heck up out of here I mean everybodys hunting the threepoint shot here in the first nine minutes of basketball as we expect pit two of seven from three Notre Dame three out of five Federico helps Alex Lubin who stepped on the Baseline Music Notre Dame activating that threepoint shot three of five there early on getting it going and its a lucky Lefty Marcus Hammond delivering in his final home game people played for Mike Bray when Bray was an assistant coach Duke they spent two years together that 94 team was a national runnerup and Jeff cable earlier today said even back then Mike Bray kept things loose that has always been part of his Persona one of the first things Mike gray said to me at shoot around today was Im so happy for chip thats the ACC Coach of the Year Jeff Capel has had a sensational season with the Panthers they go way back a ton of mutual respect a ton of camaraderie a real kinship a real friendship between those two yeah and its been longstanding and look coach Bray is just one of many in a long line of guys that really appreciate respect coach Capel uh credit to the athletic department theyre staying the course and believing in him and hes paid dividends this guys been Innovative in how hes put together this roster hes restored the culture and the tradition a bit and theyre a run brand of basketball to watch currently Music I love his game because what he does is size up Defenders attack gaps and uses that body to create some space Sun had a few times here early on have known ring quite frankly getting to wherever they want on the floor here offensively both of the Diaz Graham twins in there for Pitt Jorge and Guillermo both seven feet tall lasheski doesnt care finds the Baseline and this is an interesting move from coach cable because the Irish have four Got Five Guys on the floor they play outside Beyond The Arc so this length is gonna be challenged can they win on a backboard thats the expectation to take advantage Music Music Ryan had knocked down his first two threes hes missed the last two hes got nine points though fourpoint Irish lead Notre Dame has lost seven in a row alone in first in the ACC Applause Music welcome our viewers on ESPNU Music the first half its Mike Grays final home game as Notre Dames head basketball coach with Jordan Cornett and a Shroff Courtside 30 former Irish players in attendance today an emotional setting here at Purcell Pavilion you got a Notre Dame team thats playing for its coach and you have a pit Team Jordan thats playing for everything yeah and the pit team has more on line quite frankly and this is a group that needs to up the ante defensively here too many clean looks for the Irish better sequence there defensively but the Irish getting whatever they want shooting above 15 but it needs to lock in there it comes into this game in first place in the ACC as Guillermo Diaz Graham misses the three with a win tonight Pitt would secure a double bind the ACC tournament they would also clinch at least a share of first place in the ACC the regular season as Ensign goes strong to the bucket coming off a 22point game against Syracuse Henson continues to give this team that lift emotionally but hes been productive nearing double figures and hes been in attack mode not just settling for the three but its hacking Closeouts a few times here in his first half Music Marcus Hammond a transfer from Niagara downloaded Dane Goodwin backing down Nike sebandi good win cant get it to go Rubens doing a better job of pushing it I think theres a real advantage to them trying to get an attack while try and play downhill and to chase that early offense a little bit more its getting some good looks theyre not falling Hinson misfires tangled up at the other end Robbie Carmody whos in there along with Guillermo Diaz Graham but Notre Dame Cashes in with Marcus Hammond Watson hes matched up with Carmody number of injuries throughout his career has not played much this season sebandi the drive and kick Elliott beats the shot clock and the rebound to Goodwin Elliott came into the game shooting 49 from three over his last 11 and the Irish are now going to look to slow this pace down have a two possession lead theyre gonna try and work some Glock and try and take a pit offense it can be explosive out of the Rhythm words on the drive the kick lesheski lines it up no good its an Notre Dame team right now thats just not very deep JJ Starling out again with a knee issue Marcus Hammond playing today but he missed the game over the weekend with a sprained to toe theres not a lot of depth the sabandi drives hard and draws the foul Music Marcus Hammond been getting it going offensively for an Irish group that is in a Groove the lucky Lefty getting downhill with the offhand lays it in and gets a b case let me tell you these bonzie Coulson was a problem on the floor remember that 2015 ACC Championship team and talking with Coach Capel over the last year just Reminiscing on some of you know his coaching experiences he said coach praised Bonzi Coulson was the guy at Duke that we just couldnt stop he was just such a problem so good around the basket his awkward delivery was so hard to guard and he was so productive and efficient and Bonzi was one of those guys over the 23 years that made coach the winningest guy in program history and if you look at where this season has not been able to replicate the success of last year they have not had that low post score whos been reliable Paul Atkinson was terrific last year as a transfer theyve had Colson theyve had Luke harangoni theyve always had that back on track a lot of guys a lot of guys and thats been missing from this group that toughness with that safety valve down low to generate offense Applause Music Hammond defended by Henson entry passed down low Lubin blocked and fouled by Federico Federico good delivery from the wing from worst to pass that on an angle where the seal off from Van Lubin Ben Lubin allows him to catch and almost in Rhythm catch and deliver at the hoop and draw the foul from Federico good execution on a low post pass Van Allen Lubin freshman from Orlando careerhigh 19 points Saturday and the lost awake Forest we remind you Thursday weve got a triple header for you top 10 and bubble teams involved Michigan Illinois had seven Arizona State against number four UCLA thats at nine and The nightcap number eight Arizona against USC thank you Music hitches two of 13 from three sibandi launches and hits thats his second triple and hes got seven Cormac Ryan is a get up in and defend a little bit better take some bandys Rhythm dribble into the three away a little two lags and Savannahs a bucket getter you cant give him that comfort in that space hell punish you every time thats gonna be the challenge for Federico against Notre Dame style hes going to have to come out to the perimeter more than he would like and these are clean threepoint looks when Federico has been the chief perimeter Defender nice move by Cummings who gets the roll cerebral move from Cummings couple probing dribbles Wade until the Gap was was presented to that attack and now Pitts gonna try and speed this one up shorten the shot clock apply some full core pressure I like it they need to speed up the Irish allowing that pit explosive offense to get some stuff going the other way with pace Applause Goodwin on the drive trying to maneuver around Hinson nowhere to go shot clock in seven Ryans three rims out Savannah using the screen Music whos had 13 assists on Saturday averaging eight assists a game over his last four wants the clear out sabandi driving a catch steps out of bounds on that Baseline hardcore macheski back in there for Notre Dame is Lubin heads to the bench and so this elevates the challenge right for Federico as a Defender because now Nate was chewski even at 6 10 thats a perimeter threepoint shooter thats hunting that first and foremost essentially five out now for Notre Dame Applause and again they get Federico on the switch down low lasheski Music threepointer its good by words and again thats Federico Jason thats worse and Irish are doing a Sublime job of understanding the vulnerability of Federico the defender find the shooter to catch with rhythm Burton coming in at the scores table for Pitt lets see if Pitt decides to go small sabandi off the shot fake and traveled Music and Federico checks so many other boxes for this group even the sub with Burton its going to be for some Bandy because they like his rebounding ability his length and they do if theyre gonna keep him out there they need to try and explore getting the touches down low and try to challenge the interior defense thats been lacking from the Irish All Season trying to play to some of his Advantage words for three and Federico has been a much bigger offensive contributor the last few games I also like him as a big screener to open up things for this group theres the tag height advantage on Ryan you got to win this one thats him down drops it off beautifully for Elliott when you talk about the ceiling of Federico theres the feel and when you look at his body and all that he presents thats when youre like okay this young man can be dangerous and he is just scratching the surface the sophomore junior college transfer Applause Music to Rico as hes trying to Applause Music now on senior night his Notre Dame High is 19 three of four from the threepoint line and this is who they thought Hammond could be injured early on in the season and never really got into the flow but feeling it this evening he was supposed to be the starting point guard sprained his MCL during the preseason tonight three of four from Deep five of seven from the field Music and with that age and experience comes production this game features nine thousand points scores thats insane and Greg Elliott for Pittsburgh is 30 away for making that 10 and what stands out to me with this graphic five of them are Irish and the season that theyve had the three four now with some man or looking at Henson those four guys and what theyve achieved for Pitt and how theyve elevated this program but Ill say this time and time again as productive as those guys have been its the ability for all of them to mesh as teammates coach Cape was never an issue bringing talent in here its the Personalities in the chemistry and keeping a sound locker room this Talent has that its a winning group thats poised to do a lot here in March right now Joe lunardi projects Pitt has a nine seed Panthers in the top 25 this week first time thats happened in more than seven years go back to 2016 which was the last time Pitt went to the NCAA tournament size advantage uses it it has to be automatic has to be automatic when youve got Cummins matching up defensively thats a 10 inch advantage that has to be a bucket every time IQ basketball high IQ execution for the Irish here in the first first half Drive snakes in falls back and the rebound to worst disciplined defensively from Works didnt bite on a head fakes made of me to chest and even contested on the offering from Cummings Brian Baseline Drive and one its very plain to see that this this crowd here in Notre Dame because of the emotion of its cool its fuel Mr back Ryan on the catch to exactly where he wanted to go Burt was not in position to defend help comes late from Elliott quarterback Ryan is able to finish this group is energized because they havent quite frankly played in front of crowds like this all season long because of the Season theyve had free throw oh Notre Dame run now the Irish this season have lost four games where theyve been up by 10 closing games out has been a different story but they have been fueled here with this crowd and with all that surrounds their head coach Mike Brave as being his final home game Burton wild shot Federico using the long arms had that deflected by lejevski its batted around and it comes back to Federico new 20 sebandi driving kick and a blocking foul and looks like Cormac Ryan picked first Mikey samani a little bit out of control into the traffic weve got the luxury of the replay Works gets blown by I dont know how thats not a charge pristine position from Cormac Ryan chorus of booze for a crowd thats been engaged for quite honestly first time this season Joe linardi emailed to all of us today said Pitt just has to win one more time anywhere anytime against anyone and they are a lock for the NCAA tournament now on paper that seems pretty good but if you lose tonight you still got to go to Miami this weekend if you dont get that one now you go to the ACC tournament facing a must win its not an ideal spot but again this game on paper presents a much different challenge than what it says on paper because of the emotion in the building this is not for bit this is a good win using the shot fake lines it up and knocks it down timeout Jeff cable seven for good win Notre Dame with a 14 uh numbers getting good looks exploiting weaknesses of this pit defense that has not been engaged to the level they need to to win on the road and Coach Bradys final game his shirt is still on but if they keep playing like this he may come out in the second half topless maybe he takes the shirt off when hes at the linebacker tonight hes never been to the famous Notre Dame bar sabandi misses on the drive Music Ray was saying yesterday theyre going to close that place down tonight Whites listening let me be very clear I aint shutting anything down Im a father of three I aint shot any bar down its not my last night here at Notre Dame Ill be back so Ill go in a couple hugs share some old stories on getting out of there Savvy veterans move to put that on the public records linebackers not for everybody Anish let me tell you Music assistant Trey wurtz picks up his second foul Irish dont really foul a whole lot among the fewest in college basketball but two arm Works Hammond has two and Federico with the freethrow line last two games 1214 for the line just to 65 percent of this one Applause Music Applause we go to Notre Dame 50 seconds to go the Irish in the first half 54 from the field seven of 14 from Beyond The Arc pit struggles have come from Deep they hit 163 Saturday against Syracuse just three out of 15 so far this was coach capels concern defensively his perimeter group being locked in and doing the job Beyond The Arc quite simply they have not been up to the challenge here in the first 20 good one posting up some Bandy lost it at it for a moment and a foul is going to be called against Notre Dame too slow developing from Dan Goodwin and he likes to get into that wheeling and dealing backing you in but if theres no Advantage it cant be a bevy of pivots moving Irish spent success moving to basketball and now you give a pit team a chance to cut into the deficit without the clock moving two now on Goodwin and still a one and one at one so sabandi will get free throws Pitt an excellent freethrow shooting team sabandi at 84 percent and he misses that one go figure pit one for five at the freethrow line they came in shooting 81 in the line in League Play Its a group thats playing like they sense the pressure of whats in front of them if they can achieve this evil now weve been seeing that around the ACC results that dont align with the standings Music thank you Music hes on the road against NC State Virginia Miami theyll go to Miami this weekend a projected nine seed the difference between winning and losing today win double buying in Greensboro you clinch a share of the ACC regular season title you lose you inch toward the Bubble look this is a group thats only lost twice dating back to the end of January but in those losses coach cable is quick to point out they need to be better defensively can they get a stop here in the final sequence in the final seconds words heaps it up almost went in would have made sense after what the first 20 had been for the Irish a motivating performance on an emotional night pick going to the locker room they got to see more fight and more focused offensively if they want to steal one on the road Notre Dame ending the first half on an 110 run holding pit without a point over the final four minutes of 15 from downtown look for Pitt to be more engaged defensively defending that threepoint line showing hard as Federico recovers well this group is gonna have to be attention to detail and defend with a sense of urgency with How the Irish were shooting drives through the contact its Ryan back iron on the three Tracked Down by good women and a fresh 20 lacheski on the drive of the finger again challenging Federico Federico closes out because the job guard like skills from Blow by finger roll finish shooting percentage striking its just very easy good looks and within the DNA of how the Irish like to approach it Henson getting going in the second half Paramount hasnt done a lot of his work Beyond New York here this evening hes been really attacking the goal but that perimeter shot going huge for the Panthers hes got a dozen his second three he had made 11 threes in his previous two games and thats way too easy for Goodman Irish just making pit defend in space and its been a struggle continues to be in the second half largest lead was 16 the stagnation from pitt Elliots gonna not Factor tonight picked up a couple of fouls in the first half Federico down low and able to get to the freethrow line with the big size advantage on Hammond and thats three of Marcus Hammond they need Hammond because hes been hot Federico continues to flirt with danger though on these catches down low he neutralized the basketball by bringing it low with his size and length keep it high Elevate hoof that thing leave nothing to chance with the smallest Defender Applause Music one out of five at the freethrow line one for six big Saturday on the ESPN networks it is a Sonic Blockbuster Kansas number three team in the country going to Texas North Carolina Duke is that a win and youre in for UNC certainly feels like it I still believe call me crazy I believe this Carolina team can go out there in Greensboro and become an AQ team by taking it when theyre locked in like they happen and shooting it well like they have been is very dangerous weve seen it happen before Blake Henson got the offensive rebound after this happens its Federico misses and he goes to the line thats an area where Pitt can exert its will Notre Dame struggles on the defensive glass they rebound 20 percent of their misses thats among the worst division one yeah and this is some pit team thats generating Second Chance opportunities need to be more punishing eight offensive rebounds only three second chance to show for it gotta start to capitalize off in second looks took eight more shots in the Irish in the first half and yet still Trail by double fingers and thats been the issue for Notre Dame theyve struggled to create those extra possessions yes they dont turn it over but Notre Dame does not get offensive rebounds they dont get a ton of steals they dont get a ton of blocks and it all generates back to theres a lack theres a lacking of toughness where the opponents been able to flex their will and decide the type of game thats going to be played weve yet to see that from pitt this evening Lubin working on the smaller burden seeing matchups being exploited whether it be the perimeter defense or a big like Loop and challenging Burton to defend down low Burton the lobby to Federico Music juice good win today playing in his School record 156th game one more than Nate lecheski theyre not going to defend Lubin out there shot clock down to 10 and theyre showing hard with Federico lumens got to demand that basketball as a dive guy theres gonna be a sense of urgency for the passer to deliver Ryan beats the shot clock no good some Bandy skies for the board I try to get Federico Federico in his mini pick and roll scenarios to find the advantage Burton down low able to draw contact and two shots coming for 85 free throw shooter and Federico right here this is pit taking advantage of the pick and roll Federico the dive Guy Burton knew all along he was going to draw two and with that LinkedIn athleticism of Federico he can deliver the ball a football reference if you will a high point that thing for the alleyoop finish Music whats jamarias Burtons case for ACC player of the year I mean at the end of the day best player on the best team do you have to go any further than that I mean thats usually how this thing works but theres guys in the fold that have had exemplary Seasons as well Isaiah Wong comes to mind what hes done here for culture as a voice turning around a team pick to finish last and right now they sit in first place its really hard to harden its really hard to argue for player of the year that hes not the player of the year is going to be the coach of the year when you asked him whos your Alpha he didnt really hesitate he said Bert and thats why I asked I wanted to know that because thats an intangible that Looms large in that conversation hes the guy whos restored the culture and fortified that Locker that matters KY catch and shoot rims out so Randy there to clean smashesky wanted that he was in Catch and Release position for Gekko Burton again against Ryan one of the best defenders in the conference Burton down low trying to bully his way in and Lubin secures the board that would have been a change in momentum quite honestly and Burke was able to complete that in isolation playing Bully bull couldnt punctual him Ryan the threetime captain Al works on the dribble Drive kicks to an open Hammond his three calls six Marcus Hammond thank you some band he got caught ball watching on the triple Drive hes ball watching he stood up hes Frozen and that allows the Baseline three that held defense was rendered useless because of a lack of intention and detail from Samantha Cummings has it stolen away Ryan ahead of the pack and the Finish Applause the lob hits the backboard Notre Dame with its largest lead and they give it back up almost and a whistle they jump ball is called possession Applause quarterback Ryan is one of the toughest guys in an Irish uniform vocal leader and exudes the toughness and here he gets the run out off of two look like a leaper there getting the easy one Music Hammond the only Notre Dame player honored before the game for senior night Ive got a lot of graduate players who all were honored a season ago guys like Goodwin and luccheski and Hammond in his final home game in an Irish uniform 16 points his season high is 19 yeah hes been huge I mean hes been the leader in activating the threepoint shot which is everyone understands it is the foundation to Notre Dames offensive success but without JJ stalling in the lineup with that knee injury it was critical somebody elevated their offensive production its been him in the lucky Lefty okay Ali Cummings driving on lejevski got the step could not get the roll gets his own rebound fighting for it underneath and two shots coming for Nelly Cummings okay but like if Im in the uniform and I wasnt nearly the player to half these guys on the floor are but Notre Dames success over the years thats unacceptable guys will be grabbing each other and saying how does a six foot guy in traffic get his own rebound and draw a foul thats the toughness thats been lacking from the Irish all season long quite frankly that low post presence and free throws not falling for Pittsburgh tonight Friday in the NBA a doubleheader Jason Tatum and the Celtics will take on the team that hit reset the Nets thats at 7 30 and then in the west he got John Moran to the John Moran to the Grizzlies taking on jokic and the Nuggets how about Jeff Capel telling us of all the players hes recruited and we said whos the best guy he said you know its hard but if youre talking about what theyre doing at the next level its easy its Jason Tatum never heard of him I mean what incredible Talent Jason Tatum is are you kidding me capable has had a pension for bringing in Talent its refreshing to see that hes gotten the talent to buying together a connected locker room and the results speak for themselves no good on the three gotta go back to the four and twelve though from the freethrow line from pitt on the road youre struggling you cant leave that kind of money on the table you simply cant and its uncharacteristic Im a team that shoots 81 from the line in conference Music Here Comes Burt driving on Lubin and theres a Thanos move Ill do it myself I love a reference look Burt needs to take it upon himself youre getting down into the second part of his second half and you need your star to elevate him getting into the painted area is huge for this stagnant pit offense to this point wow out of bounds but it stays with Notre Dame Applause and theres still a pathway back into this game for Pitt Notre Dame weve seen throughout the year theyve struggled late in games theyve struggled to close games out Pitt on the other hand has been terrific in one possession games down the stretch good one backing down Elliott does not seed ground now its Ryan fouled by Cummings his first and cummings is claiming there should have been an arm bar there for quarterback Ryan and I gotta admit I aint mad at Cummings not because he went to Colgate and hes smart but because I think he had a point Bowling Green Guy before that yeah open look good theyre just spreading it its the same thing these are wide open looks for guys who hover around 40 from three Bandy looking to drive on Lubin got Lubin in the air the Up and Under counted Music is wired to score the basketball and hes a high IQ guy as well he saw Lubin having to defend him outside he didnt beat him with that initial thrust but he knew that he would be an excited freshman and he would get a little froggy and the frog jumped and when he did sabanding the score kept his eye on the goal played through the contact Big Time play Music Applause hits a free throw pit now five of 14 from the freethrow line 10 points for Nike sabandi eight away for 1800 for his career now this is where Les schewski needs to say okay theyre putting some Bandy on me let me dunk down play with my back to the basket empty dribbling by Ryan that hit nothing but backboard and now Elliott the other way Elliott accelerates down the lane out of control Burton saves it hits it straight away open three good look did not go goes to the second chance those empty possessions devastating the best threepoint look off an offensive rebound amidst chaos and Henson cant convert been a theme tonight Pitts got 10 offensive rebounds only six second chance points yeah if you gotta capitalize on these looks Irish are vulnerable on a glass Hammond with 18 hey is two hes its its just too easy its a quintessential Irish offensive performance when theyre dangerous exporting matchups and playing in space Music my Cummins theyll drive on Goodwin gets tied up held ball is the call possession arrow Notre Dame Jeff cable wants a foul a lot of contact there from Dean Goodwin take another look Cummings thought he had him on his hip thats a foul thats a fair amount thats unbelievable yeah coach cable hat tip for remaining composed on that one that was egregious meanwhile setting the heart screen on sabandi and contact down low Music they get a foul on oh man hes flying and those are the pit Notre Dame matchups from the early 2000s that I recall that was expected sequence in those games games played differently now but look Lots on the line as theyre expected and played tough lets see it Notre Dame just 2 and 16 in League Play theyve lost seven in a row pit meanwhile in first place by itself in the ACC ranked for the first time in seven years Music Panthers with a win would secure a double by the ACC tournament and clinch at least a share of the regular season title as lacheski draws the foul and a technical foul issued by John Gaffney tour the pit bench that rocking chair would look great in our new house a new house all his beef was that they called Blake Henson for a foul on that Nate leszewski drive that was a foul cable gets teed up and so far everything that can go wrong has gone wrong and look it was a foul from Hinson it was a right whistle it was stewing though from coach Capel because there was the egregious foul on a Cummings Drive where he was Bear hooked by Dane Goodwin and I think once you start getting those juices flowing where you feel like youre not getting the whistle sometimes you dont see things clearly on this side however youre trailing by 17 with everything on a line I do believe coach capels got to be more in control to not allow any more points given up by losing is cool you and I called Florida State Miami over the weekend we saw Florida State make the biggest comeback in the history of the ACC are you riding pit off right now or is there still an Avenue back into this game its still an Avenue because look Notre Dame has struggled to close games out all season long I mean theyve been a losing group this year call it what it is youre looking at the team thats atop of the ACC right now so 19 is a hefty deficit when I was in South Florida with you and we saw what happened there tell me why not for Pitt tonight Irish he has been more stoic and reserved than usual tonight seasons taking a a toll on Coach you know me and Coach have a great relationship Im lucky as a former player you hope to have that with your coach as you grow older its been difficult he did not expect this season to be what it is with the amount of Veteran experience that was returning and despite the fact they cant really figure out why obviously defensive struggles but they never expected us to have a foul is uh Notre Dame away from the ball you got to tell folks the pitch that Mike Bray made to you to convince you to keep your commitment to notice so we made references to Capel and pray and their connection from Duke Coach capable played with one of the alltime greats in Grant Hill when coach break came over from Delaware with that Duke background he said to me you remind me of Grant Hill I said Seoul its the first time the only time coach braylin oh yeah lets see he knew the right way to convince you just got to butter up that cornet ego we laugh about it all the time coach has had a lot of great talents however I was not one that turned into Grant Hill unfortunate for everybody in the Notre Dame champions you had a heck of a career and you were part of his early teams Mike Bray had instant success the minute he got to South Bend three NCAA tournament Burns in his first three seasons Boy free throws incredible have just derailed Pitt and we get a foul on Federico pit tonight five of 16 for the line totally out of character I will say for Notre Dame something you got to start to worry about this is not a deep team yeah word says three fouls Ryans got three Hammond has three and Goodwin has three I mean the clock is only ticking and its a 20point game pit needs to start digging in and getting stopped stacking them quickly Music over Federico offline its a great Challenge from Federico that time he was locked in hand in the face challenged the offer puts it on the floor sweeps to the Lane Great sequence gotta stop played fast they have the ability to do this Notre Dame when theyve been punched we havent seen too many counter punches this season the lead is 18 and an entanglement on the perimeter and another foul against pip thats on hits him thatll be his third I believe Music 15 points nine rebounds for Henson its been trying to try to be disruptive with a good win here Music no extracurricular activity no whistle shot clock at 10 Ryan drives on Federico got the step missed the bunny the length clearly bothersome as quarterback Brian got to the ring Burton now the other way kicks it out to sebandi on the drive strong to the 10 thats going to be the method now now youve got those driving lanes youve had some success cleaner looks from three will open up and then this offense for Pitt returns to being dynamic Federico guarding good win it comes back to works less than 10 to shoot Notre Dame again working deep into the shot clock with a big lead Ryan a long three does not go theres Hinson Mandy will push how to attack if youre pit continue with that initial thrust of early offense getting downhill there comes Burton dipping Federico had the rebound its knocked out of bounds but a foul against Notre Dame right here on the floor lets see who they call it on yeah it is good win and that is number four right here Burt does a good job of getting to the rim and just out something Im in this sequence Federico fighting down low the loose ball Fallon Federicos got to convert here from the line Federico oh for three at the line Applause Mike gray putting Ben Allen Lubin back in and if youre Notre Dame you got to clean up the defensive rebounding thats where Pitt can get back into this game and theyve made some Headway there Irish also need to get back defensively that early offense its no longer a pitfilling Lanes looking for the three and saying how tough are you in the painted area because were on our way there for layups Pence kidding both free throws good a lot of points left on the board by Pitt at the free throw line but Federico gets those two Music the Irish lead is 14 they led by as many as 20 its worth almost trapped now its Ryan leaning in not there gets his own rebound worse the three boom its Kevin stating per pit you built another stop and you give up a second chance in a clean threepoint look and its 17 once again Applause Federico sets the screen for Burton looking for the lob and a turnover I dont like the body language from pitt Island I havent seen this group as connected as theyve been theyre not talking to each other they look a little dear in headlights the Spurs won a lot of games by being connected like to see these guys huddle up look at each other and build that belief right now it looks like theyre just gas from trying to defend in space for the majority of this evening the BandAid went for the Steal picks up the foul Music you dont often see this many fouls called in a game featuring Notre Dame no and its again its because of the chaotic out of sorts defense that the Panthers have been time I mean theyre chasing the Closeouts theyre getting blown by and theyre reaching its a Panthers team thats desperate to figure out a way to Halt this Notre Dame offense Music there is an issue with the scoreboard were told Music foreign the scoreboard had six fouls and that was seventh foul so it is a bonus situation that was the issue Music words of 75 free throw shooter Notre Dame last year such a great threepoint shooting team and you know theyve been down worse has been part of that a guy who was 40 plus the previous three years down to 33 percent this year these are highly skilled guys and what youre seeing from Notre Dame is the shot making ability has elevated them to dig in and guard a little bit show a side of toughness thats been severely lacking this season but four of those Five Guys on the floor can be deadly from Beyond The Arc Cummings only two points no assists he came into the game third in the conference in helpers Elliots not been a factor either a clock at eight so banding all by himself able to draw the foul Goodwin was in the area but it will be on Lubin I like the pit Panthers in attack mode the threepoint shot just hasnt it hasnt got going tonight but what they have been able to do is get to the rim and draw a thousand for Notre Dame games to be historically fast because theres not a lot of fouls starting to hear the whistle a lot here down the stretch Applause bro unbelievable Music these are good free throw shooters at some point there might be some conspiracy theories out there that did something to the rims here for Coach Brays final game because this is uncharacteristic of the panther s well Notre Dames 12 out of 14 from the line so Bandy gets that one hes three out of six tonight eight for 20 at the free throw line thats a lot of bonus points anymore Music words now Hammond everybody not there Federico the rebound hes taken into the basket draw those fouls hes gonna try to attack does that that is the ammo now for pick they know Notre Dame doesnt have death they know Notre Dame has a number of players in foul trouble it is Attack Mode you can see some Bandy he saw blood in the water and when he got that basketball coming across the timeline it was like okay hes gonna see if they can keep him in front they have not been able to in the second half that was four on words Ryan Hammond and Lubin Lubin all have three so if youre Notre Dame you know this you know theres not depth you know you have guys in foul trouble play it defensively well now if youre offensive in your pit you attack even more because you know you have a pension for drawing that whistle the Irish has to be more disciplined and to make him meet a chess and Retreat that first offensive effort needs to be elevated and weve not seen multiple efforts from them guarding so far in the second half and again thats something that implied the Irish all season Applause right now seven to shoot Ryan down low to Lubin against Federico ground big loose ball sabandi wrestles it away and called for the travel Savannahs got to understand you cannot get up with the basketball not forced air and this Unstoppable Irish offense this evening well get another go we return here in South Bend that rocking chair would look great they got all the little debris off the court Bracketology in the ACC man this league has taken a beating with perception nationally even within the league pits a team that is leading the conference there are projected nine seed and the yin and yang of tonight if they win Joel and already says they are a lock no matter what happens from here on out if they lose but sudden now you either got to beat Miami or win one in Greensboro to feel safe on selection Sunday on the drive able to draw the foul good job from luccheski onto triple drive to absorb that contact the shezewsky at his size hes never out of control when he had used that head fake and gets downhill he plays within himself and good footwork to draw contact and avoid a charge from Federico Federico third foul on Federico lashesky an 87 percent free throw shooter all right Applause free throw disparity tonight Notre Dame 13 out of 15 pit 10 for 22 Applause Music Federico with a twohanded slam 6852 less than seven minutes to play here at Purcell Pavilion Applause Music Lubin great position the basket counts and a free throw coming impressive delivery from cornback Ryan to not force to wait for the moment where the defense defense vulnerable Federal Recon Burton and he waits to draw them both allows the big and Lumen to be settled on that low block to catch and finish putting the freshman in position to succeed as a dive guy Music and the Irish theyre on their way to one of their best offensive outputs all season Cummings fouled on a threepoint shot by Lubin thats four on the freshman and three shots coming theres your freshman mistake Music now Cummings is another one Jordan he came into the game 48 out of 55 from the line of the season missed is only two tonight these are these are Big if you want to try to claw your way back in you gotta have all three Applause talk to Jeff Caple last week when we had pitted Georgia Tech he was worried about this game given all the hysteria all the noise the emotions of this being Mike Brays final home game he said yeah going to play Notre Dame under those circumstances is different and far more challenging look Id love to say youre playing for pride every time you step on the floor theres an element to that but beyond that the Irish had nothing to play for for a lions share this season because of how poorly it went and how fast it went there this is one of the moments where they could say all right lets get motivated our crowds gonna show up and lets win one for the guy that brought us here to South Bend and youve seen them Cummings gets all three with a shirtless Mike Bray being waved in his face Ill tell you the Irish arent in the clear six and a half minutes left is a lot of basketball especially with how explosive this Panthers offense can be but they have to go Music so good for Notre Dame Ammon has 18 points shot clock winding down crosses over Federico and hes got 20 his high in a Notre Dame uniform Federico Federico defending a point Burton blocked by luceski gets it back and draws the foul on the shesky thats only the second uh Nate leschewski I mean this is Federico Federico trying to be in a stance I mean a crossover the space without a RICO to his credit did all he could to extend the hand in a late contest but Hammonds looking his chops in that matchup Applause another missed free throw by Pitt 13 out of 26 for a team that shoots better than 80 percent of the line in conference Applause wow Music its an 85 free throw shooter I mean crochet cable Im just trying to read his his emotion on the side angel shook his head and said wow what else can you say the previous two games Pitt was 38 out of 42 with the strike its insane with 38 out of 42 in the previous two games and tonight 13 out of 27 6927 thats 14 points its an 18point game Music his third Music that sums it up doesnt it its all going right for the Irish Music you had to know something was weird in the air when we arrived on campus and it was 60 degrees on the first day of March and the Sun was shining that should have maybe been to tell that somethings a little off here in town Cummings three rebounded by Federico foul down low its on Goodwin and thats five Music Dane Goodwin against a welldeserved Round of Applause as the crowd comes to his feet celebrating his accomplishments fiveyear career nobody has played more games for Notre Dame in the history of Irish basketball a coachs son from the suburbs of Columbus wild manner guy scratch golfer just a a good representative of this University and he never expected whats happened this season but as you reflect on whats been a fiveyear career a lot for him to be proud of in front of this home crowd thank you all right took me on a golf course and it was Uncle how ugly hes a scratch call you do the rest Applause Music Hammond has 20 points tonight to lead all scorers turns it over its a kick and clear kick from Federico no call so Bandy driving on Lubin a basket plus one bit not going the way yet 7458 449 left in the free throw for Savannah love the mentality from Savannah again gets it matched up against the big and Lubin he goes into Attack Mode hes done a great job and also good was found out Lubin is fouled out Robbie caught it Music comedy along with Cormac Ryan lacheski wurtz and Hammond and outside of Matt Zona theres really no reliable depth out Robbie Carmody hasnt scored a basket since when Anish December 4th 2020 its a heck of a spot to throw a young man like that in because of attrition in the final five minutes against the best team in the ACC 16 point lead for Notre Dame theyve led by as many as 20 Music Applause Irish led by 14 at the break shot clock down to five Hammond puts it on the floor ran into an ambush words lets it fly airball and here comes Pitt birds have one place Burton looking to go to work on Orion draws the contact no whistle basket good and the lead is 14 for Notre Dame here we go Music Applause Music a timeout called for the Irish Notre Dames got two timeouts left can the Irish close one out or does pit have a big comeback left Geico has been offering save Ryan Humphrey who played and coached with Mike Brae lafonzo Ellis one of the alltime greats his number hangs in the rafters our colleague the gentle giant he had all sorts of travel Logistics to get here but he wanted to be here for Mike Brays final I wonder why because Vons is one of the best human beings to ever live didnt play for Bray Fonz likes to stay out of the out of the spotlight here at Notre Dame despite the fact that his jerseys in the Raptors and he means everything to the program but he texts me and said just wanted to be here to support because it truly is a Brotherhood turnover by Notre Dame sabandi thundering down Court driving to the basket no good but he is fouled and two shots coming for Nikes super Music quite over yet Music everyone gets a BK Stacker well thats what Notre Dames doing foul Trouble Is Real Goodwin Lubin both the fouled out Hammond picked up his fourth before we went to break words has four fouls JJ Starling is out tonight theres only 3 35 left youve got a 14 point lead can the Irish bring this Marlin to shore I did not have Hemingway on the bingo card late but much respect here from a former English major I guess its not former Im just an English major uh look if if pit can generate stops like they put together continue to get downhill Vernon from the freethrow line without time moving off the clock this thing can get to single digits here quick and then you never know lead was 20 earlier in this half its down to 12 three and a half to go on the floor for Notre Dame Wertz lachesky Hammond Matt Zona and Cormac Ryan the Irish gonna work some clock it appears before they try and get along Applause 10 words thought about it now gets free from 18 hits the back iron that looked to be a foul no call now they call it at first glance it looked like Zona had pushed off the called against Pitt 305 to go Cummings with his third a whole lot of contact on this loose ball that is clearly hinted with his left hand grabbing Jersey body everything and no whistle it was Henson what they call the foul on Cummings they got the second guy and now lishesky an 87 free throw shooter to the line where hes now four and five tonight and if youre in the iron if youre an Irish fan youre almost appreciative its not Zona that they called the guy being they didnt call the Fallon Hinson on Zona but it puts Nate lesevsky at the free throw line a much better shooter Zona has not attempted a free throw this season Applause foreign Cummings over Zona hits thats a three Jeff Capel wanted a foul no foul is called we get a Timeout on the floor 7665 253 to go and cummings believe that Zona got into his space and didnt allow him to land Music hes right hes right got in there 100 Music Notre Dame this season has had four games where they landed by at least 10 points and lost they led by 14 at the break they led by 20 in the second half tonight Pitt has trimmed it 211 with less than three minutes to go so if youre going old man in the sea youd almost call this The Scarlet Letter for the Irish Squad thats Hawthorne not Hemingway but were just going with some of the greats right uh its like this group no question its in the back of their mind meanwhile some Panthers team desperate desperate to earn that tournament birth for the first time since 16 and also to clinch the share in the regular season title Notre Dame nearly turned it over pressure by pit up ahead to lasheski as the Irish clear Applause theyre going to use up a lot of clock here as we get to two and a hook left in regulation Music nine to shoot Works into the corner lachesky they still play keep away shot clock at three Ryan against Federico dips in dips under and scores theyre gonna have to review that to see if it got off in time before Matt Ryan its going to be close but again he saw Federico as the defender and his eyes got big and he attacked the rim did he get it off in time Anish stay tuned Applause Armstrong part of this his team astero kept it quick kept it moving because it feels like weve been here for three hours tonight and Coach Bradys last ball game hes going to keep the South Bend crowd around for one last hurray and then hes gonna go to go down the linebacker afterwards are you going you made a lot of references are you in listen it was a big story yesterday am I going no Im too old for the standing in a place where I cant move my shoulders and run away Im with you Im also caring with respect to the folks who go Im carrying around a lot more weight than you at least you can be uh mobile if you will in there and you got a great Turtle back on thatll play huge at linebacker I figured theres gonna be a bunch of six eight six nine guys there 510 sort of gets lost in the shuffle thank you Zona picked up his first foul both teams in the double bonus gray said yesterday theres no curfew today and we look ahead of the final games of the regular season Saturday for Pitt they go to Miami Pitt still could have a chance at an ACC regular season title with a win on Saturday even if they lose tonight theres some wonky tie Breakers involved and then youve got NC State and Clemson that is a must win for Clemson which is on the wrong side of the bubble yeah Notre Dame has an opportunity if they can play spoiler here to continue that Trend now theyre in Greenville excuse me Clemson South Carolina fly into Greenville which is a great time two minutes to go 11 point lead for Notre Dame and words is fouled by Cummings so two shots for Trey Wertz 75 free throw shooter Music Applause Music now the difference tonight its been free throws Notre Dame 18 out of 21 hit 18 out of 34 Music Applause Mike Brays final home game as Notre Dames head coach 23 Seasons at the helm more wins than any other mens basketball coach in school history 13 NCAA tournaments two Elite Eights and an ACC Championship Cummings drives on Zona and rattles in quick basket for Pitt quick timeout by Jeff Capel still an 11 point game with 151 left foreign Music 482 wins Digger Phelps second on that list in attendance tonight as he is for most Notre Dame home games and if you think of the program that Bray and Heritage Digger had a great run when he was here for 20 years that through the 90s Notre Dame hit a downturn and Mike gray helped resuscitate a program that was beat up and beat down you were a part of that you were here pretty much from the beginning you got here in Mike Rays second season Im glad you get to see it at the end as a former Notre Dame forward well thank you Anish my buddy I appreciate that from you and look its what was alluring to me about this University and this program was they were on the verge of returning and all the tradition obviously starts with football theres some rich tradition here in basketball thanks to Digger Phelps in his 20 years and I wanted to be a part of that and Im very proud of 23 years the coach has had here in the play Rolling four years of that its been pretty special and its kind of cool to tie it in with the Pitt Panthers uh program that I had such a great you know respect for because we had some battles from a one to o5 in the p in here at the Choice Center as well whiskey with five to shoot now its words felt like the dagger if it went in instead of rebound by Henson still slightly ajar for Pitt Cummings will fire and hit 80 to 72 113 to go full court press and now the foul I dont think that was intentional and it also felt like a premature whistle and Cormac Ryan might have initiated a contact lower in the Boom in distress Applause Music and heres a look Nelly Cummings ready catch pump fake to get worse off of his back and delivers quick three points and its still interesting here in a final 69 seconds Ryan 80 percent at the line four for four tonight Music all right Jeff Capel still barking at the officials Music the lead is 10 with 109 to go timeout is called Notre Dame has one left Pitt has one left Applause whats Jeff cable telling his team what is the end game strategy here youre down 10 with a little over a minute you know try and get something quick drive and kick or drive and finish then try and generate some uh in the back court try and generate a turnover initiate a trap if you dont have something you gotta foul quick theyre gonna try and get something going downhill you dont need a three obviously itd be nice if they have a driving lane and its quick were gonna finish that layup theyre ideally going to look for Drive collapse that defense kick out to all these great shooters clock will start when Cummings picks it up Cummings has scored the last nine for Pitt driving down the lane throws it up wildly and a foul is called and now the crowd starting to get frustrated its been a lot of his calls theres been a lot of whistles tonight Cummings on a drive lets go nowhere in the contact is is coming from now that foul called on Robbie Carmody these last five minutes have been moving at a snails pace a lot of stoppage in play Music they inbounded the ball with 109 a chance to get two points with only four seconds off the clock they want to try and make this final 65 seconds the longest 65 Nick can hear some Music Notre Dame this season eight losses in conference by five points or less Applause Music called on Hinson is walking away from the pack and you can tell his fists were clenched trying not to betray any emotion and Henson needs to watch out the theatrics wont play well hes been teetering on the line here this evening so words at the free throw line four fouls on Henson Cummings in Federico have four as well Music 10point game 105 to go Music Cummings has scored 11 straight for Pitt no bailout foul this time its knocked back Harman hes got it Pitt wants a jump ball and the call is a foul on pick and some Burton and Robbie Corbett into the freethrow line looking for his first points more than two years Applause young mans dealt with a lot of injuries over his career never had a chance to take off like he would at home its been a pretty cool moment for this young man cant get that one missed most of his freshman year with a left shoulder injury tore his left ACL while rehabbing he suffered a broken kneecap missed them both played in one game last year Burton the other way uncontested 8476 and now a steal sabandis got it over Carmody batted around out of bounds it stays with pit 434 on the clock nothing has come easy for Notre Dame this season including the final minutes of this one and they might go review this one to make this one last a little bit longer it definitely looks like it was out of bounds on either that was Hammond or not straight Works whos gonna get a hand on this ultimately and guided out of bounds not sure you saw enough there to overturn it the original call was out of bounds on Notre Dame pit basketball coach Bray said theres no curve for you tonight thankful for a lot of people are looking to imbibe this evening over at linebacker because theyre gonna be getting a late start over there with the with this one extending and extending and extending now we might not be out of here for another 45 minutes Notre Dame had a 19 point lead with 5 38 to go pit has cut it to eight three times but has not gotten closer Music Cummins to inbound its Burton hell fire from deep and it rolls in the three is good 8479 two possession game 38 seconds to go how much gas does Notre Dame have in the tank wurtz up ahead the timeline and he is fouled Henson was in proper position to actually take that charge but the foul came well before the contact between words and Henson but I like that idea from Edson thats now four on sebandi its just a tough shot a step back to create space gathers and delivers the tough shot for Bert good defense better offense Music you and I have seen some things in the last few days Saturday we saw Florida State Rally from 25 down in the second half Notre Dame LED this one by 20 in the second half Applause I mean its officially March these are the kind of outcomes you expect pressure bus pipes teams get tight wild things happen word stays perfect at the line tonight 679 Applause another three Federico has the offensive rebound back to Burton hell drive ships up ahead to words drops it off Applause foreign Applause Music didnt want to extend this one any longer dump down to quarterback Ryan the home and it looks like the Irish may actually close one out here late something may have been unable to do and clearly the emotion of Coach Grays last time out here on the sidelines gave them the extra hope they needed to deliver a few seconds added to the clock pursell Pavilion to its feet Cummings has the easy Lane 92 seconds left Mike Bray watching his final home game is Notre Dames mens basketball coach Applause but Mike Bray leaves South Bend a winner in his final home game against the top 25pick team and Anish I got to tell you great respect for obviously all programs is some emotions bleed out on the floor you dont want to see any
