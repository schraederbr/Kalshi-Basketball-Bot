Music having a hot start for Coach Kevin Keats 10th ever match up Charleston Southern and NC State and lets get this party started CLA Aubry our lead official with the tip Trey Sans and Mark schneur here at PNC Arena these teams havent met since the co pandemic back in Reynolds Coliseum so a new match up here in PNC and on the opening possession Taj Kelly with an early Miss against DJ Burns thats a big matchup coming in thats a matchup theyre going to try to exploit because Kelly he initiates a lot of offense from the top you see there he kind of gets a little bit of a cross screen to get a post touch but hell do a lot of dribble handoffs and bu uh hell pull DJ uh Burns away from the basket DJ Burns comes in 14 points a night and Uber efficient nice dime there to diara who couldnt hit the three and a defensive board here for Charleston Southerns DJ Patrick the USF transfer worth noting in this lineup Taj Kelly 15point a game scorer and RJ Johnson thats its a tough guard for any team Kelly Now One V one with Burns gets to the bucket and couldnt hit it thats an advantage the bark R ball wants to exploit tonight Burns defensively yeah they want him to take it off the bouns but I think they want a little bit more movement get the ball moving a little bit more side to side get a pain touch and share it around and too easy for Di on the foot back and thats what they brought him in for is hes high energy always giving the wolf pack some extra possession so youll see that a lot tonight Mohamed diara doubles in his first two outings really good on the boards Kevin Kats has been pleased with his effort on the glass this pressure defense of the wolf pack has caused opponents trouble in the first two games just over 14 turnovers a night as Reggie doart comes up short on the jumper they just got to do a little bit better job of getting in offensive scoring positions theyre starting so far out and then theyre not getting the ball moving side to side you got to you got to start to share the ball if youre going to think youre going to break them down with the bounce its going to be a long night Mar Ross said ball possessions important we cant commit High turnover numbers and Kevins Keith Club back to his UNC Wilmington days they love to force mistakes top three in the ACC last year in forcing turnovers and youll see this Twan game right here an awful lot these are two of their better players two of their better scorers so youll see it lot possessions late in the clock calling bank I guess it is open on a Friday night I guess it is but Ive always said Ill take them however I can get them so well take one two and three good news Scott in your career 334 trip here at NC State youre very familiar with hitting the three well I dont know how many I banked I can promise you that probably less than 300 well put it that way TJ Burns operating the offense here for State Crush off a big performance 84 points a week ago against abalene Christian with four and double figures as Taylors left all alone with the shot fake thats good patience you know they got they got a couple possessions on one side and then they moved it you know a little bit of breakdown in the defense but a good 15footer theyre going to take that all night Charles Southern comes in with two nondivision one wins and a lost to North Florida at home first road contest for the Buccaneers tonight as Kelly in attack mode he lost it and thats a turnover for CSU bleay Raba head coach for Charleston Southerns now the alltime active coach in terms of total wins in the Big South picked eighth in the preseason and this is a club that lost a Boston College transfer and claudell Harris a latch transfer and a transfer to Cornell theres some big pieces gone for CSU yeah now obviously they they lost a lot but they brought some stuff in and you know talking with him earlier it was almost a breath of fresh air you know he didnt really want to set expectations he just wanted to get 20 things from the game today that was positive so that they could go over it on film that will not be one of the 20 an easy layup there for DJ Burns who tormented Charleston Southern when he was at winra both Big South squads thats why I think Jaden Taylor really aggressive especially with the ball hes able to create and hes also a good willing passer Kelly on the attack the point Center going to work and thats a nice job drawing the foul and thats the matchup on the offensive end with Burns but defensively this is worth noting for NC State in five games at win he was dominant nearly a double double a night and in that last outing two years ago 22 and 11 he was hard to stop yeah the picture looks a little different than uh than him now but you know hes had success there uh I think its going to be interesting with him and Kelly going back and forth very key for both of their teams obviously him being on the perimeter forcing DJ to come out a little bit especially on the defensive end uh but theyre going to have their hands full all night with him down low this is Taj Kelly the junior out of Atlanta who is preseason all big South if there is one player to watch tonight Kelly could be it he had 18 and five and win over Johnson and Wales out of Charlotte little known fact there are six Johnson and Wales Academy as a culinary school I will also tell you go back and watch the Northern Florida game the first possession of the game and youll see a really good highlight of him goes one and one on the free throw so were all even four a piece during the media timeout Jaden Taylor what a nice crossover and draws the contact Savage did a really good job of pressuring and I think coach is telling him here he said you got them where you want him just try not to give him that straight line drive and thats what Jaden Taylor does you know he gets to the free throw line uh last game against ABN Christian almost got there for double digits from the free throw line and knocked them all down so again off to a really great start tonight so Jaden Taylor heads to the free throw line and weve noted his threepoint shooting hes been next throw at the free throw line as well now 10 of 13 in the first three games State as a club at 75 as DJ Burns takes the Breather and Ben met Brooks the Clemson transfer comes in and this is one of the things especially with this Kevin Keat team theres so much depth there so hes going to get guys in and out and so they can pressure this is exactly what they want to do you know talking with Coach barklay one of the things is how are we going to handle their pressure it was the big thing that he was a little bit concerned about when they get up into us how are we going to handle it and last season NC State led the ACC in forcing turnovers that number was actually at 14 a game this year so on a similar trajectory yeah and this this is how they transition into offense you know they get stops live ball turnovers and theyre able to push it and get easy baskets out in transition heres the Stanford transfer Michael oconnell with his first touch against a zone defense how does this change things for Charleston sou you know I actually I I like it cuz you know obviously DJ Burns isnt in the game but it just it puts you back on your toes especially if youre not expecting it well take the timeout onepoint game early Buccaneers and Wolfpack well have more after this we talk forever Music about head coach Kevin Keats made NC stay back in the NCAA tournament last year and this is a club that was very good in Fast Break points forcing turnovers and thats fied this impressive stretch 15 in the last 17 at home yeah and I think one of the things well well probably get to quite a bit is you know missing Jarel Joiner and chavon Smith two really good all act performers for them so how are they going to kind of supplement especially on the scoring end so far a lowscoring first half NC State two of seven from the field Casey morsel out of the timeout cant hit the jumper thats a great Baseline out of out of bounds play right there especially to get Casey that good of a look wow the block from behind diara with the rejection nice find to diara and feed the big man running the lane great effort on both ends and and thats what you love to see good Baseline out of bounds play but he gets back on defense with the block shot and then he hustles he doesnt just sit there and you know show his chest and how good he is but he just gets back able to get there and get fouled and get two free throw so just the extra effort and again were going to be a broken record but thats what he brings to this team and he brings that effort each and every night and those are the fast break type of points that Kevin Keats wants from this offense emphasizing speeding things up this year yeah and its not a live ball turnover which is ultimately what they want to get but able to block a shot get the rebound and really push it tiarra does go one of two and now DJ horn will reenter the Raleigh native returns and then they get into that kind of 221 Zone press here which is something youre going to see all night and again were going to going to have to see them handle the pressure before they kind of lit off of it a little bit Charleston Southern 15 turnovers in a loss to North Florida last week their lone division one game able to handle the Press there does eat up about 10 seconds of the shot clock heres s suler oh it kicks to Hutchinson and a nice break for the Buccaneers good bucket yeah very friendly break but again you just see the active hands being able to tip passes when theyre in the half court OK Connell gets to his spot and able to hit that what a nice debut these first two weeks for the Stanford transfer yeah I believe he led this led the team in scoring the first week uh but again hes just one of those guys that does everything right and again you just see the pressure getting to him you just got to kind of take your time get across half court and get into your set and we asked the strength coach Pat Murphy who would babysit your children on a road trip and he said okon will be that guy you know I I I would go with that he looks like a you know very trustworthy Ive got two kids at home so if he is looking for uh some job opportunities I might have to take advantage of that Michael pursuing his Masters and he was a lacrosse commit at a high school then stayed with basketball down the stretch good decision for the folks here in Raleigh as we enter week two of the basketball season horn on the lob to Burns and thats just too easy for DJ thats just great Patience by DJ horn you know they can run a little bit of an Iverson cut into a side pick and roll action he just kind of holds it and waits for the drop to come uh and then passes it to DJ to DJ to the third DJ Collin is a 10second violations rung off well I told him to be patient but maybe not that patient here you just see them holding it probing they dont get a tag on the backside and theyre just both patient like a quick media timeout here early with NC State up four welcome back here inside PNC Arena DJ Burns has entered into an elite conversation here at NC State based off his performance against abalin Christian he has now made enough shots to qualify for the alltime field goal percentage records now he has a season to go of course but at 56 hes entering some elied territory here at NC State yeah I mean hes on a great list uh to be on I think to move up to second we decided you know he needs to go seven for seven tonight uh but with him and DJ horn in the pick and roll and how patient they both were uh that might be that might be here quicker than we think 204 career field goals for Burns whos two for two tonight and here we go this is a little bit of 131 this is something that they do to just throw him off balance but again just great patience good shot and Parker on the second chance couldnt hit horn tries to save it and falls into the buccaneer bench and thats the one I think if they can get those open shots theyre eventually going to knock those down but again I think thats what C uh CSU wants they want him to take threes DJ Burns passing is a growing ability for him Elite passer and I think thats the one thing you know I keep calling it The Point Center uh but hes willing to pass thats why it makes it a lot uh more difficult to guard him because he will pass and then oconnell throws his body on the line hes called for the foul just the pardon me the kick ball not the foul one team foul for NC State a Charleston Southern team that was picked eighth in the Big South but they love this Frontline Talent as the three is off officials conferring here and itll stay with Charleston Southern a Buccaneer team thats pushed the pace in yearss past 75 points a game last year have been explosive in the two wins and Barkley rabal wants to push the pace yeah its two teams that want to play really fast and NC States going to try and press to get them to slow down but I think if they can control that press they can kind of push it and get some good looks thats the fifth Buccaneer turnover NC State has yet to give up the rock so far I think he was open and he was just uh maybe a second late getting uh Kelly the ball down low listen to this crowd Burns goes to work deep Three Horn unable to hit the wolf Packer 0 three from downtown 41 uh threepoint shooter but again I think thats one where you can maybe get the ball going a little bit more side to side and you can always get that at any time in The Possession thats a contested three for Lewis Hutchinson Nice Shot for the Rhode Island transfer yeah and I dont think hes shot well uh that great on the year but hes a really good attacker and again anytime you see one going early its going to give him a lot of confidence especially going forward Charleston Southern is a team only 38 from Deep heres another three for NC State well off ok Connell on the glass and he gets the foul late attacking the basket thats going to be big for NC State tonight yeah and a lot of it results of off of offensive rebounds you know I think if NC States going to continue to shoot this many threes I think theyre kind of bailing Charleston Southern out a little bit you know I like them attacking getting to the rim very similar to what Jaden Taylor was doing early in the game because it it puts charlest and Southern on their heels a little bit as o Connell hits his first Kevin Kats will like the free throw shooting this year 78 in the first two plus games its early in the year here be look at some of the best teams in the country Villanova right now 88 as a team for the first four games anytime you can be flirting with that 80 number especially as a team is uh is pretty solid especially when you get in the crunch time and you need to close out games here comes the ball pressure from the wolf pack five turnovers forced early dirh har sneaks one through to Johnson now Johnson an attack mode nice jumper and thats what I think they can do especially if they beat the initial press thats when they can attack and play a little bit quicker and get downhill and get a good bucket RJ Johnson All Conference transfer to Holy Cross had to replace big shoes claudo Harris is a double digit score at pit this year wow nice job holding the pivot foot there layup for NC State yeah Id have to see the the replay he he may have dragged it a little bit but again if theyre not going to call it uh it works out for him but again the attack mode thats what I want to see him do get the ball downhill and then you can uh then you can start to shoot threes thats the chaa slide with a couple of DJs on the court heres Parker on the lob ahead nice transition layup for horn and how about NC State creating off the turnover yeah those live ball turnovers if youre going to turn it over throw it out of bounds so then you can they have to run a half court set theyre much better when they can attack with a live ball turnover and this is NC State taking advantage in transition uh Tommy burlson were all there and you could see the emotion on their face and anytime you have a teammate that you suit up with you go to war you got to know uh and arguably the most important time in your life when youre 17 to 22 you know its like a brother so um you know great player for that team and uh hes going to be missed by many that National Championship Banner hangs in this Arena and his teammate David Thompson in attendance tonight you see they are part of the history here at NC State and certainly a loss that will hang heavy here in the hearts of the wolf pack faithful good moment of silence before the game too wolf pack starting to pull ahead here up five in this first half searching for a three and0 start diara tries a three typically in his bag in an offensive board thats six now for NC State yeah hes made a few um on the year but again I just think get the ball inside first and then well start to work our way out look at DJ fading away and again thats just where you got to you know tap him on the back and say good shot because that was really good defense but just phenomenal Touch by the big man DJ Burns always brings this crowd to life and Raleigh and now a 10second violation thats two committed by Charleston Southern yeah I mean theyre theyre being patient but NC States just doing a good job of being long athletic keeping the ball in front of him and here you just see that touch hes able to use his body create space fade away and nothing but nylon how does he contort the ball into a shooting motion here well the hard part is hes actually spinning the wrong way the normal way would be for him to go the other way he actually spins back into the defender bumps him off a little bit and creates space so I mean it just shows the touch and the footwork that he has Burns who grow up ambid extras loves going left but hes got that right hand too how about this step back for Taylor unable to hit this is a crucial twominute stretch here for Charleston Southern twominute scoring drought and Johnson draws the foul on horn I think thatll help him as well especially anytime they can get the stop get the rebound it doesnt allow NC State to get in the Press thats one way to kind of avoid those turnovers is to get good defensive possessions and finish with the rebound in this scoring stretch three turnovers in the two minutes and then no points if youre Barkley rall just passed Eddie Beach for the longest 10year Big South coach coming on 20 years here in the spring he calls basketball a lifelong Mission motivating these young men as Johnsons pass is tipped Taylor wants to run here and diara couldnt squeeze it Kevin Keats wants a foul hes not going to get it in a turnover yeah it looked like they may have had his his hand around his waist there in the transition uh but were just seeing this activity from this NC State roster all of them active hands when they pick up the dribble showing hands and making the the pass tough and both coaches are begging for holds right now its like Jim Harbaugh on the Michigan sideline begging for a foul well Im Im begging for one too even when I didnt get touched so I expect that to be all night this is a 60 NC State run since the media here up in Caleb Clinton turns it over that is 10 turnovers for Charleston Southern Taylor lost it on the way up but see thats what you got to do even if you turn it over Sprint back create something tough they get their own turnover able to push it and this is the shot that theyll take all night nice Corner three for DJ Patrick theres more than one DJ in the building tonight yeah and its easy to always put your head down especially after those turnovers thats the one thing I love to see especially you know theyve turned the ball over quite a bit tonight but again just Sprint back try to force a tough shot we have a timeout here diara has to walk over to the bench hell need some attention from the training staff as Middlebrooks comes in thatll be something to watch here in this first half yeah and I know the the nice part especially with this depth that NC state has you know theyve had you know some few nicknack injuries especially in the past so they are a little bit deeper but again somebody of that caliber you really dont want to see go down Music you think back to the Manny bats injury of two years ago that was in game one it was crucial for eny stay certainly not hoping that tonight for diaro but keep tabs on it as morcel goes into his bag and comes up short and thats exactly they go back to that 131 and thats what they want him to do they want you to play that isolation basketball and take tough contested pullups the Buccaneers can afford more turnovers 10 giveaways in this first half as backup point guard Alon suler comes in hes at a northern Kentucky feeds Hutchinson whos got two triples what a nice start from downtown yeah anytime you see the first one go in I mean you get that confidence so again but it starts on the defensive end they get a great defensive possession theres no pressure so theyre able to get in the half court and get good possessions thats four threes for the Buccaneers tonight looking to play Jack Sparrow here in Raleigh as that ball goes out of bounds therere certainly an intensity now to this road Squad not afraid of the moment here in PNC yeah good job of just driving getting it to the block the the defense helps in and able to knock down the shot out thats one of those that typically Kevin Keats is probably going to tell his team look we got to stay home especially on the strong side corner uh but they help a little bit just enough to get the open look Charleston Southern last year top 60 in the country made threepointers theyre not afraid to let it fly One V one for Taj Kelly he is fighting in for space on Middlebrooks and a foul here this might be on NC State okay no it is on Charleston Southern the over the back on Hutchinson good job by oconnell there especially with the the bigger guy pushing in the back but you know hes a lacrosse guy so hes used to the physicality those opening draws in mens lacrosse are epic one V1 in the middle of the turf and its a scrum well hed be one of the ones if we got into a scrum tonight i Id be probably behind him so the grad transfer comes in NC State struggling to shoot from deep tonight 0 for six and as a team just 31 burns finds oconnell good fade away there thats how you break a drought and they did a good job getting their action Iverson cut into a little bit of flow action dribble handoff and again just good patience and DJ setting a good screen up top that snaps a twominute scoring drought for NC State meanwhile Charleston Southerns made four the last five little bit of a baseline Runner trying to get him on the hot man spins into traffic as the clock hits down to five Clinton in One V one ball calls its own number and cant hit tiping no good Second Chance by Applause Patrick Burns is hooting and hollering for the basketball Oh What A wise man turning to his left savy vet heads to the line anytime DJ can get feet in the paint its probably a good decision to give him the ball NC State to the free throw line when we return here in Raleigh these mov looking nice southern made 13 threes on Tuesday theyve made four or five tonight meanwhile NC State struggling to hit from Deep yeah and thats where I think the uh you know NC State just needs to be a little bit more aggressive attacking get the paint touch first thats the one thing especially Char charlest and Southern theyre getting that paint touch then making the kick so uh it makes it especially for Shooters a lot easier once the ball comes in back to out TJ Burns knocks in his first free throw of the Season by the way three games in I would have never guessed that thats your trivia question at the end of the year when was the first free throw 733 in the east on a Friday night by the way the leaves are turning so much brown and green and BR yellow right now looks amazing on the drivein beautiful in the Raleigh area right now heres some pressure NC state has lived on on the turnover and a foul 10 second good point there Scott thats the 11th turnover for Charleston Southern yeah and they just got I love the patience but at some point you got to start to advance the ball whether youre getting into the middle whether youre getting into the sideline sideline to the middle but you got to get that zone press shifting a little bit Raab boss saying to his point guard right there yeah theyve had someone in the middle each time and again I like the idea of MI in and out so that it gets that middle Defender moving a little bit worth noting backup point guard Jaden Thompson not available tonight with a lower body injury its what really sits in DJ Patricks hands heres DJ Burns boy thats my DJ going to work if youre here at NC State just a Smooth Operator I know theres a DJ in the house literally spinning Tunes between timeouts but watching Burns go to work is magical at times yeah and I know thats one of the things he likes to do when hes not on the court is uh enjoy some music so you know hes uh hes being a little dj out here right now the fifth year senior has a ton of experience against Charleston Southern back to his winr days and hes putting on an album tonight Johnson Hees up along three oconnell comes out with it this is where States been dangerous in transition morcel attacks for the layoff yeah and I think that starts with Charleston Southern you know is just starting their offense so far out they take a you know a deep three semic contested NC State gets a rebound and pushes thats their game thats what they want so you know Charleston Southern really got to get into better offensive position and yet fast break points only twopoint difference between these clubs you would have thought coming Inc state would live on the turnover make things happen Johnson with a nice kick out that three is off and thats a good pass again almost almost all the way to the paint and you want that corner three what a dime by Taylor and Marcel knocks in the first three of the night NC State and he hasnt shot it great so far in the season but again hes one of the the shooters that they look for been good throughout the year and hes always one of the first ones out here especially during the pregame so we expect them to knock down a lot of shots Savvy vet in game 120 of his career hits the first three makes it an 110 run for NC State and how important is this possession now if your CSU theres the steel boy running and gunning tailor to the rack make it 130 MC state were were literally going to be a broken record its just coming down to you got to take care of the ball Patrick the south Florida Trans for 1 V one with morcel theres a lot of isolation ball if your Barkley R ball right now Johnson to the double the Buccaneers have not scored in almost four minutes as that shot rattles out burns the rebound at some point they got to get the ball movement is when Da catches that on the top not a 1 second or two second hold its got to be a catch rip and going to a DHL on the side back to Burns what does he have orchestrated here on the Block what a spin DJ dunk oh my goodness oh my goodness that man needs a t Swip tour its the burns era sweet Beat and now a double team leads to ball for Charleston Southern but man how about DJ Burns going to work the big fella just a phenomenal spin move uses the weight against him spins off and then just finishes at The Rim I did not know DJ had that vertical in him Ill be honest look at that quick Spin and just Rises up hang time we noted his shooting percentage coming in five of six tonight so Burns is inching closer to Second all time in NC State history this is a 1 15 Wolfpack run open three for suler nice offensive board Johnsons turn they need this unable to go and a loose ball out to the wolf Applause pack feed the hot hand and burns Taylor instead is rejected good swap by Kelly thats a great block and this is what they want to do they want fast too cant hit they want to play Fast oh my goodness the cherry picking Taylor with the tongay itll count all the same tonight 170 NC State run yeah just a up and down up and down and again this is the style of play both teams really want but you know you just got to eliminate those uh really really easy baskets this feels like G le basketball bit tonight a lot of movement how do you get a bucket here if youre CSU well they got to get the ball in scoring position theyre all the way out at half court so now when you do a pick and roll up here all you got to do is go under like Parkers doing now so you dont really create an advantage unable to hit the three was Kelly and now state with numbers heres DJ Burns bangs in the bodies and knocks in his 14th point and DJs feeling himself right now as he should if youre going to if youre going to score that efficiently and get a dunk I dont know if Ive seen him dunk hes definitely feeling it right now so hes going to be one that theyre going to try to get the ball to this lead is balloon to 20 in the last 5 minutes Johnson in attack mode has to fade away nice bucket very CP 3es on that shot yeah tough bucket for sure but again I think thats one of the things that coach barklay is going to say hey we got to get the ball moving even though you know we get a a tough bucket there nobody else touched it so get the ball moving and lets get some easier possessions youre not going to come back in one possession only four assists for Charleston Southern tonight and States position the rock well horn gets his home board and an assist to himself yeah and thatll drive a coach crazy shooter gets his own rebound and finally a whistle to break this back and forth play our final media timeout of the first half and its the DJ bur car categories you look now at the career field goal percentage record Burns has a chance to pass DJ Thunderbird tonight and already six of seven to start this game what a career for DJ down low yeah I mean thats a great list to be on uh anytime you guys are that they are that efficient especially on the offensive end you know hes hes only going to probably creep up that list uh By the time his career is over Burns has 14 points in the blink of an eye for NC State and nearly a turnover thats a reach in foul on DJ horn yeah and I think coach is a little bit upset he knows uh if youre putting the ball down two three times that trap is coming from behind so hes got to be a little a little bit quicker and make a quicker decision thats been the Bugaboo for Charleston Southern 12 first half turnovers remember the season high for the Buccaneers was 15 so this has been all in a short Sprint first minutes for Marian Savage the third point guard coming in rard freshman out of Eastern Washington heres a steel look at that step through and a strip on the way up but a foul was called on the Parker attack yeah and Dennis just being really good Iverson cut off of that uh side but hes getting on top of the of the cutter and just pushes it in transition again hes just one of those guys that you know Kevin Keat has brought in that is an elite Defender wants to get out transition and were just seeing it uh in routine today and more impressively the lone freshman coming in fourstar recruit out of Richmond yeah and I think the co year the only reason probably he wasnt a state champion so you know bringing in a guy that has has won historically uh is any is a good thing for any team thats for sure this crowd is responding to a couple of fans on the video board theyre having a blast tonight I think mod diara is back in the game this is this the first time weve seen him since he left thats a great point Ill take your theory over mine as heres the steel suler ahead to Johnson Charleston Southern needed that bucket breaks a 222 run yeah being able to push I know they got to get that you know defensive rebound but theyre able to get get a turnover and and push it which is again their game they want to play fast but they got to be in control final minute of this first half oconnell looks to feed it into space and thatll stay here what have the Wolfpack done to balloon this lead in the first half you know a lot of its just getting out in transition but it starts on the defensive end theyre getting defensive stops theyre getting turnovers so the defensive end is really thrusting and getting them into the offense so theyre getting those easy looks out in transition at for 13 Charleston turnovers Connell had to hurry up throw a prayer and Parker with a catch breaks the lane no problem for Dennis Parker thats just pure athleticism uh and hes wearing different colored kicks yeah it throws you off a little bit uh hes like an inverted Power Ranger but anybody that can be that athletic they can wear whatever Footwear they want so were going to roll with it fourstar recruit showing you why theres more pressure on the Buccaneers and Kelly is fouled to reach in for diara good to see him back in the game yeah I know coach Keats doesnt like the call but again theyre just doing such a good job of forcing that offense to start so far out and I cant emphasize enough anytime that you are starting especially on the offensive end that far youre not in a scoring position they really got to try to get that right at the threepoint line this was a tight game early 20 to 17 and its been all NC State Applause since have not said Taj Kellys name a ton tonight just four shots hes 0 of four now he bangs into the lane and floats one over diara yeah theyve ran that play a couple times and I think thats a good one the first time or the second time they ran it they actually got the switch so the guard was on them they were able to get an offensive rebound out of it that time they dont switch but hes just good physical and finishes final shot of the second half first half Parker cant hit the three but it is all NC State double digit turnovers forced in a 19point lead of the break half 10th alltime meeting between NC State and Charleston Southern Yara goes to work on the first possession and flips it in Its that kind of night for the Post players of NC State yeah and I think honestly they did a really good job on the defensive end they started in 13 131 when the ball went to the corner they matched up but again you just got to stay on the ground and make him take a tough one its halfway there living on a prayer for Muhammad diara have it himself him and DJ Burns both great nights 20 combined points after the free throw now a 20 here comes that press for NC State forced 13 Charleston turnovers the Buccaneers season High last year was only 22 turnovers in a loss to Kennesaw State a tournament team heres a giveaway and a block from behind so Hutchinsons had enough of this turnover W hell clean it up himself yeah just got to find patience again theyve got such active hands you know you got to fake a pass make a pass uh theyre just kind of just a little bit too loose with the ball has led to easy points in transition for NC State 13 of them off the turnover horn is a jump ball good hands by RJ Johnson yeah I think thats one of the things RJ Johnson and Kelly are you know theyre kind of the gogetters for this team you know they really make a lot of things happen so I think especially at the start of this half they got to find a way to really spark this team RJ Johnson who spent the offseason on a new diet pran lost 10 lbs its in the best shape of his life also got strong hands cuz he ripped that ball away now Johnson Fades a bit short this is a scrum since it was tipped into the back court thats a fear play and I know they didnt score on that possession but again Patrick fakes a pass makes it swings it to the right side theyre able to throw the ball up the sideline to get Johnson going downhill to get a shot thats exactly how they have to do it to be able to break that pressure and look at these numbers for Johnson coming in he had 25 in the non D1 win over Johnson and Wales but consistent scoring for barlay Ray to ball yeah RJs a really good shooter thats one of the things that coach Barkley was talking about as he really knows how to get to his midrange shoot the three and again hes got to get going to bring him back back and heres Kelly one of the guys that weve talked about its got to get it going the Atlanta Georgia product with a nice drive to the basket he was one of two players to appear in every game it was an injured Charleston Southern team last year that finished second to last in the Big South and hes kind of the Jack of all trades for him you does a little bit of scoring rebounds the ball at a very high level and also is a really good passer so again he just is kind of that engine here goes DJ a bit ambitious on that shot and thats what they got to do get the stop get the rebound and then you know be selective when you can push and if not set up the offense Johnson finds Kelly Burns able to collapse late and a block Taylor to morcel nice play in transition from NC State yeah great activity on the defensive end and again doing what they do best getting out and running being unselfish with the basketball making a pass finishing at The Rim down low and a nice layup for DJ Patrick what are these track meet games like as a player you know theyre a lot of fun to be in uh I think it gets a little bit frustrating at times for coaches especially when it results in turnovers but at the same time you get up and down you get a good flow so thats one of the things I always love the fast pace because it gives you a much better flow especially with how many mediate timeouts com in a game and he stayed dominant since the 10minute Mark of the first half as Taylor floats and that was a good defensive possession by them they kind of forced him out a little bit push the clock a little bit to the late side and then they force a contested two heres Johnson second Team all big South hes got some handles Kelly rides that kesio tape Fades away and cant Music hit but even early on I just feel like those are a little bit better possessions Kelly gets a touch at the top and is much more active and quick on going to that dribble handoff with Johnson more cell gets to the free throw line and diara able to save it active hands here from Charleston Southern better pass to morcel who missed it and I was about to say thats a back breaker for you know you defend for all that time give up an offensive rebound and then give up a cut and an man one for Kelly but again thats one of those that you know Caseys going to go back and look on the game film and be like man just a fourpoint swing again missed the layup push it attack draw the foul with the finish that play had everything in it and then the n one for CSU but this is this this is the type of game that theyre going to have to do you know theyre going to have to make NC State take some tough ones they got to finish with a rebound and then thats what they can do best they like to play fast they like to be quick push it in transition Brook rall noted our pace is our greatest strength he has High Caliber players both as people and his athletes he wants to use that speed and its hard to get in a track meet when youre quote unquote outmanned against a power opponent in the ACC yeah theyve got really good depth they played 10 people uh in the first half so they get in and out as well so again whenever you want to play fast you got to have some bodies and theyve thrown a lot of bodies out there today and sometimes youre so fast you make fast people look not so Music fast name that movie I cant not not on the spot like that Adam Ill get back to you on that one theres Taylor on the attack good job with a shoulder fighting free one too many steps thatd be a great name for a movie one too many steps no thats not the name of the movie with the former NC State threepoint shooting Legend Scott Wood Im Evan budrich Kevin kes in a thoughtful mood right now on his mind I think he just wanted a little bit more intensity coming out of this half you know obviously being up you know 20 coming out of it um I mean theyre still right at that number but again I just think Charles and Southern came out obviously turn over on the first possession but theyre just playing a little bit harder than his his NC State right now Longest Yard is that movie with Adam Sandler its a great movie the older one is good too the OG movie of course yeah my cousin would be very disappointed I couldnt uh name that its all good one of our favorite movies growing up Kelly on the floater thats four quick points in the second half for T Kelly thats why you see a focal point he can put the ball on the floor mix it up a little bit nice three for Morel makes up for the Miss layup and CSU just has to do a better job getting back in transition and matching up given the pace of this game if youre Charleston Southern you probably need this to be a 90 to 85 type of night to come back correct yeah you do but you also got to understand that we got to we got to limit our turnovers theyre theyre kind of shooting themselves in the foot not be able to get those extra possessions because of how many turnovers theyve had especially in the first half a foul here as DJ Patrick goes up well take the time out talk about Longest Yard and some other stuff when we come back with NC State up by 18 different home venues the buck Dome is the second smallest arena all division one basketball 881 the smallest venue is actually USC Upstate just across the state PNC Arena of course with a brand new video board in the last 2 years the square footage always blows my mind because the video board here in PNC Arena is essentially half the size of the entire Buck do well uh thats impressive but I will say if you could get a lot of people into that gym Im I bet you they can get it rocking the buck doones won two conference championships in that building under barklay rall it is an electric atmosphere in North Charleston also home to our friend Shep from Southern Music Charm DJ Patrick heads to the free throw line Ive never had a game with four different DJs on the roster between the two programs and and an RJ and a DJ in the building and an Applause RJ we have MJS and ljs mixed in KJ Keats as well a lot of initials in this Music one working into DJ Burns who has 14 points tonight faces the double nice pass out of traffic and oconnell earns The Possession as its last Touch by Charleston Southern that was tremendous hustle from okell on the boards yeah and this is one of the things I like they do such a good job of getting DJ the ball down low but they keep moving all over so you see right there DJ horn cutting and again those are looks that theyre going to want all night hes going to knock those down 70 of the time which leads to Second Chance buckets morcel wanted the foul and he wont get it got hit down a little bit low but again I think thats one of those you know coach kes going to tell them look we can get that anytime we want in The Possession Kelly into some traffic big second half for really good help Side by DJ horn right there Aaj was stripped and a foul that upsets Kevin Keats horn equally surprised hate to say it were always surprised when theres a foul called on us Ive never seen a player commit a foul and say oh yes that was on me sir unless its the hacka shack so Burns will take a breather here 5 minutes in new guard in Gattis Heath II out of Atlanta check it in for Charleston Music Southern nice kick out from Johnson Better three on the wing from suler yeah and after about you know roughly 5 and a half minutes this is how theyre going to come back in the ball game its not going to happen in a 2 three minute stretch but if they can get some better offensive possessions and again take care of that ball Force NC State into some tough shots they can creep back into this game middle Brooks has checked in for NC State in the post battling with Noble days thats a tough look and a late foul on days that s middle Brooks to the line yeah and good patience there again I think NC State just makes it hard to dig trap on that post because they do so much moving away from the ball so that gives Ben Middlebrook so much more time to kind of sit there survey see what he wants to do does he want to kick it but it gives him time to get two feet into the paint and draw the Music foul Ben Middlebrooks who at his coming out party against NC State last year you see the 10 points thats a big addition with depth down low that the wolf pack need yeah and especially since you know like last year they had du onah horic that got hurt during the year they kind of struggled with that depth so they you know added a couple bigs that you know have given them some really good pieces especially early on in this season Ernest Ross making his way back its really been on Middlebrooks as that backup center good strip and Parker knocks it out and the learning moment is as soon as you cross that half line its the worst spot to pick up your dribble thats been the challenge for a young CSU roster 14 turnovers tonight with starting point guard Claud El Harris transferring to Boston College and claudell came back in attendance to watch his team season opener BC was playing at Citadel the next night so the club drove across town neat Music moment with the legend David Thompson in attendance here for NC State the wolf pack off on the three yeah they got the mismatch but again I think thats where hed take days off the bounds especially when youre a smaller quicker guard at least get him to turn his feet a couple times see if you cant create not only for yourself but for your teammates cuz you know you got the big fella on you theyre going to have to come help from somewhere barl R ball always coaching and hes noted hes very candid in our conversation that theyre not expecting to get a win in this game but they want to learn things down the stretch for conference spot yeah and I think thats one of the things they just want to take away some positive things its so early in the season coaches are still trying to figure out what they have so they want to get some guys in there they want to see different lineups and ultimately look lets just do some positive things lets get better today Heath slips Middlebrooks gets attacked on the leg and a foul yeah had the had had the break up front uh but just couldnt get it out of his hands and in the revamp Big South Conference these teams will not be in the AP top 10 but how about FAU from the group of five making a run and we saw Arizona going to Duke last week pick up a huge win for the Pack 12 yeah theyve got some good things going I I I enjoyed watching the Arizona game uh I unfortunately was was on the broadcast so I couldnt watch uh the whole thing but was able to go back in there and watch it theyve got a really good roster but uh I also know Dukes going to be a really good uh basketball team so I dont have to worry about and you have Zack Ed the double double machine for Purdue horn with a deep two thats one of the least favorite shots in college basketball but it works yeah and thats what he does man hes just a elite shooter he shoots a career 41 from the field so you know again hes trying to kind of find his way new team only the second game so thats what he brings to this team nice block by Taylor and a foul on the way up thatll send RJ Johnson to the free throw line might have been a nice block because he hit the arm one leads to the other good Music point and as a former shooter I will take that all day big pet peeve anytime you get hit on the arm and you miss one short and it doesnt get called especially when youre at someone elses gym and all of a sudden you get air ball air Applause ball Charleston Southern four of six from the free throw line tonight making a convoy of Subs sort of fitting out of the holy city you ever been to that Naval Base down in Charleston I have I was actually lucky enough my uh sophomore year we played in that little Charleston classic down at the College of Charleston and we were able to do a tour on the battleship thats where we had our dinner uh cool little city uh so Ive enjoyed my time across the river as well yeah really neat Town yeah beautiful down there right in the heart of Charleston Charleston Southern University out of the Big South voted eighth in the Big South Music preseason it was actually a wedding possible destination for me and my wife would have been a good choice since Parker hits the jumper unfortunately we got married in July so humidity and hair just wasnt a good combination and we have a good head of hair in this booth I will say with Scott Wood Im Evan budich 36 points in the paint for the wolf pack I think thats where their bread and butter is going to be I dont think theyre you know create off the bounce three team but I think theyre a paint touch post touch kick it out threepoint team thats where I think they Excel theres a good steal and a foul on the open court well take the media timeout NC State Charleston Southern trading buckets early and a look at the Young freshman for the wolf pack as we head to a timeout we talk forever about the future this schedule sure amps up quickly first the ACC SEC Challenge and then a trip out to Las Vegas ASU BYU some opponents beyond that and then right into the conference this is a critical five game stretch yeah and this is one of the things that I really want to see out of the look pack you know we know they have depth we know theyre going to be a hard Scout we know they got five guys that can you know average double figures but once they kind of get into some tight basketball games whos going to close it out for them nice Hustle by RJ Johnson there and thatll bring barklay rall nice Pat of the back for his star point guard despite this large deficit CSU is not given up just yet yeah and I think thats one of the things that you know coach talked about especially when we talked with them earlier you know he just wants effort out of his guys he doesnt really care about this end result obviously they want to stay competitive but even when you make mistakes just play hard get back and get better and we talked hair earlier Barkley had a hair appointment this week with his Barbara Maria and the joke was how much Pomade and spray could I put in my hair to make it look good Berkeleys always the class of the Big South with a great head of hair well hes going to lose a little bit if they keep uh turning the ball over 16 turnovers might uh thin that hair out a little bit quickly I mean fman has been coaching college basketball for over 20 years thats a great head of hair yeah I just think its going to cost you a lot of money over time for product thats for sure hes the alltime active head coach WIS leader in the Big South barkl rall I can tell you underneath it theres a lot of basketball knowledge in there absolutely twotime Big South coach of the year and he has mentored now 10 different Power five assistants or head coaches in his 20year tenure and thats impressive I told him you know thats what its all about hes got you know some some staff members on his bench now that had played for him so you know making sure hes taking care of his own for sure theres a foul on the way up a reaching there for Reggie durh har barad Rabs biggest assistant he raved about was saw nimley the alltime assist leader at CSU whos now his associate head coach was a part of those two championship teams you Su saw sitting down there yeah and then thats the hard part about it is hes at some point you know going to set him free and hes going to go off and and be a great head coach somewhere but uh I think thats just the awesome part about it is kind of mentoring somebody helping them find their way in coaching and then being able to see them find success at another program two current assistants Bob Richie and Mike Morell now head coaches that made the tournament last year and he said son emilyy is the best assistant Ive ever had in 20 years yeah and I got a feeling hes going to have a lot more really good ones and here are the Buccaneers hanging around in PNC Arena hanging down 20 these teams are tied 15 AP piece in the second half Applause Kelly NC State making nothing easy on this possession until Johnson slips down the Baseline and honestly that may be their best offensive possession sharing the basketball I think everybody got a touch there again a little bit of breakdown in the defense and able to get an easy lay in now can Charles and Southern get stops on this end of the Court NC State shooting it at Music 45 Taylor finds middle Brooks nice dime to the center really good patience you know I call that the flow action where typically you have two guards they go to a dho whether its a back door a pin down or a fake handoff uh to kind of empty out that side what a steal and a foul earned by Jaden Taylor this kid is quick with his hands yeah in the last two games hes just pressured the ball so well I think thats one of the things hes hes just hes just aggressive whether its on the defensive end offensive end and again they get to that flow action empty side pick and roll drop down pass middle Brooks finishes look at this pass and then look at that steel Taylors an electric transfer coming in a butler maybe that the best conference in the country this year the Big East yeah heres the AC a little bit of that 131 to get him to change pace and Taylor said dont sleep on NC State with his first triple and I would argue that last game as well Jaden Taylor how hard and how well he played defensively really got him going offensively Taylor commits the foul here I think hes even doing it a little bit here you know he gets the assist on one end uh knocks down a three on this in again I just think theres something to making good basketball plays gives you a good flow and gives you that good confidence thats a team best six triples for Taylor who will exit with the foul he has three now thats the most frenzy Music State RJ Johnson flipping a similarly good pass and then Kelly carried it that mind moved a little faster than the body yeah and I I as bad as it sounds that is the turnover you want to take you want an state to have to take the ball out of bounds as opposed to trying to throw a pass there live ball turnover and then they can get out in transition DJ Burns checks back into the game and just watch the movement NC State will start the move here and give DJ some room to work and then he just kind of monitors the floor see whos open and has good patience thats a tough reaching foul for Charleston Southern because Burns is like a gravitational force he starts moving and everyone arounds him effects him yeah I mean honestly the best thing you can do is maybe dig just get him to pick up his Tribble you know second guess what hes doing uh but again hes just so patient he could literally be there and pound it five or six times the Zach Randolph comp always catches my eye with Burns Mary in Indiana where Im from Zach Randolph so when I first saw him that was kind of one of my my first comparisons Zach always had such great touch uh was a magnet for the ball when it came to rebounding offensively and defensively so so uh thats always been a really good comparison especially theyre both lefties and burns is so efficient he has 16 points now on six of eight shooting and with the broadcasters Jinx coming Burns has not missed a free throw all season well in his defense it was the first game hes tooken a free throw and I I would have never guessed it this is balloon the lead up to 24 foren he State largest of the night creating space nice bucket for Alon suler the Northern Kentucky transfer from the king of the Norse to the king of the buccaneer yeah good little step back there creates the space knocks down the jump shot this game has slowed down a bit in Tempo in the last 10 Applause minutes horn nice find from Burns and he hits the jumper and the crowd was a little disappointed DJ didnt shoot that one but I hate to say it if he wants minutes I think that was a good B business decision by him to get the ball moving sloppy turnover there for Charleston Southern its their 19th giveaway of the night that could be the story of this whole game yeah I I I really do I think if they could have found a way you know I know theres 8 minutes 43 seconds left if they could find a way to just take care of the ball get some good half uh half court offensive possessions I think itll give him a chance but again NC State is just doing a good job of amping up that pressure when they need to uh to create those turnovers first minut to the night for LJ Thomas the sophomore to Florida who checks in and thats on the floor not an n one although Horns played this case theres Thomas all academic team in the ACC this is his second game of the season and we have a timeout here for Charleston Music Southern and well take the timeout Music Music Rufus hates being stuck in the immedate timeout and two of the big stories turnovers and bench points for NC State yeah and this is the one thing any any young guy out there watching you know everybody wants to start but can you come off the bench and still really produce I think this is one of the things that really makes NC State dangerous know got eight players that have scored they arguably have eight players that could finish in double figures so again just makes them that much more dangerous 18 bench points for shy of a season best for Kevin Keats club and its one thing to score against the bench in games one two and three but we showed you that fivegame stretch coming up against the SEC and the ACC theyll need that bench scoring in November yeah for sure especially you know when youre coming off the bench you really need some change of pace uh especially if you know DJ Burns is one of those first substitutions out who can be on the court and really help score you know thats going to be a you know Dennis Parker great steal here DJ horn oh horn wanted to bring PNC to its Applause feet he knew it too you know sometimes you look at guys and you dont think you know they dont have that in them but we saw that with DJ Burns tonight he has it in him and then DJ horn thats got plenty of Leaping ability was off the back iron up front iron you know we might question does he really have that leaping ability but back iron you know he he has the height the Raleigh native who played at Trinity Christian wanted to bring the hometown back to their feet first minutes tonight for Ernest Ross the Junior 50 career games for Ernest hes battled back from injury and good to see Ernest now on the Applause floor Applause Music py State back into that 221 press look at horn causing traffic then a steal for Thomas now its a a fight for the basketball and is that a 10second violation or was a change of possession well I think they changed possession long enough to where they would get a new 10 Music so it is a 10second violation thats the fourth committed by CSU tonight and I can understand Barkley Rabs frustration there yeah and I would I would argue that obviously without having to see the replay um you know it looked like LJ did get possession and was about to make a pass to DJ horn underneath the basket but here we go is right there maybe Id almost call it a possession but I guess he never technically held control look at horn on the drive and the rejection thats sent to the seats by durh har well DJ horn is trying to do something special here as we take the media timeout lets see he what he can accomplish after this 122 run by the Wolfpack first edition of the AP poll came out this week in some national powers in the ACC of course Duke Miami UNC and dont sleep on Clemson or Virginia this could be a very deep ACC League this year yeah kind of when I was first looking at it um you know I was on a podcast the other day and they were asking how many do you think can get in the tournament from the ACC and it is really early on in the season but you know I like that kind of five to six number I think theres going to be some teams that surprise us you know I I I didnt say you know some things about Clemson and I got called out for it but theyre going to be a really good team as well uh coming down the stretch thats a three and0 start for Clemson as horn hits the jumper in these last two minutes DJ horn has really you know put himself out there as being kind of that goto offensive guy which is something that theyve kind of been looking for Taylor did it uh against abin Christian was really aggressive and now I think DJ hordon starting starting to do that on the offensive end think of about teams as well Wake Forest coming off a great tournament year and then Virginia Tech with excellent guard play lets give be two clubs that can make a run come January February yep its going to be really interesting especially once they kind of figure out everybodys trying to figure out what they still got but once we get into that ACC play uh you know theyre going to beat each other up pretty good so uh well see what each each team has nice Bucket from suler on the other end NC State coming off a tournament run and that was a huge year for Kevin Keats getting back to the dance losing to Quon Smith and jar Hill Joiner and bringing in players like DJ horn to compliment horn with a good step back hes been dying for a big shot tonight yeah I mean hes just been in in in his little mode right here where hes in attack so he keeps doing that again this is one of the things that he brought to Arizona State and again I know theres a lot of guys that get opportunities on this NC State roster but hes one of those that can kind of create and do a little bit more oneonone and create his own shot theres a foul on Middlebrooks on the drive now the schedule gets real tough for NC State coming up against Vanderbilt in that ACC challenge which that could say a lot for this conference come selection Sunday yeah I know theyre going to have a weve mentioned that tough stretch but again I think thats one of the things NC State wants to see they want to see themselves kind of get stuck in a tight game see how different players react and figure out you know whats the best lineup when it comes down to crunch time RJ Johnson is disappointing this NC State student section tonight excellent free throw shooter 80 last year and Dwight is not a happy camper hit some Music Applause both this is balloon to the largest lead for NC State just a point under at Music 29 Ernest Ross with his first screen of the night and it sets up horn for the Music jumper thats just a good job of him moving without the ball coming off those Iverson Cuts Ernest Ross doing a good job of positioning himself to set a really good screen they didnt switch and they didnt really hedge it was more of a drop defense and and and thats one player on the court that I probably wouldnt sit in a drop especially when hes heating up Kelly is wide open and thats not even close now an outlet from Thomas kind of get this feeling out process from both team six minutes to Music play middle Brooks on the spin in into the cycle Banks it in nice move from the Clemson transfer yeah great footwork him and DJ going against each other every day you know theyre theyre they kind of feeding off each other showing each other the footwork drills I would pay good money to watch a game a horse between those two Ive seen Ben in in pregame knocked down a couple shots Ive seen him knocked down a half court shot in pregame as well so I hate to say it I think my my money might be on Ben in a horse game theres a foul here Kelly nearly had the and one and look at the footwork here the big man yep just faking hand off and again getting deep spin move pivot step through finishing over to the left shoulder DJ horn will exit but could be for the final time tonight and a nice round of applause for the Arizona State transfer that opens the door for Brion pass out of Reedsville his r Rams deep into the high school state playoffs and of course bam was a state champion in football and basketball yeah he brings uh both of them thats one of the things a couple years ago I was asking coach Keats about and uh he just basically said look I think him playing football creates the toughness and makes him such a good Defender and it gives him so much good work ethic so uh you know hes been a good addition to the team uh now getting an opportunity to be the floor General middle Brook left alone that was the shooting touch couldnt hit it thats what I get for saying I saw him make you know six in a row during pregame every makes him in practice Kelly couldnt hit Clinton missed the tip in now Thomas runs the break nice pass and a better three for NC States Dennis Parker with his first three of the night I think that puts four NC State players in double figures your math is correct my friend backto back games with multiple players 10 plus as this Tip Drill will go to NC Applause State what have you noticed from the wolf pack in terms of that press because it continues to cause Charleston Southern problems well I think a lot of its just kind of the length that they have you know theyve got a lot of good guard size um you know DJ Horn uh probably arguably their smaller ones and then Casey Marcel whos 63 and still has a massive wingspan just putting them kind of up at the top and then they mix it up with marker at the top from time to time diara at the top from time to time they just add link so again I just think you got to you know fake a pass make a pass and be sure a lot of bench Ms here including LJ Thomas who comes up short Charleston Southern has had a bucket from the field in three minutes that looks to change here and what a nice night for Hutchinson three for three from Deep yeah hes made a few shots tonight uh you know again I think were going to be that broken record but if they could find a way to take care of the ball and get some of those half court possessions like theyve been getting it it just makes that game just a little bit easier Lewis Hutchinsons parents both have doctoral degrees from Rhode Island University smart family working it down to Middle Brooks on the spin cycle and that time he hits the Music floater the the evolution of post player footwork Ive been impressed from NC State tonight yeah and I think they work on it just a little bit different you know back in the day my dads not going to want me to say this but you know a traditional drop step pump fake Up and Under but again I just think they do so much stuff whether its guard work you know handling the ball mixing it up step backs its just kind of the evolution of kind of that pick and pop big man Davis bangs off the three and look at the pack ping pushing in transition final three minutes and thats a blocking foul sending us to the media NC State on the verge of a three and 0 start well wrap this game up and we Music return nice different leing scorer for NC State tonight its DJ horn who has 18 and that shows the depth of this NC State offense yeah it just makes it really hard to guard when youre sitting there looking at a scout and you see all right weve got two guys averaging 18 points a game its its like you know lets try to take them away but with a roster like this and you just have no idea who its going to be each and every night if you take two away theres still three guys that can get that double figure mark this free throw would give NC State a new season high in points and there you go 85 and Counting as we hit the three minute Mark of the second half two three Zone this is something different cooking in the kitchen of Kevin Keats Charles Southern breaks that zone really easily but a Miss there from Noble days heres Middlebrooks a point shy of 10 hed be the fifth player to have 10 or more oh and threw the arm there thats an offensive foul just a little bit too much chicken wing yeah much to the Chagrin there of Middlebrooks Applause hard to argue that one in the 34point game and now NC State will make one more sub coachs son KJ Keats checks in play the nine games is a freshman and gets his third appearance this Music season and again you just see the length of Parker Jr you know denying the corner getting a hand on a ball its just one of those things that just makes NC State so tough especially on the offensive end is just that length Jordan Snell will check in for his third appearance the local product at a Keri Panther Creek High School Hutchinson looks for four for four it wont get it coach Shawan Robinson out of Panther Creek at Clemson product good basketball in the carry area especially carry Apex Thomas comes right into the game and attacks that one swatted and then Brion pass lost Music it LJ doing a good job attacking getting the rim but better defense pinning off the glass Clinton using the athleticism to create a possession and now pass will exit adding on to the Alex Nelly conversation another carry kid at a carry Academy anytime these type of players score the WalkOns and the reserves it brings the crowd to life and its one of the things I always said look these WalkOns put if not more work than anybody else they got to be there they got to run the scout team so anytime they can get these minutes its just great especially for some of the scholarship players to see them kind of get their uh opportunity to get a bucket Savages turn unable to hit the three and a fight for the boards the days who throws it away thatll result in a 22nd turnover for Charleston Southern which thats the name of this game tonight yeah and I think thats one of the things you know obviously you know coach isnt going to sit down and harp on too many negative things but you know Im sure hell touch on it in the film session just saying hey got to do a better job taking care of the ball but again theyll theyll find the good things and the positives uh from tonight really try and work on those things in the practice and and and move on for sure Charleston Southern gears up for backtoback Road games coming up heres a shot and Ernest Ross gets on the board Ernest Ross and hes one of those guys that gave NC State some really good minutes last year so itll be interesting to see I know theyve really really deep but Im sure you know theres going to be times throughout the year you know they need a little bit more defensive energy a little bit more versatility where hes going to give the pack some more good minutes final minute of this 10th ever meeting Charleston Southern at NC State Ross gives it a go a bit off on the Music three wol pack will move to 10 and0 all time against Charleston Southern Patrick unable to hit the three late and thatll stay Music here well you got any big plans for Thanksgiving you know were actually going to down to Atlantic Beach hitting the sun getting some waves thatll be nice is any family coming just just you guys me the fiance and the dog all right Remy Remy the black lab Im sure Remy will have a great time at the beach Remy loves the sand I kid you not Charleston Southern heads from the sand and theyll hit the road the next two weeks ncy state will head to Vegas over the Thanksgiving break there were spots to spend Thanksgiving Patrick is blocked and this should wrap up a dominant NC State performance Music tonight Charleston Southern will head to bethon cookman for Thanksgiving week at NC State will move to three and0 four in double figures a wire to wire win for Kevin Pats at NC State yeah they played really well
