are underway at the Joel Kevin bopy Miller at the point for Wake Hunter Salis the Gonzaga transfer puts it on the deck pulls up wakes on the board first and here is how the Highlanders from Newark New Jersey lineup tonight Robinson Adam H mcy gray Elijah Buchanan and Kell degraph with a lot on his plate tonight he is a 6 10 in sixthe player but its a whole different level when you play against an ACC opponent with the size hell have to deal Music with and for Wake as mentioned Fon Reed third will come off the bench Miller hildr Salis who scored the first two points Carr and Keller Wake Forest with a 5 and three record and theyve done very well in recent years Malcolm against nonconference opponents they havent lost in over 5 years at home to a nonconference team Salis left it short long rebound grabbed by Robinson and the key in this game the attacking the paint for Wake Forest NJIT comes out in a Zone they showed a little a full court pressure drop back into a matchup Zone well thats what cam hriff does for Wake Forest making plays for nothing deakes off to a quick start and thats great anticipation and thats been a problem area for NGIT turnovers Doug coming into this game its really been lopsided for them 87 assists to 111 turnovers right here this is just great anticipation cam Hilder I love his game twoway player and thats just a great hands and then that finish he made it look easy but this is a difficult finish through contact eyes on the rim the entire time thats a big time finish and Malcolm I love the fact that he used his left hand to reach in and steal that pass as you saw three turnovers already for the Highlanders long rebound track down by Adam Hess and here is Robinson with it Music Applause forest in manto man Elijah Buchanan misses on the step back three no look hildr goes out of bounds and this is one thing thats been an issue for Wake fors their assisted turnover ratio Malcolm not very good they are 13th out of 15 teams in the ACC yeah and thats not a good look right there and again right idea they want to try to get out in transition before this NGIT Zone can get set up but I think that ones got to be a bounce pass little off Mark that time by Hil NJIT coming off a big win on Wednesday in the Bronx at Ros Hill gymnasium they upset forom 8077 maai gray lit up the Rams with a careerhigh 21 points and head coach Grant Bill Meer got a late night celebratory text message from his longtime boss now the head coach at Marilyn Kevin Willard you saw that Fon Reed has come into the game for the first time and youre right though Doug thats a huge win for nit and on the road theyre going to be tested right now against this weight team in particular now with this lineup end Fon Reed uh the size I think in rebound Bing will be key for then offensive rebound grabbed by degra Buchanan has it poked away gets it back nice drive along the Baseline to get the Highlanders on the board for the first time tonight thats a beautiful move that time great touch on the Baseline and key right now for w fors attacking the one they got to get somebody at that F line area or short corner see if they can go from there Applause Miller feeds the post Reed gets double team they swing it around F hild in the corner after the flyby beats the buzzer and buries the three thats great ball movement that time playing through Fon Reed passing out of the double team ball went left to right Doug and thats great execution that time you cant ask for a better look you can fortunate not to have turned it over initially and then did HRI back door pass looked like Salis had himself a layup but then weve got a foul Wake Forest off to an early 72 lead over NJIT here in Winston Music Salem youre great he has up his roster hes going to do it the old school way couple of free throws from Hunter Salis hes got poor to lead the deeps you see the turnover issues so far for NJIT if they cant run offense cant hold on to the basketball theyre going to have a hard time staying in this ball game here tonight Malcolm thats key for them they must do a good job taking care of the ball in particular of the live ball turnovers wake wants to get out and run before this D can get set up Salis misses everything the ball track down by Makai gray coming off his 21point careerhigh performance in Wednesdays win at forom Fon Reed stands his ground and hes going to pick up the foul and Doug I like that move uh that time attack to paint if youre injit dont settle for jumpers see if you can try to get some of these bigs of wake Force into foul trouble heres great the Southpaw from montros New York good stroke hes at 78 on the Year from the free throw line and during a RoR seems like everybody malm on this team is either a freshman theyve got nine of them or postgraduate they have five of them and thats a interesting mix and thats what this coaching staff they want to do uh they want to build at the old school way bring in freshman try to develop guys but youre right really where you see a roster make up like this and nine freshman and we spoke with the coaching sta staff they said look we want to try to build the old school way play Above the Applause Applause Rim yet another NJIT turnover off the hands of Tariq Francis and this is this beautiful execution right here little rub screen get the big rolling and the pass dug was on point thats beautiful execution by W Forest trying to find Parker frericks in the corner but its a wait for his turnover give it back to the Highlanders Music after turning it over Salis commits the personal foul as you saw seven turnovers already well both teams youre absolutely right to have to do a better job taking care of the ball I think n NJIT if they want to pull the upset on on the road against the ACC opponent uh we talked to the coaching staff they must do a better job taking care of the ball in this one friendly Rim at the Joel the Highlanders with the three ball pulled back to within four now they go back into their Zone lets see the adjustment by W I think thats the key right there get the ball to the short corner or high post area hildr path taken away pass all the way to the bucket cant finish the layup wake up four with it hildr saless foul cut off by Elijah Buchanan Hunter Salis will take a seat and in for the first time Marcus Mar and a freshman from Denmark stands 68 trying to work his way into more minutes a bigger role this year for head coach Steve fors and he was highly sought out there coming out of Denmark one of the top players looks like a carbon copy from earlier this time though its an airball hild nailed the last one off a nice feed from Miller Here Comes Miller with numbers poy Miller going coast to coast and the first two points for this former Central Michigan chipa all name team right there boy and transition challenging and the answer really thats a big move time move by H through contact and one and so Adam H with a chance for three the grad transfer out of West Lake Village California went to West Lake High School this is his fifth School in six years covering all four Continental US time zones hes the epitome of the D1 athlete in the early 2020s Malcolm I tell you what and hes the oldest player on this roster turned 25 in October so I would say uh well traveled and experienced uh he checks off those Applause Music boxes Frederickson The Freshman from Bixby Oklahoma gets himself on the board and builds the lead to six and thats a beautiful step back look weits going to have to knock down some jumpers Doug uh NJIT you can tell theyre right now strategy keep wake out of the paint forc them to shoot Applause jumpers shot clock down to three step back long to is good it beats the buzzer and give the Highlanders two more points off the terrific looking shot from Francis The Freshman freshman from Music Applause Pittsburgh well that looked like a broken possession but Frei and makes it look good at the end and thats all set up by gam H fancy ball handling that time youre right scramble situation he makes a beautiful pass for another good look for Applause Wake that foul on hildr takes us to break Kevin Malcolm the last couple of years and he has gotten more reinforcements this Year from the portal I I tell you what he has done a remarkable job hes got a remarkable eye for talent and youre absolutely right hes taking guys that have been in other places really again okay but uh he has turned them into not only players of the year in the ACC but guys that are playing for a pretty big paycheck at the next level a phenomenal job by him and his staff mining the transfer portal well coming out of the timeout Grant Bill Meer runs a good set and will get a couple of free throws out of the grad transfer from Manhattan College Elijah Buchanan comes in averaging 13 points per game although he has not distinguished himself so far this season at the free throw line perfect swish on the first next Saturday December 16th we have a college basketball quadruple header beginning at noon Eastern but these are our featured matchups Virginia Tech hosting Vermont in blackburg at four Eastern and then Virginia squares off against Northeastern right here on accn and the and if youre the hogies look out for the Catamount John Becker out of this America East conference has got a min mini Dynasty going on up in Burlington Vermont so if Mike Youngs team is not playing its best as Miller scores Malcolm that could be a tra game for sure well I tell you what just across you look at college basketball in general a lot of these mid Majors Doug again because theyre older a lot more EXP exp erience uh any game really you have to be coming in with that same type of energy as if it was an ACC game terrific defense by maai gray but then the foul is called that will send Salis back to the free throw line well early on youre NJIT you have to be pleased with how you forced wake into jumpers again that was an emphasis coming into this one can they keep wake out of the paint force them into some contested jumpers and theyve done that early on I think on the other end the issue still continues to be turnovers they got to do a better job taking care of the ball but defensively theyve done a good job keeping wake out of the paint well Hunter Salis as you know from Omaha Nebraska was a fivestar recruit spent a couple of years in Spokane Washington and playing for Mark there the numbers this season at wake and I think hes going to get to 301 points and More in less than one season as a demon Deacon Malcolm absolutely and again another nice find by coach Forbes and his staff I think he is going to be a heck of a player in the ACC and as Forbes has talked about he went to Spokane to recruit Hunter Salis and found out from a third hey you know you might want to check out this Fon Reed guy hes going to be available as well so he got a twofer out of one of the best programs in the country I would not be surprised to see these two guys have the same success that some of the other transfers have had under coach Steve for how about Frederickson coming off the bench with eight quick points Steve forb says hes one of the best Shooters hes ever signed and right here though showing that he play off the bounce thats great uh concentration and body control playing two contact well he can fill it up he is his high schools alltime leading scorer back in Bixby Oklahoma and these nine points already his best as a collegate he scored eight in his debut game against Elon nine in counting for the 63 rookie he can flat out shoot it in his high school career over 27 made Miller draws the foul it goes against Sebastian Robinson and so Miller will head to the line where he is shooting 80 thats been one of the strengths of Wake Forest this year shooting from the free throw line at 79 collectively third best in the ACC number 11 in the country and Doug Ive been impressed with uh Miller his ability to attack in particular off of turnovers or in just transition he does a great job changing direction and then speed that burst to get to the basket really has been impressive well Steve Forbes says of bopy Miller hes got some thae Applebee in him and that can be challenging yeah that thats thats great but also can be tough to live up to and so far bopy Millers done a nice job in his first several games as a Applause deep Miller going in one more time he is a Relentless and his attack and transition and Ive been impressed with his defense as well too oh he has been very disruptive with his defensive effort and energy well he considered transferring out of Central Michigan after his freshman year but he played a second season in Mount Pleasant and wound up getting himself a tremendous spot in Winston Salem at the point for Steve forbs Salis going to work makes it look easy doesnt he Malcolm beautiful and now wake starting to open this up early on it was a lot of jumpers and then right now Wake Forest attack Music the from the floor and the biggest issue for NJIT so far just holding out to that basketball seven turnovers have been a problem yeah and seven points off the turnovers for wake and you I think the big thing uh wakes ability to attack the paint as you take a look though as NJIT knocking down a three early on though wake was settling for jumpers but theyve been able to get out in transition Doug and get higher percentage shots big reason why theyre shooting a good percentage from the floor now that was Jeffrey Aken to uh tou who is now four of seven shooting the three ball as a Collegiate player off the bench for some instant Music Music offense Applause shot clock under 15 has thought about it now puts it on the deck strong to the bucket hes got seven points to lead the Highlanders tonight and thats great patience that time almost a turnover early in that possession and then they got good floor spacing dribble Drive the help was not there for Applause Music Wake Salis not able to save it that is a tremendous job defensively by Tariq Applause Francis that might be their best defensive possession right here all Five Guys locked in again you can see the emphasis on playing that pack like d they dont want the ball to get into the paint off the bounce or pass thats great defensive execution by NJIT and I love coach Bill Meyers reaction in the back of that we saw in the replay he is trying to meld a team he had this whole group come together once they were all on campus in Newark New Jersey for a July 4th barbecue and one of their team activities to build a bond and its so much different than in your day obviously Malcolm where you had a group of guys who you knew who was going to be back next year and you could build from year to year to year but as a first year head coach hes basically starting from scratch he really is and and the mix that he has nine freshman and five six year guys guys that are a lot older in experience he said this was going to be key and Ive been impressed with them hanging around looked like wake was going to pull away with this and again hes talked about that in terms of just building of the culture of with this group and its going to start with their togetherness hildr fouled looked like that pass as he holds his left elbow it looked like Reeds pass was going to be stolen it uh made its way to hildr who is still down in pain now Im guessing it was a funny bone cuz no medical staff came to talk to him yeah and those are if you have experienced that you know that numb feeling really it feels a lot worse than it is once it starts to wear off lets hope thats all it is because you know cam hris is so important to what this weight team does on both ends and he is having a great start to the season 17 points per game close to 40 from the threepoint line and an excellent free throw shooter but I think the biggest thing for him uh his playmaking ability Doug he is a guy that can beat you off the bounce and either score for himself or set his teammates up yeah hes taken a couple of jumps from his freshman year last year to this year he just keeps on getting better love the way he plays the pace that he plays with and Malcolm I love the fact that his father Daniel hild played professional basketball in England for Steve Forbes good friend you may have heard of him Nick nurse and Nick and Steve are still close they call each other very close friends and these are the connections you never know how theyre going to manifest and so coach Forbes winds up getting an allconference caliber player in Cam hildr and I think the key thing in that graphic we showed look Player Development is so huge does whether its through the transfer Porter or you have guys that have been with you for multiple years and again credit Steve Forge and his staff they do a really good job in that area guys just seem to get better and I think thats so key when youre bringing guys in how fast and how well you can develop them to fit your system maai gray is having a tough time holding on to the basketball for NJIT the possession arrow belongs to the Highlanders so they will keep it no turnover this time Music and so Jamie lucky and theyre like look were just going to knock this off early were not going to let it get out of control you can see right here again its kind of like a little subtle like hey look Im just going to give you a little nudge and typically its always the second guy that gets caught but again the referees in position and I like that a double Tech all right knock it off we dont want any extra stuff after the whistle blows so the dead ball technical on Tariq Francis and the dead ball technical on Kevin bofy Miller NJIT with the ball down by nine in this first ever meeting between the Highlanders and the Demon Deacons midrange by Francis hes undeterred by that technical and I like what they did there they put Fon Reed in a ball screen he doesnt hedge there and hes able to come off and get a clean look heres Reed who has yet to take a shot in his second game as a demon Deacon theres his first attempt it rolls off five minutes to go in the half thats better that time uh by Reed on that ball screen comes out and heades hard well its going to be hard for Fon Reed to do better on a consistent base debut game for the deakes in the win 7657 over ruter on Wednesday came off the bench 12 points and a careerhigh 14 rebounds and I love the way he carries himself Malcolm and after the game the way he spoke to the Press he just seems like a terrific young man who has been a tremendous addition to this wake program I think its huge though again his presence on both ends giving them that Dre low pul pre uh presence and then a guy again defensively that can rebound for you a rejection at The Rim Andrew Carr thought he was going up for a slam but Kell degraph said not on my watch and I like this right here uh Doug he kept the ball in play again sometimes guys try to punch it into the stands thats a big time defensive play by De graph well after four consecutive dnps degraph enjoyed backtoback outstanding games against fairly Dickinson and then in the win over forom bringing something tonight for the Highlanders as well and hes going to go to the free throw line after being fouled at the basket by Fon Reed Applause youre absolute youre right Doug he was huge Off the Bench for that in that foron game 12 points yeah I was just going to say how about whats on the screen there Malcolm I mean along with the basketball the fact that this young man has two degrees postgraduate in chemical engineering hes just stacking degrees he showing off as far as Im concerned well I can only speak for myself but I would say uh hes probably uh just between me and you that broadcast team I would probably uh bet on him being the smarter of the three if I was picking thats pretty impressive yeah you could add my GPA and your GPA and we probably still dont get to where Kell is and the coaching staff really Raves about uh him uh their short experience with him uh thus far really uh he has added so much to them and waited for his time and again that last game a win a huge win for them against forom uh 12 points uh in them coming off of the bench and a huge put back with 20 seconds left on the clock to put them ahead off the Steel by gray the Highlanders have cut the deficit to three aen toou with another bucket and what do you know the Demon Deacons are being pressed by their first time Rivals out of the America East Music conference hes experienced it as a player and as a coach and again A lot of times that word home run higher out there does but if youre init I cant ask you cant ask for a better a person leading this program and I think really theyre going going to get going in the right direction that success under coach Bill mey Millers layup snaps a 13 to1 R for NJIT remember weight led by as many as 15 points in the half but in a very short period of time less than four minutes the Highlanders got right back in it Sal blocks the shot from Gray here come the deeps little give and go Miss shot though z k finish it was a beautiful pass that time by Miller just unable to finish tough looking shot by Tariq Francis Miller from the elbow no fight for the rebound comes to the Highlanders traveling violation another turnover committed by NJIT the New Jersey Institute of Technology from Newark New Jersey they have only been a division one program since 2006 when they transitioned up from D2 and I tell you what in their 18 division one years heres something that will put in perspective how long Kell degraph has been on this campus he has been there for a full onethird of their division one history six of their 18 years thats amazing and right now though you know Wake Forest the concern is the turnovers NJIT 11 points off of turnovers and wake right now again when they have not been able to get out in transition credit NJIT theyve done a good job being disruptive and then keeping wake out of the paint they forced them into some very difficult shots wake has committed seven turn overs NJIT has coughed it up eight Applause times boy NJIT handled that very nicely they get a layup out of the Manhattan gr transfer Music Daniel tear drop hter Sal again making look easy at the offensive end he averages over 18 per game and he is got wake for back in front by five and thats all set up by Miller kind of the hockey assist again he started that play off on the right side nice crosscourt pass and that led to an extra pass to a nice little floting gray with turn the demon make my goodness that almost went for frecks but hell head to the free throw line to shoot air and Y Frederickson already has a new career high in his brief college career with nine points chance to get to double figures from the line for the 63 freshman out of Bixby Oklahoma he originally signed with Notre Dame but then got a release after Mike Bray announced he was leaving at the end of last season acpm with Mark Packer and Taylor tound weekdays from Marks Charlotte studio in his basement at four easn theyll continue talking college football of course and have the latest from around the conference right here on accn and the ESPN one minute remaining in the Music Applause for to shoot Highlanders got a decent look now they can use another 20 seconds on the shot Music Applause clock the corner clean looked for H he has money at the offensive end for NJIT and thats great use ofre the when they dont come andit guards have done a ni job sneaking theen the that beautiful in the Music Applause corner corner Matthew his first being declared eligible as a twotime transfer played his freshman year at LSU then last year at Gonzaga Hunter Salis off the bounce and a foul on the Applause Music shot theres a good look at Hunter Salis whose mom Jessica Haynes played at San Diego State and then played professionally in the WNBA she could dunk Hunters mom 6 feet tall she played for the Utah stars back in 1997 and she and her son are very close and uh he has got some very talented jeans in him no doubt about that and really hes going to be a huge piece for what wake wants to do this year another big time pickup for Steve Fords and staff Id like to start to this second half though again they come out and try to attack the paint early on and you know what on Mothers Day in 2020 Hunter wrote a beautiful letter to his mom Jessica on espnwcom that if you havent seen it its worth a Google just to see how he and his mom love each other so much and to end for the third time tonight thats Kevin bopy Miller hes into double figures and speaking of Love Steve forb must love the way hes seeing out of Kevin B Miller uh his ability uh to accelerate in transition really Doug has been impressive you can see why he Compares him and says hes got a little bit of thae Apple be in Applause him that was banked in from an odd angle Makai Ray is going to take it but that was not a thing of beauty if he shoots that 10 times he maybe makes that one maybe twice twice you got to call Bank from there but they will take that and they continue to hang around in this game Music Applause NJIT thats a nice look from Andrew Carr who penetrated got a paint touch looked back and found Zack Keller standing there all by himself and thats key dug to that right there they got the ball in the paint you dont mind that three again thats a pretty good look good floor spacing and again the ball went inside to the paint Ki it back out to a wide open shooter de graph answering at the other end 45 38 Wake Forest neither team defending the threepoint line well both teams over 40 from Beyond The Applause Arc Applause Miller Here Comes Robinson no number all five Deeks got back and so the Highlanders will run some Applause offense Robinson dumps it off thats a nice looking set de graph has two more and that is a beautiful pick and rle play that time and look thats been the key for NJIT theyve had issues turning the ball over that time in their half court set great execution H thought about it Applause Music Applause Music nice move by Maki gray give him seven and once again its a threepoint ball game and Doug thats all set up by spacing NGIT has spaced the floor out and they have waks spread out so far again theyre getting dribble drives and because theyve shot the ball well from the threepoint line guys are hesitant but they help off youan and tried to tie it hildr protects the ball hes fouls him and so the Junior from Worthing England will shoot a Music pair hildr one for two from the line tonight he is now 32 for 3 six this year hes among the ACC leaders at around 90 And if youre wondering why does NJIT Play Wake Forest in basketball again its the first time these two schools have met well the athletic director at NJIT Lenny Kaplan likes to play games nonconference in areas where they have alumni and and so NJIT has a good alumni presence in the state of North Carolina and specifically in Winston Salem and as part of the four guarantee games where they get money from the larger school to come and play and that is typically the blueprint theyve only got two games on their schedule this one and the season opener as you see at Miami where they actually have to get it on airplane but the money that they make off of these guarantee games goes as you know Malcolm a long way towards funding the athletic department absolutely and I think a great reasoning behind that again obviously anytime you can get your alums involved and get a chance to meet some of these young men and obviously the program and the school and the institution has meant so much to those folks again just a really a great thing that theyre doing at NGIT and again this is an 18th year Division 1 program from Newark New Jersey giving Wake Forest all it can handle in this nonconference game tonight Wake Forest catches in in transition up to the rim was Andrew Carr and thats all set up by wakes defense Again The Bigs doing a better job hedging on ball screens and then right here cam hilis does a nice job of locking and trailing on that screen pass misses Here Comes wake again in transition Salis right to the bucket and met at the rim Applause that quieted the crowd and at the other end Elijah Buchanan calmly buries the pullup now whether or not NJIT is able to pull off the upset uh the coaching staff will show that last play right there that is a great hustle play in transition to break up what looked like was going to be a uncontested layup de grass going to be called for the foul on the post entry intended for Fon Reed the Highlanders hanging around the Demon Deacons here in Music Winston ESPN when we partner with the B Foundation to highlight the urgent need for cancer research this is game changing research that helps save lives you can join the fight against cancer by visiting theorg donate and keep in mind again 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research dug that video every time I see it really um just so powerful so impactful that dont ever give up and obviously cancer has impacted so many people so many families and really all the great work that the V Foundation does really just a phenomenal thats a great Baseline out of bounds coming out of the timeout they find Hunter sales down the lane for two well thats what they need more of again a continued attacking uh in the paint thats going to be the key for them and then right here theyre going to have to do a better job defending the threepoint line NJIT right now over 40 from the threepoint Applause line NJIT has picked up at shooting to stay in this game now 13 for its last 21 H leads all scores with 15 and its once again a fourpoint difference I love the way hildr penetrates stays on time on balance and just Waits until he has an opening and great uh body control that time bully ball that time again dont settle for a jumper and thats beautiful jump stop jumper under control great body control Music Applause by NJIT has never LED trying to beat an ACC opponent for the first time after four tries yanans three is Off the Mark and here comes hild right to the basket and the Applause whistle thats been their advantage 12 fast break points to two cam hildr right here showing off the body control thats just a big boy move right there jump stop jumper and then in transition Doug that is a beautiful finish through contact much needed bucket for w just occurred to me watching those two highlights Malcolm he could have fit in with those great villain NOA teams for Jay Wright the way he plays absolutely and again Steve Forbes and staff they deserve a lot of credit for his development again weve seen him get better better year after year and uh he continues this season coming in early on though close to 18 points a game he is Applause Music averaging numbers for the Highlanders a second chance for HS 0 for two on that Applause trip Applause Fon Reed tried to establish himself on the post hes playing with three fouls couple of the Highlanders also with three fouls degraph and Applause Buchanan Applause heres Buchanan step back three little strong hildr with another rebound thats great blocking out that time by weight as a team all five guys had a body on somebody and Reed just picked up his fourth personal foul and thats not a good decision right there and we talked about blocking out by wig thats an even better job of Team rebounding by NJIT not a good foul by Fon Reed and so hell take a seat once again on Steve Forbes bench shrier goes out for NJIT the Highlanders hanging in there 8 minutes gone here in the second half at the Applause Joel good drive by Gray hes a lefthander goes left all the time just couldnt finish poopy Miller with that quick First Step he missed the layout and both teams getting some pretty good looks Doug guys just unable to convert at The Applause Rim Strong Finish First two points on the night for Sebastian Robinson the threetime Rookie of the week in the ameres conference the coaching staff you can see why theyre so high on this young man that time a great body control to go around the big and cut this deficit back down the Music six car off the great fakes sets up Salis here come the Highlanders in transition Francis had a good look Robinson the offensive rebound hell pull it back out and thats a heads up play a lot of times guys get an offensive Rebound in that situation think they got to rush it back up get the possession you got a new shot clock you Canon and the shot clock expired before Robinson got off the shot often the Highlanders have been as close as three points here in the second half they have never LED tonight the Demon Deacons have been able to keep them at arms length but as you see Malcolm they are facing another drought three and a half minutes since wake scored and credit n jits defense theyve done a nice job doing this right here being disruptive and going back to the earlier number points off of turnovers theyve done nice job of creating some offense with their defense yeah Grant billm told us yesterday in terms of you know you go on the road playing ACCC opponent like wake you you have to do what you can to control the tempo maybe slow it down a little bit but with all the turnovers theyve forced theyve been out in transition constantly theyve been looking to push throughout the throw down by Kell degraph well hanging around weve used that word a couple times that phrase a couple times but it all starts on this end for NJIT theyve done a good job contesting and then being disrupted uh against Applause wake and de graph again went straight up defensively after going straight up on the other end for the dunk and beautiful interior passing right here and again uh the defense of Wake spread out but theyve done a nice job spacing the floor and then their bigs have done a nice job finishing and when theyve had their opportunities around the basket degraph gets called for the foul 20 ft from the basket trying to close out and that is his fourth that is a huge problem for NJIT Miller gets it back guarded by Sebastian Robinson Salis for three good crash for the board by Keller The Possession continues with the Freshman Frederickson back on the floor number 20 in white Keller again that one Applause goes just like that well wake pushes it back up to a sevenpoint lead and thats again better patience and youll take that three ball dribble Drive gets into the paint draw the defense and then kick back out Robinsons pass knocked Applause away Salis picks up his dribble now brings it back out to Miller who calls for a screen inside out go the deeps another good look and again on the glasses Zack Keller but that is now I dont know if theyre looking at the shot clock and again if Im forbs although you like that there on the play that looked like it was going to be a wide open pull up jumper for boy Miller and thats a break for NJ it again one of the rules they put in a few years ago if you get an offensive rebound the shot clock if you do it in the front Court the shot clock resets to 20 if you track it down to the back court it goes back to 30 Miller two more for the red shirt sophomore out of Victory Rock prep in Florida timeout with NJIT down nine wait for a 60 and the Highlanders 51 biggest lead of the night came in the first at 15 but I tell you what malcol NJIT having been blasted in each of its previous four outings in their division one history against ACC opponents doing a nice job still hanging in there they lost by 41 opening night in Coral Gables to the Hurricanes a much different Story So Far here this evening and I think theyre getting more and more comfortable we talked about their breakdown a nine newcomers freshman and then some fifth year guys but theyve done a nice job hanging around in this game Ive been more impressed though with their defense theyve done a nice job creating turnovers and being disruptive to Lake offensively no surprise inside Andrew car now with six points wake has four players in dou figures thats been one of the stories this year theyve got four guys averaging better than 15 points per game the only division one team in the country that can claim that they uh have some fire power if Im wake Im going right back to that same play they ran last time see if you can get car poed up in the paint NJIT to Applause double little flip shot by Daniel sh Off the Mark Miller takes the contact no call and its NJIT Applause basketball and thats not a good play that time by Miller again you have a lead be a little bit more patient you dont mind getting into the paint but again you had success the previous play Going Down Low to your Music Applause big down to seven pull up by Robinson Applause no miller with the head up finds from the other Wing frecks who picks up in the second where he left off in the first you can see why Steve Forbes gave him High Praise and said hes one of the best Shooters hes ever signed and Steve fors has had a lot of really good shoters in his coaching career and that is a quick release right there in transition off a nice find by Miller 13 points and 20 minutes off the bench for Frederickson Robinson airballs it Demon Deacons trying to take advantage in transition Hunter Salas give him 14 points and the Wake lead has ballooned to 14 dug their defense that has been the key in this run theyve contested and then theyve been able to get out in transition and they have dominated that area in this game fast break points 172 the advantage to wake in Fast Break points yanan with the pullup double team on the post back out to Frederickson Miller penetrates passes to the corner Salis again from the midrange no the tip in by Andrew car Wake Forest with its largest lead of the second half at 14 and Hunter Salis the SE the junior rather from Omaha taking in that here tonight 13 and counted you can see why theyre so high on this young man his ability to shoot the ball quick release and Doug he put up huge numbers in high school over 270 made three scored over 2100 points and again you put him out on the floor with a guy like Kevin boy Miller hell be able to G uh and get some uh shots uh because of wakes great uh Flor spacing and this was a huge coming out party for him tonight Frederickson as a high school senior last year averaged over 30 points per game so you know he can get hot and this is the first time the Deacon fans have really gotten an opportunity to see that scoring ability Elijah Buchanan into double figures now for NJIT Fon Reed back onto the floor for Wake Forest having yet to score tonight playing with four fouls he comes up to set the ball screen tend to shoot here is Reed and thats not a good look and not one that Steve Forbes and staff wanted again they prefer to a with his size Advantage a down low on the Block let him go to work there dont want him settling for contested jumpers to graph the last to touch Grant billm has his team down 12 do they have another push in him here in Winston I think thats kind of under the radar right now quinson Bradon now of that team right there is dangerous as we take a look at a beautiful transition off by w Andy Miller with the beautiful F to Applause car yeah you say Clemsons under the radar theyre not going to be for long they have you know gotten into the rankings the last couple of weeks number 24 in the AP pole Joe Gerard at 21 points today and the win for Clemson over TCU and so the Tigers how about freericks get 16 points to extend that career high timeout called its a 30 second timeout well be back in half a minute as wake for is puts this away Youre 15 or more points hes into double figures now off of this slam off the beautiful feed from boopy Miller all name team boopy Miller and Doug Ive been impressed with his ability to set his teammates upy with the L to car and that is beautiful transition offense by Wake Forest and right now Miller has six assists in this game to go along with 13 points and Steve Forbes has been raving about how much better Miller has gotten since coming to Wake Forest that from their first scrimmage to now nobody has improved more than Miller and his assists continue to go up he continues to involve his teammates while still getting his own it it really is a transition for him right Malcolm it really is and again credit uh Steed force and his staff uh we ran to graphic earlier guys like Jake laravia but guys like alandis Williams that have come into this program and have continued to get better again that does not happen by mistake uh his staff and uh coach for do a great job of getting these guys to play the way that they need to do in their system he came into this game 10th in the ACC in a at 36 per game and travel against Salis but I I dont think its a stretch to think Miller is going to climb those ACC ladders in terms of assists per game based on what were seeing lately and especially here tonight well coach for says look hes reminds him a little bit of Tai Applebee and you can see why again his explosiveness his ability to get into the paint I think for me the big thing I was impressed with his ability to accelerate and then finish through contact and then set his teammates up as well too really uh youre right I would not be surprised to see him be one of the top ACC assist leaders two minutes to go Miller with the rebound in the basketball another paint Touch under control give him two Applause more Kevin bofy Miller and the Demon Deacons closing in on a sixth win this young Music season its gifting go time in the ACC there you see the graphic only division one school to have four players averaging 15 or more points per game and so Frederickson came into the game averaging only 33 its been a quiet night for Fon Reed his second game as a demon Deacon scoreless S still and his night is over after having picked up his fifth foul never got going but there will be better nights for the sevenfooter from Richmond Virginia and I think it goes to the balance that Lake Forest has again R you have a team that can put four and five guys in double digits but theyve done that on a consistent basis another rebound for Miller lost it Salis has Applause it Carr got the defender up and lays it in he may get to his average of 153 Applause yet Malcolm we havent even mentioned deari mon Santo who the deeps are still hopeful they might get back by the end of the month and if you bring that sniper into this mix theres another great offensive weapon that maybe if his rehab continues as they hope he could play December 30th against Virginia Tech if not sometime early in January and this will change the complexion again for Wake Forest for the better one of the better threepoint Shooters in the ACC you talk about a guy that can out shoot it really uh that is something that uh many folks will take an eye on with this wake team getting him back in a healthy Monsanto he really to me Doug was a guy that spes the for with this weight team you get him back into the lineup and they become very dangerous with the leadership of poy Miller lot of WalkOns on the floor Now Kevin Dunn will Underwood Owen kdy but its the scholarship freshman Parker Frederickson who just keeps filling it Music Applause up now Doug folks are going to look at this score and say okay maybe it was an easy game you know right now looks like theyre going to win by a 20 but dou make no mistake about this this game was very close 8 minutes 10 minutes to go in the second half jit was uh very much in this game again at the end folks are going to look at the score and say look it might have been an easy game but give credit to NJIT they hung around for quite a bit in this game Kevin Dunn one of the WalkOns from right there in Winston Salem with a bucket and a rebound Jaylen Robinson scored for NJIT at the other end but that will do it NJIT pushes wake but in the end the Demon Deacons were just too much they pull away for an 8359 Victory well at the end of the day Doug its a win a balanced performance Again by W Force D fors have to be pleased with how his team shared the ball and then the Freshman Parker fingon really an impressive performance for him a guy came in that was only averaging three points uh he wound up with a game high 19 points yeah five in double figures Frederickson the career high 19 Miller 15 Salis 14 hildr and Carr both with 12 thats been the script for the Demon Deacons so far this year they improve to six and three on the year and jit drops to two and seven for Malcolm hucke and our entire crew Im Doug Sherman thanks for watching Wake Forest beat NJIT 8359 now we send it to the studio Luke Hancock and Justin wal here
