dealers Lance Terry did not play in the first meeting between the two teams hes in that starting lineup That Coach Pastor has used for the last seven games for the Yellowjackets the opening tip control by Georgia Tech and the white Louisville the traveling red Music and we thank you for sticking with us after most of you just watched Clemson defeat NC State 9671 of the Tigers improving to 135 at ACC Plus fog goes against the cards Ron groover mark schner Mike Palau our officiating crew this afternoon at mccamish this is Terry Ellis defending him well get inside of the paint Franklin was blocked and finally forces it up on the rim nice place yeah nice play by Franklin Hundley halfway played great defense Franklin not giving up on the play interesting see thats a matchup that Ive been watching you know and looking forward to this afternoon Jayvon Franklin the senior gets us started in the opening seconds of this one Music working it around the perimeter Atlas driving open Lane hes a great drive by Ellis he nearly comes up with the steal for Georgia Tech youre going to have to give him different looks because when we highlighted this is a guy again playing just as well as any guards in the ACC as of late 21 points a game high for Ellis in the most recent game on Monday for Louisville a loss on the road at Duke Coleman fires a three and for Georgia Tech you want to be able to move this Louisville defense again going east to west you want to shift it theyve got guys out there that can knock down that shot again GC Georgia Tech fall back in what looks to be a a match up 32 Zone Goldmans now made 47 threes on the season on the weak side for Louisville and Mike James was there and ready offensive rebound is one of the things Kenny Payne talked about for this Louisville team if youre Georgia Tech when youre in scramble mode you got to turn and put a body on those players Yellow Jackets are 11 and 17 on the season three and 14 in conference play 106 overall on their home floor Kelly from the corner too strong good contest by Withers Kelly you want to run him off of that threepoint line they didnt put the ball on the floor Music its Elon Ellis Applause almost produced the turnover Coach master and Coach Payne talking to Ellis coach Pastor who wanted a turnover instead the goal is when youve got a trap you always want to defend UC Franklin get his hands on there late whistle right there almost can sympathize with Josh Paterson looked like Franklin may have had his hand on his arm so Jayvon Franklin picks up the foul for Georgia Tech Louisvilles four and 24 2 and 15 in conference play one last Saturday at home against Clemson for their second ACC Wayne 8373 snapping a fourgame losing streak Withers didnt get the bounce try to follow his own miss good Hustle by Withers and theyre going to get Coleman for the foul for Georgia Tech while we have a second lets check out todays keys to the game brought to you by your local Ford dealer report hes tall and from Louisville do you want to be bullies in the paint you want to be able to tag the paint go to the offensive rebound for Georgia Tech theyre a team that you want to create early offense the key for them offensive is how can they get to 70 points Withers at the free throw line red shirt Junior Charlotte North Carolina just up the road 78 percent of the season for the strike Jalen Withers foreign line in the ACC this is Coleman stepping into the three ball what looked at me a turnover by Kyles third event turned out to be at the wide open three for Debo Coleman again for Georgia Tech you want to get Pace even if they score you want to not have to face up against that half court zone or mantoman from Louisville 483s now made on the season for Coleman who grabs the rebound starts the break Music Applause Withers up on Kelly its dangerous Georgia Tech player Franklin now Kelly hit the deck after the three Withers fell as well Music Ellis waiting for reinforcements tries to drop it inside and he does successfully the trainer and Tom that was set up by Ellis pushing the pace trainer coming back Georgia Techs got to do a better job of getting back because L Ellis is going to push that pace and try to get them to early office whenever he can Sherrys the cutter in the paint Applause last tears and got also that hes going to look to try to get into that lane can shoot the three ball but he needs to get downhill try to get into the midrange early Terry averages just over nine points per game this season hes got his first basket of the game right there struggled at pit he was old for four and fouled out of that gameplay just 15 minutes the double dribble violation against the Cardinals again we always talk about the fact that Georgia Tech wants to touch that paint Lance Terry comes in Georgia Tech up early by three Music Kelly for Georgia Tech we talked in the open about him having a career high 24 points in that loss against it and when you look at those numbers career Howe also in 63 for Georgia Tech I feel like their offense gonna go and they can get him established because hes their best threepoint shooter getting him off along with Debo Coleman what allowed them to touch the paint a lot easier Billy also had six points 16 points rather in the losing effort on the road at Louisville where the teams played on February 1st its a 10point win Louisvilles won eight in a row in the series at home theyve won 13 of the last 14 against Georgia Tech with the basketball right now and Goldman whos connected on a couple of Threes early in this one loss on Tuesday on the road at Pitt 7668 for Georgia Tech Sturdivant shot clock down to seven passing tight quarters nearly knocked away from Franklin spit for the rim got a fist full of metal and got fouled monthly Hatfield were going to see Georgia take realize dont have another option certified gets down there good defense defense and again if youre Huntley Hatfield you just stay solid and basically when you have David Franklin hes a guy athletic enough to go and try to put it right in the rim great looks right behind the back Franklin in his last six game Pride averaging a double double 14 Points 11 boards and 61 percent from the floor for number four for Georgia and I think is his energy the fact that you dont have to run a play for him uh his shot blocking has definitely been a huge Plus for them and on the other end a guy again athletic enough to go to the upper room so to speak were going to knock down easy layups and then finish at The Rim hes been very aggressive in the opening minutes of this one kick back out for a three for the cards Lance has it for Louisville and thats what Louis has to do for this Georgia Tech Zone get into those gaps forced him to collect and then make that next pass and again you saw a wide open threepoint shot great pass back door to Kelly this is Terry at the other end misfires fight for the loose ball James went to the floor for Louisville headed to Ellis and that is off of Georgia Tech will stay at that end of the floor and thats one of the things that Georgia Tech is going to have to do today is get back in transition because we talk about LL as he wants to get downhill you see two guys right there Kelly coming up with that block thank you again youre gonna have to keep him off balance because he is going to be in high Pursuit all afternoon long Sydney Curry 21 in red has also come into the game 68 senior 270 pounds in the middle this was knocked away from the fingertips of trainer Terry three Georgia Tech getting to early offense Tom with the fact he saw getting that ball get the deflective uh possession right there coming back getting an early knock down three for for Tears Terrys got five points in the first half his first three of the game did not score in that boss twos be a pit box at 10 for Ellis Applause double from Atkins produces a turnover up ahead Franklin couldnt handle it one of those unforced turnovers you see he John faster yelling at Kyle Sterling you do well to get a turnover and then thats the first turnover for Georgia Tech you have to be able to capitalize on that especially for a big guy like Franklin hold on to it anything give him a chance to go get it at The Rim seventh year for Coach Pastor on the bench for Georgia Tech 14th year overall approaching 300 victories in his coaching career Turn Around from lands lets see a little brush screen by Lance getting right into the lane your pass for him and hes one of those guys again strong and athletic enough to be able to elevate over smaller guards down low how about lands hes got five points almost at his average of 58 per game Perry on the drive and the Miss and lands comes out of the spread Ellis quick First Step L illness and again we talked about his ability to put pressure on the defense Georgia Techs got to do a better job of understanding that when he turns the corner just watch how quickly he gets downhill absorbs the contact and then able to finish again Tom Ellen Ellis and this last week and a half has been playing its just as well as anybody in the league last four games about 25 points a game 55 from the floor in that span as well having been scoring and trying to complete the old school threepoint play for L Ellis the senior from Durham North Carolina coach pastor already pacing those sidelines three and six at home in conference play for Georgia Tech three and three in their last six games but coach faster told us Brian they could have won all of them well in a lot of games that they came right down to the governor just couldnt finish and you see England Moore come in and turn over thats one of the things for Georgia Tech you could not turn the ball over against this Louisville team because again thats one of the things they want to do is get downhill and try to establish getting that ball in the bank facilities come into the game as well for Louisville number eight on the handle right now number 11 rather Music Coleman gonna pick up the Georgia Tech foul its the second one on Debo Coleman foreign Music six points in the game for Coleman hes the leading scorer so far for Georgia Tech Ellis and lands both have five James hes flying out of that corner a couple of moves and then uses the backboard weve seen on multiple occasions from lands with Georgia taking that one three one zone hes been able to get downhill the best way to beat a 131 is to get into those gaps no one has come over in him youve seen multiple occasions lands being to get right to the bass good finish with his left James has four points for Louisville the turnaround off the rim from Sturdivant work on the offensive glass and Franklin all the effort nothing to show for him Lance trying to shed his Defender trying to save it couldnt do it Sturtevant one on two to the rim Withers blocked it away there was a whistle on the drive by a Sturtevant Louisville on a 70 run over the last Georgia Tech and one of the things for Georgia Tech is that his shot clock in ability you see the numbers almost two blocks that game fourth in the ACC has given them an opportunity to turn good defense into offense because his athleticism has allowed them to be a team that can get those stops get into early offense and again when you look at the last numbers I mean look how big he is big over the last five six games with points rebounds and those blocks well five got five blocks on two occasions also shooting 61 percent from the floor doing it all and I would classify him as bouncy and aggressive around that Rim Brian you know occasionally if you know what after this if he doesnt have a plan career over he can go work for UPS you get as he delivers my man right no hes got UPS oh hes got UPS too okay all right well he delivers too absolutely yeah hes been impressive almost nine points per game leading them in rebounding as well close to seven points per game Sturtevant is in fact at the free throw line foul was against bacilli for Louisville who hadnt seen action in seven games prior to this afternoon so Kenny Payne throwing a little Wrinkle in there in his line and one of the things that I see for in this first half for Louisville already 12 points in the paint that was one of the things I think that theyve got an advantage especially with Georgia Tech mixing up their coverages 56 percent from the line of the season for Sturdivant you wouldnt know it for those two senior from Norcross Georgia Applause Sturtevants played a lot of basketball Brian is 108th career game were seeing that these days these days you think that when you see with the the covid and then the additional years you see Coleman get called for that foul um but probably would be his third foul and the things that Josh passing can illiford because Sturtevant there is that when you go back to Louisville and look at the team that they have on that floor Sydney Curry is another one of those guys look at how massively builty he is interesting to see if Kenny bank and give him a touchdown low because hes a monster in that block but glory is 6E 270 and a soft touch right there from Ellis I knew that LL is coming out of the game would be for a quick blow third in the in the league in minutes played about 36 you get a whistle with Georgia Tech in possession just over 11 minutes to go in the first half we see why so Lance Terry will go to the bench for some medical attention Ellis got nicked up as well and officials are going to take a look at this one can you watch on this drive and I think Lance Terry probably got caught right there by the elbow Ellis on that pullup jumper obviously being right there I dont I dont look at it as being ill intent but again you see right there hes drawing blood you see both the players be intended to so Ron groover and Mark schner they just came over and talked to Brian and basically said that there was no no contact No Malice in the contact because again if you look at the plate watch where he elevates and it just he catches Terry right as hes going up in his shooting motion and again they basically doomed that there was no ill intent its going to be a play on so no flagrant fouls involved there keywords being excessive flagrant one extreme for fling group two but no evidence to support that basketball play so Ellis now has seven points Brian that leads everybody in scoring in this first half not surprisingly second best in the ACC Terrys tough he wants to stay in there and he will I thought it interesting when we had a chance to talk with uh Louisville coach Kenny Payne hes talked about L Ellison in numbers hes scoring hes always encouraged him to get everyone else involved early and then after that slowly look for his offense thats kind of what weve seen here in his first half him trying to get everyone weve seen Lance get a touch and some other players in them every now and then you see him try to get downhill already the seven points of the fish at three for five towards patients employees that he has shown recently not necessarily early on in the season feeling like he had to do everything well I think thats where youve seen this team play a lot better because they had to have some type of system in play where players are trusting the system and theyre not as energetic enthusiastic as I would like to say to try to rush up uh shots and Trust the system trying to make sure we get the floor cleaned up Robbie kremens courts named after the legendary Georgia Tech coach that was dedicated back in March of 03 and The camish Pavilion has since been refurbished some early numbers only one three for the carts so far Georgia Tech and Coleman has knocked down a couple well it stands down for the news of 14 points in the paint by Louisville hes an eye on the shot clock inside of 10 now heres Terry hell step back for three interesting and response to Lance Terry again sometimes I mean you get a guy he can see his own blood kind of gets him going it seemed like he was hunting that shot listen to see again its good to take his time for his ball game how does that ignite Lance Terry in the Yellow Jacket basketball team eight points for Terry couple of made threes Curry to the rim too strong and Coleman possesses it Applause he got fouled lands and Vasily for defending him and found him can you see this last time see Taryn realize that if youre gonna pass under the screen knocks down that threepoint shot and this is one of the things that Josh Pastor said that you know at times they struggle to score but when you get Lance Terry with his rhythm Miles Kelly playing better and then you know what Kyle Sturtevant has picked up this allows the Georgia Tech game on the last six games have been able to find better ways to score keep an eye on that Georgia Tech shooting percentage just 29 on the road on February 1st at Louisville and 10 point loss in the first meeting between these two teams this is Terry both sides of the rim as it bounces out to Withers collection he really thought he had that one shot it right in front of us Applause stumbled in the corner prior to the shot attempt by trainer double dribble but even before the tournament by train how about that pass Ellis looked like he was already in no mans land on that trap having enough patience to be able to get that ball overpass two other Defenders our broadcast position today is just to the left of the renewable bench and Penny Payne right in front of us so we are right in the middle of the action as Kelly saves it to Sturdivant High arching three Applause encouraging his players to push the pace I give Georgia to take an opportunity to get set up with that half court defense tied at 19 Louisville took an early nine point lead on the road Monday at Duke they would not stand up Trail by nine at halftime and lost 7962 Music Withers stepping back deep into the shot clock once again ball did not hit the rim and then chipped in trainer and JJ trainer is another one of those players for Louisville last three games 13 points a game he is long and wiring talk about with a little bit of Bounce look at that offensive Rebound in the putback tied his career high with 16 points at Duke on Monday for trainer winners on Coleman Kelly in the corner Applause Music first points of the game for the leading scorer this season for the jackets a great bond by Debo Coleman again Scouting Report tells you that you know what you have to make sure that you keep Miles Kelly in your rear view mirror again hes one of those guys again you can ill afford to make it going because he is very streaky split points and bunches averages just over 13 points per game that is the best on his Georgia Tech roster Louisvilles made five of its last eight shots went on a 103 run to take the lead after Georgia Tech getting back into this one Coleman goes high for the rebound up ahead try to run the floor just knocked Away by Withers with a block by him good whos getting back in transition will look to be an easy basket but Jalen Moore Taylor Moore defending into the corner Terry lines it up Applause Music Applause one point lead for Georgia Tech into the corner Withers he hits a three yeah thats a glance at the crowd as well good penetration by Mike James again Force the defense to collapse you guys Jalen Willis wide open you see Kelly with a quick response and Applause neither team being able to actually pull away Applause Miles Kelly now 67 made threes on the season best for the yellow jackets offensive foul Huntley Hatfield for Louisville Miles Kelly doing it on both hands of the floor you saw him absorb that charge and then again come down strike a pose not down to three Tech up by one left of the Georgia Tech bench to watch the action this afternoon thrilled to have him in the building right now this is Georgia Tech up by one neither team has been able to expand this league greater than three interesting to see whos going to England this last you see great move by trans tears for the and one and again Im going to tell you man theres a player sometimes when you see your own blood Tom it likes to fire man because again you see that hes picked up his level of aggression you see again coming down and attacks the big Sydney Curry not sure that Ive still got the The Wonder of to doing that but coming in absorbing the contact and the Finish great finish at The Rim by Lance Terry 83 for the freethrow line this season Lance Terry Music Applause its very often 30 of 36 for the stripe coming into this afternoon threepoint lead Georgia Tech Curry back its out of the paint Kelly comes away with it Id like to see City Curry take one more dribble down low Georgia Tech is not having one and can stop him from getting to the rim dont want to settle thank you great pointer from Coleman again what weve seen from Georgia Tech is that every time they get a chance to touch the paint Force Louisville to have to converge on the ball a little bit get the ball out and its been Terry and then also Miles Kelly and Debo Coleman already seven three pointers you see air ball by Jalen Withers Sturdivant runs it up attack from Iraq for Georgia Tech and Kenny Payne wants a timeout a 100 run for the jackets how about a little bit of a heavy by Kyle Sturdivant again Georgia Tech being able to extend this lead anytime that they pay certain good defense on one end able to get downhill you see a lot of the frustration by Kenny Payne again you watch Carl Kyle sturvin willing look to be almost like a little bit of a hesitation move gonna go right down and finish up the basket give Georgia Tech an eightpoint lead Sturdivant led the team in scoring in the first meeting February 1st in Louisville with 17 points that was a 10point loss for the yellow jackets you see over the last minute and 24 seconds Georgia Tech on a 100 run and again for a team that traditionally struggles to score already 32 points with six minutes left to go that Georgia Tech averages just over 68 points per game thats 13th in the conference theyve made Seven threes and again thats what they average for an entire game Brian Oliver thats ninth in the ACC 72 threes per game for Georgia Tech during the course of the season Music this is where Louisville gets back in this game Georgia Tech playing the mantoman I feel like Louisville can get the balls inside and try to punish them in the paint lands tough shots degrees lens has been that one that it seems like hes been really efficient Georgia Tech has not been able to stop him from getting his team everything right now three for three perfect from the field love the way that hes been able to break down the tech Defenders a great pass over to Jayvon Franklin again Kyle sturdivin has done a magical job being able to probe that Lane Louisville has to do a better job of trying to not allow him to get those easy passes yellow jackets have made their last five shot attempts double on Ellis able to get it to lands on Terry offensive five good defense by Lance Terry and when Sydney Curry gets that ball hes got to check and realize a lot of times you get those little guards down there theyre pesky theyre looking to try to take take that offensive uh foul and then the last play again on Georgia Techs end watch Franklin wide open again for a big guy like that throw it up at The Rim we talked about how bouncy he is Kyle sturda been doing a good job of being able to to get the ball for the big at The Rim how about Sturdivant seven assists in the first half and heres the thing is that he has been able to get Jordan to take those wide open shots talk about already seven three pointers and how hes getting everyone else involved is his building hell be able to score Louisville comes out with a little bit of a 131 of Their Own Applause be frustrating for campaign because again when you look at a guy like Miles Kelly but you know he shoots the ball real well Georgia Techs got seven threes you cant allow him to be able to just give you a little bit of a ball fake and still shoot an uncontested threepointer eight of 14 from threepoint real estate in the first half for Georgia Tech land trying to keep base and Kamari lands is the one for Louisville again we talked about L Ellis has given them the offensive blow already nine points still perfect from from the field at four for four lands as the Freshman from Indianapolis Indiana who averages about six points per game already above that in the first half Applause approaching the fourminute threshold in this first half and Coleman dragged the pivot foot turns it over solid defense by Lands that one time felt like Debo Coleman didnt have anywhere to go broke that fit that foot right there if youre Josh pastors you sub him out and bring in more this is one of the things you do not want to do you do not want to allow Louisville to get back in on countless careless turnovers coach bastner looking for a win against Louisville hes just one and eight against the cards as the Georgia Tech head coach hes only a couple of years removed from an ACC tournament championship Moses right as the player of the year in the ACC ENT lands long rebound and Sturtevant able to grab it to the corner Sturdivant midrange lands had it for a second now gives it to Ellis Ellis a couple of feet behind the line easy board Franklin were going to see Kenny Payne trying to encourage his team not so much to get to the first open shot to get to the second third option A lot of times you want to be able to get to your third option to force that defense to have to move and shift so Louisville is now two of nine on threepoint attempts their 10th in the conference threepoint shooting Franklin a little show and go watch out bit of an awkward fall from Franklin there about two or three more games for each team for Georgia Tech picks up their last Mayfield goals out of seven Georgia Tech is on the road Tuesday at the Dome to play Syracuse and then March 4th at Boston College we could have shot the regular season and you know I appreciate the candid nature from coach Pastor during our conversation hes looking forward to the tournament he knows theyre going to be playing on the first day in all likelihood and wants to make a little noise there in Greensboro Ive always thought that at the end of the regular season you want to be playing your best basketball again everyone wants to shoot for that Covenant double by but the teams have got a nice little rhythm Josh said that he thought that some teams that maybe still needing a couple of wins to be able to get into the NCAA tournament may have a little extra pressure on him so but its important for them to finish off strong right now in a good position this first half already up 11 Ellis slipped down stirred of it the other way Terry out of the corner Terry turns it over coming out of that corner that last play Down ABC Ellis looks like hes limping a little bit not sure if that is a slight hand injury or not and for Louisville with a little bit more than two minutes left to go theyve got to get something in their half court offense last few possessions will come up empty still feel like theyve got a lot of advantage on being able to bring Georgia Tech down get that ball down low James a series of moves a pass the sturdament he wears a different colored uniform good weak side help by Jayvon Franklin its nine turnovers from the first half for Louisville by the way this Louisville program eliminated Georgia Tech at the ACC tournament in the first round last year in Brooklyn its a Miss from Terry and a foul on the offensive glass more in the vicinity for Georgia Tech the first against Moore Louisville no main field goals over the last two minutes and 55 seconds again going into the half we want to have some kind of momentum if youre Kenny Paynes team a member of that 1986 Louisville National Championship team is on the staff at Kentucky 2012 for a national title and they watch this Mike James advance to the rim and thats what theyve been able to do get to the second and third option because again with the guys that they have that are athletic and long theyve been able to get to the rim nice drive to get downhill by Mike James inside of a minute and a half to go in our first half of play Georgia Tech has built a nine point lead Terry sent it back out to Kelly leaping over everybody is Franklin for the putback and you saw Franklin go up thats one two thats one to win you go back and you consider those the 5050 balls you had two Louisville Defenders right there he just wanted it more went up and got that offensive rebound for that finish to extend takes lead to the left Franklins got five rebounds in the first half Music for three back iron Terry Moore go lay up Georgia Tech has done a good job Tom with being able to limit Louisville to one possession and then get those Steals and get those easy opportunities you see right now Yellow Jackets up to 13 moved by Taylor Withers Up and Under like Brian Oliver back in 1990 MVP of the ACC tournament back in 90 well slide to that cool 50 after youre done you got it they look out for your boy by the way that tournament 90 was played in Charlotte North Carolina five seconds Brian Oliver Sturdivant free throw line and he beat the horn a little bit of double Cuts Kyle Sterling put him on a skateboard a little bit of a hesitation what better way to end it you see a little bit of skateboard a little bit of a heavy but you know what right there at the end put it up to get the yellowjacks the 13th generally good things happen for them because theyve been able to touch the paint tipped out of bounds by Franklin this is the 41st alltime meeting between the teams 45 points for Georgia Tech the most points in the ACC game this season and that 4532 the largest halftime lead for the yellow jackets so Ghostbuster told us weve been scoring points thats why were in games and were three and three in our last six wide open Hundley Hatfield on a rim bender and that was Ellis because he pulled two Defenders over there and that allowed the big to be able to go right there no one came over to stop Hadley uh Huntley Hatfield and that allowed him to get an easy basket the way to start off the hats Louisville gets the first two of the second half teams have played 13 times as ACC opponents Louisvilles 111 against Georgia Tech in ACC play Franklin what a fake and two nice nice move right there as well the whole thing say birds will fly frankly got one a nice little ball fake as you see down low Huntley Hatfield trying to get a little position down there 11 points now for Franklin that is off of Coleman again watch this move by Jayvon Franklin again most Biggs if you show them show them the ball hes going to jump in them being able to gather himself to finish 14 times this season into double digits for Jayvon Franklin the senior from Little Rock Arkansas on the handle knocked away from Huntley Hatfield whistle stops playing a foul against the yellow jackets on two separate occasions you see LL is trying to get the ball inside for a big he understands that He commands so much attention and then by that last time getting the ball over the Huntley Hatfield drawing that foul sure Kenny Payne is telling his team that we got to get stops on one end and continue to attack that bank Well Ellis is the senior from Durham North Carolina played there against nuke on Monday and had 21 points LED everybody with those 21 in the losing effort for the cards on the road shot clocks at 10 Music third event Huntley Hatfield get tangled up three instances wherein Louisville has gave him the ball down to Huntley Hatfield Georgia Tech has been Switched at last time you saw them have Kyle Sturtevant down there doing a good job of recognizing in this match again if Im Kenny Payne I continue to go back and try to pound that ball inside first year head coach Kenny Payne for Louisville Kelly brings it up goes around his Defender Applause Miles Kelly but heres what set that up youve got to honor Kelly as a threepoint shooter enough of a hesitation to get the big to bite on and stand him up and in the blowby did you see it again Kyle Sturdivant down low trying to hold his ground 11 points for Kelly Hundley Hatfield three attempt Sturdivant over the top Georgia Tech ends up with the basketball so Kelly now 21 times the doubledigit scoring this season the best on the jacket roster and almost traveled and almost threw it away Kelly money from three thats got to be frustrating for kidney pain because again thats the one guy you do not want to have a lost coverage Louisville fellow fell asleep on that when Georgia Tech has extended this league to eight and heres the thing when youre Gotti can shoot the Rock and youre four for seven this is what you get because again you see him be able to blow by and athletic enough to be able to use the rim and shield off and watch that acrobatic it looks like Tom wormy over at the LA Fitness getting his run on Church League how about Kelly 14 points four of seven from threepoint distance in the midst of a 70 run and if you go back Brian to the first half with about seven and a half minutes to go its a 3010 Georgia Tech run and thats one of the things and for Louisville I thought that when they came out they were able to find something on these mismatches but you got to have enough discipline to make that extra pass and not try to bully the guards right now you see Sydney Curry down there with Lance Terry you got to find a way to get the ball and punish Georgia Tech with those mismatches Ellis varying the speeds on the drive it goes out of bounds and off of Georgia Tech and good defense by Jayvon Franklin a lot of times when you have that mismatch and L Ellis there are not many people in this league that can stay in front of him once he tries to get downhill 33 points at Miami for Ellis in midFebruary 30 points and 10 boards and a doubledouble against Western Kentucky that was a twogame winning streak they beat Florida a m in the next game and thats an offensive foul good defense that last time by Lance Terry again Mike James going to him watch how he saved gets his feet set right there takes it right between the numbers and again that is the classic offensive charge Kenny Paynes team is that theyve got to be disciplined youre not going to get back into this immediately you have to chip away you got to get some stops and stay a little bit more disciplined with your offense hes going against the team thats won its last three home games in Georgia Tech against Florida Tech out of division two Virginia Tech and Notre Dame Virginia Tech the last ACC win February 15th for Coach pastors team 7770 as they give it back to Louisville a little miscommunication between Kelly and Sturtevant again for Louisville spacing important you want to shift his defense from Georgia Tech forced them to defend first two or three possessions and then see if you can get down him dont forget this Louisville team lost by a point four times this season this lands finds the target but again that play by itself you saw three passes you shift the defense and you get a wide open uncontested shot thats how theyre going to be able to chip away at this lead and get back into this game Kelly Music lightly Off the Mark Applause lands coming out of the corner gets the soft bounce not soft enough second effort Curry knocked away from him and he got he got filed in the process good offensive rebound by Sydney Curry but as big as he is that first time he went up I didnt think he needed to clock race for the contest Miles Kelly pick a foul for Georgia Tech were going to take the time out Yellow Jackets after 5237 lead against Louisville it would appear by Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina we start with the cards Brian absolutely you see Tuesday taking a long Virginia Tech and then finishing up and Virginia Tech excuse me in Virginia Virginia in a big game tonight against North Carolina Carolina desperately needs this Virginia coming off of that loss up at Boston Josh pastner and Josh pastner go to the last two offense Syracuse teams and finishing it in against Boston College that last Wednesday had a huge win well we have a moment a message from Coyote Tractor my experience if you work the land youve got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of Music it Applause Sydney Curry is at the free throw line for Louisville you mentioned that win against Florida a m at home that was his big game of the season 19 points for curry who hits both free throws hes a senior second year in the Louisville program out of Logan College in Illinois I see Louisville changing up there a little bit going it looks to be like a 131 Zone again for Georgia Tech you got to get into those gaps you do not want to settle Sturdivant and again he finds Franklin trying to drop the hammer got fouled on the dunk attempts and watch Kyle Sturdivant sells it with a pump face Curry put a Franklin Curry a little late over there thats one of the best ways to get through that that zone get into those gaps but at the free throw line Applause you want to stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer starring Brian Oliver well give you potential allconference team player of the year Coach of the Year all kinds of goodies if I gotta slip you another 50 Maybe but I do appreciate that major TV star and it needs to be noted well thats we should call it sleep in the barrel but you know what I started with you a long time ago oh you started with me yes and your Ascension has been amazing and I give you all the credit in the world for your work after a sensational basketball player man you know what can I hit you with venmo how about the move by Mike James earning some free throws I get what Im saying for Louisville is that when you get a chance to shift the defense and then you get downhill theyve got guys that can put that theyve shown on different occasions that they could get into the lane now youve got to finish but you got to get some stops on the other end six points in the game for James first trip to the freethrow line Applause hes an exciting freshman in this lineup for Louisville no question about it well and you look at the length the length and athleticism its a process theyre getting the guys to themselves talking that you always dont take advantage of your options the disciplines you see right now extending themselves on this um defensive effort right here and something theyve got to stop Georgia Tech and not allow them to get what they want their first and second looks so James is up to eight points thats a miss out of a corner from Kelly and pulls in the rebound foreign Applause knocked away might have been the quick hands of Sturdivant to knock that one out of the clutches of course Louisville back all the way over here and again you see that last time watch with Sydney Curry gets down you see a hand by the bill Coleman wasnt it I thought I heard a little skin over here which pain was dramatic a new player Louisville maintains possession and a soft bounce is there on the Move by trainer I cant over emphasize the Louisville you see how theyre able to claw back in this game they have guys and they take advantage of the mismatches get the ball inside youve got to force Georgia Tech to make a decision where theyre gonna allow him to play oneonone Little Pony led by his 18 Terry Slams on the brakes Curry was waiting Coleman misses all the way to Ellis another good defensive possession by Louisville theyve gone into that zone even though Jerry touched the paint coming up with another opportunity again falling inside forced him to adjust goes out of bounds and it is off of Louisville Kamari lands had a great look right there that time he couldnt go and see Kenny Payne he tell him that hey son you got to finish that one because Im wide open you love the penetration you just got to finish that 12 points for lands as he heads to the bench and Withers comes in for him the last three minutes and 52 seconds Georgia Tech went out of field goal Terry recognition by Jayvon Franklin again with the ball on the floor you get that to just hesitate get over the landing again Georgia Tech amazing job of shooting the three ball Army freeze James Applause with a powerful move that was a bully move because again when you look at watch Mike James realize hey Im its where I want Im going to shy away from the contact Lance tries to stay solid jumps into him for the ball in the midair and you sit back and say hey you know what got a little mouse in the house action right here give me the ball I am hungry double digits for James at the free throw line which make it 11 so Mike who has started every game as a redshirt freshman from Orlando Florida 11 times into double digits and above his season average of 94 points per game you see both teams kind of find some things that are working for for Georgia Tech you see that touching the paint for them just work for them Franklin kept it alive Coleman that was Franklin over the top of Curry second on Franklin one of the doubledigit scores for Georgia Tech despite that foul Brian yeah and heres the thing for Louisville this lead had ballooned to 18 theyve been able to cut it down to 11 again go back to whats been working shift this defense get the ball inside touch that paint elevates and hits watch out cards clawing their way back into this one for them better job of being patient so check you have to get back and touch that paint Louisville playing this zone right now you see the Louisville cows Georgia Tech you stay disciplined touch that paint Force the defense to purge a little bit and get a hopefully uncontested shot guards are on a 93 run Kelly on the drive thats that offensive foul Music you see Bobby Griffins over there again you watch now Ellis what looks like could have been on the side of him again its a good thing good Im sitting there but then on the end now lets get into that midrange jumping and itll take elevate a little bit of the momentum shift Tom wormy for Louisville and Ill be cut to the lead to nine possibly eight sister leading scorer this season has nine points on four of nine shootings three of 12 on threepoint tries for Louisville in the game Withers forces his way down the lane Moore came away Applause down a little bit Applause Franklin to the basket free throws upcoming Ellens has picked up the foul for Louisville that theyve got a lot of skill players for them to be able to cut this lead down to what is it nine now theyve done a good job to make Georgia take Georgia take his last score over the last 208 and then theyve done a better job of being able to be patient and attacking attacking the bank yellow jackets have connected on 10 threepointers in the game Franklins at the freethrow line theyve made nine threes in the Lost hit on Tuesday over the 28th takes the Panthers I love that look from behind the backboard that is my favorite shot and I thank my director for taking that shot is he still here Jay Hoovers our producer were so glad that youre with us Tom wormy Brian Oliver with Georgia Tech Legend privilege to sit Brian Oliver inside of McCandless Pavilion on Bobby crimens Court Louisville down by 11 again kind of like a broken record you see Georgia Tech has gone into a zone right now whats a record theres those old circulars I seriously dated myself a tough Miss right there Brian from trainer that have been a huge bucket for Louisville absolutely and again for Georgia Tech get that success touch that paint more in the paint see that last time I feel back in all four to go in the second half Lance Terry trying to create some space foul against Ellis so hes picked up a couple of quick ones to his surprise and his head coach Kenny Payne you see a little bit of a its Franklin at the free throw inside of the Mr Zella Ellis misses so like thats the shot that LL has traditionally cant hit but Glory but youve got all the success in being able to get the ball inside I would like to see him pull that ball out and run their set all of a sudden Brian both of the teams have gone a little bit cold the defense on both ends has been better lets see wide open shot by Lance Terry on the Run both points to Louisville James Watson big stud Huntley Hatfield and he got tangled up with Kelly Sturdivant was in the vicinity as well and this is where for Louisville the discipline comes in that shot was a shot that yes Mike Jan shoot why not give your guys your big guys a touch inside because Georgia taking the second half has not been able to stop you through the ball and especially with his lineup thats the fourth personal foul on Miles Kelly who has to exit the ball game and Debo Coleman comes back in Kelly with 14 points Franklin leads away with 15 Coleman has nine as he comes in and how they Hatfields at the free throw line first or the dead truth lets look at the throat there behind they had some Miles Kelly on the on the bench theyre into Tech how long do you keep him on the bench because again the best threepoint shoot right now because they continue its eight of ten from the stripe as a team for the cards the difference is 10 were inside of 10 minutes to go in regulation Sturdivant Georgia Tech just one of its last eight shot attempts Terry comes up short more and lands were fighting for the rebound and theyre going to get lands on the personal foul and thats one of the things that Kenny Payne talked about is that Georgia Techs ability to get off his house you see right there layers get caught the jersey of Jalen Moore theres got to be something just as simple as turning putting a body right now Louisville has the edge and read eight for that rebound so weve got Ron Gruber and Mark Schnur taking a look at the sequence Brian and you looked at maybe theyre looking for a hook and hole Im not sure but right there you see what could hold yeah you see lands with a little bit of Jersey there as he fights with more and Ron Gruber just came over and gave Brian the update yeah he did he said its going to be a hook and hole one and youre gonna shoot two shooting foul and then theyre gonna get the ball Applause so flavored one against lands hes on the Louisville bench thats a critical junkie with 90 42 to go Brian in a 10point difference and because I thought that Louisville was doing a good job of playing defense that last time you have to get that rebound and the last thing you want to do is get caught later so the play deemed excessive the hook and hold more at the freethrow line and though the first tech points even thats something per game second in the ACC well I think as well its not the three ball the benched squad has not come in and give him what theyve been used to and a lot of thats been Louisville left doing a better job of contesting shots and not allowing them to get the pain touches but then again Georgia stat Georgia Tech now is a lead up to 12 being able to extend this lead if they can Terry bounces out more Hundley Hatfield did well not to foul well theres great supportive for Louisville and thats where hes most dangerous L Ellis is one of those guys if you allow him to get you with your backpack youre gonna take those again his ability to finish lets cut this lead down to 10 Ellis has 11 points 25 times in double digits as a concern about the leaders in the ACC second conference in scoring its his way into the paint Franklin Applause Georgia Tech it seems like theres a lid on that basket wonderful no field goals over the last five minutes for the yellow jackets Henley Hatfield was fighting with skirt of him down low heres Franklin with a onehanded Jam soaring to the rim well Ill tell you what Tom wormy Sometimes the best thing to do is get a steal and go and make your own Jay Von Franklin with 17 points the last two of a thunderous variety on the Slam by Franklin Ellis his way between the ball out of stadies with Louisville and Franklin being able to get Lane we talked up that he could go way up the run to finish man thats the Flop like that a long time ago used to a long time ago 17 points for Franklin ties nine thats way above his season average of 88 Applause defensive possession rides a little bit back and forth Music the Cardinals trailing by 10 inflation but Jay Von Franklin today Brian Oliver 17 points five of it on the floor Music and his energy going down to stretch this game but theyre gonna theyre gonna need a lot of funding for jackets we talked about how well they shot the ball from a Honda Accord come back to life a little bit only two for now they are Music just three of 14 on threepoint shooting Applause shot clock at 10 for Withers on the drive strong move lefthanded move by Withers but you saw that move to this when the ball reversed as the defender came on he had ripped through to be able to use his momentum and gets him to the blow by and finish with opposite hand three at the other end again Kelly comes off the bench and well talk about the yellow jackets and they had struggled only two for nine Kelly comes back in huge three extend this lead back up to 11 17 points for Kelly 17 for Franklin Ive made threes Miles Kelly Music Applause Music on the move and heres the thing Jayvon Franklin played as good a defense as he could how about the Finish By LL is being able to use the rim to be able to Shield off acrobatic finish Louisville refusing to go away Coleman Uncorked the three bouncing around to the miss Ellis again Louisville maintains and this is where this is where when you were fighting on the road and you see the blowby right and then how it helped satisfy Grizzly Mike James been calling for that offensive foul thats where you have to be patient especially when you realize you have the advantage of the smaller player why she does the duck in on last and then again Terry does a good job of trying to get away sure if that was enough to Warrant offensive foul its been a very theres been a very physical game on both ends you see both teams fighting for position Kelly down Lakeland on Lee Hatfield defending Franklin trying to muscle his way to the basket he got it back you see that last time I thought they should see last time you see the move by Franklin Applause apparently Hatfield stand solid right there we go with a good opportunity right now Withers was stumbling James got it back moves into the paint and lays it in games and even though Jalen Withers could not come up with anything that still forced Georgia Tech to have to confirms on the ball on the deck and now Louisville again with another run into cutting this lead down to seven 13 points for James stir the handle they go low to Franklin who sends it right back out to Coleman shot clocks down to eight been trying to save it Ellis turns on the Jets puts it up on the rim and the slam trainer again momentum shifting for Louisville turning another Health right now in a three run he passed them one at the timeout to try to gather his troops you see a lot of Cardinal fans in there letting them hear it again you see Coleman sets it in and then youre off and running LL is realized got an acrobatic trainer there in the Finish upstairs finish Im wearing Greenfield has used the defense and they have been more patient and more disciplined as they going off on this last little run 10 points now for trainer after the alleyoop jam and a folks made that drive about five hours or so to come to it to watch the cards and support their team theres a lot of cardinal red up here in mccamish and again as of late Louisville has given their fans cheerful and its been a game of runs at one time it seemed like that Louisville was going to get run out of the gym Georgia Tech expanded that lead to 18 but Louisville has been able to chip it away yet it was 5234 about three minutes into the second half Applause 103 run for Louisville if Im in the Huddle of Josh passing Georgia Tech go back to what you were doing to get that patience you shift him left to right you try to put the ball on the floor you got to be more into when you get that ball and then for Louisville you continue to stay up in them you limit Georgia Tech on their first and second options get out and run when you can Applause Sturdivant trying to get by Mike James staying with him a little far away from Sturdivant he was fouled into the nice hand by Kyle Sturdivant and being able to get down that we saw in the first half him being able to pull the lane and watch him right there realizing being there and doesnt have any place to go gets himself gathered see James on the foul first half big assist a big bucket to cold cool on by Louisville two for two from the line in the game for Sturdivant just 57 this season but again knocks the other one Applause I feel like any pain undiscus got something right now that they can use their advantage theyre going to run ball a couple of times run a screen and look to get that ball inside the Hatfield second effort more came home looks like theyre going to call it how about the block by Jalen Moore well it looks to be great pass by L Ellis it looks to be an easy bucket for a Huntley Hatfield and then Jim Morgan comes over and send yours has been denied at The Rim great great God help but again good recognition by L Ellis incredible look at that block from right behind the backboard by our technical crew and the hell ball Arrow favoring Georgia Tech with the basketball and the lead by eight as we cross the fourminute threshold in the second half Terry bounces out more with the follow and he leaves it in for Georgia Tech well Jayla Moore has come in two big plays with Georgia Tech and the scene that they were on the road so one big block and then the putback can stand that lead back up to double digits little 50 run from Georgia Tech Lance trying to answer the three cards again was the penetration by Jalen Withers again Georgia Tech fell asleep great recognition to get over got to get now this could probably come down to the wire Music George attack has attempted 23s that ones a Miss for the bailout by Kyle Sterlington I thought that hes better whos trying to get downhill now this expected by Price hit the floor hes going to take the guy down so you can take advantage of it Franklin to the rim

giving up on the play hes got a high motor and for Georgia Tech coming up with steals weve already talked about his athleticism I feel like thats been on full displayed again today yellow jackets have had times with Ace sputter up on offense and hes filled in those gaps beautifully for Franklin first year in the Georgia Tech program making it impact transfer from Auburn and South Alabama Music coming off a 15point performance at Pitt on Tuesday also had eight boards he has upped the Annie this afternoon against Louisville just a little less than three minutes left to go in this game Louisville still got plenty time what you have to do is that youve got to get into your set a little faster than usual again theyve had a lot of success in getting downhill you do not want to start jacking up threes you still got plenty of time to get what you want Applause three second violation against Louisville Music Applause see right now Louisville extending their pressure the Georgia Tech

Terry and the rebound Franklin should go under the two minute Mark for Georgia Tech again you want to make sure that you run some clock Yellow Jackets 12 threes Franklins working on a double double

career high and assist for Sturtevant considering that Davon Smith was unavailable again Brian for his fourth straight game with a right ankle injury Sturdivant continues to step up in the backcourt for Georgia Tech yeah especially in the first half I thought that we talked about them getting those eight threes did a good job of being able to probe the defense in the lane and get those wide open and then tonight and then excuse me the second half for the village Ive received good playin by L Ellis final minute now after the Ellis bucket hes up to 15 points lands also has 15 near field Kelly gravitt and lands had to follow him stops the clock 519 remaining Music heres todays Coyote Tractor Turning Point Brian EC Lance Terry wide open over there knocks down that three with Georgia Tech was searching for a little offense hes had a huge afternoon the yellow jackets making 12 threes today thats definitely one of the bigger things for them is what looks like they may be able to hold on and win this game considering they only average about seven made threes per game exceptional today Terry Sturdivant Franklin Kelly all in double digits and you look at sturdiven with a double double and then we talked about Jayvon Franklin with a double double 19 and 12 Applause Music 10 of Kellys 19 coming in the second half James met in midair by more in a foul consider the fact that Georgia Tech had lost four in a row in a series Prime 13 of the last 14 and only one win against Louisville since it joined the ACC well we talked with Josh pastner earlier he thought that again that they were playing just as well as anyone in this league because you know there are three games that they basically could have won theres a game thats North Carolina state that for the most part was right in it and they played against a very good pit team and had Lance Terry in foul trouble that was another victory that they could have and hes shown I mean right now yellow jackets at 80 points kind of felt like the magical number is getting to 70 and they found ways to score it when you look at it youre gonna knock down 123s youve got your big and Javon Terry excuse me um frankly they could give you 19 that just shows the yellow jackets have been playing better as of late last win against Louisville for Georgia Tech was February of 2020 and a win at home 6459 it appears that Georgia Tech has done enough this afternoon to get another home win that would be four in a row at home with this afternoons effort trainer got the foul from Louisville and Terrys at the freethrow line Georgia Tech trying to close in on its fourth ACC win this season and improved to 116 on their home floor Bobby kremens court with Bobby cremins in attendance just to the left of the Georgia Tech bench make sure that if

dad wow Cowboy Cal was a sharp shooter played at Wake Forest Im sure Cal is in attendance and very proud as you hear the crowd tells him to shoot it he might get an assist Franklin adds another two and that will do it the final count 8367 Georgia Tech Over Louisville huge day for the yellow jackets I think it was their threepoint shooting Louisville was able to climb back into it with some good defense and get into the cup Yellow Jackets had a couple of good runs in the second half to be able to seal this Victory Jayvon Franklin the DoubleDouble 21 points and 14
