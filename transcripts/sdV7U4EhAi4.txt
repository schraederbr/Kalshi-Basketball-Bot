we kick off the new year with some ACC Music hoops and Reno wins the tip Stanford in the road red and Clemson in the home Music white there is REO the leading scorer and rebounder in the ACC less than 10 to shoot for the cardinal sers the pullup and got it to start the game and pretty good ball movement there by Stanford on that first possession got it moving from side to side in a great extra pass and oiah sers a transfer from SEC knocking down that jump shot and thats what coach Kyle Smith said today theyre going to have to shoot the ball well from the perimeter to try to get a win one thing to pay attention to in that Clemson starting lineup Victor lockin playing under the weather today was really gutting it out apparently in pregame warmups here he is defending rno and r no spins right to the cup for two well needless to say Stanford is going to play through 42 in red Maxim righto does a great job of getting great position and that time locking trying to go for the steel and got burned because of it Clemson coming into the afternoon two and0 in League Play as lockin first shot is snatched off the rim he wanted a goal 10 on Reno who is the lone returning starter from this Stanford team a year ago Blakes deep three and the Duke transfer makes it a seven nothing lead well anytime you go on the road in conference play youre going to have to get off to a quick start and that is exactly what Stanford has done here needed that from Clemsons leading score Chase Hunter and that twoman game between Ian shefflin and Chase Hunter has just been terrific both those guys integral parts of their Elite eight run last year and playing extremely high level here again so far this season it is a Stanford team that has played just one ACC game I suppose you have to call it that even though it was against Cal welcoming two West Coast teams into the conference tap back wont go and here comes Clemson yeah I think its going to take some adjusting for everybody to see Stanford and Cal in the ACC as we see a great take there by Jaden Zachary drawing that foul but its going to take me some time its going to take everybody some time to get used to seeing these teams in the ACC but they are playing some terrific basketball this year as we see Jaden Zachary the transfer from Boston College whos played a pivotal role so far this year for Clemson Joey Gerard their point guard a year ago exhausted all his eligibility but Jaden Zachary has stepped in extremely well into that role hes been a big contributor for Brad brells team has scored in double figures in three consecutive games coming into the afternoon Applause Ryan agarwall running the point for Stanford here gives it up to camon and he cans at three you know its really interesting I dont want to call it a throwback but both of these teams are very similar with regards to the twoheaded monster inside see the length there of camon bothering Ian shefflin on that shot but both teams have two guys that can step out and knock it down from the perimeter oh my goodness Stanford is hot to start osiah sers for three and Clemson is a terrific defensive team but Stanford right now just playing with all the confidence in the world to start this game they have hit five of their seven field goal attempts and three for three from downtown and mentioned it earlier Kyle Smith said he needed to get off to a good start and they have done exactly that you see the great Post Feed there to Rau for the easy two and then great skip pass and great screen on the other end and oiah sers knocking down the three and the Cardinal doing what they need to do for their first match up against these Clemson Tigers T to shoot for the tigers shefin with five zacher Quick Pass Wiggins Baseline jumper rattles home and thats a tough shot right there a little 10ft midrange jump shot sort of had to forced it up because the shot clock was running low but Stanford so far doing a pretty good job on the defensive end of the Cordon not allowing anything easy for the Tigers Jaylen Blakes he check three wont go and Reno last to touch it thatll go back to Clemson Clemson we talked about how good theyve been defensively this year but you see the ball movement there and thats what Ian shefflin can do hes an inside out threat but hes a great passer made the extra pass to the opposite we Wing to Jaden Zachary the extra pass to Chanty Wiggins and chy Wiggins the guy to me is is the one thats going to have to play well for Clemson to have a a really really good year in the year that theyre hoping they can have hes got a lot of physical ability knocking down that brid right his jump shot but a lot of potential for number seven in white lockin tries a Applause three isnt it amazing we talked about it earlier sometimes you play your best the games where you know youre not feeling very well because youre so focused on not feeling well that you play loose and free but big guys for both teams back team right now getting away with the travel there the crowd letting him know about it but the big guy stepping out showing some touch early Music on and thats great defense by the tip of the spear defensively for Clemson Jaden Zachary winning it back for the Tigers down three early on New Years Day and warming up at 215 by himself he did not particip participate in the team shoot around at 800 am earlier this morning feeling under the weather getting tons of treatment throughout the course of the day so he could make his start this afternoon and what an impact he can have on this team particularly replacing PJ Hall from a year ago PJ Hall an allconference caliber player and currently going up and down in between the NBA and the g league with the Denver Nuggets but Victor Lockett has stepped into that role extremely well saw earlier knock down to three very skilled good defensive player complement Ian sheins game really well so the more hes on the court the happier Brad brell is going to be Hunter Twan game picked off camon with good hands in the Applause Music lane heres Reno defended by sheflin Brad Brownell told us locken would start on Reno but it was going to have to be a combination of bodies to defend the big fell good rebound Dylan Hunter and a second opportunity for the Music Tigers five to shoot Hunter kick back shefflin a three something keep eye on in this game will be the pace Stanford so far not in a hurry to get up and try to score and transition doing a pretty good job of running their halfcourt sets well using a lot of the shot clock very deliberate with what theyre trying to do oh Brad Brown Al what a success story he has been at Clemson ushering them into really what you could consider the Golden Era of Clemson basketball now the winning as coach in Clemson history and since the 2017 18 season the fourth winningest program in the ACC consistency is the one word that comes to mind with Brad branell in this program it just seems every year theyre right there near the top of the ACC and I dont expect this year to be any different they are extremely talented first h of the game for Zachary and counted in the foul Victor locking doesnt look sick this afternoon Clemson basketball is known for their defense and right here turning that defense into easy offense on the other end great deflection great steal a great bounce pass and love that by Jaden Zachary of rewarding Victor locking for getting out and running good catch finish chance for the threepoint play lock him with a quick Music five goes to show what we know earlier during warmups we theres no way hes going to play does looks like he feels terrible coming off a great bounceback game against Wake Forest his line is indicative of what they want for him 13 points nine boards a season High six assists pair of blocks pair of steals thats the type of guy he can be for Brad brownells team well you know what youre going to get from Ian shefflin and Chase Hunter on a nightly basis thats a given but to get that kind of production from that third guy really is going to determine how successful Clemson is throughout the rest of this ACC season early lead for Stanford has vanished after the 80 tiger run and agarwall stops the threeminute scoring drought Zachary got away with the push and floated it off the window yeah Stanford bench clearly not happy with that no call looked like you got that forearm a little bit extended but when you play on the road especially in the ACC youre not going to get all those calls but a great move there by Zachary three for mager wall Stanford has missed their last two from Deep after hitting their first three three Hunter a step back and the rebound by the Harvard transfer Chisum oara who could be an exactor for Stanford if they are to be successful in this league this Music Applause season you like that shot from Reno hes certainly capable great take there by Chase Hunter hes certainly capable of shooting 38 from behind the arc this year I dont like seeing him settle when he faces up he is so skilled and so good and with the rules this stay and age when you face up you cant get touched or hand check like to see him put the ball on the floor like oara did right there oh yes and won the hard way for the Harvard transfer you mentioned it Chism oara the Harvard transfer putting his head down and getting to the rim and a good finish you know a little undersized at about 66 67 but strong physical player and great job initiating the contact there and tell you what Ive been really impressed with the start here offensively by Stanford showing a lot of patience taking great care of the basketball oh one of the things that you talked about at the shoot around today when we were chatting with Kyle Smith the Stanford head coach physicality of this Clemson team how would Stanford stack up so far to start this game theyve been up to the test they absolutely have and this time go in their two3 Zone and careless turnover there by Clemson a little uncharacteristic but yeah Stanford has not seemed like they have been phased whatsoever by the physical defense and the physical nature of the Way Clemson plays handling it very well here through the first eight minutes Jaylen Blakes to sers and the USC transfer hitting from both sides to start the game thats the second time now oiah sers making that midrange pullup look really smooth leads all scores to start with Music Applause seven here is Dell Jones just into the game for Brad Brown now and another turnover on Clemson Clemson Tigers getting out transition early and Chase Hunter all ACC player finishing at The Rim but Stanford with the early threepoint lead here in Clemson returning the Cardinal back to National prominence well hes won everywhere hes been one in Colombia one at San Francisco one at Washington State now trying to get that Stanford program back to where it was like you mentioned but he is a phenomenal basketball coach longtime assistant for Randy benett at St Mary so obviously very familiar with the Collegiate game but especially the West Coast so really impressed with the job hes done so far here through the first couple of months of this season and especially the first couple minutes of this game very impressive from the Cardinal team Danny Kaylor yes sir Brad Brownell not going to be very happy about that defensively Benny gilers in the game to do one thing and one thing only and that is to make threes and you give him an inch of daylight hes going to get it up and that looked really smooth leaving his hand quick release Benny Giller former walkon earned a scholarship going into last season now hes a young man who started six games this year and it kind of goes back to Kyle Smith wanting to build the right culture first and Benny Giller certainly fits the culture hes trying to build at the farm well if you can shoot theres going to be a spot for you somewhere throughout the game of basketball and he has found his Niche here on this Stanford team I tell you what Stanford is playing with a really high level of confidence in the first half of this game really impressive Applause stuff thatll be the second foul on Chase Applause Hunter Chase Hunter first fans didnt like it on the replay Applause oh my and welcome to those of you joining us on acc Network Happy New Year from Little John Coliseum in Clemson South Carolina Matt Schumacher the former Louisville Cardinal David padet with you and an interesting start to a matchup that we thought had the potential to be very good David Stanford shooting exceptionally well particularly from downtown to start that helps anytime you go on the road and you shoot the ball well that certainly helps things but theyre playing well defensively too very prepared for everything that Clemsons trying to do very impressive start for this Stanford Cardinal and thats the guy thats got to get going here Chase Hunter got to get him going when he plays well this team is really difficult to beat well he is playing with two fouls meanwhile Stanford on a 10 run over the last minute and 48 and if you are just joining us on acc net they LED early seven zip hot start shooting the ball 60 from the floor for the Cardinal well Clemson one of the better threepoint defensive teams in the country and so far Stanford is four of seven from behind that line so Brad Brownell going to let his team know not real happy with that defense but give Stanford Credit theyve made some tough shots doing a really good job of controlling the pace using a lot of shot clock being very efficient with what theyre trying to do offensively well Victor locking coming back into the game he started today we werent sure if he would game time decision battling illness and tasked with defending the top scorer in the ACC Maxim Reno well Maxim Reno one of the best players in the country that quite frankly most people dont know about and thatll be a foul on chamok par trying to swipe the ball after the rebound by lockin well you talked about it Maxim Ry no of course last years most improved player in the Pack 12 probably arent a whole lot of folks that watched those games on the East Coast last year playing at 1030 eastern time but certainly he will be a big name in this conference going forward without question and understandably so just like you said a lot of unfamiliarity with the Stanford program and Cal program as well just being on the west coast this being their first year in the ACC Hy braider drills a triple and that is what he does thats exactly right we talked about Benny gilers in the game to shoot threes well Jake Hyer is as well but back to Stanford and Maxim REO was not picked for any of the preseason ACC teams obviously voted on by the media but I think a lot of that is just because of unfamiliarity a lot of the media people just not familiar with either program rejection by lockin and then a tie up Foster with Reno and the possession arrow points to the tigers on that last possession a great extra pass there by Victor locken instead of forcing the tough two inside and on the other end lockin protecting that Rim hes a Difference Maker when hes on the court we talked about it earlier stepping in try to fill the shoes that PJ Hall left here after that Elite eight run a year ago and has done a great job for Brad brenells team on both ends of the Court hter Basel L draws a foul on Aiden camon that is already the fifth foul on Stanford this half and this is a real measuring stick game for a Stanford program that is coming off a loss to a very good top 10 ranked Oregon team a chance for their first quad one win of the Season here this afternoon Kyle Smith said it today that Oregon game was a gauge of where they are and he said you know were just not quite there yet but so far today they certainly have looked the part oh yes counted in the foul for Applause Zachary one thing you got to do when you go on the road on conference plays you have to rebound the basketball well and that time Stanford giving up the extra possession extra opportunity and got burned because of it Jaden Zachary with the tough rebound now there in the lane chance for the three threepoint play now with eight points as he completes his second threepoint play of the first half the Junkyard Dog of the Clemson Tigers team according to his head coach and now an 80 Clemson Music run Blakes off the window and the Duke transfer has been a revelation in his first season its Stanford and no unfamiliarity with Jaylen Blakes coming into this building you mentioned at the Duke transfer just putting his head down right there and going aggressively to the rim really impressive finish has been their second leading score Hunter off the bounce yes sir and Clemson such an integral part of their offense is the point forward Point Center between Ian shefflin and Victor lockin who that time got the ball top of the key the dribble handoff their guards are so good at coming up that dribble handoff and attacking legs tried to scoot around the 611 locking and draws a foul Jaylen Blakes having spent a couple years at Duke no stranger to ACC play you see there just Strong finish going to the rim and really stepping in and playing a pivotal role we were talking to Kyle Smith earlier we said whats the difference been for him he just said you know what its the first time hes had a chance to play 30 plus minutes a game hes playing loose and playing with a lot of confidence and not necessarily worried about coming out of the game if he makes a mistake and hes played well because of it already six points three assists this afternoon played about 10 minutes a game off the bench last year at Duke and his head coach Kyle Smith said you know when we recruited him we did not expect this but they got him in the camp particularly in the fall and realized wow weve got something here in Jaylen Blakes great onew punch with their leading score Maxim r shefflin red checked it by Reno and wisely saved by sers bouncing it off the leg of sheflin well theres not going to be anything easy around the rim on either end of the floor tonight and you see Maxim Reno himself not necessarily known as a great shot blocker but that time timed it perfectly and a great save there by oiah sers to keep possession of that basketball still no points for sheflin already halfway through the first Music Applause frame Reno Fade Away tough shot rims down you know what makes that almost impossible to guard is the fact that hes 71 but his release is so high that was pretty good defense by lock in but sometimes good offense just beat good defense give credit to raino there for the tough turnaround jumper lockin creating space rims out out second chance and last Touch by Reno whos a little bit hobbly as hes helped up off the floor good game here in the first half at Little John Coliseum locking battling through illness glems it down Music four e e see right now one of the best players in college basketball and a big reason why is his feel for the game has such a great understanding of what to do with the defense how to read the defense you see that Time Jake H breeder there number three in white thought about going didnt Reno took his time didnt force the issue one way or the other and you see the skill there on that turnaround jump shot just an incredible incredible Talent he is he has drawn comparisons to Dirk nitzki from his head coach Kyle Smith just the way that hes able to create space and get tough shots off yeah and anytime youre going to be compared to somebody like Durk niskey one of the alltime greats but you can see it and you mentioned it his ability to shoot the three shoots almost 5 threes a game but shoots 38 and you saw the the footwork and the skill there around the basket so how do you stop him you tell me Im just glad I dont have to coach against him thats all I know Zachary rims out chef on the offensive Board Hunter the reload and now Clemson will reset with 10 to shoot inside to shefflin rejected by Reno again and sheflin still looking for his first points of the afternoon only 3 seconds here on the shot clock we take a look here The French Connection most of you guys probably recognize that guy there in the middle 32 in blue that is Victor wanyama former French national teammates as we see Chanty Wiggins knocking down a hug huge three there with 3 seconds left on the shot clock but makes a lot of sense why Maxim R know is as good as he is playing against Victor wanyama all those years over in France said he learned a lot from his time in the national team training camp ahead of the Olympics this summer onepoint Stanford lead less than 6 and 12 minutes to go in the first half with tough to force it over the top of that 71 right now well its in your mind I mean you want to try to get to the rim but certainly you know hes back there somewhere oh Blakes left it short got tapped back to him sers a third opportunity and puts it home for Stanford how about the quick reaction jump there by osiah sers just went up and got that ball out of the air USC transfer showing his athleticism a big time offensive rebound and finish and rebounding was one of the points of emphasis for Kyle Smith coming into this game less than 10 to shoot for Chase Hunter Zachary with Music Applause three and a couple times now here so far in this first half Chase Hunter has had a chance to take a couple shots and has Shi away and given the ball up I know hes certainly not a selfish player but I think sometimes when the balls in your hand especially late clock Brown BR all would like to see him be a little bit more aggressive and make a play has been their leading score all season long and a foul against clemon on the drive by Reno Stanford does something very unique on there underneath that aboundance place didnt do it that time not sure why but normally they have Maxim r no on the ball but that time Wiggins knocking down the three you see the offensive rebound on the other end by osiah sers so just when Clemson thought they were going to make a little bit of a run Stanford with the answer on the other end on the offensive backboard and now two fouls on Ian shefflin along with a pair on Chase Hunter something to keep an eye on throughout the course of this game as sheflin heads to the bench still scoreless on four shot Music attempts agar wall was fouled on the inbound pass by Jake Hyde breeder Music Applause Music Applause and its going the other way and chismo Par was open on that underneath that abounds play they just didnt see him and then tried to force it late turno over in the other way Stanford give them credit defensively for what theyve done so far here in this first half but just under five minutes to go holding Clemson to just 30 points done a pretty good job defending their sets worked hard on that for a long time today and and shoot around Hunter no lock in yes sir and the foul Applause and Victor lockin was a little confused there for a second he thought maybe that foul was on him looking at the official like what was the call there but an unbelievable tip in with the left hand Chase Hunter being aggressive that time getting to the rim just unable to finish but watch the lefthanded finish there while being held a big time tip in again Clemson has had Success With The Second Chance opportunities you mentioned it earlier Kyle Smith said rebounding has got to be a priority so Clemson doing a good job getting to the offensive backboard and now seven fouls on Stanford as agarwall heads to the bench with two Clemson in the bonus the rest of the way in this first half trailing by one Music Applause and the Cincinnati transfer ties it a 33 a Applause piece for Clemson 2 and0 to start League Play coming off a double digit victory over Wake Forest in which their defense was the key to their Music success already the sixth tie of the first half Blakes lost it and here comes Chase Applause Hunter Clemson starting to do a better job defensively of making Stanford more uncomfortable getting to flexions leading to turnovers b ball from Hunter puts it Applause in and a timeout taken by Kyle Smith Chase Hunter had to get going here a little bit offensively and faking the dribble hand off faking the screen knocking down the three Clemson taking that threepoint lead e well were looking forward to it Taylor meanwhile here at Little John Coliseum a threepoint lead for Clemson on a mini 60 run led by Chase Hunter who leads all scores with 11 points I Schumaker David padet with you four minutes to go in this opening half in Stanfords first East Coast Road Trip as an ACC team oara on the drive and he left it off the side of the rim a pretty good look there for okara just unable to finish with the left hand and Clemson with the threepoint lead despite Ian shefflin with no points here in this basketball game and two early fouls but picking up the slack for him has been Victor Lock has played very well despite being under the weather oh thats another tough shot by Wiggins theyd love to get more of that from him as ACC play unfolds without question he to me on film has been really impressive hes a legit 610 is a terrific athlete plays way Above the Rim theyd like to see him be a little bit more aggressive offensively and you dont have to tell that young man to be aggressive offensively Maxim right now just showing the touch and again when he faces up he is almost Unstoppable getting to the rim would you like to see them get him more touches in the paint here to close the first half you know they play through him so much whether or not hes touching it on the post or just getting the ball in his hands hes a great passer and you see this time Stanford with a steel trying to get out on the break aara through traffic no tap back good by Reno who now has eight plus six rebounds and a timeout taken by Brad Brownell willll be back in 30 seconds for the final 3 minutes of the first half from Clemson Music back from Clemson South Carolina onepoint game the offensive display David has been terrific in this first half yeah who says the midrange jump shot is a lost AR Chanty Wiggins that time knocking down the little turnaround making it look easy and Maxim right now with the soft touch with the right hand been so impressed with him was very excited to see him play here in person and he has not been disappointing at all 86 rebounds we mentioned it earlier leads the country in double doubles with 10 at about the halfway mark of the Season Stanford really impressive for their first East Coast showing as a member of the ACC not backing down whatsoever from this Clemson team long East Co road trip theyll have to pit next before they head back West and resume class in the rest of their ACC Music schedule locken thought about it for to shoot lockin going to work on the Frenchman and puts it home again showing that skill set locking a very capable threepoint shooter so you got to get out there and respect him using a little shot fake to sell it and pretty good defense there by right now but locking just finish it with that right locking now with 11 points Here Comes Zachary in Music transition and a whistle will give it back to Stanford this morning we didnt even know if Victor lockin was going to play had not been feeling well but little shot fake put it on the floor spin move and a great finish around the rim 11 points here in this first half playing extremely well picking up the slack with I cheffin sitting over there on that bench with two fouls and Zachary couldnt Corral as he goes crashing into our broadcast table and gets up under his own power he is just tenacious on the defensive side Relentless trying to create deflections get Steals on the basketball just a terrific on ball Defender after a little bit of a slow start offensively for Clemson they have caught fire here over the last 10 minutes Blakes what Lane parted like the Red Sea there for Blakes and Stanford back within one and a foul against the Cardinal and that foul is against Jaylen Blakes and just a breakdown here defensively chony Wiggins not on the same page as Jaden Zachary on that ball screen defense you dont you dont want to worry about the guy popping back to the top of the key you got to stop the guy with the ball first theres only one guy on the court that can score and thats the guy with the ball Brad Brownell not going to be happy with that possession when he watches that get on film meanwhile third trip to the line this half for Jaden Zachary and his first Miss from the line and a foul on Victor lockin that is number two on the Cincinnati transfer well the fans are frustrated with that foul but there theres no need for it as a coach thats very frustrating because youre 93 ft from the basket Reno clearly had the ball whether or not you fouled him why even try to tap it out of his hands just get back on defense because now you mentioned it just picked up his second and as you referenced a couple of minutes ago shefflin still on the bench with a pair 90 seconds to play in the first half here from Clemson South Carolina I thought Stanford here might try to get REO a touch on the post since Lins got those two fouls five to shoot for oiah sers Reno rejected right place right time wont go and Renos third opportunity no Applause Music good about the sevenfooter battle in the first half here its been what we thought it was going to be these two guys can really really play on both ends of the Court both very skilled offensively but you see that time locking showing the length and blocking that threepoint attempt and again if youre just joining us Vic their locking was a game time decision playing ill under the weather looked like he was lumbering in pregame warmups hes been Fleet of foot to start this contest as Wiggins will head to the line for Two Shots thats something Clemson worked really hard on today in their shoot around was the underneath that abounds play for loves to switch a lot of the action off the ball that time Wiggins just slipped it to the basket great pass got fouled going to the free throw line and that is now the second foul on chisim moar so he agarwall and Blakes all with two fouls and now Victor lockin will head to the bench great first half minutes from lockin double figures in scoring couple of blocks on Reno and some rebounds to boot a small lineup in the game right now for Clemson chony Wiggins their biggest player at 610 Stanford going to try to get the ball inside here to Renault let him go to work sers was fouled on the dribble pullup in the USC transfer headed to the line not a good foul there number one rules dont ever foul a jump shooter Clemson had played pretty good defense up until that point in The Possession not letting Maxim r no get a touch on the post its a little bit of a bailout there sending sers to the line sers one of four brand new players in the starting lineup for Stanford this year under first year head coach Kyle Smith and not unlike Jaylen Blakes has taken his game to an entirely different level particularly at the collegate level career highs across the board for osiah sers and ties the game at 41 well like we mentioned with Jaylen Blakes its makes a huge difference where now all of a sudden youre not playing 8 to 10 minutes a game youre playing 30 plus and you play with a lot more freedom and a lot more confidence and you see it on display Caleb Hunter with Music Applause 11 walled off by the taller camman now five to shoot for his brother Dylan Hunter draws a foul on oara and that is number three on the Harvard transfer pretty good possession there defensively by Stanford Aiden camman did a great job of moving his feet against Chase Hunter and AAR there you got to know from a scouting standpoint Hunter is righthanded so hes going to want to get downhill go to his right hand try to sit on that right make him go left towards the sideline but good job by Hunter of being aggressive and not settling for the long three and they are not super deep at that position Chism moar very versatile player can guard multiple positions perhaps why Kyle Smith elected to leave him on the floor late with those two fouls and now hell head the head to the bench to close out the half Music shot clock turned off for Stanford down Music Applause Music two Blake cofed it up dalan Hunter at midcourt with one and could not beat the buzzer on the shuffle pass first half and here is Reno with Wiggins showing double and a tough Fade Away by the 7 foot one Maxim Reno he waited to see if Chanty Wiggins was going to come double but he used his dribble to almost bait him into not doing it and just that is such a difficult shot right there we mentioned it earlier how Kyle Smith compared him to a dirk nitzky type of player that looked like a dirk kind of play right there a fade away from 10 ft just unbelievable skill and with that rebound he now has his National leading 11th double double of the season five to shoot for Reno in his bag to start and Victor lockin got to get at least get a hand up there I know thats a difficult shot but what Stanfords doing is theyre keeping Ryan Ager while one of their best threepoint Shooters on the same side so if you go double hes such a good passer that he can kick it out for a wide open three locking thought about it inside the shefflin again looking for his first points and he might get him at the foul line a foul on camon number two on the red shirt freshman from Andover Massachusetts you see he keeps his dribble alive and that is just an extremely difficult shot thats good defense by Victor lockin thats just a tough fade away you see 11 double doubles through the first 13 games of the year so thats pretty good in it partner that average is pretty good we mentioned it several times a lot of people in the ACC or the country for that matter dont know about him just from playing us out Stanford on the west coast hasnt got a lot of national exposure but before this seasons over a lot of college basketball fans are going to know that name shefflin finally on the board when scoreless on 0 for four shooting in the first half sat a lot of the back end of the first half with those two fouls Music Applause great defense Again by jayen Zachary and it is cut the shot clock down below Music 10 shefflin deflected that pass three to shoot Reno loses the handle and its scooped up by lockin great job there by Clemson just never allowed Stanford to get comfortable and a whole lot of fighting down in the paintt between camon and shefin and that is quickly the third on the 61 Aiden Applause Cam that last possession offensively for Stanford just never got anywhere right out of the gate and great job there Victor lockin at the end of the shot clock forcing the turnover Clemson making it a priority they are trying to get the ball inside to Ian shefflin that time he didnt get it but he did draw that third foul Zachary off two feet so tough on both sides of the ball well thats why that third foul is such a difference cuz that time Aiden camman wasnt able to be as aggressive trying to defend the rim almost had to get out of the way Jaylen Blakes look like he got away with a little bit of a back court violation there his heels right on that line Reno no good with the left hand here comes Chase Hunter who had 11 in the first half oh on a dime rolled it off the front of the Applause Music Applause rim REO off the fake sent Away by lockin what a battle in the paint Applause Music shefin could not force it lock and fighting for the rebound and a jump ball and the possession arrow points to the Applause Tigers Victor lockin had a block in the first half that was really impressive but this one right here he bit on the shot fake I thought Maxim REO had a wide open Lane to the rim recovered and then met him at the top with no contact whatsoever Victor lockin has been incredible on both ends of the Court here today that is a big Time defensive play three blocks for lockin who is doing it all while playing under the weather and is that number four on oara yes it is just checked into the game picked up the third late in the first half with less than a minute to go and he cant believe it the Harvard transfer beside himself its pleading his case to the officials there that Jaden Zachary just lost his balance ear early on three team fou so far for Stanford well next Saturday weve got an ACC Network mens triple header Clemson hosting Florida State at little John to start then North Carolina and NC State square off in an instate showdown in Raleigh and finally Virginia Tech taking on Cal should be a great after afternoon and evening on the ACC Network Cal losing a tough one to pit earlier Applause Music today and a timeout taken by Jaylen Blakes the defense has turned up a notch to start the second half for Clemson there you and the Tigers on a 60 run heading into the timeout Music 2600 mile trip coasta Coast to take on Clemson in their first true ACC game and they have lived up to the test to this point theyll had to pit after this game and finally get back home late into the night early into the morning on January the 4th oh its something theyre just going to have to get used to cuz they make that trip five times this season we see jayen Blake is coming out of the timeout being aggressive getting to the rim for a much needed basket but that travel something theyre going to have to get used to but we see Jaylen Blakes who had a very good first half offensively just beating Chase Hunter off the dribble trying to cut this to a onepoint lead Stanford and Cal coming into the league they knew it was going to be a lot of trouble for them the East Coast teams have the advantage because they only have to do it once a season if at all where these guys have to come back here pretty much every other week but yeah thats the current L current landscape of college basketball so something theyre just going to have to get used to but it does not seem like its affected them so far here today no sir there is Chase Hunter still scoreless in the second half and the rebound raino it was interesting Kyle Smith told us they toyed with the idea about coming out here on New Years Eve but decided to get the extra day and get acclimated to the East Coast time zone get acclimated to playing out here at Clemson South Carolina as Jayden Zachary has his fourth steal and draws a foul the boot on Blakes Clemson with a twopoint lead 16 minutes to go at Little John this a season the big reason why Brad Brownell was so high on Jaden Zachary the transfer from Boston College was his defensive prowess on the basketball just relentless on point of attack active with his hands if he doesnt get a steal he puts enough pressure on the ball to force a turnover weve seen it so far here today Zachary one steel away from 200 in his career and he actually said that he challenged himself to be more physical on the defensive side going into that win against Wake Forest in which he had five steals his head coach Brad Brown now calling him the tip of the spear defensively for this Clemson Music team Wiggins at Deep three yes sir from the top of the key and Wiggins in double figures a really really good possession there offensively for Clemson the ball moved everybody touched it at least once Chase Hunter with the great Kickback pass to Wiggins whos a very capable threepoint shooter not shooting a great percentage but looked confident on that one four for five from the floor today with a pair of made triples té yes on the bunny hook yeah great footwork there tried to go to the left but spun back to the right and was able to finish with the jump hook and again Stanford with the answer every time Clemson seems like theyre going to get it going and great hustle there by Jaylen Blakes getting on the floor tie up and wins it back for the Music Cardinal Clemson got this ball reversed from side to side see Chase Hunter there got double team coming off the ball screen just an easy kick back to Chanty Wiggins knocking it down looking comfortable doing so still very young still figuring out how he fits in Brad brownells system just to sophomore but great potential sers at three yes cans it from the left wing jayen Blakes is doing a great job of just finding the open guy and we have a great view cuz were right here on the line but he darn near stepped on that line again he did he is playing with fire playing all the way out there at at the half court line the fans behind us are trying to let the officials know about it Wiggins against Tay no sh chefin the rebound and muscles it up and in that is what Ian sheflin has done during the course of his career here Clemson 20 rebounds earlier this year against Kentucky in a win here over against Wildcats just a rebounding machine when he gets his hands on the ball its not coming out hes got very strong hands and a great time that time finishing picked off by hi breeder Zachary Blow by yes right now Clemson just starting to oppose their will a little bit on the defensive end and doing a good job of turning that into Quick offense I think here if youre Stanford you got to get Max right NOA touch again on the Block got Chanty Wiggins guarding him but Thomson doing a good job of not letting that happen five to shoot deep three Benny giler tracking it down bumped Wiggins out of bound Clemson with four in the offensive side and Hunter says I dont care took it to the cup and draws Two Applause Shots Clemson made it a priority at halftime to turn up the heat defensively see that time jayen Blakes just a little bit too much help there by Chase Hunter not staying at home not sure Zachary needed the help but on the other end out in transition a little bit of a secondary break and Jaden Zachary is strong physical when he gets to that Rim hes going to finish well womens basketball takes over the ACC Network every Thursday all season starting tomorrow we have a double header that starts at 6 Eastern Virginia Tech hosting Florida State and then Stanford squares off with SMU yes that is now an ACC matchup and that is at 800 pm Eastern tomorrow on accet and the ESPN app Hunter now with 13 at 11 in the first half hell head to the bench for a breather Maxim right now going to the bench as well to get a quick breather which I would assume will be his last one so where does Stanford turn for offense here hyater and the foul is going the other way I think theyre going to get Ian shefflin there for a push in the back trying to get that defensive rebound and thats his Music third negating what was an incredible stolen inbounds play by Dylan Hunter who is shaken up at the end of the Clemson bench and now hes going to walk back onto the floor and the roof was about to come off of this place if Jake Hy breeder had knocked that three down be and shefflin just going in for the rebound see here like you mentioned it off the inbounds pass jayen Blakes went to the floor more couldnt quite tell but the officials saw a little bit too much contact there from sheflin forces Brad BR now to take him out of the game can for to have him get his fourth this is shooter on shooter here Hyer and giler Elite from Beyond the AR no raino on the floor for Stanford T to shoot keer sers with five Applause Music Applause and now does Clemson try to exploit no raino with their 611 locking on the floor and thats a foul on Blakes and that is number four on the Duke transfer you mentioned it earlier foul TR foul trouble is something Stanford can ill afford to have happen not an overly deep team Jaylen Blakes is not a guy they can afford to have sitting on the bench very long but that fourth I have a feeling hes going to be over there for a while as we see Maxim right now checks back into the game Stanford on a 2minute scoring drought their largest deficit of the game at six Zachary wiggling around the defense he has 16 to lead all Applause Music Applause Music Applause scores Hunter heating up Gaylor draws a foul at midcourt for Brad Brownell youre okay with that one but again Clemson has Stanford playing way out there at half court the pressure and the physicality starting to show and if youre stord here you have to get 42 in red Maxim r no a touch on the Block somewhere isolated where he can face up and try to go to work youve been calling for that for what seems like minutes in this second half battling blocked and guess who Victor lockin winning it back for Clemson great job there by lockin of just taking it away Hunter off the window and good and a timeout taken by Applause Stanford Jaden Zachary a big reason why Clemson able to open up this 10point lead a great job here probing off of the balls screen easy finish Little John coming to life Tigers of Music 10 one thing that has become a common theme under Brad Brownell is meeting or exceeding expectations as they have done many years in a row this year picked fourth in the ACC preseason poll coming off that historic run of the Elite 8 first time since 1980 and just the second time in program history right now on a 100 run well I dont think theyre going to be sneaking up on anybody anytime soon especially after that run they had last year in the tournament but just an unbelievable job hes done here over the course of his career we mentioned it earlier just the consistency needed that from Agarwal yeah needed that desperately a great kick out there by Jaylen Blakes and a was had a quiet game we see Stanford going into the two3 Zone I thought wed see this a little bit more today obviously they just werent very comfortable based on what Clemson can do oh what a floater by Miles Foster the Illinois State transfer and Miles Foster played sparingly this season but show enough to touch around the rim and I think that almost caught Maxim right now off guard a little bit wasnt expecting him to go up with it right away Zachary the rebound remember Blakes playing with four fouls just watches as Foster goes to the cup and draws two I think thats going to be four and Aiden camon theyre going to call it on r No but a great kick out there by camman instead of forcing the issue kicked it out to agal knocking down that three but miles Foster had some great minutes in that win a couple weeks ago against Kentucky came off the bench in the first half gave him a big Music spark Clemson their largest lead at 11 with 10 46 to play in regulation well just goes to show you why this Clemson team is so good and why they were in the top 25 see a bad foul there from Dylan Hunter but Ian shefflin one of your best players Your Leader he had a quiet game by his standards a lot of that due to foul trouble in the first half but you get Victor Lock in you get miles Foster to come in and just pick up the slack as a collective group effort and just because one guy may not be having a great night doesnt mean that somebody else cant pick up for him and thats a big reason why I think they can make a deep tournament run again this year camon picking up the loose ball that was an aggressive take by Blakes playing with those four fouls and a lot of contact there I felt like that needed to be something one way or another but worked out for the Cardinal Zachary Scoops It Foster finishes and the foul Applause miles Foster giving Clemson some big minutes here in this second half doing exactly what he did in that first half against Kentucky and on the other end Jake hyb tried to take that charge no call but Stanford able to lay it in but here great pass great interior pass and a great catch by Foster able to go up and finish well now four fouls on camman he remains in the game four fouls on Blakes T2 stays in the game for Stanford its sort of that period in the game with their largest deficit they need points Music quickly Jaden Zachary is just hounding jayen Blakes when he brings that ball over half court not the shot there that Kyle Smith was looking Applause for wagin in transition got it from downtown Applause Music Applause yeah and a foul underneath willll keep it on this side of the floor well we talked earlier about how Stanford had always been able to answer the Run by Clemson but this time Clemson just opening this lead up and Chanty Wiggins playing with a ton of confidence knocking down his second three and we talked to Brad Brown all about it earlier today he said when he is aggressive and playing confidently on offense we are a different team you see the results there when he scored double figures they have a hard time losing today it appears going to be the same Music way double on Reno good pass Stenson rolling to the cup and getting extra minutes today is Stinson due to all the Stanford foul trouble and Stinson known as a threepoint shooter and that was one of the few times today where Clemson has come aggressively after Rau in the post but a great pass and a great cut off the ball but they got to get stopped on this end of the Court Stenson into the grill of Zachary five to Applause shoot Zachary at three great defensive possession there for Stanford had to have it after Clemson had made their last five field goal attempts and there is Dylan Hunter winning it back to chase Hunter fouled by Stinson and two shots coming for the Tigers leading score and Evan Stinson even though he committed the foul I think he got the worst of that Collision there underneath the basket but again and Clemsons defense just being the difference the active hands there by Dylan Hunter creating the turnover and a good foul by Stinson didnt want to allow an easy layup nothing unnecessary there but lost his shoe and got sent to the floor in the process Stinson one of seven freshman on this Stanford roster including two red shirt freshmen a young team Under firste head coach Kyle Smith tomorrow 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header nothing but net will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game and look ahead to the best matchups on the schedule for the weekend oh my God and they are going to catch right know there for a goal 10 thats the second time he snatched it off the rim today got away with it the first time in the first half yeah and in his defense being from France in Europe in FBA rules thats legal as soon as the ball touches the rim its a live ball but that ball was clearly still in contact with the rim so you cant grab it I thought for guy with no sh our fans having a little fun with Maxim right now behind us pretty evident at halftime what Brad branell said to his team lets turn up the heat on defense and lets not settle for jump shots they have made it a point and a priority to get to the rim and it is paid off here in this second half right now quick trigger seeing the shot clock wind down Chase Hunter couldnt save it and at least for now thats going to reset the shot clock to 20 seconds I think the officials are trying to decide if Chase Hunter had possession and it looks like he did so that shot clock will Music reset Blakes on the floor with four fouls as with Chisum Music oaro okara against shefflin sent Away by Wiggins who is having one heck of an afternoon here at Little John Coliseum 73 59 in favor of the home team looking to start undefeated in ACC Music play here in Clemson South Carolina built in 1965 local favorite and yet only a couple guys on his team had ever been he had to change that and he did this tweet and we tried to go today but unfortunately they were closed because of the holiday by the way we asked Brad Brown out whats your goto order there he said I keep it simple double cheeseburger not a whole lot of fixings just ketchup mustard pickle yep I like it third foul on Chase Hunter and you were remarked to me when we were off air during the last commercial break that the free throw line has been the difference in the second half fin Stanford getting the line here that was thats only their second free throw of the second half meanwhile in the other end Clemson 10 of 11 here in the second half alone 1922 for the game versus eight of n for Stanford so mentioned it earlier Brad Brown now made it a priority we are going to be aggressive getting to the rim and putting a lot of pressure on this Stanford defense and it just paid off in this second half Clemson seven and one in this building this year only loss in overtime to Memphis Wiggins Up and Under no fighting for the rebound and secured by The Freshman Evan Stinson such a tough place to play and they just ratchet up that physicality even more at home raino floater is good and finally they got him a touch on the Block isolated with a clean catch all of a sudden Stanford cut this back back to a 10point lead and going back to that two3 zone try to throw Clemson off their Rhythm offensively a little bit Zachary rebound Coral by Chase Hunter and pulls it back out for Applause Wiggins and now oara leading the break for Stanford Applause what effort by Stenson dalan Hunter wins it back bodies on the floor three on one Hunter bang There was a ton of contact on that entire sequence on both ends of the Court the officials let him play Clemson gets rewarded with the chase hunter three look like a football game for about 20 seconds which these fans here are very accustomed to seeing but just a lot of physicality started with Clemson hitting the offensive glass unable to convert chisel mpar going down no cont excuse me no foul call right there I thought something had to be called but nonetheless Chase Hunter going down knocks down the three but Stanford with a quick answer finding a way to hang around but just got to find a way to put a couple stops in a row together on the defensive end Hunter pull up Applause silky 20 for Chase Hunter some guys is just effortless for him to score and Chase Hunter is one of those guys made it look so easy and another tie up forced by yes Jaden Zachary of course who else its been all over the place defensively and a little shaken up here is Victor lockin on top of not feeling well coming into this game but the ball pressure the Relentless ball PR pressure from Clemson in this second half has been really really impressive lockin has been Paramount not only all season but in this game 11 point seven boards and has done a nice job defending R up good hustle here by both teams getting on the Applause floor hit his own teammate Jaden Zachary going down to the floor nonetheless Zachary wins it back for Applause Music Clemson warriorlike performance by the Cincinnati transfer Victor Lock in today wasnt sure hed play game time decision warmed up on his own battling illness this afternoon at Little John picked off by Blakes watch out and Blakes draws a foul on Zachary that was a heck of a play by Jaylen Blakes not only creating the steal but he was determined to get to the rim that is exactly what Stanford needed a quick turnover but you see here just the anticipation a great hand on the steel good foul there by Jaden Zachary not letting him have anything easy ACC PM with Mark Packer Taylor Tannon bomb weekdays at for EAS right here on the ACC Applause Network both teams in the bonus the rest of the way both teams dealing with foul trouble Stanford with more severe foul trouble three players with four fouls Stanford continuing to stay with that zone only challenge about staying with the zone is it makes for long possessions and being down double figures with just over five minutes to play going to be tough camon with a nice block one of two Stanford players on the floor with four fouls he thought he wanted back for the Cardinal and they are going to change the call Le Cassel will give it back to Stanford and now very often you see all three officials not really sure who that went off of but a good block there by camman it looked like it went off the right hand there of Jaden Zachary I think the officials got that one right meanwhile sers has 20 to lead all Stanford scores all of a sudden we got ourselves a ninepoint game here so the Cardinal hanging in Brad bradel going to get a Applause timeout the Cardinal not going away quietly in a big ACC test with Clemson on the road Music having a great game 16 points and being aggressive that time using the ball screen getting downhill in the lane finishing with the left hand and just an incredible performance to try to keep his team in it and just like just when it looked like Clemson was going to run away with this Stanford has found a way to make this a ninepoint game and a lot of its been due to that two3 zone Ive gotten a couple of stops to see if they stay with it it now going to a 131 coming out of that timeout try to switch it up even more with some length up top with Aiden camman sheflin had it poked by camman Zachary less than 10 to shoot Wiggins at three yes sir and Wiggins with a season High 17 and if youre Stanford that is very very frustrating coming to that timeout change it up played pretty good defense and of course chony Wiggins who has had himself a great game continues to shoot the ball lights out from behind the ark can sellers respond tipped Away by Chase Hunter four minutes to play in regulation here at Little John Coliseum and Clemson just not let you make any entry pass whatsoever easy whatsoever that time just Chase Hunter getting his hands up causing the deflection that has been the story of the basketball game here for the Tigers 14 steals Wiggins heat check yes sir Here Comes Blakes to St Stinson a three ill advised from The Freshman early in the shot clock and Clemson will run some time down I can see see why you only have two points Clemson very content here to use as much of this shot clock as humanly possible and this is the guy you want to have the ball in your hands L clock have not seen a ton of touches from Renault in the paint in the second half when hes got it hes been very effective as Zachary picks off another when you got to give Clemson all the credit in the world before that they have just not allowed him to get any looks whatsoever and a great finish there by Chase Hunter there have been times where Renault has been open but the ball pressure on the passer just is simply not allowed any easy post Applause entries twominute scoring drop for Stanford leads to the largest lead of the game and a block by lockin what a Applause game well it has been the Chanty wiggin show here on offense for Clemson today three made threepointers that last from from the corner Clemson 14point lead Applause well back here at Little John Coliseum it has been the Chanty wiggin show in the second half Wiggins with a season eye 17 points four of five from downtown David padet and has helped Clemson secure their third straight ACC win Brad branell told us today at shoot around this is the guy they got to get going to get that third spot on offense and right on Q he has delivered for his coach today only shooting about 35 coming in from three prior to the game but four of five today from behind the arc and has just looked really confident he hasnt forced anything there were a couple of times where he could have forced a three but didnt settle got in the lane made the extra pass been really really impr impressive here today back door feed Dylan Hunter wont get the plus one but heads back to the free throw line a great set there coming out of the timeout against the Zone flashed Victor lockin into the middle Dylan Hunter with a great back cut and a great pass unable to finish but going to the free throw line yeah yeah we know you messed up well weve talked so much about Clemsons offense but its been their defense particularly over their last two wins Wake Forest and now this one against Stanford that has made all the difference Clemsons always been a great defensive team but that graphic right there says it all when they are locked in and playing well together as one unit defensively and everybodys on the same page knowing their assignments they are really difficult to beat and anybody had a chance to watch that Kentucky game that was about as impressive as youll see cuz Kentucky is the real deal offensively and they just had them locked up and it all starts with Jaden Zachary his pressure on the ball here today especially coming out of the locker room at halftime was the difference in the game that win over Kentucky just keeps looking like a Resume Builder as lockin has another SWAT playing under the weather all afternoon hasnt looked like it for Clemson yeah he has been really really impressive in this game he just done a little bit of everything so for Clemson theyll start 3 and0 in League Play in backtoback Seasons went 7 and0 to start ACC play last year Victor lockin was a game time decision based on not feeling well but the best part about that block right there is he didnt block it out of bounds and SWAT it into the bleachers blocked it off the backboard and kept it in play and allowed his team to retain possession Big Blocks yep for the Cincinnati transfer Clemson will have Cal at home next then theyll go on the road to Louisville meanwhile Stanford will continue their East Coast Road trip and had to pit on Saturday this is a Clemson team that in my opinion is going to finish in the top three of the ACC Id be very surprised if they dont so if youre Stanford obviously you didnt come in here and get a win but theres a lot you can take away from this the first half especially they were the better team they really were and Maxim Rau whos taking a little bit of a rest over there trying to get ready for Saturday he was really really impressive and some of the other guys just struggled a little bit but theyre a team that picked 17th out of 18 teams in the ACC they are not going to finish 17th you count on that year one under Kyle Smith laying down the foundation of culture and effort he said this teams already got that figured out now the next piece is winning games in this league you know its all brand new no doubt theyre trying to learn every team in this league from scratch and its just going to take some time but I like what theyre trying to do and they got one of the best players in the country theyre going to be just fine overtime loss at home a couple of weeks ago to Memphis was a gut check to this Clemson team they then lost another OT game
