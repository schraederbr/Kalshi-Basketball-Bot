shoot can defend youre going to love Hunter Salis just the fourth ever meeting between the deacons and the Buccaneers and mens basketball Andrew Carr wins the tip and we are underway no Matthew Marsh in the starting lineup but he did warm up and we do expect him to play for the first time since the Georgia game Zack Kellers been starting with Marsh out and he gets the feed from Salis and he gets fouled from behind by Reggie doart and free throws 16 seconds in on this Black Friday MATA in Winston Salem North Carolina good patience on that first set by Wade Forest mov the ball around get a a player that I think also hasnt given him some contribution and Zack Keller gives him an opportunity to go to the preow line Charleston Southern started in man theyll play some different defenses based on their ability to get stops and then put pressure on the other team P called on taj Kelly as Zack Keller breaks the seal one thing that Ws done very well so far this season Stan and shoot free throws yeah almost 80 on the season their size their ability to penetrate get them to the free throw line they have got to make them first broadcaster Jinx of the day right on Q thank you very much told you about this stuff Buccaneers have had the same starting lineup for five times of their six games for head coach barklay rabal whos the longest tenard coach in Big South mens basketball histories in his 19th year he was BJ Mackeys position coach at the University of South Carolina when BJ was a superstar in Columbia BJ was an assistant under barlay a little bit over a decade ago down in North Charleston and yes Charleston Southern is located in North Charleston it is its funny about that didnt just pass Ed Beach the longest 10 coach in in the Big South and well see how this goes foul was on Keller Miss from Johnson theres the Wake starting five same quintet that you saw all three games down in Charleston and Ws not that far away and a big part of that has been bopy Miller find in his Groove missed his first shot to hard to rebound we talked about Johnson but another guy you keep your eye on is going to be Taj Kelly number two go inside and scores a second leading score on his Char y good strong rebound from Miller and then he shows his lower body strength as Taj Kelly climbed up his back second foul on Kelly less than 90 seconds in and quick sub Noble days Brad student from Wisconsin checks back in or checks in for the first time for the Buccaneers and thats a bad break for Charleston Southern as we said Kelly the second leading scorer on this Charleston Southern team Noble Gaye gives him some size but not much scoring only every about two points a ball game a fifth year player from to l hildr checked his feet they were not in the right spot said Justin Porterfield whos working today with Isaac Barnett and Bill cumington theres Alan suler sophomore transfer from Northern Kentucky theres seven transfers on this Buccaneers team which is the normal these days but a lot of these guys are getting their first real college minutes this Buccaneers team has two wins over nondivision one opponents three losses to D1 teams they play pum cookman close losing by six on Monday that was their last game and they just get Keller with his second foul I think they did yep number two on Zack Keller will we get an early Matt Marsh appearance no looks like Marcus Marians the first off Steve forbess bench here this afternoon Parker Mar had some nice moments down in Charleston last week very active hit a couple of mid midrange jumpers uh has played really good against LSU so it be this is good give him some early moments and see what kind of production you can get out of him Alan Music suler and its staying here fouls on Andrew Carr blocking Music out hard a little little armsy as opposed to getting his backside on the on the offensive player and riding him out there so he happen right in front of the officials easy call you know these games like this mates holidays youve got to create your own enthusiasm so a lot of times you you play looser early and you can remember you and I were together when we played Houston Badness a couple years ago and had a bad start it didnt well the same thing happened years ago against Dale state so you you dont want to give a team like Charleston sou a lot of life thats a nice look right there score DJ Patrick first two of the day for CSU and if you Wake Forest youve got to get sharp youve got to pay attention to detail couple of Chip Shot close files that you didnt need to pick up because you werent moving get active now and theyre going to call it close so you got to adjust today the 96th ball game of Steve forbes Wake Forest coaching career native of Lone Tree Iowa hes one and0 as coach of the decks against Charleston Southern deacons the program three and0 against CSU Carr misses his first shot rebound for dooh har here come the Bucks they can really shoot when they get their looks her scored double digit threes three of their five games so far this year B missed it h drift the rebound here he comes thats what scares you if you wait Force you got to get off there what a take by Cameron HRI Coast to Applause Coast first field goal for Wake Forest comes over three minutes into the game nice little match up there Miller versus Johnson Johnson can beat you off the bouns Davis traveled just lost his Music feet pun cam Hills with nice penetration were just saying that you a game like this youve got to create your own energy try to be in that tack mod spits The Defenders uses the rim as protection nice layup by cam har Buccaneers going to show a little full core pressure s Im going to put you on the spot here you you dont need to answer right away Im curious if Cameron reminds you of anybody you know Im going be H I can answer that I I just watch guys I dont really my mind doesnt work like that because every player is your own person thats fair you know I mean but you know hey he gives you a lot of things I I just like him because hes always impressive he plays hard hes looking for a play I think the thing that happens is we dont realize how how Talent he is because we didnt grow up watching beating the buzzer Hunter Salis released that ball with less than a second on the shot clock thats why I was talking about Salis his ability to score off the bouns clock winding down knocking down jump shots hes got a really smooth shot just kind of get in the groove last week Johnson missed marry in the rebound Hunter Salis already has more made threepointers as a demon Deacon than he had in two full seasons with Gonzaga Carr hits the cutting hriff and hes fouled by RJ Johnson and that will get us to to our first timeout hes from Omaha Nebraska he played a couple years in the Spokane Washington and Hunter Salas can really score deacons up four early here at the Joel Wake Forest W 60 games for the zags but clearly capable of more and hes doing it for the team in old gold and black so far this season well he leads his team in threepoint baskets and you saw his Awareness on that last possession clock winding down in a nice little rhythm goes up strong knocks down the jump shot his athleticism is something I think that fans are going to really enjoy watching as we get in the ACC competition for get to the basket make plays and as you said so many more baskets now than he did in two season with his ads Matthew Marsh seeing his first action since the Georgia game back on November 10th missed a threegame stretch in Charleston with a concussion but could be see Matthew back on the floor they missplay the dble hand off and charlon Southern gives it right back K trying to just get in their passing they just trying to mess with the passer and they just miscommunication one throws one goes and I think its fair to say both these teams have had turnover issues through five games exactly and again thats thats part of what happens on a game like this on a day like this youve got to turn your own motor up youve got to be your own motivator cut down on those mental mistakes Parker Frederick in on the floor for the first time Rising Fire around and out rebounds tip by Marsh controlled by Charleston Southern Taj Kellys back in the game they did change the first foul we said it was on Duart they gave it to Kelly now they corrected it and its on doart which means Kelly only has one which means he can play Hutchinson for three blue Hutchinson yeah Lou Hutchinsons a very streaky shooter only averages about six a game his knocked down is 63 had a nice couple of looks against NC State knock down three threes against them but hes long and athletic to make play ni Pi roll welcome back Matthew Marsh yeah thats good to see Miss some ball games du to the concussion to be active and to finish strong hes got to recognize his matchups hes going to be matched up pretty much against a smaller player can take full advantage of that longtime Wake Forest fans will appreciate hearing that Lou Hutchinson who just made that three for the bucks played his high school basketball for Long Island Lutheran theyre coached by former Wake Forest walkon John buck as the three knocked in from Alan Subler in the corner as suar ties it at eight John Buck known for Duncan in an ACC game against Virginia May circuit 2005 here at the Joel before my time this this is a Charleston Southern team there went on they they averag about eight threes a ball game theyve had some nice looks so far John Bug made a big time play every we go as youd expect Marsh has been a little off ker huh Marsh a little off kilter as youd expect yeah and like I said a moment ago hes got to recognize ass cars that theyre in the posterior and theyve got a size Advantage you dont have to rush anything get the ball try to make a move kick it back kick it out and get it back just had some big news 6 minutes 32 seconds into the Game Hunter Salis not in the game he left hes on the bench he he never left the game against LSU played all 45 minutes of the 8680 overtime defeat part of the reason was because the marsh this is a very young team a very thin bench its good to see Frederickson out in the game early tough shot gatis Heath the third gives the Buccaneers the twopoint lead one of the guys that doesnt really score a lot at 64 can play in the post does a better job in the mid post area boopy Miller with a kiss a hes quick hes so Applause quick had a tough first half of his season opener against Elon and ever since then hes looked really good boopy 21 assists seven turnovers his last four games oh nice move off the dribble exploding the bucket Taj Kelly scores for CSU and Steve Forbes is getting in the ear of the Freshman abama zanka immediate timeout for an angry coach Forbes choose counter when you order ahead in the Eddie was a wizard for UNC Asheville Tim Craft still coaching the carder web running Bulldogs Kevin mcgean still the head coach of Campbell Campbell no longer in the big South Mike Jones on that list with Radford hes now at UNCG had a big win the other night he just beat Arkansas what I saying North Carolina right now down to the Bahamas Miller feeding Carr hes triple teamed and hes fouled look at all the blue shirts around Carr and Carrs just got to understand where he is on the court hes right there in the in the restricted area 610 611 this Kick That Power It Up dont bring it down first foul on Lou Hutchinson who gets a breather Miller thats a textbook box out from tajj KY it really Music was open court four out one in sometimes Five Guys out they move cut very well youve got to defend its going to cause some mismatches for some of the bigger weight Defenders think about the great players that the Buccaneers have had through Barclays tenure Kelly Loops it up battle for the board one by Carr Here Comes goofy Miller Miller to the corner Keller offensive rebound for Carr Five Guys on the floor right now only two of them were on the deacons last last year that switch car was been thats better he just take your time and go inside got to score that I was to say Carl was being guarded by Gadis instead of you know I know its part of your offense have bigs away but sometimes you just got to go back to old school take them downtown take him low and just beat him inside going to mention son nimley is one of the great players in CSU history hes on the bench as an assistant for barklay rabah Keller rebounds the Miss could I could really score score Christian keing was a pretty good player ended up playing a year at Chapel Hill Miller turnaround two nice move by I understand your oneonone assignments right now whos guarding you try to find a way to work this is going to be a game where you just got to beat somebody youve got a size Advantage youll get a great Music shot loose ball in the corner out of bounds last Touch by RJ Johnson AR Johnsons been the sort of quiet so far in this ball Music game marus Marcus Marian back into the game for Wake Force Hunter Salis remains on the bench made his only shot three points one assist in seven minutes so after the subs its Miller with Carr Frederickson Marian and zanka Andrew Carr takes it Deeks now one for five Beyond The Arc Midway through this first half 12 apiece last three ball games at Charleston classic they were like 26 of 69 from the three range yeah so I would have expected more SC and then 24 in the first 10 minutes the two teams combined right on Q DJ Patrick get to the 10 its Rhythm also and again youve youve had some shots opportunities that have not Fallen i like to see this ball work just Contin to work it inside out youll get something Frederickson off the curl comes up short bucking the ball and hes hes struggled a little bit I dont think its confidence I just think its just some technique having to get rid of the ball a little quicker than maybe before obviously a big Time High School score the shot will fall even on that shot you can see it well see how he drifted a little bit to his right on the shot good look though hell knock some down again if youre charlon Southern you like the tempo with this ball game its a team that aages about 78 points a ball game but theyve got a NIC little flow move the ball inside out side to side pretty good close out from hildr but it didnt matter cuz DJ Patrick set his feet hes got seven first half points for CSU 143 poter a lot of those were against maybe not as good a competition but still he knocked them in Carr met at the rim by do Har got a piece of it Patrick the other way for do Har Buccaneers already with a fivepoint lead looking to add to it and that will make it a sevenpoint game Alon suler you see the spacing that Charlestons getting three guys around their perimeter and theyre getting those mismatches and theyre just taking those bigger Deacon deons demon Deacon players inside and scoring this is a nice job offensively by seven nothing run theyve made Seven of their last nine shots three goes for Marcus Maran his second three of the season for the Danish freshman Rams will take him at Music home second three for Maran this season second three of the game for the deak along with saless buzzer beater the shot clock buzzer steel Maran poked it away Miller to Frederickson and he was out of bounds second time in the half at the deacons turn it over stepping on the sideline CSU with a mo right now Stan man they move the ball there get a nice look come off the jumper bam knock it in playing at their own speed just beating a guy to the basket no help there it doesnt matter hes going to score anyway 1915 Charleston Su M for is two of its last eight and the Buccaneers in a related story have the fourpoint lead with 742 to play here in the first half struggling shooting the basketball thats obvious but heres the thing that would concern me we talked about it in the open theyre being out rebounded right now by two and you just you just dont want to see the if youre the decks use your size Advantage go in and pound RJ Johnson off the dribble kicks it for Patrick Salis back on the floor for Wake Forest shot clock down to six here for the Buccaneers RJ Johnson trying to create draws contact in the fouls on boy Applause Miller Clock winds down you always assume a guys going to try to put it to the floor and create but thats not always good when you guarding Johnson because hes got such a great first step and a good move and you got inside only thing you could do is either give up the layup a reach that time he chose a reach and put him to free throw line 95 per up the line now since jigs doesnt work I guess all the time and RJ now 21 for 22 from the free throw line this season former all rookie Patriot leager at Holy Cross play for the Crusaders solid guy up at Matthews North Carolina and I tell you what I like about him he is so hungry to just make things go in his career like I said all rookie team in the Patriot League but he said hey I got bigger and better things a nice move Carr missed it and a late whistle and Andrew Carr is going to get a couple free throws theres the second foul on Reggie doart hey whos your favorite alltime Holy Cross Crusader Bob K its a good choice well youre asking me a lot of questions today is this youre trying to see if if I ate too much and you got too much trip to fans and stuff like that and Im sleep are you just curious of the stuff that you know S I knew youd be sharp Im Im gonna be Im just gonna be me whos your favorite Holy Cross basketball player uh Tom Hinson Tommy heinson see that see how you thats why I like you thats why I like you because you you you get it know I understand youre doing a lot of things today I appreciate I dont I dont know what it is but I get Music something oh you got in all right Carr knocks down a pair at the line wake back within Music four you went to Bob Koozie basketball camp in Worster one time didnt you I did not but I was a big fan of Bob Koozie he broadcast Celtics games growing up time yes he did like your pronunciation of Worster though thank you very much again again dont let me fool you you know Im smarter than a bo be a little too strong the free throw line Music jumper Patrick fakes it takes it makes it when you run a four or five perimeter player offense and youve got bigs and You got size Advantage theres no one in the middle of protect see how easy and fluid that shot was after the shot he could have driven heci think made right jump as the games high score right now USF transfer DJ Patrick and Hunter Salis might be the leading scorer by the time were done here today well he can score a lot of ways and defin need get Wake Forest needs to get backto back baskets wouldnt be shocked to see them change lineup or either go to Zone they had some success against LSU last week playing some two guard front Zone oh thats too easy he missed the layup and another offensive rebound Steve Forbes just growing redder and redder by the second Noble days knocks down the three miss a two to get a three Second Chance opportunity but think of about how that all happened on a nice little back cut because what happened the lane is open theres no one in the room Applause protect it has not been a great first 15 minutes today for the Demon Deacons Kim hildr has been off the quiet also Applause today hildr makes a little noise but not enough didnt get the shot to go in another Rack Attack Kick Out Pass Heath missed the three rebound Carr have been big for bucks largest lead has been seven tough pass stolen away by Gattis Heath II and hes stripped by Salis Hunter Salis through the traffic like theres a lid on the bucket right now well youre getting some good looks but youre rushing a few of them ill advised passes you got to understand who youre throwing the ball to and what part of the Court youre throwing to this is a nice set right now for for Charleston lets see if they get a back cut or midrange jumper out of this right back Hut theres layup free throws coming Marcus Marions like I was set officials disagree and if youre Charleston Southern you youve got to like the speed of the game for you the tempo Wake Forest is helping you out a little bit with Miss shots as we just mentioned but theyre getting the rebounds and theyre able to run what they want to and the most important thing offensively is that theyre spacing the first point first points at the free throw line earlier for RJ Johnson hes now three for three at the strike you look at w right now theyre two and three its easy to panic youre down seven against CSU all three losses close games against teams in the top 90 in the kenpom I mean yet you havent had any disastrous losses so far this season no were not saying thats going to happen tonight its a disastrous loss but they played some good teams and it shows you a couple of things you got to rebound better you know the depth and the fact that youve got a lot of guys that didnt play a lot of a lot of minutes in this team they got to learn how to play together so closing games well said shot clock again winding down HRI going to need to create Music something thought that grazed the rim they did reset the clock just before it expired Barkley rall wants his team to slow down watch it look at how how spacing the lane is open you try to go to the high post you go to killy and let Killy be a screener or a passer he reworks himself from post he scores off this tough shot Taj Kelly I see it sometimes see it before it happen 30 20 Charleston Southern leads Wake Forest poopy Miller and Applause one we talked about it a few moments ago you have to win your oneonone battle boopy Miller goes inside whines and d goes inside theres contact there he takes he says Ill have three we get that minute voice of the de Stan cotton said earlier this season if you call him Kevin and hes not looking at you he wont turn around his name is bopy as far as this program is concerned and bopy is a very capable scorer from the point guard spot hes going to be an important one today if he going get back in this game well by any name you want to call him that was a big basket with under three minutes left to play in the first half maybe give there some momentum hes a solid player and um I think theres going to be a lot of boopy moments throughout the next couple of weeks of the basketball season sevenpoint game Miller completes the threepoint Music play little token pressure this time trying to get Tron s out of a rhythm a little more pressure you see by bopy on the Applause basketball Jaden Thompson shadowed closely by Miller Johnson feeds the post Kelly kicks it Patrick and and a nice rebound from Salis coming in nice close out by killer that time attack the shooter didnt foul theres the quickness from boopy everything with the Applause Buckle look for boopy as this game goes to try to Contin to initiate the offense and maybe as this go game goes maybe the leading score hes got the speed to penetrate and Applause score two minutes to go in the half Hutchinson straight away rebound Music Salis attack had 25 against Talon a couple days ago its had a nice couple of games theres a three for cam hriff all because of the great penetration by Miller getting him downhill finding shooters and a confidence by cam H to take the jump shot lck Forest lowest scoring half of the Season entering today its the first half of the Utah game when the de scored just 31 wow now theyre at 26 with second or third time today where Charon sus had Point Blank layups could decide to dunk it build the front of him and use glass H Alis I I you know trying to just be honest with about this Wake Forest can get all they want if they take it into the pain eight nothing run from the DS timeout Buccaneers minute to play in the first half wake hes still trailing by two but he has to feel a little bit better about the eight nothing run over the past minute 56 deons were down 10 before that handled the ball better got great penetration Shooters ready to shoot knock down plays played a little better defense got fortunate theyve missed a couple of layups in Charleston Southern but its a nice comeback for Wake for they how Charles from Southern Rea getting in inside Taj Kelly another offensive rebound but a whistle out of bounds W for ball deak with a chance to tie or take the lead Salis in the lane turns it over and the Buccaneers can take the final shot of the half its the sixth turnover of the half for Wake Forest Buccaneers with six as well nice opportunity here get a basket get the ball back begin the second half yes indeed try to extend this lead Kelly Fade Away beautiful high post just worked his way inside hildr didnt get it off and the Buccaneers will take a fourpoint lead into the locker room when these two teams met a couple years ago Stan W for one team so far the season as you would expect because ones division one and ones division two so the question is why do they play each other and well that answer is unknown well some some of those games are Regional rivalries no not Regional rivalries come on tocoa Falls its close to Charleston Regional money of course I was trying to save that for the big thing money the opportunity to play up who is the famous TV executive that said the answer to all your questions is Anybody Everybody said that you aint got to be in TV Z to do Laughter that money money money money Andrew Carr just picked up his third foul meanwhile 2 seconds into the second half no sign of a sub to the scorers table yet although Here Comes Marcus Applause Maran what I said now I think I think theres going to be a point in this game where Charlestons going to say he could be right there hey we win this as opposed to hoping we can win lets go out and take this and wakes going to have a lot to say about that their execution has got to be a little sharper hildr to Keller spinning pivoting scoring as you said earlier just score use your size go inside pound it inside and finish plays Music Patrick elbow jumper got it hes got a really nice release doesnt he 66 67s good body the lint and does a really good job you know how they run the offense for him of going off screens and catching and scoring DJ Patrick injured almost all last year at USF but played pretty well as a freshman or is a sophomore I should say for the Bulls his freshman year was at Triton junor College trying to squeeze it inside not touched by the Buccaneers now Andrew Carr is going to come out of the game he played a few possessions there with the three fouls two points four rebounds three fouls and 14 minutes this is a hard matchup game for for Andrew Carr they get him out on the wings a little quicker and if he doesnt score early he gets in his head his rims have been unforgiving on the day after Thanksgiving for Wake Forest my goodness oh great Hustle by Johnson jump ball Wake Forest Applause ball can you believe the rim did not let that basketball go through okay do do do I have to say it the iron un kind do I have to say it the iron un its the holidays Im a good spirit Im probably charge me for saying that you know who thats Brandos Fring famous hell probably Ill probably get a text from him hey Id be surprised if Tims watching but you never know no Salis elbow jumper no good rebound deflected around and Tay C wins the rebound for CSU Timmy B seven points seven rebounds two assists for Taj Kelly Patrick Bullseye hes got 13 Buccaneers stretch the lead back to seven using that size getting in the Rhythm wake needs a basket wake needs to get energized Hunter Salis for three eightth rebound for Applause Kelly third straight year that the Buccaneers have been playing on Black Friday against an ACC opponent they had their Thanksgiving in a hotel in blackburg Virginia a couple years ago and Clemson South Carolina as well over the past couple of years had a chance to knock off the Hokies last year around Thanksgiving well be together as we get into December basketball play and you Ill talk about it a lot and you know its this is a hard time for teams and coaches worry because you got to get your guys minds and you dont want to think about okay Thanksgiving was yesterday so you got to play so it is a very difficult task especially to play on the road if you havent done it a lot so its interesting to see where that is but youre right they did they played Virginia Tech a close game oh poopy Miller with a crossover again the iron Music unkind Charleston Southern slows it up seven point lead on the road here in Winston Salem North Carolina kly number two he was at the high block and he kind of worked himself around let see if they try to swing it to him in the posterior but he continue to use those driving angles shot clock at six Kelly stolen by Salis ahead to Miller hes currently one on Three hell score anyway yeah and maybe thats the play mark that down that will turn W Forest around great defens play probably should have shot the ball in Kelly in the pain Talis gets the steill initiates a break that they score off of bopy the Wake Forest leading scorer with nine Kelly versus Music Keller everybody touched it Corner three short Kelly another rebound power dribble back up and in hes a man inside at 67 one of the things that you notice about him immediately he has got that great block pres a preseason member of the Sun the conference side second team Big South and I tell you what hes going to be able to eat inside the rest of his ball game unless weight does an adjustment Miller looking for Keller who lays it in Applause Nice Nice finish by Keller there but theres clearly a a 7even foot sized hole in the wig Forest lineup K gets the rebound and you just wonder if the NCAA reviews waiver appeals on the Friday after Thanksgiving are they in the office today reviewing appeals or are they still enjoying the leftovers holiday leftovers theyll talk to you on Monday yeah probably right which Monday is the question poops going to get free throws here 5 minutes into the second half lot of questions right now for Wake Forest most immediately can they get some momentum and turn this around against the Char Southern Music Buccaneers if you choose curbside will you order in the house sitting Courtside and Im not talking about Stan lutter although you are a prince among among Thieves uh Josh Howard the ACC player of the year 2003 what what a great player he was playing for skip Rosser winning the ACC regular season title that year had a great NBA career playing alongside Dirk nitzky alas he a legend local guy great Music guy and I I was a senior in high school during his senior year and I was accepted in the Wake Forest like a week before the season started so I was kind of Allin on the deakes way more than so than I am now quite frankly as as a fan now Im a broadcaster but as a fan its the high school kid rooting for Josh Howard watching him that year as as he just tore up the ACC it was fun to jump on that bandwagon early Ill tell you you want to go over there and shake his hand get his autograph in Im okay you okay Im okay Im next to you well yeah thats good too but you know you know I but look Im Ive gotten to work with Randolph Chris Ive gotten to to meet you know two games with Mike jinsky theres a lot of great people thisall is now be honest I Ill the people that weve got the chance to know over life of being in broadcast business and some would debate if we broadcasts not but its been a blessing its been a pleasure to talk to the people that you know you watch play you played against you coached against straightway three Mr just people just people know this good guy you say you know Evan leer like you really know EV I yeah Le my god i Ive never met Mugsy but I want to introduce my father to Mugsy because know my dad was a 55 basketball player and Mugsy was his hero in the 80s cuz Mugsy was 5 three in the NBA we get that done I get that done for you yeah dunar High School Baltimore Maryland my my dad sitting here at the Joel today dont dont mistake bopy for buppy because his grandfather named buppy Marsh fouled on his way to the rim good pass from bopy threepoint game here 1355 to play in this second Music half no but I mean if were talking about things that were thankful for this time of year being being a part of this University this program you know through the ups and downs over the past couple decades its its special to get the opportunity to sit here Courtside we appreciate James over Street and ever huto and the Wake Forest athletic department for letting you and I do these games here and its its really a great privilege and we are thankful wow you youve been listen you have been listening to me it is its a blessing and I enjoy it like I said I try to lock in and enjoy every moment of it and dont H locking in appreciate that move right there by hildr a needed basket by Wake Forest now lets see how CR Southern will respond six nothing run for Wake Forest High post action theres a split screen Kelly Wake Forest ball and and cross Southern will look back at missed opportunities as a drive theres no one to protect the rim how many times have we said that for both teams but this is what HTH does well gets to the paint spins and elevates strong looking for the threepoint play box and if youre Wake Forest right now now you have to take this game if immediately theyve gone couple possessions without scoring unforced turnover by Charleston Southern wakes got a basket theyve got to score right now put pressure on Charleston Southern and take them away Marsh back in the Music game the two Brits involved in the screen fouls going on suler fourth team foul of the half on Charleston Southern shoot one and one at seven into the double bonus at 10 poopy Miller lays it off a little too creative perhaps cuz he blew by everybody and Matthew Mar was go and the ball was a little low you remember Marsh is a sevenfooter so you got to get the ball low but its got to be high its got to be right about it wait force between there and the bottom of the numbers well wake has certainly upped the defensive intensity here in a onepoint game in the second half Charleston Southern with another turnover thats their third turn in the last three minutes and theyve had five in the last five minutes five in the last five in two games already theyve had more assistent turnovers today isnt that one but you know I was talking before half about weight maybe need to go to Zone to be honest with you all you got to do is just turn the defensive pressure up a little bit theyve done that in the second half hriff Up and Under going to the line and a chance to put wake for is back in front for the first time since it was 8 to5 with 1422 to play in the first half its really odd to say a guy at 64 65 can just dominate in paint all the trees but cam H can certainly do that and again this is a a number of what he did against LSU and most of those baskets were paint baskets hes hes a different player yeah but as much as I think of him as more of a midrange score and getting free throw opportunities to scoring hes already made nine threes going into this afternoons game second best on the team so he can score a lot of way wake leads 40 to39 you mentioned can be in 64 his dads 61 and bopy Miller gets it back for Wake Forest different attitude on defense in the second half pressure on the basketball a little careless on the inbounds pass he can run the Baseline after a make throw it in the Dead Mans Corner poopy Miller using his speed gets his hand on it knocks it off the player weight ball Dead Mans Corner sounds like a place where a Buccaneer might be comfortable not so much deacons by one wake fourth has scored the last eight points to retake the lead putting pressure on the basketball getting some Second Chance opportunities and that young man is taking over the game offensively with penetration and baskets penetration and passes lets see if they can keep this intensity if you waake for crossing other You got to handle the basketball now youve been very loose last couple possessions quick shots the second chances that you were getting earlier on rebounds youre not getting down go back to that formula for all the Wake fans who werent di hard Central Michigan basketball fans last year you may not realize bopy Miller only played four games last year missed most of the season with an injury so hes working his way back and hes making plays and its going to be called an offensive foul and neither Steve Forbes nor the Wake for as bench can believe it lets see lets take a look now watch this off arm watch right there see he jumped into his face thats thats what theyre going to say he jumped into that space was that space that goes from the top basically from the floor all the way to the ceiling and he invaded that second foul on bopy he matched up with Johnson here RJ Johnson the leading score for CSU double figures every game here not much today beautiful pass Better Block Here Comes hild dri did a double take thats Aaron Clark into the game for the first time this season for Wake Forest Millers lob for marsh poked away Clark a true freshman fourstar recruit from Pennsylvania and Buccaneers back on top 41 to Music 40 snap to for 4 minute scoring drought and csus right there 1132 to go we get a timeout Buccaneers by one choose duracel to make the most of holiday the back door set and thats a great block there the end of the play watch this back cut come from the weak side gets the block kept the ball in play you talk about blocks you talk about Boston Bill Russell was the guy blocked it ke it in play and boom off you go into transition big play by CL who just got into the ball game and hes played three minutes so far hasnt taken a shot but got the deflection there defensively Stan there theres always an undercurrent feeling in games like this when is the ACC team going to make its move Ill just say this wake is running out of time to make its move thats what I was talking about at the beginning of the half is that you know its really wake but more Tron are they going to try to play to win expecting wake to go ahead and knock come off door look at have Miss going his ball game charlsons in this game theyre leading this game got to make plays now Andrew Carr cant connect and it will be wake ball theyll put the shot clock back at 20 as the buzzer sounded but wake will get the reset off the car Miss deacons now four of 11 from three in the game wake is seven assist on nine turnovers Charlestons got seven assist on 13 turnovers both teams have only missed one free throw free throws turnovers and Infamous rebounding that will be the determinator of this basketball game some teams going to get on a little bit of a run and thats a chance heres your chance right now to extend this get the lead and extended if you wake for us Tau a foul on Alon suler before the ball was inbounded 17 foul sets up Andrew Carr at the line of shoot one and Music one Andrew closing in on 9900 total points in his college career goes to the line here with 895 smooth Strokes not been able to get that Strokes not been any kind of really off rhythm today but maybe knock free throw down gives him some confidence go back on the defensive end and play and if youre if youre Charleston Dont Force anything dont become scoreboard Watchers dont let weight get on this front after the made free throw by the Music deeps they go back and forth wake leads by one charlon Southern leads by one under 11 minutes to play in the game DJ Patrick comes up short rebound deflected controlled by Marsh Huff Galloping up the Music floor Hunter Salis relative ly quiet eight points hes a playmaker that weeks going to go to come crunch time and free throws are coming for Hunter we talk Im sorry we talked about the the spacing that you were seeing out of charford Southern a lot especially in the first half but now youre seeing a little bit of that in the second half for Wake Forest especially with Salis and its 65 64 65 66 give taken inch either way he has the ability to beat his guy thats defended him and also Elevate thats the thing thats really impressed me he really elev off his shot you saw an example there all you can do is fou RJ Johnson who the leading scorer for the buck so far this year but hasnt made a field goal today just picked up his third foul hes been very quiet mean not Mark a mark of that at 1038 with Johnson now going on the bench this might be a chance for Wig Forest to put pressure make some other guys beat you scoring the ball smooth stroke at the line for Hunter Salis using double figures full court pressure for his his sixth straight game to begin his Wake Forest career this is a big possession for both teams stops him they can skin cross from Southern they continue to stay in this game little dribble handoff back to Kelly DJ Patrick kicks it out doart inside Kelly with three kicks it Dart has to fire off defensive rebound kick out this is Thompson and a whistle and a foul on the Bucks excellent ball movement that time second chance opportuni for the Buccaneers was black and blue battle it was it was I like that it was but again we had Thompson taking a shot under the rest has not made a three all season they get a rebound and an offensive foul Barkley not very happy about that understood The Possession I mean hes saying everybody was jostling for positioning there and our got thrown Point here but someone jostling a little stronger and harder than the others one the officials it was TJ Kelly jostling illegally cuz theres some legal jostling that there is some legal jostling theres theres a lot of illegal and that time it was some illegal dont you hate that hes got a nice stroke for a big guy or for a little guy well no for a big because big guys arent typically always great Soft Touch free throw shooters but watch him do a good job bending and extending watch his hands follow through bam smooth nice you you let me tell you help you I make a good shooting I can help you Putt and I can make you shoot punt or punt p u tt punt wakes on a four 142 run over the last 5 and 12 minutes and we get a foul away from the ball on Clark reaching in on doart the two number 13 notice I didnt say anything about driving though say anything about get number Ive se you get off the te You got some game yeah a little bit you too we we were good together we didnt play this hey stay on basketball right there dribble hand off gets your cutter oh great defense Salis doe for it but Buccaneers made maintain possession recognized clock four three Patrick does missed it car the block out the outlet Salis ahead for Clark back to hildr good transition defense from the Charleston Southern Buccaneers dangerous lob tough catch kick out Clark his first shot rebounded by Carr nice job there by Clark to get the rebound finally space it out using clock Salis to car a bump a miss a rebound and a foul Andrew Carr has been pure at the line so far six for six tonight two more opportunities here looking to extend the Wake Forest lead Buccaneers just one of their last eight at the offensive end I love how Wake Forest has spaced the floor and then tried to work the ball back to their post and get car involved a little bit and kind of get finishing plays remember earlier was not taking advantage he didnt finish that time see how that that shot was a little rush he came came out of it a little bit so it was a strong Line Drive shot lets see if he makes the adjustment Bend and extend bend that knee and extend right there bam and and theres his 900th point as a college basketball player between a and Wake Forest and pressuring the ball on the inbound to making it difficult to get Music Applause in RJ Johnson remains on the buccaneer bench Taj Kelly way off hildr got drilled in the back no whistle rebound still found Marsh Salis waves away the screen he couldnt if you want to use glass or try to go straight should be long and that indecision will kill you beautiful feed in and out at The Rim another Miss layup for Wake Forest Marsh tumbling down the floor able to pop back up and a hand check foul going on Carr as dooh har drove Baseline with 815 to Music go thats four on Andrew Carr foul 15 foul here we go no time out we go Buccaneers kind of hanging on of the bench as if theres a time out but there was no timeout csus got an inbound into Kelly working on Marsh they got the 7 foot one dude from Cornwall England with a foul Kelly did a really nice job with the shot fake got close in the basket the foul actually occurred low when Marsh pushed him the left arm a nice job there by Kelly was a 69 free throw shooter and if youre going to win this game youve got to get some fouls CR so have they got to make their free Applause Music throw the road from here for Wake Forest only gets tougher Florida on Wednesday and then the following Wednesday against Ruckers its a seven game home stand but there some tough speed bumps along the way about it its the Florida team that can you believe theyre 4 one right now theyve already played three ACC teams theyre basically a member of The League at this point they lost to Virginia they beat Florida State and pit both those wins by double digits impressive win over pit the other night yeah Florida state had a good win over a ranked Colorado team the other day in Daytona Beach satas fade away no Im watching some tape on Colorado prepared for another teams game Colorado was in theyre not a bad basketball team top 20 FSU yes they are very solid team got some size RJ Johnson struggling to get going but Taj Kellys got a ton of rebounds tonight there 10 boards but the Buccaneers still come up empty hildr to the basket thats a Euro Step from a Euro yeah oh kicked it should be c s Music Applause fall watch this in transition push the ball this is what I like to see attack attack attack step through euro give me a Music basket so Mrs Ramos charlon Southern led by as many as 10 in the first half but it was a fourpoint game at the break and the Buccaneers have zero field goals in the last 4 minutes and 19 seconds as wake has built its largest lead of the day when you think about low seeds beating higher seeds of the NCAA theres always that L and you got to think about okay we can win this game and then they make all those intangible plays a loose ball Second Chance opportunities a transition basket Charlestons had those opportunities of late but not able to take advantage of it only more 11 points theyve got to find a way to get a charge youve got to make that run right now if you wait for us youve got to settle up defensively play smart play without fouling and only allow one shot if you allowed Music one out of the time out Kelly on The Dive missed the layup he cant believe it that was one of those plays Im talking about every that was a nice little slip screen didnt make the make the layup and Ws got to make him pay for that hild dri ejected by do Har and a late whistle going to send cam to the free throw Music line theres a drive get rid of him you see got him on the arm got him on the body got him a little bit every place I want to give a shout out to Wake Forest Sid Lucy Baris shes got a great nugget in in her Game notes wakes one of two division one schools with four players averaging 15 points a game so far this season for wake up obviously bopy hildr Salis and Carr none of them have 15 today the only other team with four players averaging 15 or more so far this season Jim Lenas hurricanes down in Coral Gables that went to the final four last year so you can expect a big scoring game when Miami and Wake Forest play each other later in the season well the the the fly in the ointment of that is other than those four guys there havent been too many other deacons that have scored points and been many of have played got Music hey when is deari Monsanto going to come back thats going to be a huge factor for Steve forbes team in December and Beyond Les trying to get this job done today though and theres three for Alon suler sus got 10 and the Bucks are right back within five at 5146 he knocked down six threes in in their lost Monday to baboon kman regie the club could be a factor in the swag but uh that was a big basket for Charleston Southern hildr creates contact and well get back to the line be the 20th and 21st free throw attempts of the afternoon so far for the decks 17 for 19 hildr currently wakes high score with 13 points Music my biggest takeaway watching this Wake Forest team so far this year stand curious to get your thought you know remember watching early in the in the season two years ago ales Williams was such a dynamic passer with the way he created Tyree applebe last year ended up being one of the leaders in the ACC and assists was a little bit different than Alon Im curious who who the passing Playmakers are going to be on this team and can this team pass the ball well enough to be good in the ACC thats a good question and obviously the easiest answer is going to be Miller but I think this might be a group effort you know I I think you look at their skill set a lot of times when you pass the ball to Hil he puts it on the floor so being able to create space but yeah Miller would be the obvious answer but I also think Salis and H are going to be guys that they have to be solid passers but you got to understand who youre passing to sometimes too they got to score tough move Kelly missed it rebound ripped down by Salis might have been a little body contact low but not enough to throw him off hes got to finish that hild driff oh little Nifty shimmy to the basket him talking about you make a pass and then he just does such a great job getting in the middle of the floor and getting to the basket if you watch him he starts off really low and explodes doesnt run from contact he maintains his balance beautifully well yes Heath hangs in the air blocked by Marion Buccaneer Ball nine to shoot just over five minutes to play all of a sudden cam HRI has 17 points watch watch Mar and just use your size you dont really do anything just go up strong and straight he gets contact clock goes off a WG Forest player 68 freshman from scolin Denmark suburb of Copenhagen if you were interested in a trip I was I was thats a offseason CH clocks winding down contested three to beat the buzzer wont go battle for the rebound one by the Buccaneers and the loose ball thrown off tells foot by he thatll stay with CSU yeah reset yeah Prett the way of the bucks but uh TR sou sing for jump shots W Forest tighten up their to defense barklay radab ball is going to take a timeout here to draw something up for the Baseline inbounds well take the timeout as well were back in 30 wake leads by nine over Charleston Southern uhoh for their last 12 that one make was the suar three that got him back within five wake has scored the last four Baseline inbounds which they refer to is the blob what they draw Music up flipping it in do hard up high Patrick comes around the screen Buccaneers continue to try to get it inside for Kelly no angle to get the pass off and a steal for Salis weak side Music Defender Miller crossover Maran kicks it Salis Applause its a foul on Keller on the rebound number three on Keller one and one for the Buccaneers 90 ft the other Music way not mad at that sequence if from awake player freshman gets it in the r okay not maybe confident I I would have shot in the paint probably nor me but he kicks it out to a wide open shooter the ball just doesnt go in but I like to see the unselfishness but you got to get those baskets you got to get the two for certain if you can and then if you get the three thats a bonus right now you fou with the clock stop and now Charleston Southern which we talked about early since about 71 gets a chance of getting closer this Music ball Kelly is now four five at the free throw line hes got 12 points one of three Buccaneers and double figures Charles state in his ball game and think about it Johnson has not been a b Fact one of Applause Music two third double double of the year today for Kelly but his teams down eight they just over four to Music play Hunter Salis takes it himself Applause Music also to answer a little bit even more depth about that question you asked about the passer with HRI and Salis and both their ability to put the ball on the floor you may not get a lot of great passes out of them like you would traditionally see dooh har some contact no whistle and two for Reggie Dart Jr iron kind that time El Buck back with an eight 338 to play love two hearts length playing m Le put him on the point of impress hes had an odyssey of a college career yeah kickball wake ball timeout 325 to go deacons trying to finish off the Bucks here at the Joel on this Black Music Friday when youre launching a new product with a tight deadline two weeks grammarlys tone suggest down the lane and finishing plays scored in double figures four out of the five games that DS had played yet can still be the number two threepoint shooter on his big forest team 33 in the opener against Elon the only time not in double figures he had nine against talson 12 of his 17 here in the second half today first game of a seven game home stand wake does not travel on the road again until the new year next year at BC January 2nd Andrew Carr with the exclamation point put the daks up 10 nice call by coach Forbes and staff after the timeout give yourself some space and get the ball in Millers hands Throw It Up High car Music finishes lopy Miller cannot believe that they just caught a foul on him and they did fouls on Hill watch this theres a little pressure and and no pressure on the back basketball and you dont protect your weak side but it really wouldnt matter the guy 69 610 611 in this case is goes up high above the crowd but a nice pass let the guy go after the basketball and then put it in a nice pass better finish by car and a quiet offensive game for RJ Johnson hes five for five from the line but 0 for five from the floor six points now all at the line for RJ really thought he would be very aggressive scoring trying to win his matchups against the guards and W for four five shooting so far back close to H yeah couldnt get it going easier said than done poopy Miller unable to angle it over the rim the Carr creates another possession get some tough rebounds in there and see Steve Forbes wants to talk so Steve Forbes uses one of his three remaining timeouts with 234 to Music go its interesting wakes next nine games against Power conference opponents you look at the Ken pal projections I know youre not a big analytics guy but the up why you got to call why you got to call me out like well because youre an old school guy and I appreciate you dont know that I do you you know Im anal we argue like were an old married couple and I know Florida go the the point is the next nine games against Power conference opponents you look at the Kemp pom theyre all projected to be close yes and and that tells you something about where wake is perceived what they have done statistically so far and you think about the Utah game the Georgia game the LSU game close games that didnt go their way theres going to be an opportunity for this team they just need to figure it out in the last four or five minutes of games and and all all that said thats very true but see also its about the eye test and the execution test and and sometimes against equal competition youve got to step your game up you have that in you you got to make those plays but I I I dont I dont well yeah I do I dont dislike anals I just think that you got to use your eyes and your hands and your ears and play I agree with you there too Johnson kicks it Patrick three ball has not been there today Buccaneers averaging eight and a half made threes a game they only got five today good J good choice Andrew Carr buries the three those free throws he made earlier gave him some Rhythm and confidence to shoot no hesitation that time great job in transition this is the largest lead of the afternoon for the Demon Deacons and a reaching foul called on poopy Music one and one here for the bucks youre the only personal let get away with some of that stuff you dont like this you dont like that I dont like a couple things you know I dont like mayonnaise dont food me too you know I dont like that see but you wont put that out cranberry sauce why do people put cranberry sauce on I put it on the plate you have to take it off or touches other stuff and that hurts your feel with people you just stuff like that you know dont call me out on all my all my my vices I but thats okay I dont mind it because its you one I dont know about you that Im going to ask you on the air do you do any cooking yourself on Thanksgiving thats the heck of a question to ask somebody you going to ask me something like that did you do any cooking over Thanksgiving I did thats you I didnt Applause no no no I did not I I was I was the family member I was the guest my job was there to compliment people eat ask did you need any money for anything you know and walk away okay thats thats my job no you do your job know your rooll know your roles out here youre play by play Im the end you dont see me you dont see me reading a lot of stuff and doing the reads and stuff I dont do that stuff roll stay in your place no I there arent too many reads here on acc Network that much thank you very much AC netwk we appreciate that but no did I do any cooking for Thanksgiving I brought him some simply lemonade some rolls cont and uh thats what I say I do and and didnt know but thankful to be able to do Laughter that its a good time of the year great basketball fellowship and friendship and then above all do great on your exams there a lot of good college basketball a lot of great games you catch any of the Carolina villain open I watched everything thats the other thing too I didnt stay long where I was either you wanted to watch ball of course I do you know and then you got people want to talk to you about a game because you know what you do they want to talk about you thats going to be it yeahs putting this thing away with some full core pressure here late in the second half couple free throws from Marion layup from Music Miller the lead has 12 to 14 yeah Miller got away with a push and watch this on the inbound situation theyve been pressure and just go to sleep when you hear me always talk theres a great example of why I always talk about come meet your pass test your pass you stood there and let it come to you and someone else took it away from took your candy speaking of the holidays Johnsons going to get a couple free throws here NC State had a nice win yesterday last night over Vanderbilt they play BYU out in Vegas tonight 5 and saw saw some of that bit and pieces of that I knew I had to be here early to be told I dont like analytics and then ask me did I could Thanksgiving dinner and uh you know so I had to get up early to hear that Lookout Dan watch I got you they trying to make it up to me there but tell me look out was this the first decks game on the court for young Miss leer you mean my daughter yeah it is her first game sitting close to thats thats the Monumental thats why I want to give us give her some love remember all of five years old all of five years Applause old wake comes up with a loose ball H driff puts his head down and gets to the bucket Applause Laughter again Fearless Steve Forbes and Justin Porterfield in a somewhat heated discussion right now not entirely sure what about as a timeout called by Wake Forest with 103 to Music go conversation between Forbes and Porterfield continues hes probably asking him did he you what did he prepare for dinner think so Music yeah well more like it for the wig Forest offense in the second half yeah better shot selection closer shots we dont have on the graphic stand but 18 free throw attempts in the second half compared to five in the first half yeah thats that goes back to being aggressive on defense a better defensive set defense went got the easy baskets more confidence better shots Music Applause Music Applause this is interesting the fact that wake is pressuring full court here with a minute to go in a 15point lead I I think habit you what did you play you playing Florida next you got to get in a better Rhythm offensively as well as defensively I think thats part of it I also think the net rankings are a part of it because the net ranking has not necessarily been wakes friend the past couple years has margins of victory in these type of games matter in that particular analytic I I dont disagree with you on that and that could be but that would be something you would talk about to coach in private but hes trying to get this basketball team to a certain spot I understand that and and so you know you put pressure on and youre working on things and getting people on the court and so uh and and you still know even though the margin may be out of out of whack you still realize that cross the southern can explode make the margin closer going back to what youre saying so I got no problem with the pressure Wake Forest 419 seconds away to improving to 33 and five in this building since the start of the 2122 season wake looks like theyre going to avoid falling at two and four they havent been two and four since seven years ago today big part six years ago today they beat UNCG to get to two and four they were one and four got an opportunity to really do some damage as you mentioned rord coming Florida game this week Andrew car just got a double double thats his 10th rebound along with 12 points hildr with 21 Miller with 13 car and Salis for 12 a piece first double double of the season for Mr CLK in jit theyre going through some changes there last year too there thats thats going to be an interesting game Im looking forward to seeing it I saw Dale State play the other day did you yeah I did I saw Scout in the Horn uh not bad team I think they pick like maybe six fifth or six in the me Stan Waterman is their uh is their coach and uh they theyve got some guys that can score in the premium got a couple big guys Applause and Presbyterian on December 21st theyre 5 two they gotten off to a good start for Quinton frell yeah so seven Applause games so Steve Forbes able to empty the bench Vincent ruti is into the game along with Will Underwood Owen kedy and Kevin Dunn final seconds with wake up by 18 doart for three 16 to go thatll do it 15 is the final margin some dicey moments wake again trailed by double digits at home in the first half but Steve
