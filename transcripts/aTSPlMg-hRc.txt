came into the program a year ago as a walk on coaches didnt even really know who he was and in less than two years has become their best player this should be a great match up between these forwards today pit controls the tap its a different starting lineup today for the Panthers a change along the front line as they go with William jeffris and G GMO Diaz Graham in the starting lineup instead of Federico Federico Zack Austin Diaz Graham gets in the book on the first possession pit grabs an early Lead South Carolina state they enter it three and8 overall ever at their top scored at over 13 points per game loose ball after a rebound and Pitts got a run out and an easy one and Pittsburgh will look to push it in transition at all times and great job there by pit on that first possession of limiting South Carolina state to one shot South Carolina state fourth in the country in offensive rebounds that is what they do Pit right there doing a great job Jeff cable yesterday said we got to take care of the backboard the Bulldogs had 29 offensive rebounds in their win earlier this week over Jacksonville that game on Monday theyve started 0 for two from the Applause field starting lineup for the Panthers theres jeffris and Diaz Graham down low its an electric back court between Carrington Leed and Hinson they combine for over 50 points per game between the three Diaz Graham tees up a three that one barely Clips the rim Pittsburgh will look to shoot a lot of threes when they are open more times than not theyre going to have at least four guys on the court that are very capable of shooting behind that Arc Jeff capable even very comfortable with his big guys right there shooting those open Applause threes you see that last effort from pit against kesas 82 points made 11 up their last 12 shots in that game a block and it stays on this end with the Bulldogs pit head coach Jeff capable in his Fifth Season make it his sixth he is 82 and 84 at pit LED this team to 24 wins a season ago but when we talked to him earlier this week he said this is a very different team from what he put on the floor last year yeah a lot of their experience last year was in the back court and their front Court was young and that is kind of flipflop this year a younger players Carlton Carrington a true freshman coming in playing big minutes at the point guard spot so kind of a little bit of switch there but again we you got guys like Blake Henson and yod Diaz Graham Federico feder Rico returning from a year ago it helps to have that veteran leadership in that front Court they won a game in the NCAA tournament their first postseason win in the big dance since 2016 after South Carolina state gets on the board the jumpy from jumper from mccardy underneath Henson in traffic hell head to the line to shoot a pair South Carolina state coached by Eric Martin in his second season he was on bub Huggins staff at West Virginia even that one year at Kansas State spent 16 Seasons with Bob Huggins and welcomes eight newcomers in his second year at the helm of this Bulldogs program and Eric Martin also played for Bob Huggins at Cincinnati was a great player started on a Cincinnati Final 14 back in the early 90s and you we talked about the offensive rebounding and if anybody knows anything about a bob Huggins team and staff they are going to hit the backboard hard so no surprise that he has brought that same philosophy to South Carolina state Hensons first points come from the free throw line H going a little bit of a one two two full court pressure here just to try to slow down the Bulldog see if they can force an easy turn turn over and South Carolina state is well a team that will certainly mix it up defensively they love to pressure the ball willll get out and press full court as well you see early on here pit doing a great job on that defensive backboard Henson Catch and Release three Off the Music Mark Henson powering inside and he has it denied at the Rim great block there by Dron Jones looked like Hinson had a pretty easy layup and Jones coming out of nowhere and Hinson making up for it with a turnover on the other end hson able to scoop it in what do you think about the tempo here in the first couple of minutes its certainly what Jeff capable wants and I think Eric Martins going to get a timeout here to try to calm his team down as pit getting off to a quick lead here with about 3 minutes into this ball Applause game we head to a timeout pits jumped out to an 8 to2 early lead here at the Peterson Event Center in Music Pittsburgh rated Mature when did you last really feel something beyond the extraordinary feel it now on PlayStation 5 play not much has gone South Carolina States way to start this basketball game but we do see a great block here by Drayton Jones looked like South Carolina state might get out and transition and get an easy one but the Hustle by Blake Hinson getting back on the other end creating the deflection turns it into a steel gets rewarded with the easy layup out on the break it has been all Panthers so far early on its been a little bit of a different start for Blake Henson weve seen him active in the open floor and around the rim he averages over four made threes per Applause game South Carolina state they play a deep bench and a lot of production from those guys that dont start like this guy TAA Taylor had 10 points Off the Bench against Jackson Bill and he knocks down the jumper South Carolina state not a great perimeter shooting team they certainly like to try to get the ball inside in and around the rim to score they have guys that are certainly capable of making shots but they just havent shot it well so far this year and that length of Pittsburgh could be a factor here today but on that possession right there that little midrange jump shot looked pretty good from the Bulldogs pit one of the longest teams in the country they have great size as Carringtons three is Off the Mark and South Carolina State coach Eric Martin said this will be really the first team weve played this year that we dont have the advantage in terms of just player length yeah this pit front Lines got three guys s feet or taller that they can rotate in there and you just dont see that very often in college basketball anymore it seems to be much more guard oriented but pit team as long as they on the front Court theyve got some good guard play as well pocket pass underneath Diaz Graham cant convert its a NASCAR Tempo all the way to the rim and the layup goes with the left from Taylor one of the best ways to combat that length around the rim if you are South Carolina state is do exactly that get out and transition turn your defense into offense a great job there all of a sudden little 40 run here by the Bulldogs to cut this lead to two pit they are 22 and0 all time against vak teams as Carringtons three Is On Target and that was one of the things speaking with Eric Martin that concerned him the most we said what do you think about this pit team he goes well if you watch that game against West Virginia a week ago it was scary scary was the word that he used made 16 threes nine of them coming from Blake Henson and you can see Ry right there just a dangerous shooting team leg it knes in and he finishes you know thats one of the things that makes a great threepoint shooting team so dangerous is you have to respect that line so much your defense gets extended and it opens up the lane and provides driving opportunities like that time from legot right there Le is scored in double figures in all 10 games this season for pit the transfer from Rhode Island deep in the shot clock South Carolina state in some trouble still out on the arc a hoist and its in from Michael teal not sure that was the way Eric Martin drew it up but you know what when you go on the road against a great pit team youll take it any way you can get it heals coming off a huge game against Jacksonville on Monday he had a team High 17 points and went three for three from three the block will send us to a timeout pit leads at 13 to nine South Carolina state not a great threepoint shooting team but when that clock is running low you got to let it go youll take it any way you can get it what I feel in my heart during the Subaru share the love event its just so rewarding we believe in love not just our customers but also

games since the 1986 87 season when Curtis aen did it and Curtis is currently the radio color analyst for the pit Sports Network theres a look at Curtis andan Blake side by side you know this throughout the rich history of this Pittsburgh basketball program quite surprised its been that long since somebody scored 25 points in three straight games but just goes to show you how talented and offensively how dominant Blake Henson can be and has been over the last few games as you see it right there with the tough little fallway coming out of the timeout just a little isolation play there at the top of the key and pretty good defense from South Carolina State but that was just a tough tough shot sometimes good offense beats good defense theres his last three outings hes been nails from downtown has six already in this one the top scor in the ACC at 219 points per game and hes tops in the nation 42 made threes per contest loose ball SC picked up Banker no from Taylor itll stay on this end with the Bulldogs you see Jeff cable a little frustration there on the sideline Im sure he beat it into his players head over the last couple days in practice guys we got to rebound the ball sometimes South Carolina States best offense is the offensive backboard and go careless turnover there and underneath that of bounds play Henson able to pluck it off the deck driving in with the left blocked no Applause whistle Bulldogs want to run and a foul on the floor as Mitchell Taylor drives hard well weve seen it already a few times in this first half South Carolina state doing a great job around the rim defensively we talked about the length of Pittsburgh but that time Dallas James with the block and when South Carolina state has been able to get a clean stop theyve been able to get out on the break and transition and had some success and again that time drawn the bulldogs were taken out underneath out of bounds South Carolina state LED Missouri by 16 in the first half of that contest they also had a ninepoint lead over Ferman they lost both of those games but theyre certainly capable and theyre three and eight which is already close to their win total from last year in Eric Martins second season driving kick threes an airball from Carrington it was interesting talking to coach Eric Martin he said look as new as our team is and as young as our team is theres these are just the growing pains were going to have you said I got to stay patient which he has been doing and were just going to figure it out they played a really really difficult schedule they had six games in a row on the road so some early Growing Pains throughout the season but he hoped that will prepare them as they head into conference play here towards the first of the year theyve been a tough out for Missouri Ferman and Charleston Southern the love and the flush from Federico feder Rico and a great pass there from Carrington off the dribble penetration and and feder Rico feder Rico has really improved his offensive game and pit does a great job the guards do have for the last couple years of looking for that lob when he gets near the rim Taylor kny off balance and he gets it down off the glass well we talked about the threepoint shooting ability but Pittsburgh can score in a variety of ways in that time Carlton Carrington getting in the lane throwing it up to his big man

called for a class a technical foul yeah we see the drive here in a good finish Taylor looked like you said something to the official or maybe to the Pittsburgh bench couldnt quite hell but Les Jones there the official on the Baseline obviously saw it and heard it right away and just uh you know got it cant get caught up in the moment like that I know youre got the adrenaline going youre excited just made a big play but you know he knows you can see right there by his body language he knows that was a mistake but uh Pittsburgh going to the free thr line for a couple easy ones here Taylors been the guy so far for South Carolina state he has six points on three of four shooting the rest of the team just five combined on two of 10 as leit goes one for two from the stripe the 90 free throw shooter misses Music one theres Taylor today off to a hot start came off the bench for the second straight game scored 10 Off the Bench against Jacksonville on Monday South Carolina state switching it up here defensively going with the full court one two2 back into a one two2 halfcourt zone trying to see if they can throw Pittsburgh off their Rhythm a little bit here get him to take a quick bad shot deep in the shot clock Austin blocked fourth block of the game already for the Bulldogs and a whistle and a foul on the floor and Eric Martins teams have been known to switch it up defensively love to pressure the ball love to try to protect the rim you see there Dallas James with the good block and again about the thir four time so far in this first half where theyve been able to turn defense into offense by getting out on the break leg just wrenches it Loose Coast to Coast cant finish and James clears for South Carolina Music state both teams looking to push the pace here offensively not having a lot of success the last couple times and another turnover here from the bogs its been frenetic Austin lost the handle on the way up a three and its tipped out of bounds itll stay on this end it has been a track beat since the Under 12 here in pit it certainly has been a little sloppy both ways by both teams trying to push the pace but you got to be able to do so under control and convert neither team doing a very good job of that these last few possessions but South Carolina state already with quick five quick turnovers in the first 10 minutes so got to take care of the ball if you want to have any chance to win on the Applause road shot clock at 10 crosy oneonone burow throws it up and he draws a foul and not a good foul there by the pit Panthers did a good job defensively got it down to six on the shot clock there and you dont want to bail out the offense by reaching in at the last minute if he makes a tough shot he makes one but certainly dont want to do something like that to send him to the free throw line and let him earn it the easy way what do you think has led to kind of this this street ball type flow that weve had the last four or five minutes well both teams look to push the pace offensively and both teams doing a good job of being active defensively but just havent been able to convert on the offensive end when they have gotten on the break one straight in we go one ACC PM with Mark Packer and Taylor tabom Wednesdays from Marks Charlotte studio in his basement at 4 Eastern theyll continue talking college football and have the latest from around the conference right here on acc Network and the ESPN app its a fivepoint game midway through this first half the Bulldogs are Scrappy and a lead pass and crossy puts it home Jeff C not going to be very happy with his guys on that last possession they knew and prepared for this one two2 full court changing defense type pressure from South Carolina state he said one of the key points is we have to take care of the basketball against whatever theyre doing defensively that time with the turnover best way to make up for a turnover come down and get it to your best player and your leading score in the ACC let him hit a three first three of the day for Blake Henson it comes with less than 10 minutes to go in the first half again he averages over four per game tops in the nation the rebuttal off the mark from a bulldog Simpson with the Miss but land make it low couldnt handle the rebound and itll stay on this end and Eric martinss teams love to try to create turnovers on the defensive end and that time just a little sloppy from the Panthers and again South Carolina state able to get out on the break where they have had success but next time down pit doing a much better job playing under control finding a wide open Blake Hinson whos going to knock down that shot more times than not thought it was interesting coach cable talking about Hinson and just how much hes grown into a leader he studied leadership during the off season he read books he watched videos and really took it upon himself to lead this team as weve got an offensive foul on South Carolina state and because of the experience that they lost a year ago with all of their backcourt players Blake Hinson had to step into this role and obviously was had a great year for him last year but has just really elevated his game and with a couple new players coming in that had to play significant roles like Carlton Carrington ishma leet he had to be the guy to step up and its been very very successful and Jeff capable has said nothing but complimentary things about him and obviously his oncore play has spoken for itself nice swing Corner threelegged partially blocked deep in the clock South Carolina state pulls it out of the pack and theyve got numbers three on two they hit the trailer in a three from dubinsky is off the heel offensive rebound Bulldogs that was already their seventh offensive rebound Cross Key catch and shoot no eigh offensive rebound fresh 20 for South Carolina state you know its kind of the old conundrum of basketball its great that were an offensive rebounding team but what does that mean that means we miss a lot of shots but Pittsburgh playing with fire here a little bit by continuing to let South Carolina state have multiple chances at it each time down Timeout on the floor pit leads it 21 15 South Carolina state Scrappy here on the road the love that goes into a Subaru comes out when Subaru and our retailers share the love 116000 animals

check division unlock check and check MVP case a season thats still anyones season check baby NFL on ESPN South Carolina state head coach Eric Martin in his second season played four and then spent 16 Seasons as an assistant to Bob Huggins David does this look like a Huggins team this is a bob Huggins influence team to a you see pretty good defense from pit doing a good job closing out standing Fring the ball being active being in their stance but you just cant afford to continue to give up two or three chances at an each time down you know everybody makes a big deal about boxing out when it comes to rebounding which obviously thats an important part of it but the most important part of rebounding is you got to go get get the ball I mean you got to go pursue it rebounding is a mentality and Eric Martin has done a great job of instilling that mentality into his players and you can see already with eight offensive rebounds so far in this game their last four games plus 42 on the glass they dont shoot it particularly well but they fight and they claw and they scratch on the boards and theyre only down six and that backboard is a big reason why and Pits been lucky they South Carolina state has not been able to convert a lot of those extra opportunities but you just do not want to continue to give them that many chances at it this guy Henson has nine of pits 21 double comes and a foul called on South Carolina state thatll be on Caleb Music mccardy fourth team foul on the Bulldogs second on mccardy as Davon Everett checks back in we spotlighted him at the top former walkon averaging over 13 points per game in his last six hes not scored yet here today comes away with a steal South Carolina state forcing the fourth pit turnover just G mod Diaz Graham that time was trying to do the right thing by getting the ball inside to Blake Hinson who had position its just really difficult to make that pass from that angle you got to reverse the ball to the wing to get a better angle to get that ball inside runner from Everett and a foul on the rebound called on a bulldog thatll go against Drayton Jones and Im sure in that last time out Jeff K brought it up several times to his team guys we simply have to do a better job of rebounding the ball you see that time there limiting South Carolina state to one shot Jeff cable also probably saying guys we got to were were forcing some silly turnovers here South Carol States done a good job extending the full core pressure but lets stop turning the ball over and just slow down a little bit sometimes press can do a good job of speeding you up to where you make bad decisions but its got to slow down and be under control well and he said in those three losses this season four pit one of the glaring errors for the Panthers is that they did get sped up and turned it over more than their average and theres another the fifth of the game for pit yeah and thats just a young turnover right there from Carlton carington and what I mean by that is he was looking at the offense a lot of times what you need to do to be a great passer is you got to read the defense dont focus on the offense see what the defense is doing and thatll tell you whos open pits turned it over five times in less than the last five minutes of action piering turning and hoisting the airball Alon couldnt get it to go Corner three from leget and the rebound for South Carolina state you know we mentioned it at the beginning the pace certainly favored pit there as we see another threepointer on the break for South Carolina state Again atiba Taylor playing really well in this first half as I was saying that pace early on certainly favored Pittsburgh but I think right now if youre Eric Martin you got to be really happy with what your defense has done to limit this highpowered Pittsburgh offensive team only 21 points with about 5 minutes to go here in this first half long two put on the line from Carrington no offensive rebound Diaz Graham a deep NBA range three from Hansen is money and thats why hes going to get some interest at that next level you saw how deep that was that was almost out of bounds there in front of South Carolina States bench and you know when Blake Henson gets his feet set at about 6667 he has the ability to shoot over smaller Defenders and does such a great job of getting a shot off quickly but impressive range there on that three Henson the first player in double figures today been in double figures all 11 games this season and the 65th time in his career north of 10 on the break jeffris the lob and the Finish from leot the guard getting in deep yeah good fast break there by Pittsburgh started with good defensive rebound made three passes out on the break and thats what Jeff cable wants to see more out of his team as this game goes on Baseline jumpers off the mark But pits out of bounds on the rebound heres that Henson three yeah and it was a little bit of a broken set there but you see hes clearly six feet maybe more behind that line and just shot it with ease and that next time down a great pass there by jefferis and good finish by legot this is one of the things Jeff cable talked about yesterday was he said his team has not finished half well this season and I have a feeling hes going to be keeping a close eye on this last four minutes to see if his team can kind of open this lead up heading into the locker room at halftime weve talked a lot about South Carolina States defense what has pit done well defensively South Carolina States missed eight of their last nine shots well Id say through the first 15 minutes overall pit has done a good job defensively they just havent done a good job on the backboard like we talked about earlier but theyve been solid South Carolina States hit a couple tough shots late in the shot clock but overall pits defense has been pretty good in the half court Miss three from The Freshman Jaylen low pit is three for 10 from downtown Hensons two for two but everybody else one for eight a three from a bulldog is an air Bank out of bounds stay on this end with South Carolina Applause state the Bench productions been strong for South Carolina state 16 of their 18 points has come from the bench the bad news the starters have just one basket Carrington Rising Fire its an Applause airball shot clock at 10 Taylor trying to end the drought tough turnaround and he hits it and again thats about the fourth or fifth time we mentioned it just a few minutes ago Pittsburgh has done a pretty good job defensively theyve been disciplined theyve been solid but South Carolina state has just made a couple tough shots and a guy thats been quiet for South Carolina state Davon Everett who be focused on there in the open and so if youre Eric Martin you got to be pleased your best players had a very quiet first half but youre still only down six in this ball game deep in the shot clock a long way from the bucket low kick out jeffris Catch and Release Applause no and as great of a job as South Carolina state has done on the offensive backboard themselves pit with only three offensive rebounds here in the first half and figure a team with their length probably be going to be a point of focus at the locker room at halftime 26 sloppy play leads to the eighth South Carolina state turnover but head coach Eric Martin has to be pleased with his teams effort late in the first you are mine no is that a traffic light or break light select all images animalg I like dogs heard sheep wait do dogs hurt sheep how else are the

do people will talk wow oh fancy uhhuh I fancy a great deal mhm even the trays have trays well she is the hostess with the mostest who spins the least hey coming up next Virginia Tech hosts Vermont in blackburg at Ford Eastern then Virginia squares off against Northeastern its right here on acc Network and the app alongside former Louisville great David padet Im James wesling and South Carolina state getting bench production like they did on Monday against Jackson Bill and really like they have all season long yeah a team that has 11 guys averaging double figure minutes on the season so certainly a deep team and kind of he got to do it by committees sometimes and its been that way throughout the course of the year and certainly no different here today so you know sometimes you say is it good to not be able to necessarily pinpoint to one or two guys who you can rely on a basket for yeah but but you know what you know you got guys on the bench that can come in and contribute thats also a luxury to have as well on this end hes not on the floor but has pit been relying too much on Blake Henson as Jaylen low drills a three prior to that basket Henson has 12 and the rest of his team with just 14 I mean Blake Henson has certainly carried the load here and I think coming out of that timeout Jeff cable drawing up a play with hson on the bench and great little side ball screen action hit the lift guy out of the corner and that three looked really good from Jaylen low there and going to have to get a couple other guys going here offensively especially with Blake hson sitting on that bench which dont expect him to sit over there too much longer Jeff keep will probably put him back in here pretty quickly see if that last three gives low The Freshman some confidence just his fourth of the year and after a steal it leads to a dunk for guer Mo Diaz Graham and that was a great pass by ishma leet to G mod Diaz Graham there did a great job of running the floor and two quick turnovers here for the the South Carolina State Bulldogs and Pittsburgh looking to get a little momentum here and Jeff Cables going to be happy to see this maybe get some positive play and momentum going into the locker room you see here great Advanced passing just a great job by Diaz Graham of running the floor and getting rewarded by legot with the great pass Yeah you mentioned earlier that coach capable was not happy with how his teams have been closing out halves much better today a blocking foul in the Halo this will put legot at the line a little bit of a breakdown there defensively by South Carolina state leg it was dribbling back out didnt think he had anything and then realized that lane was wide open and going to the freeza line to try to extend this lead even more here with about a minute and a half left to go what do you like about ishma leeds game hes got today seven points four rebounds and four assists but hes averaging over six rebounds per game as a guard just six three on the season I think thats what Jeff Capel likes about him most is his ability to rebound as a guard that is just so important you cant say okay guys weve got three SF Footers on our roster we just got to rely on them to get the rebounds no you cant do that if you got guards that are can average five six seven rebounds a game that just goes such a long way for your team but you said it his versatility just kind of finds a way to fill up that stat sheet in every category and doing so far here in this first half Pits on a 70 and an extended 15 to5 run to take their largest lead of the day its a Bakers Dozen 13 shot clock at 10 for the Bulldogs crosy on the handle Taylor off the back rim and its one and done for the Bulldogs final minute before the half down low Diaz Graham and hes foul seventh team foul on the Bulldogs and again G mod Diaz Graham doing a great job of getting out and running he started that break with the defensive rebound and thats twice now in the last couple possessions where he has taken off and run the floor great hustle and hes been rewarded his teammates have found him with the dunk earlier on and now going to the free line for chance of two its a 58 foul shooter drills the first one as pit pushes their lead to 14 and these pit bigs you mention all the sevenfooters and the guys that are just under 7 ft tall but they all move really well I mean how advantageous is that for a team that wants to play at their Tempo yeah it fits what Jeff capable wants to do perfectly and give him and his staff a lot of credit Ive had a chance to cover this team quite a few quite a bit over the last few years and the development the Improvement that these guys have shown has been really remarkable and thats a credit to Jeff cable and his staff for continuing to put that work in with these guys Everett still cant find the bottom of the net he is started 0 for four has not scored the top scorer on the season for South Carolina state Hensons threes wide right offensive rebound stick back no tapped around into the hands of a Applause bulldog you see the length there Pittsburgh even though they werent able to convert with both the twins in the game at the same time that just presents such a problem there on that back line and again another Bulldog turnover hits in AE and for a thunderous double fisted Applause dunk halim is here in pit takes their largest lead of the contest into the locker on a 10 scoring run shot clock into single digits for the Bulldogs AA Taylor was their top scorer in the first half all alone underneath a slam from Drayton Jones and a great job there of not panicking as that shot clock ran low would have been very easy to kind of force up a bad shot and Drayton Jones just getting open there behind the defense and if youre Eric Barns team here you just got to slowly chip away at this lead theyre continuing to stay with that half cour one two2 zone it was effective there in that first half but hes got to find a way to find Blake Hinson most importantly cant let him get anything open first half stats South Carolina state didnt shoot it well but they outrebounded pit Carrington from the corner around and out Applause Panthers are 22 and0 all time against Mak teams South Carolina state picked last in the preseason Mak pole and theyve got the first four points of this second half pretty much the start you wanted if youre Eric Martin but pit two times in a row there defensively has just theyve helped up too early the dribble penetration theyre helping up too early and theres nobody left to cover down on that that Baseline but a great job by the Bulldogs of dropping off for the easy layups this looks like a team South Carolina state its going to pose some real problems in League Play yeah oh theres no question about it Eric Martin talked about that with the tough nonconference schedule theyve played and we see here just two great drop off passes and for the easy finish but that that nonconference slate there they had six games in a row on the road as they force another turnover here from the Panthers his Hope was look its a fine line you dont want to crush the confidence of your players by going on the road against High major opponents and just getting your brains beat in but at the same time you got to play against good teams if you want to get better and so hes done a very good job of kind of balancing that that act and hes hoping itll pay dividends and with the way theyve played here and been resilient I think this team is certainly going to be one to keep an eye on in the makak as the New Year rolls around Carrington on the move for pit and Le it stepped out of bounds on the catch second turnover for the Panthers in the early minutes of this second half and thats number seven for the game hit they were an 11 seat in the NCAA tournament a season ago won one of those first four games and they took down Iowa state in the first round they lost in the second round so they went two and one in the tournament last year they were six and4 through 10 games early on in the season seven and3 this year theres their season summary from last year that first 20 plus win season since 2015 2016 14 ACC wins including some big ones in the month of February Jeff capable was named the league coach of the year yeah very rightfully so and a great pass there by Yo Diaz Graham against that zone to a wide open William jeffris but yes Jeff cable did an unbelievable job last year coaching this pit team I mean to go 14 and six in The Gauntlet that is the ACC I mean thats just incredible so very welld deserved honors in that coach the year but he loves his team again this year we talked about some of the turnover theyve had but a lot of good key returning players obviously Blake Hinson leaned away but hes very very excited about his team this year Diaz grah bothering the shot then he rips down the rebound fuels the break ahead to jeffris swiveling lost it on the way up a strip and a foul called on South Carolina state and I think thats what Jeff cable is going to want to see his team do more of here over the last 16 minutes is lets get out on the break we mentioned it thats why they had a lot of success there closing out that first half on a 100 run did a good job securing the rebound lets get it and go did a great job taking advantage of that and again good job with the advanced pass and Jeffers getting fouled and going to the free throw line that is pit basketball that Jeff C certainly wants to see two shots here for jeffris swish is in the first we asked coach capable how is this team shooting the ball so well from Beyond The Arc I I like the the terminology that he used when he said the ball has energy what do what does he mean by that it doesnt stick so offensively its always moving you know the killer of great teams on the offensive end can be when the ball sticks if it gets to one guy and then it stays there for three or 4 seconds you know a lot of programs actually keep track of how often a player is holding the basketball on offense with the thought being the less time youre holding it the better cuz that means the ball is always moving and the more the ball moves the tougher its going to be for the defense so he is continually harping on his team to keep that ball moving and when you shoot it as well as they do you can certainly see why spin move leg its all the way for a layup and great job there creating the steel on the defensive end and a great spin move under control and able to finish and you know Pittsburgh mentioned it time and time again when theyre able to get out on the break just a great job of converting and finishing first time out Eric marks teams going to going to need a little bit of a timeout here but you see Pittsburgh turning defense into offense in a great spin move Panthers trying to open up the 17point Music Music lead Music buddies I present to you the Kerwin frost box Ill take that

Event Center with David pageant Im James wesling pit what has made them so connected offensively sharing the basketball very simple you know average over 15 assists per game on the season less than 10 turnovers which is very very impressive and you see already here today 12 assists on 15 made field goals we mentioned it before the break talking about Jeff capable really puts emphasis on the ball having energy its never stopped its always in motion big key as to why his team has been a very successful so far early on this season building off of a great last year just continually share the ball its one of the things he loves about them is their unselfishness shot erased by leged his third block of the Season pit has not shot the ball from Beyond The Arc up to their standards but still have been able to build a 17point lead a foul on the inside as G mod Diaz Graham is down well check on him when we come come Music Music Music back Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music heres a look at that last foul David did you ever take any shots like this down low in the post when you played oh if you play long enough youre going to get hit in the face once in a while unfortunately and obviously no ill intent there just turned and got a hand right to the face there but got up and ran right back over to the bench saying you know what if I if I dont get back over there in front of Coach cable before too long hes going to take me out so looks like g o Diaz Grahams going to be just fine to continue in this game hes had a nice game seven rebounds Five Points three assists and a Tap Out for Henson who lines it up and knocks it down and a great great play there by G mod Diaz Graham with the tap out wasnt able to secure the rebound with two hands but did it the next the best thing which is tap it out and when you can tap out to the guy like Blake Henson hes going to make you look even better knocking down that three hits on a 10 run stopp and pop at a foul and this will put Taylor at the line for South Carolina state you see here this is where the length just takes over but just a really heads up play I mean if you cant grab it at least tip it back out try to keep it alive cuz when that shot goes up all the Defenders are going to be inside the threepoint line and one of the best times in basketball two shoot of three is off of an offensive rebound there so just a heads up play from Gamo Diaz Graham who you mentioned has had a great game here this afternoon he really filled up the stat sheet against West Virginia at 15 points six of seven shooting also went three for four from Beyond The Arc thats a sevenfooter that can step out and hit threes and run the floor as well yeah spoken to to Jeff capable in the past about it you know theyre from both of them are from Spain from the Canary Islands and you know very typical of European style basketball is regardless of your size you work on skill development from a very early age and you can see the way he moves the way hes able to shoot the basketball just a very very skilled player and uh I know Jeff cable certainly loves having him on his team especially today couple of free throws from Tia Taylor who leads South Carolina state hes the first bulldog in double figures with 11 heres some full court pressure Diaz Graham the lob too high for feder Rico out of bounds and you love the unselfishness there and not too often do you see a sevenfooter and this is Jorge Diaz Graham getting into the game trying to throw a little bit of a live pass there good idea just better execution timing was a little bit off there but again Pittsburgh trying to really push that pace and get out on the break eighth turnover for the Panthers today floater in the L in and out no and Federico Federico with the rebound lead pass hson soaring in and he lays it home and again another great Advanced pass that time by jayen low to Blake Hinson getting out and running and you know Pittsburghs done a great job on the defensive end of this floor especially on Davon Everett you know we mentioned him in the open has been kind of the guy this year for South Carolina state very very quiet here so far this afternoon another rim run leg again Bulldogs rip it Music away South Carolina state without a field goal the last almost five minutes of Music action hook pass leot steps in front to bother it did a whistle and a jump ball Arrow favors pit fast break 101 basketball doesnt get much more simple than this when you have to take only two dribbles to get the ball from one end to the other youre doing something right and that time Blake hson great pass though by Jaylen L hitting him right in stride for the easy two 20po lead for the Music Panthers fed Rico underneath muscles at home not too many teams across the country can go seven footer to seven footer from the perimeter inside like that but Jorge Diaz Graham with the great little bounce pass away from the defense and feder Rico feder Rico catches the ball in there with two feet like that hes going to be almost impossible to stop Diaz Graham commits the foul you see here good little shot fake and the onehanded bounds pass just great skill and good job there by feder Rico feder Rico not bringing it down he caught it kept it high and was able to finish Jorge Diaz Graham coming into today seven assists just three turnovers on the season I mean those are Reserve guard numbers in terms of Music passing you know what else is impressive for this Pittsburgh team if you take a look at their statute we mentioned the inexperienced and the younger players like Carlton Carrington whos checking back into this game a true freshman has 61 assists and only 19 turnovers so far in the season that is almost in Hur of for a true freshman so you can see why Jeff cable is so excited about this young but talented team 20point lead four pitch after the free throws from teal some pressure applied by South Carolina state couple of freshman guards playing keep away in back court low in Carrington Diaz Graham tees it up oh on the follow Austin throws it Applause down Zack Austin coming off that right wing out of nowhere with the twohand putback given South Carolina state little taste of their own medicine with the offensive rebound and great finish there on the other end for the Bulldogs and again pit getting out on the break whistle and a foul called on a bulldog back to the dunk from Austin and one of the most vulnerable parts of his own defense is the offensive glass cuz you dont necessarily have a man to block out youre more responsible for an area and that time Zach Austin just did a great job crashing from that right wing and a terrific put back Austin the transfer from High Point Junior from Winston Salem averaging just over six points and five rebounds per game he was all big South a season to go Federico federo at the line a brick on the first Music one you know David Pitts only hit five threes today 5 for 16 from Beyond The Arc this has been kind of a a different effort a different style of play from pit today it has and I think that goes to show how versatile they can be on offense but give them credit South Carolina state has played that one two2 half court zone defense for a majority of this game and H has done a great job of not settling for a bunch of perimeter jump shots theyve got theyve done a good job of getting the ball into the middle of Zone and had a lot of success from there and obviously when you also get out on the break and are able to finish its certainly going to help your field goal percentage as well and Jeff cable there just not happy with that foul and defensive end and great finish there by Jordan Simpson going to the line chance for a threepoint play caps off the oldfashioned three trims it to 17 low Crossing lobbying and a dunk for feder Rico and that has become part of Pittsburghs offense feder Rico has done a great job of learning how to just stay around the rim and when his teammates and those guards get into that lane off the dribble penetration they are looking to throw that ball up and that is a very very effective weapon to have on the offensive end Federico feder Rico had 39 dunks a season ago and he commits a foul on this end itll send us to the Under 12 Pit by 19 at home and it has been all Pittsburgh this afternoon feder Rico with the easy twohanded done Panthers cruising here in Music Pittsburgh Music Music buddies I present to you the Kerwin frost box Ill take that hey y buddies lets

points back in 08 against dwan Blair in this pit team well this is uh certainly an embarrassing surprise but yes I had a lot of great experiences in this building it uh you know certainly known for being one of the more hostile environments especially back in those big East days and uh you know we we obviously had some pretty good teams too we for whatever reason just always seemed to play well in there so uh some good memories from the Peterson Event Center 61 from the field David padet second in Louisville program history all Big East made the elite eight quite the resume and I think youre in half to be an extremely rare company just in terms of the success you had in this gym at pill yeah like I said I mean we were playing against some phenomenal Pittsburgh teams you know Jamie Dixon had it rolling back there in the day and uh we just for whatever reason we just always found a way to play well in this building yeah like I said a lot of great memories from the Peterson Event Center from myself and a lot of the Louisville Cardinal fan base Jorge Diaz GR stepping out and canning a three this is eighth three of the Year these bigs are capable from the perimeter for the Panthers and they lead by Applause 22 on the floor weve got a tie up Arrow favors South Carolina state well you can see why they are one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the country obviously weve talked a lot about Blake Henson and his ability to shoot the ball but when you have seven that can step out and do it as well it is uh certainly an added bonus when you look down your bench and say go ahead and knock one down eight to shoot for the dogs long three Off the Mark rebound pit Pitts won 91 of its nonconference games here at the Peterson Center 77 of their contests at home collectively Runners off the mark from low offensive rebound Diaz Graham up Applause up pit Cycles it out with t to shoot hard pass Diaz Graham gives it up blow Catch and Release its good and tomorrow when this Pittsburgh team gets together and watches this film Jeff capable is certainly going to praise his team for that possession right there we talked on it earlier about how he loves the ball to have energy and that possession right there was phenomenal probably 10 12 passes if not more and dont settle for a good shot when you can get a great one and that is exactly what happened on that possession hit putting on a clinic their largest lead of the day once again theyve pushed it to 23 theyre on an 80 run three ball short from Applause debinski and pit has done a great job here in this second half of taking care of the backboard we spent a lot of time in the first half talking about South Carolina state and their ability to rebound the ball on the offensive end but no offensive rebounds for the Bulldogs here in this second half Diaz Graham fighting Austin from the corner didnt get the friendly roll fied off the glass kept alive look at the Applause hustle and a foul called on South Carolina State just phenomenal hustle there by the Pittsburgh Panthers all the way around Zach Austin selling out it behind his teams bench and just keeping the ball alive on the backboard you see the length there just having an impact and great Hustle by Zach Austin taking out one of the managers back there behind the bench but kept the ball alive and Panthers are going to keep possession so just terrific hustle Jeff cable is going to be really happy to see that as well as a former player and Coach this time of year its mid December right before the holidays right after finals the lob and the Finish from Zach Austin but is it hard as a player to get locked in this time of year and and as a coach as well you know its quite the opposite actually because school is over for the semester you dont have to worry about classes or study hall or anything like that all youre doing is focusing on basketball for these next few weeks obviously the holidays players that get a chance to go home and that kind of stuff but it is all basketball all the time over winter break and its a great time to kind of try to regroup really work on the things that you need to work on from a team standpoint because once that calendar flips to the new year you are full steam ahead into the conference schedule and you got to be clicking on all cylinders so its its a great time of year to kind of rally your team together and say all right we got through the nonconference now lets focus on the next part of our schedule yeah thats a really good point heres this weeks featured womens college basketball matchup right here on acc Network in the ESPN app number 14 Notre Dame theyve won seven straight and tomorrow they square off against Purdue at the Joyce Center coverage begins at noon Eastern couple of free throws from Taylor pit leads at 6035 that ends the 100 Run for the Panthers in this second half pit Plus 11 on the glass here in this second half Austin running the floor the Euro Step finish no low from the top cant hit the Applause dot crosi lost Applause it the cutter low all the way and he has it blocked out of bounds and Pittsburgh has been really really active on the defensive end here in the second half especially over these last five or so minutes of of just getting deflections getting their hand on the ball getting tips creating Steals and and theyve done a great job of kind of suffocating this South Carolina state offense and then conversely doing a great job getting out on the break and able to finish and uh a really impressive performance here especially in the first 12 or so minutes of the second half by this Panther team what do you think is the ceiling for this pit team I mean do they they made the tournament last year theyre off to a one game better record through 10 than a season ago I know its so early theyve only had one ACC contest but just in terms of the ey test what do you see as Austin gets fouled at The Rim well I think a lot of the of their success is going to be determined on the play of of Carlton Carrington a true freshman point guard who weve talked about whos had a terrific season I mean I still look at the 61 assist 19 turnover numbers through the first 10 games I mean that was just incredible but you know you got to have great guard play to make a Deep Run come February and March and I know that might sound like a little bit of a cliche but it is so Paramount that he continues to play well but the luxury that he has is he is surrounded by great experienced players like Blake Henson kod Diaz Graham Federico Federico Jorge Diaz Graham guys whove been here so you know as young as this back court may be theres a lot of experience in the front court that can kind of help lead those younger guys along the way these are all new players on your screen for pit and theyve all been very productive through the nonconference and Lowes logging a lot of minutes today hes played already 16 Off the Bench The Freshman who is actually a higher rated recruit than Carrington out of high school you know and youve also got guys like you see a good move there by Mitchell Taylor on the other end but you know going back to guys like ishma legot the transfer from Rhode Island I mean hes hes a junior so hes played enough college basketball so like I was saying theres enough around Carlton Carrington from an experience standpoint to kind of offset oh as we see a big time finish there by Zach Austin wasnt quite sure if he was going to try I wasnt quite sure if he was going to try to tear the rim off but he certainly did there and again another guy you just talk about the experience and Zach Austin second time today he has shown that athleticism just a big time dunk on the break points in the paint are now 3413 in favor of pit lowest field goal percentage that pit has held to an opponent this season was North Carolina t they held them to 27 South Carolina States at 30 feder Rico misses a bunny lead pass Taylor swoops in and Music scores and pit throws it away on the inbound thats their 10th turnover sends this to immedia timeout and Zack Austin doing his best to try to make it into the sports center top 10

thats coverage you can only find in one place right here on acc Network and the ESPN app another one another one South Carolina State trying to Bull their way to the rim and its blocked heres the week six AP top 12 and a fascinating note dug out here by Jason every National Champion since 2004 they were ranked in the top 12 of this week six po as Carrington scores four pits so David Who belongs and who doesnt in your eyes well I think they all belong theres no question I think were farther or excuse me far enough into the season to know I mean Oklahoma sneaking in there at 11 that nobodys really talking about undefeated uh you got to think the defending national champion Yukon after that performance last night going out to the West Coast and taking care of Gonzaga at Gonzaga maybe the win of the year so far and you know Arizona Purdue play later this afternoon so a lot of great teams in there all of whom in my opinion have a chance to cut those Nets down come April Im sure youre ready to make your National Champion pick here on December 16th but you have one or two that you really like and its hard to go against Yukon uh that may seem like the easy one but I just was blown away by how impressive that performance was last night the only loss so far in the season with at Kansas missing one of their best players and lost by four and had a chance to win that game so uh Danny Hurley just picking up right where they left off a year ago the Huskies have looked like they are destined to have a chance to repeat this year after the free throws pit leads it 66 to 41 pits made Seven threes today their season average is just over 10 per game but theyve been winning games from Beyond The Arc not only offensively but defensively as well theyre plus 15 on the board today from down town and one itll count for ishmail leot but we talk about how well they shoot it but they also guard the ark really well opponent only 27 for the season from downtown yeah they have the luxury of being able to switch a lot all of their bigs do a great job of moving their feet so they can defend smaller guards uh obviously have length so are able to close out uh a little bit more quickly and contest shots as well so uh yeah you know Pittsburgh their offense is going to be fine this year I mean they have too many weapons and shoot the ball so well you know Jeff cable mentioned it theyre only going to be as good as their defense takes them this year and theyve had theyve had games so far this season where their defense has been very good its just got to be a consistent effort night in night out especially when you get into the gauntlet of the ACC 145 and five for leot right around his average on the season in all three departments as pit leads by 28 down low bothered at The Rim Pittsburgh switching it up a little bit there going a little 32 Zone in the half court maybe just trying to work on a few different things give a couple different looks here and got both Diaz Grand Brothers here in at the game excuse me in the game at the same time here so you know just being able to rotate those guys in with feder Rico feder Rico and I think this pit team is destined to have another great year in the ACC obviously you know you mentioned at the top Blake Henson maybe the best player in the country that nobodys heard of averages 22 points per game does it all 67 230 big body that can step out and hit the three leads the nation and threes made per game so obviously just on paper hes the big story for pit and then leg it and carington you know the big three average 51 points per game but after that do you agree with that it just seems like pit like 4 through 13 are super balanced in terms of the production that they get well and theyre going to have to be balanced and theyre going to have to contribute because every teams scouting report that Pittsburgh is going to play their number one focus is going to be we got to stop Blake Henson so Pittsburgh is going to need other guys to step up night in Night Out theyve gotten that success so far this year from Carlton Carrington ishma Leets had a very good game today but you know some of the other guys are even going to have to pick up a little bit more of that slack because theres going to be so much attention paid to Blake Hinson rightfully so that its going to have to be a group effort to try to pick up some of that scoring load when Henson is struggling jeffris commits the foul two free throws awarded for for South Carolina State this is Everett at the line he has not scored today in the book with that free throw 0 for six from the field the top scorer for South Carolina state Michael hwit Jr enters the lineup for pit what have the Panthers done to limit Everetts production this afternoon well scouting is a lot of it obviously they know as their leading score they had to do a good job on ever coming into the game but I think just the length I mean it has been on full display and a good pass there from Diaz Graham to Diaz Graham but you know Pittsburgh has been very solid defensively and its just its its hard when youre going against the front line thats 7 ft 7t 7 ft its tough and uh Diaz Graham just throwing it just a little bit behind his brother there Im sure hell mention something about that later but uh you know you take a look right here theyre in the 32 Zone they have one of the seven Footers up at the top of the zone so its just a its its a unique defense to have to play against you just its hard to prepare to go against that that type of length Morrow cans a three thats his first three of the season the 68 guard stepping out huitt locking low its in and another great possession and a great example of that ball continuing to move it didnt stay in anybodys hands making the extra pass and you got guys like Michael hwit coming off the bench and knocking down to three just youll take that extra offense wherever it may come from a steel a run out and a layup and five straight for hwit Jr Off the Bench and the bench the bench is going to roast him later about that one they thought he was going to get up and try to dunk that one but smart play there dont try to dunk it and not get the points just lay it in and take the two down low a block eigh hit rejection they hit the trailer Austin soaring in and the unselfishness here by this Pittsburgh team just impressive to watch you know you can tell they all really enjoy playing with each other and just have done a great job in this entire game of making the right play on the break they have 21 assists on their 29 field goals when they go 20 for 20 a dunk for Diaz Graham he gets in on the fun around the rim CES 15 and0 at pit when theyve got 20 assists and 20 makes and its all Panthers Music Music Music State

ACC mens college basketball is presented by Food Lion official grer of the ACC pits currently on a 90 run over the last 69 seconds of play and they lead it 7946 with 247 to go a look at Blake Henson 19 points tonight on just 10 shots and this team is sharing the rock 22 assists on 30 made field Applause goals Taylor trying to Jet Baseline hes turned Applause away CH clock at 10 Corner second thought three off in Austin the rebound Zack Austin 10 points and four rebounds Off the Bench in 12 minutes yeah Jeff cable is certainly going to be happy with the contributions hes gotten from his bench guys in this game and Zack Austin who started every game up to this point in the year not letting that affect him being taken out of that lineup coming in and having a big impact on this game and and the difference in the second half really has big part of it has been the backboard I mean pit has absolutely dominated the backboard on both ends and has been able to convert out on the fast break and has just done a great job of playing unselfishly a lot to build on from this second half in this performance here today by Jeff C Music Applause team pit has hit that magical number of 80 under Jeff cable when they score 80 or more they are 30 and two and 6 and0 this season as they lead it 81 to Applause 46 Applause 18th turnover for South Carolina state Marshalls checked in to operate for pit H it another three on target well no no lack of confidence for Michael hwit coming off that bench he was trying to set some kind of record for points per minute here just three for three with two threes and a fast break layup just uh instant offense Off the Bench and trying to earn some more playing time as the year goes on yeah he has his jersey number eight points in three minutes of action and 0 for three coming into this game from behind the arc so two for two here today and this looked really really confident with both of those makes South Carolina state at the line feder Rico committed a foul just his first eighth team foul on pit pits exploded for 48 points in this second half theyre on a 140 run Panthers will move to 8 and3 theyll be six and2 at home they have Purdue Fort Wayne coming up on the 20th and then its ACC play theyll have a 10day gap between that game and the Syracuse game on the road then its North Carolina and at Louisville its coming up for the Panthers Marshall Around the Horn to Austin going in denied at the rim no whistle well if that would have gone in I think Z Zack definitely would have been on top 10 tonight I it looked like there was a lot of contact obviously no call so we played on but you can see the athleticism and I love the mindset of Zach Austin just trying to be aggressive and just dunk everything around the rim you know a lot of times guys try to draw the contact he said no Im going to try to dunk everything every time I go in there and a whistle and a foul with 47 seconds left back to the dunk and a great shot fake to get the defender up and just taken off from way out there andly looked like some contact but nonetheless you just got to love the aggressiveness and got rewarded next time down and have little bit of a casual conversation there with les Jones and Zach Austin been very impressive Off the Bench like you mentioned for pit here today and maybe a message being sent by coach capable to reenergize him because I mean he looks like a guy that wants back in the starting lineup today you know sometimes you got to shake things up a little bit guys may get complacent for whatever reason and uh you know the ultimate motivator is sitting over there on that bench so whatever the message may or may not have been seems to be working here today for Zach Austin with this win today pits won 12 of their last
