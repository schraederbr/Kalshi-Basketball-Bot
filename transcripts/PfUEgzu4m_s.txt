and what he brings is a ball mover and expect Caleb Foster and Evans and Patrick Gumba to benefit most from the presence of Kaden We are underway Cameron indoor stadium Happy New Year Duke starts with the basketball of the home white Our officials this afternoon Ron Groover Bert Smith and Paul Cells So an extra ball handler on the court from the beginning and a foul called inside And thats the freshman from Sagal Mohamed Cila So with Boozer in the lineup from the beginning Duke gets a little smaller but they do add a ball handler They add another creator And I think Foster and the Wings are the guys I think will benefit most It puts Foster in attack mode and takes the point guard responsibilities off of Camboozers plate Georgia Tech we mentioned Bango back with a double double after missing three games The strength of their team is the front court cheering Reeves lines up a three and connects Kes Reeves opens the scoring with a triple Shooting 40 on the year and hes been on a tear from behind the threepoint line here lately And he could opens up here hit his first three from behind the threepoint line Offensive rebound after the Evans miss Why not Nothing but the bottom of the net PATRICK GUNGA with the answer from three That shoot a great percentage there You see Ca backing up in the paint Kind of a dare you shot and best to take those early cheering Patrick Ga knocking down his first three ball Fleming the freshman Hes not shy to let it fly And thats why known more for his midrange but again hes a confident freshman He doesnt know what you dont know And he comes in really aggressive Boozer in attack mode Cam misses it And Georgia Tech looking for something in transition Reeves right to the rim Misses it cheering And both of these teams fine playing in an uptempo Boozer the trailer distant from three Backto back misses for Cam Boozer cheering Georgia Tech front line between Bonga and Cila have really elite rim protection Duke starting to settle here from behind the three point line here early Evans attacks inside this time tried to get it to Camboozer underneath and its ripped away Good start defensively for Georgia Tech Damon Stoutmire gets his teams to play big against their toughest competition They are five and six in his tenure against top 25 teams including a win against the Blue Devils two seasons ago cheering Thats a really good record there but again he hes always had talent and he coaches it well Lamar Washington knocks down a three and Georgia Tech leads 93 All triples so far I think Washington is the key for Georgia Tech in a sense of getting them organized Big make from Isaiah Evans left all alone and he makes the Jackets pay We know about Nate George transferring out But watch out for Washington Hes emerged as a leader for the Yellow Jackets 28 assists in the last three games for number one in Navy Lamar Washington Risky pass and it doesnt pay off Well defended by Duke Kaden Boozer launching the attack A trail three ITS GOOD Caleb Foster drills it And you want to see the benefit of having Kaden Boozer in starting lineup Thats what you see cuz now with freeze up Foster G be aggressive and I think youll see Isaiah Evans get open looks like that If they can get him going then look out If you like threes this is the game for you Three a piece so far in the early going at Cameron Indoor when youre so concerned with guarding the paint you open up the threepoint line And here Kaden Boozer pushing in transition the defense collapsed Caleb Foster is a guy we talked about Its going to benefit from that And hes shooting over 41 from behind threepoint line Wont get an easier look than that one Bill in many ways Kaden Boozer makes it easier on everybody else to do what they do best And thats why John Shy thought he has earned his opportunity to start from the tip Hes a ball mover Jay And thats what you want I thought against you talk about Texas Tech they got a little stagnant on the offensive end Tough take Camboozer reathers goes up and draws the foul But Cameron Boozer will be at the foul line when music we come back Tied at nine A good one as ACC play opens up in Durham between Duke and Georgia Tech and Randolph Childris Its all about the three so far It is Reeds gets Georgia Tech going Lamar Washington steps back and he laces one Duke comes back and again Cyp see Patrick Dumble gets him going early once he starts here Then Caleb Foster gets going behind and theyre looking to get him going Right now both teams are starting off shooting the ball very well There have been 11 total shots taken Nine from three Six have gone in And now Camboozer an opportunity to change that with two free throws to come Duke fell down early 93 So an opportunity to go on an eight nothing run here in just about a minute of game time The first points of the afternoon for Cam Boozer the nations leading scorer just over 23 points per game Couldnt believe the stat 11 games into his career Hes the first player in division 1 basketball in the last 30 seasons to go for 250 points 100 rebounds and 40 assists in his first career 11 games Its hard to imagine theyve had backtoback considerably the best player in high school come here with so much hype and they both have exceeded the expectations of that hype Theyve been incredible John Shy going to his bench Dame Sar into the game Misfire from Kaden Boozer who made his first career start today But Georgia Tech couldnt corral the rebound It will stay Blue Devils basketball Amini comes in the game and hes known as a shooter having a little bit confidence issue right now See if having this smaller lineup and he and Don May Sar could help get things going Yeah Jimnya battling through an ankle sprain limited in practice and then toughs it out on game day Kaden Boozer trying to squeeze it to Malik Brown Goes out of bounds again Shot clock down to 9 seconds It stays Duke ball What do you try and run here with the shot clock under 10 Dribble handoff hero or iso for Cambosa Well when you have the nations leading scoreer it can be that easy Passes out of the double team Sar cant connect on a three Well the turnovers have piled up for Georgia Tech four in the last three minutes for the Yellow Jackets They are three for three from three Turnovers bugged them against FloridaM That rattles it and drops The Yellow Jackets move in front by one The sophomore Jaden Mustaf off the bench for two Wide open Malik Brown Not usually his shot and he cant connect You can see Georgia Tech schematically forcing guys who traditionally dont shoot it great to take those shots Reeves buries another and Georgia Tech four for four from three Hes in such a rhythm right now Transfer from Florida Pull up pop The immediate answer for Cameron Boozer That shots going to be there cheering for the Duke front line So far theyve knocked down two threes See if Georgia Tech was forced to make that adjustment or not Great spin move by Dongo Everything but the finish Battling for the rebound with his own teammate and he traveled by Dongo was wrestling for the ball with his sophomore teammate Payton Marshall And its a turnover Yeah just great transition And again Wayy Reeds is shooting the ball really well Youve got to get out to him And here four five ball screen Just not a lot of teams have the ability to do that Cam Boozer walks into one Theyre the Boozer brothers starting together for the first time in their Duke careers as Cameron sets the screen Brown left open again from three and he misses it He is now just one of 10 on the season from three From two hes 89 left all open and open for a reason statistically speaking cheering Shot clock ticks down to eight cheering Boo Tough take off the window for two Jay thats something to keep your eyes on Late clock I thought the last two games teams have been looking to put Camboozled in ball screens knowing hes going to switch on the tackle Tied at 16 after the triple 7 minutes into this one It has been back and forth cheering Boozers like enough of that Yeah youre going at me Im going to go right back at you Dongo left all alone Cant connect The open threes havent really falled for either team today Tough take for Kaden Boozers He tries to go coast to coast and is fouled Hell get two at the line And this is what I think a lot of teams are doing You know you get a good ball handler good guy can drive down here Here Jaden Mustaf he drives knowing Camboozer does not want to foul Hes been told not to commit those fouls I think we saw that against Lipst I think we saw it against Texas Tech And as much as we praise Cam Boozer and the things that he does really well I think defending smaller guards on the perimeter it is something that hes going to have to continue to improve on Cameron Bruiser coming out of the game right now Isaiah Evans checks back in And Cameron with seven so far and his brothers at the line Kaden is like a oneman fast break when he gets in He pushed so much pressure on you pushing tempo Thought hes helped get Duke off to a solid start And now he checks out after knocking both free throws down Caleb Foster into the game So the Boozer brothers off the floor Duke leading by two 1816 Blue Devils go fullcourt pressure here cheering Right now Georgia Tech has a good multiple handlers right now to help initiate the offense against this pressure All three guys on the floor now Fleming Mustaf RIGHT DOWN THE LANE Jaden Mustaf hes been very aggressive in this first half Hes got six Hes a hard righthand driver physical guard once he gets his shoulder pasture has the athleticism and length to finish himself Georgia Tech went to a double team then backed off of it Gungbo lost the ball and then jumped on it Jump call The possession arrow with Georgia Tech Third turnover of this first half for Duke cheering Great job there just rejecting the ball screen Calebs Fosters got to force him to use a screen He rejects it gets to the rim and finishes And here just great physical defense there by Marshall getting on the floor getting dirty Thats the effort you want to see if you want to come into Cameron and pull off an upset Georgia Tech comes in with confidence A fourame win streak headed into ACC play Big underdogs today but they have not played like it did this first half Four of five from three Look at they keep that going and they do NOTHING BUT THE BOTTOM OF the net Chaz Kelly cheering Confusion on the weak side by the Blue Devils and they switch Both guys went to protect the basket Foster drives in the floater falls Great take for Caleb Foster applause I think hes been really solid for the Blue Devils I think now Kaden in the starting lineup It frees him up where he doesnt have to worry about being such a facilitator Now hes going to be able to get more to his natural position of being a downhill driver and scorer Georgia Tech shooting 67 from the floor What does Duke need to do defensively One its got to be more communication right now Too much penetration They got to own the paint And only in the paint is keeping the ball out of the middle so you stay out of rotation Right now Georgia Techs knocking down threes Theyre spread out and now theyre getting in the paint Great take and a hard foul will send Isaiah Evans to the line Great play design there but its Georgia Tech on top by three Georgia Tech only averages six made threes a game They already have five minute five threes and were 10 minutes into this game and Sh is not music too happy about it The threepoint line for both teams and Georgia Techs taking advantage of it Been a couple of dare shots just sitting in the paint saying guys hey worried about percentages I think thats what we saw with Sher going to break is you got n guys knocking down threes that statistically has not done so speaking with head coach Damon Stoutmire for Georgia Tech at Shootaround He said I know this group is going to get better as the season goes on you know fourgame win streak headed into ACC play You know a lot is made about the first month of the season You get your metric and and then people want to try and label you for the rest of the campaign but Damon Stoutmire said he knows what this team is capable of when theyre fully healthy and now they are but they have played like it so far on the road against number six Duke I think he feels as though they preseason picked 13th in the league and he knows that hey if were really healthy he acknowledges maybe the top four theres a little bit of separation Beyond that he thinks its wide at opening He got his group of guys playing like him Gustaf dumps it off for Celock Georgia Tech hasnt spent much time in the paint yet this first half but theyve been terrific from three Five of six cheering Nice catch and shoot Confident from the freshman Muhammad Cila Great job of spacing the floor Ca showing you his range Sar dumps it off Tough take Lot of contact And there comes the foul on the follow attempt by Patrick Gunga I thought Cila did a great job earlier coming over just walling up putting his body in there But again when that happens someone has to help the helper Duke able to get an offensive rebound and Gamba is at the line for two This is the first you know as Duke still searches for their consistent second scorer You know was discouraging in the loss to Texas Tech Yeah Gungba season low four points Isaiah O Evans season low four points You need those guys in double figures if Duke is going to be the team that many people think they can be I think thats part of what we see with Kaden Boozer getting in the starting lineup just to get the ball moving I think they got themselves in trouble Its just been next man up I mean Cam Booz has been so dominant Its been a different guy that stepped up They play the right way Theyre really unselfish group Their focus is on the defensive end of the floor But who steps up to be that second guy Will it be Dames Sarina Who would Foster Everyone expects it to be Isaiah Evans and he hasnt been able to do it yet So well see what happens with this multiple handlers on the floor now with Kaden Boozer and Caleb Foster And you dont need it to be the same guy every single game but you at least need someone in the supporting cast to give you those double figures Another tough take but great defense Patrick Gumba walling up to take it away See those are plays like that I like to see those guards just get to the rim Its oneonone you know You drive it there I think oneonone you got to attack the rim Kaden Boozer does the best job of that Foster cant connect on a three That would have given Duke the lead Jaden Mustaf Navy been very confident today Six points Chaz Kelly with the shot clock down to 10 Goes right in Isaiah Evans Terrific defense Stole it away Foster draws the foul and a chance to tie it at the free throw line Excellent defensive possession there by the Blue Devils Starting with Kate Boozer accepting the switch staying in front of the basketball He and Isaiah Evans there Did a great job that entire possession staying in front of the basketball creating a turnover You see Shell telling Isaia Evans great job Great defensive possession there by the back quarter the Blue Devils Well John Shy was telling us that its tough to get into a rhythm when you have so much time in between games Early in their season theyre playing every 3 days and then you just have two games in a 20day span To put it in perspective in the month of January if you include todays game Duke is going to play nine games in 30 days right Whereas theyve just played two in the last 20 finals and Christmas break I mean it just come for that group It came at the wrong time in a sense of they had come off some really physical games and you started to see the little air leaking out of the tire little slow leak coming out against Lipkcom This group came out a little flat turning the basketball over and they responded for the most part for probably 25 or 30 minutes of the Texas Tech game and then their offense got stagnant and gave up a seven 17point second half lead and theyre looking to correct that correct those teams and a lot of that started in practice And I think thats a big reason why Sh went to Kaden Boozer for his first career start today just trying it to ignite this group Hes a ball mover and hes a defender makes everyone around him better and I think its going to free up guys ultimately like Foster and again you need to get a guy like Isa Evans as well going The other thing that the Duke head coach hasnt been happy with is foul shooting after that make Duke just seven of 11 in this first half certainly cost them in the second half of that Texas Tech game Thats something to monitor and be conscious of Again Yellow Jackets have done well on the road leading by one Washington trying to squeeze it in and he does Perfectly placed pass Mohamd Cila An easy layup Great battle by Cila Keeping your feet moving inside and a great pass there in the field Big man doesnt like the ball that low but Washington there is kicked Somehow the ball gets through traffic He puts that mid on it and able to finish in traffic Lamar Washington 28 assists in the last three games And with passes like that you can see why hes the reason why David start feels so comfortable with his group He feels as though he has a leader now guy that he can coach hard a guy that this team can follow when hes in the lineup and hes one of the reasons why with the health of Donga that this Yellow Jackets are starting to play good basketball Duke misses the front end of a one and one Ball back to Georgia Tech leading by three Cila feeling it Got it The freshman not playing like one on the road to Cameron You can see Duke has given the front line guys those shots but they know better than anybody when theyre playing against guys Sometimes they just play out of their mind and throw the statistics out Yellow Jackets are really comfortable on the offensive end of the floor Shot clock down to five Kaden Boozer down the lane The floater is perfection Great job there turns the corner Cely doesnt come over to help He stays with Patrick Ga Great decision there with the floater Georgia Tech has made six of their last seven BUT STOLEN AWAY THE STEAL AND THE SLAM CAMERON BOOZER makes it a onepoint game Great job there denying that reversal cheering by Cam Boozer cheering Cila has it He is the last six points for Georgia Tech Backing down Gumba Lost the handle Backto back takeaways for Duke Evans COUNT IT PLUS THE FOUL ISAIAH EVANS fires the Blue Devils in front cheering Duke falls behind and they started cranking up on the defensive end and started there by the player of the year in Cam Boozer and Isa Evans music decides to join in on them Starting to pile up and now for the remainder of this half Georgia Techs going to have to rely on their bench guys Duke comes at you in waves and can they make a run here before they we go into halftime Now were in the midst of a of a Duke run right now The Blue Devils started just three of 12 from the floor since six of eight and now in front by two after Isaiah Evans completes the threepoint play 7 nothing run in the last 50 seconds Thats how quickly it can turn for as well as Georgia Tech has played in this first half And again youre shooting 71 on the road at Cameron You find yourself down two You absolutely cannot turn the basketball over in this building Easier said than done Its a lot easier said than done against one of the better defensive teams in all of college basketball A foul called on Malik Brown off the ball This is what when you look at Georgia Tech theyre in foul trouble right now but they have wasting reason His size allows him to play in that four spot Now youre going to see more pour out one end Put Georgia Tech on the offensive end WATCH OUT GREAT SHAKE HELLO HAPPY NEW YEAR KES Reeves onehanded jam to tie it at 31 Dont let the three ball fool you Hes shooting it well from behind the threepoint line Jay But attacking the rim is what he does best And you saw his athletic athleticism there I mean here just a head and shoulder fake Shakes Kaden Boozer and no one wants to get in the way of that highlight field Well its the threes that have ignited this Georgia Tech offense but that onehanded jam will do wonders They go back inside Stolen away again Nine turnovers by Georgia Tech Duke cant cash in in transition Offensive rebound Cameron Boozer wins it back for Duke Evans lines up the three Missed it Anda called for a reach in there Really good looks there Both shots by the Blue Devils Thats been one of the things those theyve been getting looks One by Jame and one by Evans there And they just hadnt been able to consistently knock those down yet Washington in attack mode Scoop to the hoop for two and Georgia Tech back in front Hes a differencemaker He calms his group down Boozer a three Usually hell make you pay Missed it that time and a frustration foul after the rebound So great job here again when its switching five as a guard You always want to attack and get downhill Great job using the rim of protection getting to that left hand and kissing it off the glass Boozers knocked down Cam Boozers knocked down two threes here And you dont want him to settle Hes just so dominant on the interior You still want him inside But I think him coming inside opens the floor for everyone else because you have to double him He plays in the post Deep three Theyve been falling but not that time for Lamar Washington Just Georgia Techs second miss from three Evans through contact doesnt get it to drop Battle for THE BALL ONE BY DUKE Gumba kept the possession alive Camber Boozer rejected by the rim Just didnt quite get the angle right there And that goes on the other end Kesi Reeves off balance and somehow that falls The efforts there to offensive end of the floor just unable to get shots to fall And this is what we talked about with this lineup And Reeds is just again hes just a shot maker Hes playing with so much confidence right now Hes hot from behind the threepoint line And again you know what he can do attacking the rim There showing you he can be a threele scoreer Duke has been in the bonus On the next Georgia Tech foul theyll be in the double bonus But right now one and one for Isaiah Evans connects on the first earns the second This is another thing to watch too We talked about the 12 free throws missed versus Texas Tech Theyve missed four here in the first half and got to be careful Start missing free throws those things become a problem Get the yips Evans knocks them both down Georgia Tech on the other side they have yet to attempt a free throw Theyve gotten what they wanted on the offensive end of the floor Their problem has just been when they turned it over cheering You know those nine turnovers really the only negative for a first half that Georgia Tech has played outstanding Big underdogs coming into this game and you wouldnt know it with the way they have shot it Even with that miss still over 70 from the floor Kaden Boozer from the corner misfires Lamar Washington had a cheering foot on the line No theyre going to say he tapped it off Sars back So it will be Georgia Tech basketball When we come back Yellow Jackets a twopoint lead on the road at Cameron Runs Look for some middle ball screen here to get Cam Boozer going Camboozer nine points to lead the Blue Devils Weve talked throughout the first half still looking for that consistent number two scorer to emerge His brother Kaden got his first career start Only four points for him in this first half And for Georgia Tech very balanced seven different scorers Marshall spins into traffic and a foul called Georgia Tech is doing a really good job of trying to control the middle of the floor Flashing their bigs up in that m that pinch post area here I think Boozer Cam Boozer with the slap on the wrist there Camera crazies dont like it Yeah I dont think anyone in the building like it Reeves hes got the hot hand on a heat check Misfires Yeah thats the problem Sometimes you settle on shots like that and the way Reeves is screaming in a groove right now but thats not a good shot Like to see him reverse it Get continue to get downhill right now youre getting good shots and when youre not turning it over youre getting high quality shots and shooting it well Just dont settle Gungba hands off for Sar Thought about the three Good give and go and a hard foul to deny Patrick Gumba an easy layup Hell have to earn it from the line You can see the schematic part of what Georgia Techs doing Ga knocked down his first three from behind threepoint line and not guarded in there So what he can do is dribble hand off to a guard maybe pull that big out of the paint allows that guard to turn a corner and him get a free run The free throw shooting now five misses in this first half John Shy in his postgame against Texas Tech could not emphasize it more how that needs to improve as this season goes on Theres nothing you can do Jay about making free throws You you cant simulate game situations to make guys make free throws Its a lot like rebounding You either got guys that make them or rebound and or they dont when it matters And cheering right now Duke is doing a lot of great things and a lot of things well but theyre struggling to make food Thats an offensive foul off ball They get Payton Marshall for a shove And itll be Duke Ball trailing by one under three minutes to play in this first half Duke has not made a field goal in the last four minutes Foster changes it and fires the Blue Devils in front Thats what you want to see if youre in Duke Blue Devil right now Some of your guards stepping up cheering You can see with Darren Harrison the lineup here Sh looking for shooting Scramble for the ball led to a three but it went begging from Washington cheering Sar lines it up Missed it Battle for the rebound Georgia Tech wins it cheering Those shots are just going to be there Its just on saw to knock down shots and theyre not guarding combo behind the threepoint line Must high off the window to tie it at 37 Under two minutes to play in this first half Jaden Mustaf again rejecting the ball screen Getting back to that right hand cheering Foster again this time off the mark He has been hunting his shot in this first half Nine points and Tai Cameron Boozer for the leading scoreer Good patience Chaz Kelly Great take The transfer from Boston College puts Georgia Tech back up by two and John Shier takes a timeout Well step aside for 30 seconds What a fun first half Georgia music Tech a twopoint lead Georgia Tech a 3937 lead ACC play underway right as we ring in a new year Happy new year everyone Randolph Childris Jay Alter with you Two teams looking to ring in 2026 with a conference win and it has been a back andforth first half Dam Stoutmire he is five and six against top 25 teams as Georgia Tech head coach always gets his teams to play their best against the best He does and hes really excited about the future of this group Hes finally have his full compliment roster of guys and theyve been banged up and a lot of injuries Boozer the lob whos a little too high and overshot the 611 Gumba been a frustration foul after the misfire on the alleyoop attempt This may be the first time youve seen this year a front line of guys was so its so big and its so athletic at Georgia Tech is with eila Gas been out with foul trouble and Marshalls been in there and theyve they just stayed in the paint Theyre forcing Duke to take perimeter shots and take the shots they want them to take and not allowing Duke to get comfortable and owning the paint cheering Heres Lamar Washington goes into the double team Kaden Boozer picks the pocket Evans tried to get it back to Kaden AND ITS STOLEN AWAY TWOON ONE The steal and the score Chaz Kelly Georgia Tech a fourpoint lead Really comfortable coming in off the bench Hes starting to find his rhythm Five for five in the FloridaM game and hes had his moments here in the first half Boozers got a mismatch and he cashes in Oh Camboozer will make you pay Jay thats against a double team there He just splits the double team and like I had enough Use it or lose it Timeout for Damon Stoutdermire He elects to use it His team could hold for the final shot of what has been a back andforth fun first half to open ACC play at Cameron Indoor Jay theyre getting the shot attempts they want Theyre running the paint off the dribble Theyre music getting in the paint forcing rotation guards are finishing at the rim and early in this game they knocked down threes Hopefully everybody that wanted to watch Duke basketball or Georgia Tech basketball found music us on the ESPN app because the game airing on ACC Network weve just been told is headed to triple overtime between Virginia and Virginia Tech Maybe well get it for the second half Eventually we will But what a great game Ill tell you what as ACC play opens up its been a terrific nonconference for the ACC Took care of business and very healthy state of the league headed into conference play Joe Lonardi ESPNs brackettologist projecting eight bids to the NCAA tournament for the ACC A lot to be excited about in the ACC And I think it its this part of the year when the season starts youre excited as Duke comes out in the zone trying to shake things up but its a reset No matter how great your pre your November early December games are or how bad they are you hit a reset button here as conference play starts and weve seen some really competitive games here in the ACC Clock down to four Reeves turnaround hits it KAZI REEVES HAS BEEN ON FIRE 12 points to lead all scorers It sends Georgia Tech into halftime with a 4339 lead on the road against number six Duke Just give the ball to your lead and score there and Wy Reed just raises up and shoots the fade away to his length Youre not going to bother that shot puts Georgia Tech up four Georgia Tech heads into halftime with a fourpoint lead shooting 68 in that first half Wow to the ACC conference slate We just saw triple overtime at Blackburg We had a fun first half Georgia Tech shot 68 To put that in perspective the best shooting first half from a Duke opponent this season 48 By Dongo THE STEAL AND THE SLAM And he was scoreless in the first half Thats Georgia Techs best player Dongo He only played seven minutes with foul trouble And Jay as I said when Duke gets in trouble they go to Cambooza in the middle of the floor And you can see defensively Georgia Tech is prepared to defend that They run a similar action with Bongo And again creating turnovers He only played seven minutes in the first half with foul trouble Its critical They can get quality minutes out of him here in the second half He cannot pick up a third here early And he has been a Blue Devil killer in his career as Boozer flushes it on the inside averaging 16 and 12 points per game against Duke but scoreless in the first half and his team stepped up without him on the floor They go right back to Dongo He sends it down low and another slam This time the freshman Muhammad Cila The passing by both of these frontline teams their bigs is exceptional the immediate answer The Boozer brothers starting to cook at the beginning of this second half Duke still trailing by four The Kaden making his first career start today as John Sh trying to ignite this Duke offense after the loss to Texas Tech And then the 10day layoff following the loss Reeves launches A THREE AND HITS IT Kaci Reeves has been money from three Thats his third triple Georgia Tech up seven The Blue Devils got to get back to their identity and thats the defensive end of the floor Right now theyre not guarding the basketball Oh Georgia Tech shot 68 in that first half Now theyre up to 71 from the floor Tough to win basketball games when youre giving it up Seven out of 10 makes Itll stay Georgia Tech ball John Shier getting urged on by his team to challenge this and John Shy says he will Yeah even for us up here Yeah it looked like it went off Georgia Tech Uh I think its it should be a quick Yeah it should be a quick change Now as we ring in 2026 with ACC play the Blue Devils have won 18 straight ACC home openers But John Shs team so new rule in college basketball this season coachs challenge if you use it and are correct you keep it And John Shy was successful Blue Devils down five cheering And Georgia Tech shooting 71 from the floor So you have said many times Randolph Childress that theyve got to get the defense going Yeah Now you look at that opposing field goal percentage this season 36 It is nearly double that today It is and credit Georgia Tech I mean this is a formidable front line with their guys and guards are starting to get comfortable I think they figured out what with with Lamar Washington at the point guard position and it balanced out everything else Boozer tough take swatted away Cila hes been a big force on that front line for the Yellow Jackets You would not know hes a freshman particularly on the defensive end This is a first conference game in ACC play Youre at Cameron and cheering Yellow Jack is playing with confidence Kaden Boozer goes right at Cila and this time beats him for two Great Spain action there coming off allowing Kaden to get to the rim Fleming give and go Dongo crafty take Tried to initiate the contact Cam Boza kind of pulled the chair at him a little bit Probably Dongo still athletic enough to make that finish Pull up pop Swatted Foster retreats now in attack mode Rejected on his way to the rim Itll stay Duke ball Both teams line driving to the rim right now You got to try to whoever controls the paint will control the rest of this game And both teams started out shooting the three ball well but theyre attacking the paint Team crappy finishes there Theyve completely flipped what theyve done offensively in the first half It was all threes as Kaden Boozer gets the hoop and the harm A chance for a threepoint play Now the threes have stopped and everyones taking it to the rim But you you made the adjustment Now teams were closing out now And this is what Kaden Boozer does Hes 65 guard Hes big Hes physical Just uses his size to get to the rim there Nice lefty lay and draws the foul And as soon as you come over and start rotating over to cut off the layup hell start finding guys help open up this Blue Devil offensive end of the floor And Kaden Boozer completes the threepoint play His first career start The Boozer brothers cheering in the starting lineup for the first time in their college careers Now both in double figures cheering Duke in the two3 zone here Watch the middle And the defensive adjustment paid off but they couldnt close out the possession with a rebound Itll stay Georgia Tech basketball Randolph do you like the adjustment to the zone here Well hes trying to destroy the rhythm right now with Georgia Tech Theyre carving them up Theyre getting every opport shot they want Theyve knocked down threes cheering Theyre getting to the paint The zone is just to force Georgia Tech to get the ball a little be a little stagnant Offensive rebound Cila cant clean up the spell but a good rebound Patrick Gumba ripped it away Heres cheering Cameron Boozer Duke beginning to steal the momentum in this second half BOOZER DUMPS IT OFF EASY FINISH GUMBA TO TIE IT AT 52 Davis start by dongle off of Cam Boozer He has to He doesnt want a foul And now the Duke defense starting to dial it up cheering Evans lines up a three Missed it cheering Tough take trying to go coast to coast and a foul called Lamar Washington at the line When we come back tied at 52 when Duke gets staged on the offensive end play beginning the last two days Randolph Childris Jay Alteria We got a terrific game here at Cameron Indoor Stadium Tied at 52 Georgia Tech led by as many as seven but Duke behind their back court starting to come alive Its the first time weve been able to say that all year long for the Duke Blue Devils where theyre being led by their guard play And I think this is what coach Shy was looking for by inserting Kaden Boozer in the starting lineup that we said Foster and that Evans will get more opportunities with his creativity But right now credit to Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets Theyre getting the shots they want getting in the paint They knock down a bunch of threes early but theyre starting to control the paint Theyre shooting 64 here in this game and Blue Devils have no answer for them cheering And that was the first free throw Damon Somayers team has gotten today Washington makes them both Georgia Tech back in front by two cheering Heres Cameron Boozer Lost the handle Stolen away Eight turnovers for Duke Georgia Tech with 12 points off of those turnovers cheering Kick to the corner Don go The hesitation draws the foul from Cam Boozer Thats his second Smart play there by Dongo Didnt take the corner three and drawing a foul Catching Cambooz on a close out there Well early in this game Georgia Tech earned the lead because they were letting the threes fly and they were falling Made five of their first six but theyve just made one of their last five Definitely more intentional about going inside He gave him confidence early that they could win this game Almost a terrific putback but Sila couldnt finish it Foster tried to go coast to coast He didnt get it to go Itll stay Duke ball underneath their own hoop I like the aggressiveness though by Caleb Foster Oneonone in transition Your defenders retreating Attack the rim That time the call didnt go his way but I like the aggressiveness I mean in this second half both teams with the same mission which is just attack the rim or draw a foul Lets watch the bench here Jay Not a single point from the Duke bench in the first half They were out scored 17 to zero Someone from the Duke bench has got to contribute to this game offensively Adame Sar trying to do that but misfires from three Dongo all alone Way too much on it Thats an air ball and the crazies will let him know it Kaden Boozer COAST TO COAST COULDNT FINISH IT BUT MALIK BROWN DOES IN PERFECT position for the follow flush And thats the first bench points for Duke today on Q We just talked about it And cheering the one guy known for being a versatile defender maybe the best defender of the group is the first guy to score from the bench cheering Eight ties eight lead changes Its been a back andforth ACC opener What the zone has done to Georgia cheering Tech the ball is stuck Its not moving around as much Dono with two seconds on the shot clock cheering Missed it And thats a shot clock violation Duke has really dialed up the defense and its paid off It has And when theyve gotten stops theyve been able to outlet the ball and rebound And Kayton Boozer is showing you what he ultimately is And thats just a winner Creating opportunity here in transition and Malik Brown cleans it up cheering But the pace in which Kate Boozer has been playing with has created so many opportunities for Duke team that has struggled on the offensive end of the floor Well theyre forcing Georgia Tech to struggle offensively The Yellow Jackets have missed their last eight shots Its allowed Duke to erase a sevenpoint advantage Tough take through contact and a foul called Thatll send the freshman Dick Kmenya to the line 56 foul shooter Thats one thing we definitely want to keep a close eye on in this second half Duke free throw shooting They were just six of 13 in the loss to Texas Tech And John Shy saying you can learn so much from a loss Now this is the first opportunity How does Duke bounce back and foul shooting certainly will play a big part down the stretch as we remind you January 10th a terrific triple header It tips off NC State Florida State Syracuse at Pit Cal at Virginia Tech Triple header Saturday January 10th right here on ACC Network And Lemeny knocks them both down from the line Duke back in front by two Blue Devils with the momentum as they take their first lead since they led 3735 And John Sh says Get loud on New Years Eve at Cameron Indoor Stadium I mean youre knocking down free throws Sometimes thats all you need to get get yourself going cheering move in the last couple of minutes has been the defensive end of the floor The zone is held They have the fullcourt pressure here cheering Georgia Tech just barely advances the ball before a 10second violation cheering 13 seconds and Georgia Tech has not even initiated offense Shot clock down to seven cheering A three off the mark The Duke defense has forced nine straight misses from Georgia Tech Spin the zone The zone has sparked it COUNT IT PLUS THE FOUL CAM BOOZER Since Shire is going to the zone it has allowed the Blue Devils to rebound and get out in transition You dont want Cambooza coming at you with a head of steam No one has solved that riddle this year cheering Here comes the one two two press Coopers delaying Not really aggressive in the front court Theyll fall back to the 32 And again its slowing down this offense Georgia Tech is really slow to get in their their offensive sets and how they want to attack the zone Duke a seven nothing run Georgia Tech has missed their last nine shots and the shot clocks down to five again A lot of standing around Flamming tries to create at the end of the shot clock and draws a foul So this is a Yellow Jackets team that shot 68 in the first half Now theyre just 30 struggling with that zone And they havent made the adjustment Randolph just around the perimeter until that shot clock ticks to single digits But its not just the zone now Now that Duke is getting out and theyre scoring theyre able to set their full foot pressure up So theyre limiting the amount of time that Georgia Tech has to attack and then theyre going to their Achilles heels of forcing them to take jump shots and theyre struggling Well that free throw ends a threeminute Georgia Tech scoring drought Welcome to conference play How about that laughter Just what starts Throw throw the records out for November in December When conference play starts its a reset Georgia Tech has come to play A one possession game as we kick under 13 minutes left to this second half Kaden Boozer making his first career start has been terrific The Boozer brothers have combined for 27 Sar dispossessed Brown there to keep it alive Kick to Boozer RATTLES IN AND OUT IT WAS HALFWAY down for Kaden cheering Malik Brown turned down a dunk right there below the rim when he got the offensive rebound cheering Damon Satomire was urging his team to initiate the offense in transition but couldnt do it And Duke settles back into their zone which has been so effective in this second half Reeves hes been the hot hand but misses there Theyre not penetrating the zone The balls not touching the paint Theyre just moving it around the perimeter and its easy to match up when youre running a 32 zone Kayen Boozer draws the foul Hes been really good this second half here That is the fourth foul against the freshman Fleming Damon start like that says it all What are we calling here I He doesnt like that call at all As physical as this game has been and he wants him to continue to let his guys play Another missed free throw Jay by Shar the Staten against Texas Tech just six of 13 just two front ends of one ones in that game when you lose by one when you led by 17 in the second half and you can point to so many different factors of why you lose that lead but a big part of it is foul shooting Duke missed them both there but they do get the offensive rebound Crosscourt pass Amena finds Sar Sar lines up the three Cant connect Another offensive rebound Cam Boozer dominating the glass right now He draws another foul Duke is game during the game with a field pass and then of course post game here at Durham as ACC play tips off yesterday and today Randolph Childris Jay Alter with you Duke a threepoint lead with the basketball They trailed by as many as seven in this second half They have punched back Theyve done it with defense Georgia Tech has gone six minutes without a basket They have missed their last 10 shots Its allowed the Blue Devils offense to find a rhythm as well They have and theyve done that by with the zone and its allowed them to rebound and get out First couple of possessions they gave up a few offensive rebounds Since then they tightened up their defensive rebounding and here Cam Boozers got going in the second half and theres no one on the floor that can guard him Theyre in a smaller lineup and look for them to force feed him right now So they goes to Boozer Passes out for his brother Cant connect on the three Another offensive rebound Keeps it alive Still cant cash in though BOOZER RIPS DOWN ANOTHER ONE TRYING TO FINISH it himself through traffic Cant do it Reathers GOES UP STRONG THAT FALLS OFF THE RIM No good Another offensive rebound FIFTH TIME IS THE TRY Malik Brown finally converts J Im just tired watching that possession But Cam Boozer with dominating the offensive glass here doing what hes done all year long When the Blue Devils have been in trouble hes put him on his back and hes carrying him And with all those rebounds thats a double double for Cam Boozer in this second half The Blue Devils have 18 possessions 11 scores and that is a huge three for Chaz Kelly to bring Georgia Tech back within two Its their first basket in more than six minutes you needed a three Jazz Kelly is not the guy you thought would take it but he the last couple of games he settled into that role coming off the bench before that three by Kelly Georgia Tech had just made one of their last seven threes Duke play through Cam Boozer And why WOULDNT YOU A CHANCE FOR A THREEPOINT PLAY The nations leading scorer is showing why They showing you why hes not just the ACC player of the year hes the national player of the year right now First half of the season hes been the best player in college basketball In the last five minutes hes shown you why Hes giving you everything Well Georgia Tech gave Duke everything they could handle of that first half but in this second half they have been so efficient offensively Duke this is their 19th possession theyve had 12 of the 19 have resulted in points And that one results in a threepoint play the oldfashioned way to put the Blue Devils up five cheering And the scoring has dried up for Georgia Tech Look at that 68 in the first half for Damon Satires team Now just shooting 33 in the second half cheering Watch the 10second call here They only have 3 seconds to advance the ball Foul called Dame Sar reached in there and thats Sars second foul cheering cheering Dukes back in that 32 matchup again cheering Find some penetration They got to get the ball in the paint to attack the zone like this Reeves on a great cut Puts it up and in for two Kaci Reeves breathing life back into Georgia Tech after Duke took control of this second half Georgia Tech is still a one possession game Got to find a way to limit Duke to one shot Theyve done a really good job defending the first possession but now you got to rebound Sar all alone and cant convert Duke has struggled from three Just six of 27 And they have yet to make a three in this second half Good pass underneath Easy finish for Payton Marshall to make it a onepoint game One of the few possessions against that zone Georgia Techs been able to get it in middle near the ACC And that time by Dongo had many options of passing the basketball And John Shier wants a timeout 925 remaining What a game to start ACC play at Cameron Indoor Well be back in 30 seconds Come on Come on Well this game has been back and forth since tip off Georgia Tech came in big underdogs but Damon Stoutmire told us at shoot around look weve won four games in a row Were finally healthy and he knows this team is going to improve as the season comes along and they have showed that they belong here against the number six team in the country on the road to start conference play The Blue Devils have won 18 straight ACC home openers but that streak getting tested onepoint game Cam Boozer the nations leading scorer finds his brother Kaden who made his first career start today Boozer brothers have been terrific A give and go leads the three The Boozer brother connection on full display cheering Cam Boozer with his third three here in the this afternoon Knocked down two early cheering Great defense One of the best defenders in the country Malik Brown And a rare turnover Kaden Boozer usually so good in transition but nobody home there These two like they know each other are in their sleep here Kaden drives baseline kicks it back to Cam and he knocks down his third three here Hes feeling it Thats right out of the backyard in South Florida Yeah I mean theyve done that a million times I think they can play with their eyes closed They have combined for 33 points of this game Theyve given Duke a fourpoint lead Georgia Tech not going away cheering Dongo squeezes it inside Marshall goes up strong rejected PATRICK GUNGA SWATS IT AWAY AND BROWN has it for Duke Heres Foster Finds Cam Boozer Foster lines up the three Got it Time out Georgia Tech Duke has their largest lead of the day But Duke has gone from down seven to up seven in this second half with Georgia Tech desperate to get their first win in Cambridge since 2004 Duke looking to extend their winning streak in ACC home openers to 19 straight And right now its the Blue Devils with all the momentum A six nothing run in the last minute before the Damon Statamire timeout How do the Yellow Jackets respond here But here theyve got to figure out a way to get the ball out of the perimeter Theyre just moving it around against the zone Feels like theyre in the danger zone right now as we take under eight minutes to play Duke starting to separate Reeds needed it Didnt get it cheering And a foul called on the reach will give the ball to Duke And they are shooting the rest of the way One adjustment there J SH put Malik Brown at the top of that zone So when the ball goes on his side he can crash and rebound and help secure rebounds on the weak side He was concerned about that against this front court of the Yellow Jackets there and its a great adjustment there and he was rewarded with the rebound Now theyre shooting free throws Free throws have been critical for John Sh big talking point following that first loss of the season to Texas Tech where they shot less than 50 from the foul line in the second half of that game Missed two front ends of the one and one that day Just missed the front end of a one and one there Flying through the paint Lamar Washington draws the foul and hell get two from the line The Washington was a spark for this Georgia Tech offense in the first half Been quiet in this second half He looks to get them lined up I know the zone just slowed everything down Just not a lot of ball movement there and able to get a missed off the free throw and get in transition cheering Sunday weve got a quadruple header of ACC womens basketball tipping off right here at Cameron Newor Stadium Notre Dame taking on Duke That is Virginia Florida State Virginia Tech at Louisville at hit Boston College Four in a row this Sunday right here on ACC Network Fivepoint game after the Lamar Washington free throw makes Georgia Tech now tries a little zone of their own with Duke struggling from behind the threepoint line Question becomes can they rebound out of it Well they tried to squeeze it into Boozer and its stolen away You want to get the ball to that ACC logo when youre facing the zone Thats exactly what Duke tried to do And Georgia Tech turns it into three Kesi Reeves Jr drills it to make it a twopoint game cheering Its amazing the momentum of this game Patrick Gome the line front misses the front end of the one and one Now Georgia Tech is going on a 50 run Evans the immediate answer Isaiah Evans buries it Theyre just a different team when he gets it going Isaiah Evans so explosive but very streaky from behind the threepoint line If he could just consistently start knocking that down it just changes so many things cheering for this Duke lineup Shot clock ticks down to eight cheering Washington crosscourt pass and they say he traveled before he threw the ball Turnover cheering Dukes come out the second half got really aggressive here and now he re got back to his scoring ways and Isaiah Evans answers back This game right now is its like it started Guys are starting to heat up from behind the threepoint line Duke has made their last three shots GOOD FEED BROWN MISSES THE FINISH THAT WAS A LAYUP for Malik Brown but he wins it back on D Makes up for the layup and then GIVES IT RIGHT BACK Fleming playing with four fouls The freshman goes right to the rim and draws the foul Six minutes to play A chance to make it a onepossession game from the free throw line You love Malik Brown because hes so unselfish and team player Such an elite defender Well that was a roller coaster Then you win the ball back and you throw it to Georgia Tech cheering Thats the third foul against Cameron Boozer Lemming makes the first This is what makes the league so fun This Georgia Tech group was picked 13th in the league cheering applause Theyre finally healthy Its exciting group to watch and theyre going to surprise some people Well the big story was how was Duke going to bounce back after a 10day layoff after their first loss of the season against Texas Tech Well they are getting tested in the ACC opener here at home One possession game under 6 minutes to play Good ball movement leads to the slam Gungba finished it but a terrific play offensively cheering applause Duke is going with the size Theyre playing with a big lineup They have Patrick Gomba Cam Boozer and Malik Brown on the court Malik Brown at the point of the zone And they put him up there So when the balls on the weak side of the court he can crash down and rebound Oh the height paying off there And now Duke has numbers Four on three Decide to slow it down Fivepoint lead with five minutes remaining of this one Foster in attack mode Kick to the corner The extra pass finds Evans He cant connect A long rebound Keeps the possession alive Foster a three No good Some good looks Just cant knock him down Its really good possession there by the Blue Devils Cant be upset about either one of those shots Good shots just didnt knock him down Mustaf drills it THE SOPHOMORE JADE AND MUSTAF And its a twopoint game cheering Jaden Mustav not known for his threepoint shot making only shoot 31 on the year but he stepped into that one cheering making this a one possession game here and theyre going back to the zone Oh you have to credit Georgia Tech not going away Every time you think Duke is starting to separate the Yellow Jackets have punched back Theyve battled through a lot Theyve been through foul trouble Not a lot of their starters have played Their bench has stepped up here led by Jay Mustaf and they have completely outscored the Duke bench and its the reason why theyre only two points out of this lead of this game Duke has shot 32 threes in this game Theyve only connected on nine The free throw shooting has been problematic as well 16 of 24 from the line Gumba screaming misses the front end of another one and one Duke does get the rebound though Nine missed free throws Lot of time left here And the last two have been front ends of one and ones Shot clock down to seven and a foul called will send Camboozer right back to the free throw line Tell you thats just a heady play You dont see many freshman make you dont see many players make in college basketball Catches your hand in the cookie jaw Just raises up Cheap way to get to the free throw line 22 points 11 rebounds for the nations leading scorer Makes the first And thats a welcome sight for Blue Devils fans that are hyper aware that they have struggled from the free throw line this season Misses the second but it stays a onepossession game as we tick near four minutes remaining in regulation cheering for Georgia Tech here You want the ball in Washingtons hands Some type of ball screen action maybe with him and by Don Thats whos got it Washington pull up Pop air ball Duke deciding to slow things down with a threepoint lead cheering Been very efficient offensively in this second half Trailed by as many as seven now trying to close it out in open ACC play with a win Shot clock down to five Kaden Boozer pull up pop Missed it Good rebound by the freshman Fleming and a foul called Georgia Tech with the ball Trailing by three Weve got a fun The one thing Duke has dominated today is the glass 21 offensive rebounds a season high which has led to 15 second chance points That is the difference in the game right now as the freshman Fleming cheering steps to the line for one and one Both teams shooting free throws the rest of the way He earns the second by making the first and a chance to make it a onepoint game The one thing thats impressive about Duke is they just find a way to cheering win games no matter what it is And thats what theyve done and theyve dominated the offensive glass here against a really good frontline guys at Georgia Tech here The only time Duke failed to do it last time out against Texas Tech and they bounce back and finish the final three minutes here in a onepoint game And another foul called Patrick Gumba off ball He will head to the line for two because now Duke is in the double bonus the rest of the way with three minutes left in it Thats what you want is a big guy thats struggling from the free throw line Fact Gumba shooting 68 on the year but hes missed the last two free throws and they both were front ends of one and one Can he get you at least one Two of seven from the line today screaming That rattles him And as sometimes Jay just becomes psychological thing or some mental thing Hes a better shooter free throw shooter than what hes showing here today screaming Makes them both Great job there just stepping up here in the last three minutes to make those two free throws Buckle up Should be a fun finish in the ACC opener One possession game Georgia Tech down three with the ball cheering by Dongo Thats the quick spin baseline cheering He tried to do it and turned it over Straight ball screen defense there I mean post defense there Patrick Ga paid attention to the scouting report You knew he was going to spin baseline No baseline Great job of bodying body dongle forcing the turnover Duke continues to do it with defense 17 turnovers for Georgia Tech cheering Look for Cambooza to catch it right there at the elbow He wants to get to that right hand and a travel before the contact and Georgia Tech wins the ball back Good response from Dongo Great job there Again were talking about guys being doubted in the scouting reports Cambooza gets to there He wants to get back to that right hand Donga does a great job of bodying them up causing the travels cheering Each team with two timeouts as we take near two minutes remaining in regulation Im putting the ball in Washingtons hand Hes got to make a play for me Shot clock down to seven Washington the lefty IT DOESNT DROP DONGO STOLEN AWAY ISAIAH EVANS poked it free cheering And John Shier takes a timeout with a minute 43 remaining Duke with the basketball at a threepoint lead Youd have to imagine Dukes going to play through the Boozer brothers down the stretch They have combined for an impressive 34 points today Theyre doing what theyve always done and thats just win Find ways to win Impact winning Cam Boozie I mean I think the national player of the year but theyve got an added booster with Kaden Boozie Hes come in creating for others getting to the rim in transition defending at a high level Well Kaden Boozer earned his first career start today So the Boozer brothers have been in together for the first time since tip off But John Sh telling us he makes it easier for everyone else to be at their best And Jay what weve seen from Camboozers being an insert in the starting lineup is weve seen Isaiah Evans have moments in this game He and Caleb Foster are in double figures and theyre scoring and thats what you wanted to see with adding that true point guard in the lineup Every Duke starter today in double figures been a more balanced attack It hasnt just been the Camboozer show but in a onep possession game youre probably looking at number 12 in white right now Heres his brother Kaden Pull up pop Got it MAKING GOOD ON THAT FIRST career start Duke leads by five and Damon Statamire takes one of his two remaining timeouts cheering Its a great job here coming in Tried to get Cam Boozer in the post Thats how you punish drop coverage Bigs inside You reverse it sets the ball screen Kaden Boozer throw all the analytics away The midi is a good shot to take when youre in rhythm Now Georgia Tech has stayed within touching distance in the in a minute 22 to play J they just find ways You know thats what this Duke team has been great at today Its been controlling the offensive glass They have not shot it well They relied on their defense when they needed to The zone has helped cheering limit the Georgia Tech offense and help them get back to control of this game Well they go back to manto man here cheering You got Duke in cross matchups now They switch back Washington trying to go baseline and a foul called on the floor will send Lamar Washington to the free throw line to shoot a one and one Duke is switching five You had options there Lamar Washington there just decides to put his head down and get to the rim and draws the foul Georgia Tech a perfect 10 for 10 from the free throw line and they have all come in this second half cheering Misses the front end Thats a big miss there a chance to make it a onepossession game again And now under a minute left Georgia Tech looks like theyre going to play this possession out cheering Got to get a stop here if youre Georgia Tech Such a smart play Cam Boozer just driving right in on Dongo whos battled foul trouble all game long commits another one there It will earn two free throws to extend this lead to seven I know you want to leave him oneonone I just dont think he can I think hes proven he can beat you when the moments matter I think if you want to upset Duke youve got to figure out a way to make someone else make the play I know he can Now hes shooting two there Georgia Tech got excited with that miss Theyre ready to take it up the floor Duke in the double bonus A lot of basketball left to play here for Georgia Tech on the other end You do not have to have a three Plenty of time Each team with one timeout remaining David Statamire the Georgia Tech head coach is over at the scorers table seeking clarification on something Maybe unintentionally or intentionally trying to ice Camboozer here laughter before the second free throw Got it Sixpoint lead for Duke Get into your action quick You dont need dont want to waste a ton of time here You said you dont need a three but you need something fast Reeves does LAUNCH THE THREE AND he buries it Kaci Reeves cuts the lead in half J thats just a difficult shot to make It was not a good shot but he made it Its one of those oh no it goes in and you celebrate it Makes it a one possession game 23 points for Reeves Thats his fifth three What do you do here if youre Georgia Tech Do you foul or do you play it out I dont think theyre going to foul here And they do Shot clock was already down to 19 There would have been 9 seconds separating the shot clock and the game clock Doesnt look like Damon Statmire wanted his team to foul No I mean this is just a difficult shot takes the contact steps away but he is in such a groove from behind the threepoint line And for Georgia Tech there if you were going to foul you should have fouled Once you trapped he got out of it You got to file immediately You could have added 10 more seconds to this game and extended it And Reeves ties a careerhigh with that three Is shooting two makes the first back to a two possession lead And I and I Im with you Randolph I think you play that out and if you get the miss you have 9 seconds to tie the game and send it to overtime Now youre back down two possessions and you let so much time tick off that clock I dont think you can spend enough time in those key moments to get your guys comfortable with what they need to do in those situations fivepoint lead cheering and the final timeout taken by Damon Stammire here to make it a one possession game If not with less time its going to be really really difficult to come back and take advantage of uh the missed free throws that Duke has had You need a gift You need help from Duke right now Theyre extending their defense Yeah the Yellow Jackets are now out of timeouts the rest of the way Duke has one remaining cheering Good thing is Duke is following their guys up the court Got a chance here Get it in the cheering trying to run that late clock play Great defense there by the Blue Devils Under 20 seconds to play Lot of time coming off the clock and a foul called against Kaden Boozer Thatll send Georgia Tech to the line to shoot one and one with 17 seconds remaining Get to the line there to catch it Kaden Boozer there on the reach Now Damon startmar is going to use a sub here bringing Chaz Kelly into the game taking Washington out And Georgia Tech not yet in the double bonus So Washington has to make the first to earn the second Hes four of five from the free throw line tonight Makes the first Now the question becomes if you yellow jackets are you going to let the ball get inbounds and try to get a trap and a turnover or are you just going to foul immediately Try to get a 5second count maybe cheering Missed it It stays a twopossession game Boozer the rebound NOBODY NEAR KADEN TONS OF TIME TICKING OFF THE CLOCK 79 seconds remaining Duke did such a brilliant job killing clock before Georgia Tech could commit that foul Those are valuable seconds Every single one of them that ticks down Jay is a lot of teaching points for the Yellow Jackets there You got to be close enough to Camboozle there to foul It would have saved so much time even once he got the rebound And the freshman with such a quick outlet there Isaiah Evans a chance to make it a sixpoint game And Isaiah Evans is the best free throw shooter applause on a Duke team And you want with their re free throw struggles hes a guy you want to put the ball in his hands if you can Ice games shooting 84 Got them both Georgia Tech has to hurry A quick three WASHINGTON MISSED IT AND DUKE HANGS ON John Sh and the Blue Devils bounce back after their first loss of the season with an 8579 victory against Georgia Tech to open ACC
