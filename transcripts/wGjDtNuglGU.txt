Panthers in the home whites Jacksonville in the black with the neon green trim and the Dolphins win the tip were underway from Oakland inside the Peterson Event Center Robert McCrae the fifth steering the offense wearing number 13 for the Dolphins hes a transfer from Wake Forest ishma Le guarding the ball here and pass inside kick back out to jossi po leg it forces a miss good defense by the Rhode Island transfer in the panther setup Applause shot freshman bub carington has impressed a lot of people in his first three games 18 points and a triple double in his debut 18 points at least in each of his first three games and really doing an excellent job making a quick first impression for Panther fans doing it in a poised way not pressed he doesnt play like a freshman he plays like one of the older Applause guys still scoreless through a few possessions here at the feet now legot trying to drive on Workman and too much contact as legit draws the foul the first Jacksonville foul of the night Ill tell you one thing Jacksonville is not going to come out backing down against this Panther team even in the warmups they were making noise showing that we are not going to come out and lay down for you Panthers now on a niname home winning streak have to go all the way back to January of last season to find their last home loss as ishmail leget gets the Panthers on the board with the triple jazy Powell wearing 10 running the point this possession for Jacksonville mentioned McCrae Jarius cook Stefon Payne the third and Workman rounding out the starting five for the Dolphins Aaron pass Le going to take advantage goes up himself a quick five for ishma Ley what a way to protect the basketball using rim with the reverse layup transition smart basketball play well Carrington has gotten a lot of the attention early but the Rhode Island transfer legged has been excellent in his own right coming off 17 Monday night against Florida G Coast rejection by Zack Austin Hinson fakes a deep three penetrates and the flush from Hinson I think he got the mimble Jason like I said that before the game at half court Jacksonville was making a lot of noise looked like they were trying to get under Hons skin hes not backing down from anyone nothing doing offensively so far for the Dolphins they are 0 for four from the field early hon trying to back down McCrae steps off him takes the jumper and hits 3 minutes and 15 seconds in and the pit Panthers looking hot as ever both sides of the basketball Zack Austin Den eyes and hitson converts on the other Applause end welcome to the universe well Julius a quick N9 nothing start for the pit Panthers five points for m m Leed four from Blake Hinson and if the Oakland Zoo wasnt alive enough already well theyre awake now yeah I mean you know thats what Henson do when he gets it going early hes going to get everybody in a in a in a gym energized um but again I think they poked the bear you know hes not a guy who would try to you know start with I really do think that he was a little more focused to start this because they were trying to get under his skin so Jacksonville head coach Jordan miny now forced to cope with a nine nothing deficit to start the game and the Dolphins commit a foul in the panther back court had an excellent season in his first year at the Helm of the Jacksonville program LED them to 21 wins including a 150 home record went all the way to the conference Championship game but last season bit of a different story and he acknowledged that and said did some reflection over the off season after having such a successful first year when you win a lot youre blind to a lot of spots in your program he said and he was able to learn a lot from more of a Down Season last year didnt realize how important Workman was to this program until they actually missed him for the entire season last year another rejection from Austin and the Panthers working in transition with lean Austin Carrington ball movement at its finest Hinson fires a three gets his own rebound and the pullup off Applause Music Target Jacksonville still scoreless Panthers keep the ninepoint advantage well take a break at the feet well theres the reigning ACC coach of the year made history for the Panthers last season in the ACC brought them back to what many of the fans surrounding this program knew it could be Jeff capable getting them to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2016 and one thing hes talked about with this group in 2023 is that there are a lot of similarities between last years team and this one just with the team chemistry mention that he just likes being around his team and it was the same way last year they like each other its genuine and theres a great Bond among everyone on the squad everybody on the same page is a great feeling to be around one go and thats just the win thats all you looking for is a team that that respects that Austin with another block hinston racing the other way and he Applause F here to push it in transition after a block why play slow after your guy make a Play Still block what have you re long rebounds get out in transition and they have guys that can get it leged gets it look up H it can handle it its going to be tough to stop this you know this team when they when theyre working on defense getting stops and turning to easy points and getting to the free throw line so Julius we are 4 minutes and 50 seconds into this game Zach Austin has three blocks I mean thats what a guy as athletic as he is we know that he can do it were just waiting for him to get that three ball to start falling yeah he can do that too great company here Kevin Durant Keegan Murray couple of guys that have had 60 and 60 seasons in the last 20 years threepointers and blocks some excellent company for Zach Austin who did it twice I Ill tell you one thing let me be on the list with Kevin Durant Im taking that screenshot and Im all over social media with it sending it to NBA teams too right everywhere y Im not downplaying that Applause ever so over five minutes in now and Jacksonville still hasnt found a bucket and the Panthers have just inserted one of their best defenders will jeffr with an excellent job there against cre it to force a miss and he did just that hold held his ground kept his hands up show why hes the best defender on this Panther team and travel by KERO Diaz Grant hes also new to the contest and to go back to Jeffers you know we talk a lot about bub and Leed you know their offensive ability but you need a guy thats going to come in here and do the dirty work for you it go it doesnt go recognized the way it does when a guy is getting buckets but you need a guy like Jeffers thats just going to come in and and lock a guy up Jeff cable said he was terrific on Monday against Florida G Coast defensively rebounding the basketball he is one of those players as you noted Julius is not always going to stuff the stat sheet but comes in and makes an impact for this Panther team as Jacksonville finally gets on the board for the first time tonight off the jumper from Jai Applause pal 12 to shoot for the Panthers leged swings to Austin leg it again Runner front rim rebound Applause Music Dolphins solid defensive possession Jacksonville trying to squeeze the pass through but Panthers get in the wavy Carrington scoreless so far tonight has only taken one shot from the field Austin squares up for a triple in and out puit hauls the rebound and gets it to mcra theyre being really aggressive with Carrington coming off of that SC with the Hedge making sure he cant get anything any good looks and through it couldnt get the lefthanded shot to go freshman from Baltimore dishes off to Austin and it ends up with kmo who ra it in just the way Austin planned it got it poked out right and just fell into the arms of Diaz Applause Graham 122 is the Panther lead just about seven minutes in not sure who that pass was intended for but the Panthers will take advantage of the Music turnover nice penetration by Austin ball pops out right to your guy early Christmas present right there is what we call that thats where those long arms come in handy right G Mo Diaz Graham the 7 foot sophomore from Spain critical piece for pit specifically in the NCAA tournament last year feder Rico feder Rico missed time with an injury Panthers relied on guo Diaz Graham to start each of three games of their March Madness Journey last season mentioned that each of the twins put on about 20 pounds of weight coming into the season guo specifically said he feels faster feels stronger and guys cant push him around anymore he said he jumps quicker and higher and just all around feels more power powerful in different shape coming into this season and Im sure his rear end is saying thank you because he was definitely biting a dust a lot and that time hes going to be glad that the dunk did roll in off an impressive feed from jayen low guo Diaz Graham gets a quick Applause four Jeff capable upset at the first one wasnt called he thought maybe Jacksonville should have received a whistle initially then ends up going against the Panthers hes having a chat with Tony Music Applause tiza Panthers operating now with Jaylen low and Bub Carrington out on the floor which we have seen through the first three games a few times low more of a true point guard Carrington can be more of a combo guy when needed now another loose ball and another foul called against the Panthers and its on Jaylen low who picks up two within the last 30 seconds leaving Jeff capable with no choice but to take him off the floor just getting locked up with the arms you know its one of those veteran plays there this just unfortunate playing hard you take the guy legs from under him you know sometimes it just be that way yeah I dont know about you I can see the call on that second one but the first one his arm just got caught I dont know you know they get really you know creative with holding on to your arm the referee cant tell whos holding who the offense always get the benefit of the doubt yo grabs the ball right off the rim mentioned Carrington out on the floor now with low stepping aside both of the twins hero and Forge out on the court as well well see if that stays the case after the break for now its 142 Panthers Leed and Hinson with five a piece coming back in Music B well Tuesday night Jacksonville put up 85 points shot really well from threepoint range as well and I asked Jordan miny do you expect the offense to be that good this season he said well let me get one thing straight we are a defensive team we pride ourselves on that and the numbers back it up and if its one thing hes doing very well and thats not letting Carrington get get comfortable within the offense mentioned bub Carrington has had 18 or more in each of his collegate games so far tonight hes got no points hes only taken one shot so Jacksonville doing a good job so far of taking him out of the offensive picture more so than the Panthers previous Music Applause Music opponents and Jaylen low with the two fouls hes the only Panther in this game that has committed a foul they came within a 30 second span so he will likely sit the remainder of the first Music half Panthers for a moment got a poke away and now Workman goes up against jeffris and draws contact good move way to get him off balance those hands came down just enough for him to draw the foul that should be a good matchup to watch work Ming going against Jeffers tonight yeah I agree I mean for Jeffers I I see him more as a perimeter Defender yeah than I do somebody who who wants to get it on the Block but hes strong enough so you know pure pure post player and Workman Jeffers well see you might be you might be on to something Jason you just got to hear me out for a second I got you I got Applause you initially I dont I didnt and see Jeffers as a guy who would be on yeah a post player but you know with his frame and his length and his athletic ability Im sure he can definitely do it so the two free throws make it 144 Jacksonville without a field goal however in the last three and a half Carrington left wide open back rim feder Rico able to tip it to Hinson leged Euro Step Tross contact he is so Fearless going to the basket creative using a Euro Step thats the third foul that hes drawing already a stat that goes overlooked I mean hes applying a lot of pressure on their defense right now Jeff capable even said that he reminds him of the guards that pit had when they were really really good and I have a feeling that means when you were playing Julius but physical ultra competitive a really easy guy to play with and Coach Cel appreciates the fact that he can create not only for himself but for others as well and through three games proven that he can score he can pass he can rebound really important piece for the Panthers to add this Applause year he plays with that edge and that attitude Leed averaging 153 points coming into tonight 77 boards and four assists an impressive St line on the year for the junior carington takes the pull up and one from Applause downtown chance for the fourpoint Music play transition pull up step from Deep three caught him sleeping right there if they going to keep hatching him on a on a screens he just said Imma do it myself I dont need the screen to create my shot and maybe he heard us talking about how he didnt have any points tonight decide to take matters into his own hands and cant complete the fourpoint Applause play Panthers three of five from the line on the night an area they certainly want to improve have struggled in the past couple games games shooting free throws they were just 18 for 32 against Florida G Coast on Applause Monday but a 15point Advantage a quarter of the way into this game Hinson fires he drils Applause it what a hand in his face and it doesnt matter he has no conscience Music whatsoever and I like every of it McCrae step back rims out Carrington off the screen up to Federico backing down the defender kick out leg fires Music connects Music well first thing first carington is getting real comfortable with the screen now hes not giving it up quick he doesnt its not making him off balance hes finding the guys and taking on a depressed now so hes finding open Shooters and theyre knocking it down earlier in the game it looked like he was a little passive against it now its like okay you want to be aggressive Ill take it Ill find my guy and Ill allow them to make plays Music ishmail Leed up to 10 points already tonight three of four from the field including a pair of triples and you have to like the pass from Carrington on that play Julius to feder Rico noticing the 7in height Advantage from feder Rico against McCrae who was guarding him and you know hits his big man in the right spot and hes catching it thats something that they wanted him to work on is being able to be effective down there in the paint and feder Rico caught it you know making the right play I mean again this team is unselfish they you know they dont theyre not out here looking to hog the basketball they understand that sharing the basketball is the best way its going to make them very difficult to gu so Jaylen low does reenter for the Panthers despite the two fouls and now Jeff capable frustrated by another odd call here by the officials off the ball not quite sure where that one occurred but it does go on feder Rico the first for the Panther Applause forward now a drive from NYL Shifty move in the paint to get it to go nice little floater in the Lan and that ends in 110 run by the Panthers Dolphins come out in a little zone now change it up a little bit low takes the pull up three Hing ticks it back out Ausin oh Music yeah and thats the one thing that is tough to do is rebound when you go Zone you have to find a guy to box out its the main concern when you go into a Zone Austin makes them pay great defense by feder Rico Lay It In transition crosscourt to Hinson now reset Low Drive had it deflected out of his hands now NY black for Jacksonville foul called against the Dolphins Zack Austin the ultimate twoway player Julius weve seen his defensive ability and how about a slam too just getting the work done on the glass nice little pass find him out of place dunk it with authority out of owners ures your car because sometimes something from and this is what he does best turn defense to play and the transition strong going to the basket I mean what can you say a guy that can get shoot the three get to the basket I mean hes just getting it done from everywhere yeah hard to believe this is just his fourth game in a pit panther uniform outscoring Jacksonvilles entire team 12 minutes into this game and leg it with double score double figure scoring in his first three games with the Panthers continues that tonight he is the first player on the floor into double digigit points with those 10 through just over 12 minutes of tonights Music action King goes two for two from the Music line hon having a night himself as the Panthers continue to pour it on here in the first half Austin ures the rebound Carrington moving quickly another pull up three for him he buries Applause it theres a lot of weapons a whole lot of weapons I mean hes just knocking a three down at such a high clip right now its amazing to see ask Jacksonville head coach Jordan miny how are you going to slow down bub Carrington and the rest of these Panther guards and he said I dont know if were going to slow him down but were going to try to slow him down important distinction there made by head coach Jordan miny and so far tonight Panthers having no trouble on the offensive side Ill tell you what Jordan minsy you know game plan in the beginning worked but its like Carrington is evolving right in front of our eyes yeah and then you cant you cant he drew up a great play from the time out this guy just has to knock down a shot ambitious alop attempt there targeting Austin now hinen cant get the three Austin tips it out to legit Austin fakes a few times finally took it but off back Applause Music rim turnaround jumper good for Marcus nlack and hes been the leader so far offensively for the dolphins with six points hining wide open three thats Applause Music good I would keep going back to that high scen in a row I mean the Panthers are going to switch that out take it NL got it going let him keep shooting it not that time and legy was looking for Austin but turned it over feder Rico rejection Le it Hinson another Applause Music three Im not sure if this Tempo is what the Dolphins want to do I dont think so to go back and forth with this Panther team the way that they can shoot the ball and finish at The Rim I think thats a fair Applause assessment without a doubt Jacksonville still looking for its first three of the night and it wont come there as Hinson gets the board off the top of the backboard Ley L pass feder Rico Music Applause Music Applause finishes well Julius this may seem routine at this point for the Panthers some of these early nonconference games but important to remember that Jeff capable has built it into this because it wasnt long ago Panthers were losing nonconference games to Nicholls State St Francis The Citadel and right now theyve made it look easy for sure this is just a its just a testament to the players and how hard they work with as feder Rico get the block right there telling the guy to use a Sefi reference no suit for the you sir dont come in here with that little man and finishing on the other end so its things like that you know bringing in a guy like feder Rico who can clog up the middle back in those in those days if if two years ago its those days um they didnt have a shot blocker and a guy that can protect the rim and finish at The Rim like feder Rico feder Rico and Jeff capable has mentioned that he wants feder Rico to continue to work on some things offensively but makes up for it in some ways because he is such an elite Defender received votes for ACC Defensive Player of the Year last season as Hinson fires up another three thats good Henson with 14 in the first Applause half and an eight nothing run by the Panthers to go up 30 Applause Blake Henson hot hand for the Panthers the senior from Florida leading the charge for pit really impossible to overstate the importance of Blake hinsons addition to this pit panther program hes got 16 points tonight and were not even at halftime yet made three threepointers Jeff Capel said that his spirit is all over this program and its a huge part of why theyve been able to find a Resurgence here with this team and said this summer it was cool to watch Blake Henson find his voice in a different way last year the voice Jeff cable said was jamarius Burton and theyre two very different people but watching him and allowing him to find his leadership voice this off season Jeff C said has been really cool to watch his personality so infectious you know especially when he gets when he gets it going Applause offensively he plays with an energy and a Swagger that you know that are bring the life out of your most quiet humble guy he can bring it out of anyone Music C said its been a really interesting and unique Journey for Blake hinston started his career at om Miss got some time there and produced well in the SEC before transferring to Iowa state did not play in game action for Iowa State and really got a second opportunity at his career with pit y Mo Diaz Graham chases down the loose ball goes up strong and Applause converts last year that would have been a turnover yeah you can tell hes starting to settle in and get a little more confident not be in such a hurry and just you know taking his time to make the right Music play another foul call Jeff cable not happy Oakland Zoo not happy with the ruling there that goes as the seventh hamper foul of the night and it gives will jeffr his second Music personal so Hinson who already has 16 in this first half steps back Applause Music Applause on Im sure when Henson touch it hes going to be saying to himself heat check a guy got to go and feed me hes never shied away from a shot never but thats what Shooters do they Applause shoot hen Five for 10 from the field Applause tonight took 15 shots Monday against Florida G Coast made six of them Panthers up by 31 here 3 minutes to go first half heres Carrington looking for a lane Hinson open look here not that Applause time and out of bounds last off NYL he tried to save it but the Panthers keep Applause possession impressive 47 Pittsburgh from Beyond The Arc so far tonight 7 to 15 Applause and pass gets away from G mod Diaz Graham NL goes up and slams it home nice Poise vet from play to slow down and use your body to cut the defender off on top of the excellent defense so Marcus nlack one of the few bright spots so far for Jacksonville hes got eight points on four of seven shooting Carrington left open for three back iron Applause n slows down to cut off Diaz Graham he had to be a little worried of the chase down there right absolutely I mean thats a footer right there thats without doing that he probably would have got it beat up so that was a smart Music play a little bit of a squeeze me dunk though you know not one of the infamous dunks from one of their legendary alums I bet you you dont know who that is who you talking about D Brown what you know about D Brown okay tell me what do I need to know D Brown come on the pump up shoes in the dunk contest I was a young and when D Brown pulled that out you know I had to do a little bit of homework found out de Brown went to Jacksonville took me right back to my childhood when we used to act like we had the rebok pumps on but you know you you wasnt even thought off back then Jason come on youre a young fell thats a good thing its okay my brother its its okay exposing me in front of everybody no come on its a good thing you know its only dating me thats what Im doing is is is telling everyone how how old I am now Im old enough to remember you thats good enough right playing when it wasnt HD see every time we bring it up we got to bring up all of the Applause Music facts with the blouses we had on back in those days the Jersey were super super baggy did you have any of your ankles showing in those shorts basically sweatpants right basically might as well have been Applause Music Applause right so just over 90 seconds left in the first staff Jacksonville draws the foul that time goes against Michael hwit Jr for the Panthers and one of those games so far despite a 29point lead I think Jeff cable may be frustrated by the frequent foul calls going against his team well that one he had to take I I think that instead of giving up the layup go ahead and make him earn it from the line but you know theyre playing hard sometimes it just doesnt work out in your favor with the hustle those incident incidental files you know are difficult to deal with but you got to deal with Applause Music Applause Music them Dolphins going to the Press trying to change it up again Diaz gam right on Q on the base line got the feed and converted GMO up to nine points hes perfect four for four from the field I mean hes just looking over his guy has the awareness to get it to him nice touch and focus and leg it makes it look effortless doesnt it effortless I mean but the Dolphins came out with the Hedge early on went to the zone now going to the the Press I mean I guess when when youre hitting on all cylinders the panther is going to be really difficult to stop these Panthers they just dont seem to have the answer for anything right now Jeff capable pleased to see the Applause offensive contribution from G mod Diaz Grand tonight he only had two points on one of five shooting Monday against Florida G Coast mening perfect from the field with nine tonight for the sophomore from Spain guo Diaz Graham Hinson from the elbow Diaz Grant the put back once and once again for Applause two and make that three Panthers in double figures now Hinson hesitation strong take to the cup and one its a strong move thats a grown man move right there with the poison transition the handle to put it on a Dr I me create his own shot sman just a threepoint Music shooter hes just too big right there what are you going to do hes trying to get back to and figure it out you know but you know Henson just used that big old Music body 20 points in the first half Music so hes averaging 19 points per game on the season Julius coming into tonight and well we already know that average is going to go up yeah hes going for a 40 piece now hes going to be like bub Carrington was in that season opener saying coach make sure I stay in the game for sure bub one of the triple double Blake might might have a chance at that 40 piece tonight and I think he can do it just being him self he doesnt have to force the issue I think his teammates to look up there and see where he is and want him to uh you know reach Milestones like that just because he has it going and thats the luxury of being on an unselfish team that way but the minute that your coach see you fishing for it is when hes going to yank you so you got to do it quietly got to do it quietly Jason dont look pressed you got to sell it within the offense you know his personality it doesnt really ever strike me as press thats not what it seems like we mentioned the difference between jamarius Burton and him in the contrasting leadership styles that coach cable talked about he said Blake is more a joking getting everyone hype type away Jarius Burton little bit more serious grown man energy and hon likes to have some fun Music Applause and tie up here possession arrow pointing with the Panthers not much to complain about if youre Jeff capable through the first 20 minutes Applause here not at all yep now a 10 second difference between shot and game clock here towards the end of the half Diaz Graham throws it away Sabino for Jacksonville goes Coast to Coast Panthers will have the last shot of the Applause half freshman point guard jenin low Austin for three no good but still a 30point lead for the Panthers JP NBA Jacksonville still looking for its first threepointer on the night rough shooting outing so far for the Dolphins just seven of 29 from the field in the first half Panthers doing just about everything right here in their fourth game of the season I mean call me crazy but I can see him definitely being a PJ Tucker in the NBA yeah he probably shoots a little better than Tucker too yeah for sure for sure might not be as good of a Defender but he can be there he can definitely he he competes at that level see those are the type of names I need from you Julius PJ Tucker Ive got that one all right okay I thats up to date thats a little yeah yeah recent Ive watched him in the NBA Finals plenty of times dig a little too deep in the archives thats right okay Dolphins come back out in a two three fre Zone stretched out there they leaving that middle open Legas three is short grabs his own rebound and finishes body control attack you right in your chest no fear going in Applause there yeah just follow your shot kids thats what legot does right there and just go right in there absorb the contact keeps his Focus doesnt panic and finishes leg in double figures with 12 on the night hes been so efficient not just tonight but the entire season for the Panthers came into this game shooting 49 from the field and they get four of seven shooting in this game I tell you one thing in those ACC games on the rad when you cant seem to throw it in the ocean youre going to need a guy that can make offense quick going to the basket and Leed is going to be that guy for him create off the dribble get to the basket get to the free throw line hes going to be really important during those times Zack Austin grabs his fifth rebound of the Applause night carington putting his ball handling on display now finds GMO Diaz Graham Diaz Graham went up hard and got fouled Applause Music hard nice move by Diaz Graham attack the basket get to the free throw line I dont know if workman is pleased with that call though well workmans now got four fouls we talked about him in the open if Jacksonville was going to have any shot tonight they needed a big performance from the grad student Bryce Workman but four points 0 for three from the field and four fouls for Workman unfortunately for him he has to go against feder Rico Austin Henson the grand twins its a lot of bodies the Panthers can throw at him its a tall Applause task athletic finish there from danan puy for jackonville he gets the foul call and will head to the line by the way Panthers shooting a lot better from the line themselves tonight as we get one more look at the feed to Music it and pick came into this game with just a 59 free throw percentage on the season that was the worst in the ACC and 323rd nationally coming into this game a lot better in that area tonight 11 of 14 the Panthers off Austin drives Baseline dishes to Hinson and rebound by the Dolphins Panthers thought they were out of bounds but no Applause call High black looking for an option finds puit with 11 to shoot and a Applause travel you know another guy we havent talked a lot about is McCrae yeah you know the Panthers have done a really good job at know keeping him at Bay hes a guy from Wake Forest so hes used to this kind of ACC play not a guy that would be timid at all but cant seem to get it going CRA came into tonight averaging 17 points per game on the season he is 0 to four from the field in this one they Tred through it again and its tued Away by Austin and they do get Austin for the foul and just over 3 minutes into the second half another personal foul called on the Panthers and that makes it four on the team for pit just a few minutes into this second Music Applause period Music still nothing doing for the Dolphins from threepoint range as for Diaz Graham helped up by Jordan miny over by the Jacksonville Applause Music bench miny still coaching hard over there knowing hell right back in the Pittsburgh area in the week Hinson attempted the alley pass to G Mo Diaz Graham who was fouled but thats right Jacksonville with about a week off after this one and then they come right back to Pittsburgh playing a tournament over in Moon Township at Robert Morris theyll take on rmu before playing Fairley Dickinson of course Fairley Dickinson coming off the magic of last years NCAA tournament victory over Purdue interesting that last year pit played fairly Dickinson Julius in this building and talked to toin Anderson before that game and never did I think that Fairley Dickinson would become as prominent as they did later in that season I think as a testament to the game changing its going to be hard when you have those traditional old school bigs to win in ACC tournament thats my opinion but Im sticking to it um there you know these quicker stretch four and fives is going to expose those guys on the other end you need guys like the Diaz Graham twins that can run the floor to defend on the wing the games changed like you tried the spin move would have been an excellent finish GMO especially as you mentioned the twins having a great outing tonight 14 points five of six from the field for guo Diaz Ram Panthers with three players in double figures Yos one of them they lead by 32 here in the second half at the peak welcome to the University of Pittsburgh were here in the Cathedral of Learning which if you can imagine 14 points from Dio Diaz gr tonight in just 11 minutes Julius hes been really efficient he got a couple of Christmas gifts on his first four points but from there it was all work keeping his balance there getting the the tip in right there and finishing at The Rim you know just focus man we talking about a guy 61 7 feet tall who is a very skilled player so he has a very high ceiling for the Panthers yeah you definitely see glimpses of what he can be and its nights like this that are really exciting and if he can continue to perform as he has tonight and start to carry that into some tougher opponents remember the next five for the Panthers are all against Power Conference teams and Julius its during that stretch where well really start to learn a lot about this team without a doubt when how how are they going to handle some Applause Music adversity especially with the new back court bub Carrington jayen low both freshman ishmail leet the transfer from Rhode Island how will those guys perform when they have some tougher tests starting next week when they take on Florida at the barlay Applause Music center I tell you what Florida will know how to take a punch theyll know how to deliver one as well so theyre not going to lay down just because you go on a little 10 run or what have you its going to its definitely going to be a different story Applause Deo to low fir from the wing Jaylen low buries it he gets his first bucket of the night that young man is as cool as the other side of the pillow just keeps his composure also plays with a lot of confidence for a young Applause guy Jeff cable talked about his performance Monday by far the best game of his collegate career so far against Florida G Coast said he just wasnt pressed about scoring as a freshman a lot of the time thats how you judge yourself is by the points category coach cable said he put pressure on himself instead of just being a playmaker which is what he did Monday just taking the plays that were there for him and it worked out well freshman the freshman and the three is good for Carrington Jorge with the block how about that for some rotation defense now guo back to Carrington three in the air thats Music good that is quite the sequence block on one in Carrington back to back threes hes shooting a three at such a high clip for a freshman it is just beautiful basketball isnt it yes it is I mean this is a guy that has a running start at you too hes not flat footed both of you are going you know got to step and the kick out be unselfish he could have been thirsty and kept that one I got the block on one and you know Im keeping this one we but he kicked it out to his guy who just made one smart decision now guo showing that he can pass as well hes got the 14 points six boards and a great dish and like youve continued to talk about JP if youve got a sevenfooter who can pass like that shoot efficiently thats going to be dangerous yes sir especially when you put him in a Twan game with Carrington the way hes shooting its going to be very difficult surrounded by Carrington Diaz Graham Henson leot I mean they just compliment each other so well hey though since youve been calling me out I got to call you out it was Jorge with the blocko with okay okay yeah I got you you know I cant tell them Im a part yet hey neither time Im thankful for jersey Applause number thats hor that time stepped in to try and take a charge they call a block instead and Jeff capable is Music iate this what we alluded to earlier Julius despite a 37point lead when youre a coach and you see some of these calls going against you its still frustrating you know I think hes trying to keep his team you know focused coach this all the way to the end because like you said theyre playing a tough opponent you know in Florida next um coming up in Brooklyn so I mean he was kind of sideways right there little sideways but he did look set I think set but you got to take it you got to take it all away I dont know I might have to agree with the reeree right there you got to take it with your chest you cant like Paul sideways well Ill let you talk to Jeff t50 you know I can understand both I can understand why coach C was upset but I understand the referee point of view as well hey Ill give him credit I think its one of the hardest calls to make in sports you football pass interference and know some of the penalties in the other sport but the block charge in basketball I think is in real time one of the most difficult calls to make for sure I agree with you 100 although Im not really a fan of the charge like if it was up to me I would take it out of the game all together because I I especially when a guy is in air theres no way that a guy can take fight and you stand here thats just not a basketball play to me so how do you defend that then without fouling you got to get up there and block it weve seen guys get contested at The Rim time after time tonight am I right so why not go up there to block it either you get dunked on or you let him dunk it but to stand there with a guy is in the air and try to take a charge I think is not a safe play it should be taken out of the game so if Jaylen low finds himself under the basket in practice guarding Jorge Diaz Graham whos about to go up for a dunk what should Jaylen get dunked on thats just what its going to be either get out the way get dunked on but you shouldnt be put in that situation I think is when we watched jaar get hurt on a on a play like that were seeing so many players in the air and a guy just stand there when you should be you I mean you at a you know division one or NBA level you know make a play or dont well the Panthers have been working on physicality around the rim and in the paintt and Jeff C mentioned one of the things for them is that they dont play against interior physicality in practice and thats what they felt that papati was going to bring for them so not only hurts them in game situations but felt that kti provided that physicality and that aggression on the inside to be able to prepare some of the panther bigs for some of the ACC opponents still Applause think but until then they had to rely on the OG G Gilbert Brown who got that grown man strength on the p on the panther bench he has to fill in and get the job done for Applause him Panthers with three to shoot here leg it pull up triple not that time but Austin hes just everywhere rebounding the basketball and distributing Jaylen low got a mismatch finds Leed in the corner crosscourt Austin for three off front iron loose ball Jorge wins it back tips to Austin now low Panthers try to reset calm things down here goes low dish out to Ley Baseline Drive and hes f Applause Jeff cable out on the floor as you can see a lot of physicality from Jacksonville tonight Jeff cable has not been pleased with the way this game has been officiated Jordan miny trying to calm things down and you can tell up 35 Jeff cable is not worried about the results of this game hes worried about the safety of his own team and in a game that really has already been decided theres just no need for any extra aggressive fouls and hopefully things can get cleaned up here in the Applause Pak back in Pittsburgh and can provide some clarity on the sequence before the break Jeff cable did receive a technical foul for coming out onto the floor and arguing this right here you can see Stefan Payne of Jacksonville really not even going for the ball in challenging ishmail leet shot Jeff C was not happy about that so technical foul called as Marcus nblack is on the line but pay receives a flagrant one as well so a foul on each side flagrant one is called on pain and cable gets the T for coming out and disputing as he should you got to protect your teammates I mean excuse me your players he didnt like the foul you know go out there and show I mean sometimes the technical foul is worth it and again as we noted before the break Julius this is for Jeff capable not about the outcome of this game obviously the Panthers have this thing won with 11 and a half minutes left he is worried about his players and as you said protecting his players in a game thats already in hand and he knew going into this one that Jacksonville was a physical team talked to us about that and even compared them to some West Virginia teams that he remembers just because of how physical they are but I dont think he imagined it getting this out of hand in a game thats a 36o Applause margin still early in the season also you know you got to continue to take one possession at a time just keep getting better and better knowing that its a long season youre obviously not playing your best basketball right now you want to continue to get better this for every team in the Applause country Panther still with a few starters out on the floor Zach Austin ishmail Leed and Federico feder Rico imagine as we get closer towards the end here Jeff capable going to utilize his Applause Music Applause bench and here come a couple substitutions now as deer mod Diaz BR William jeis and Bub Carrington will all step on for the Applause Panthers Jeff capable has praised his teams depth this season says he likes the fact that he has so many good players that push each other he wants them to make him have to make difficult decisions and creates really intense practices feels very confident at least that the Panthers are nine deep possibly 10 here is Carrington with 12 to shoot you know they always say the game is for the players practice is for the coaches pull up triple offt Target and panther shooting percentage has fallen below 30 in this second half after shooting so efficiently in the first Applause Music Applause half and theres of 38 from the field in half number one and just 5 for 20 here in the second theres jeffris now Jorge in the corner passes to his brother back to Applause Jorge I think they like the give and go the two of them weve seen this before I remember seeing that in the NCAA tournament last season yes sir I think it was the first round against Iowa Applause State a twoman game between Jorge and his brother gu Moy to see their parents did a good job teaching them how to Music share the finish at The Rim two skill gentlemen what a tandem they are yes Applause Music sir and they stayed so committed to stay at pit and going through the summer plan Jeff cable and the staff had for him mentioned putting on that weight working out staying in the gym and preparing ing for this 2023 24 season guo Diaz Graham mentioned a point last year speaking of March Madness after the win in the first four over Mississippi State said he just wanted to hit the floor and start crying because it was so beautiful and he said sure there were times in that game he felt overwhelmed but by the end of it it was so rewarding for Guero Diaz Graham and the rest of the Panthers and tonight Im sure none of the players on that team will ever forget as pit was able to get the NCAA tournament win and Advance on to the round of 64 of course ended up winning another game against Iowa state held the Cyclones to under 50 points Julius what was going through your head as an alumni watching the team in the tournament last year you know it was a great feeling for for a few years you know the program being down um it was nothing negative being said it was just a great Cloud over the program and um to just see them you know push all of that to the side and finally get back and string off a couple of wins um it just its a testament I just kudos to coach cable thought Jeff G had a really unique perspective on it continue JP no you know I just get much respect to him to have to go through that and weather the storm and not give up and continue to fight put the pieces together um even though you know all of the talks and the negativity you know it was Pittsburgh they used to win it youre not winning they going to let you hear it so you know he was no different he was no exception to that so but to hear all of that continue to fight and continue to find players and the PTO the changes in in basketball as the hole and he figured it out and got it done I think it was welld deserved so Im probably more proud of you know for him um just to get through and make it through it says a lot about him always appreciate Jeff Cables honesty when we talk to him before games and he was completely candid with us and said the first four years here were really really hard and hard on him because it made him question himself it seemed like every move he made was wrong and he thought am I just wrong in all of my evaluations and said in year four having dearius Burton have to undergo a knee procedure Nike Sandy tears his ACL just seemed like it was one thing after another and then they get into year five which of course was last year and they start one and three they come home after the tournament in New York City and theyre down at the half here in this building against Alabama State and hes thinking to himself am I this wrong but then they went and beat Northwestern on the road and he said thats where it happened they felt the team come together followed that up by beating NC stayed on the road and then everyone started to feel it again and the Panthers started to string together some momentum that of course led to the end of season magic that they Music had well if he was wrong then Ill tell you one thing that he is so incredibly right about and thats recruiting Bob Carrington I mean if he hasnt shown you that that was as of right now he Bob Carrington is making me look like um I wasnt so crazy comparing him to the Shawn Millers and the Brandon Knights and Cary kers and Trey Woodall and you know all of those guys that came before um in fact I mean he keep this up he might be at the top of that list well I got to give you credit because you said it early and I was a little bit skeptical but through three and a half almost four games here hes lived up to the height you know watching how poised he is you know playing the point guard position and you know the the one thing coach cable said about him and you know how smart he is and the time that he put in watching film only makes me even more comfortable you know making a statement like that knowing that this kid is just going to continue to improve Carringtons got 15 tonight double figures in all four Collegiate games for him so far Panthers up big with insurance right Julius Im going to put you on the spot bub Carrington is the best pit freshman since Bob Carrington I have to give it to him nobodys never started their career with a triple double by the fa hes at the top of the list unbelievable performance from this guy through four games hes got 15 tonight and just noticed during the break Julius five of seven from threepoint range tonight coming in at 47 I mean I didnt think he can shoot this well I didnt think he would shoot this well I thought he would be jittery you know something like a freshman but he doesnt seem to have any of those traits hes cool cool calm collected so I mean just much praise to him hell continue to get Music better I thought it stood out our conversation with Jacksonville head coach Jordan miny we were asking him about how he can slow down Carrington and he said I dont think hell be a guy that stays in college long hes a three LEL scorer got a triple double in his first game there is a lot of NBA potential in number seven for the Applause Panthers I mean hes showing that he can show the he can play the point guard position I think thats whats huge the fact that he can shoot well he can handle it and he has that length I mean he just has the make up of the NBA point guard Jeff cable said hes always been a gym rat wants to get better very smart and that means book smart and basketball smart too and able to pick things up really quickly Min reads quickly and for his age just has an incredible feel for what the defense is doing he sees the floor differently and I enjoyed this quote from coach C he said Im not going to say Ive been surprised but Ive really been Music impressed well he had to see something he had to show him that he can play he didnt think that he knew that he can play play the point guard but you know not this well I mean come on usually you know point guards are supposed to struggle when they take this Stu thats the hardest position on the floor youre not supposed to make it look I dont it doesnt matter you know you playing against guys whove been here for a while the learning curve has nothing to do with your athletic abilities between your ears and the game just still looks you know slow motion for him like hes processing everything as if hes been here two three years already well and I love that you point out the versatility too because even when low comes on and he starts to become more of the ball dominant point guard they dont miss a beat Carrington is perfectly comfortable in either role when low is on or off the floor hes an impressive shooter passer hes shown his ability to rebound as well and cant say enough about the Freshman through four games and here he is again fakes takes back iron that time five for eight I would say still a good performance from threepoint range without a doubt huitt low and Carrington out there together I kind of like it you havent talked too much about Michael huitt Jr but hes gotten some time tonight BR student from fville North Carolina is hwi as the Panthers get another three from Blake Hinson who was Electric in the first half hasnt gotten as much playing time here in the second of course they havent needed him and hes up to 25 on the night welcome to the party Mr McCrae the Dolphins need to get him going you know regardless of the score hes their main one of their main guys be nice to see him get a rhythm going orge Diaz Graham starting to chip Applause in hes up to five to a four from the field and he grabs a Music Applause rebound Carrington setting up his offense penetrates strong take draws the foul hits the deck and hell head to the Music line nice strong move driving into his left showing a creativity off the dribble feeling like this is a Music mismatch Carrington has had pit ties for a while his father actually coached Jamal artist from age 10 through high school and hes been a panther basketball fan for a while of course remember Jamal Aris key player for Pittsburgh just about six seven years ago played in a for team melow thats why he wears number seven for the Panthers dad goes by bum hes Lil Applause bum and making that long sleeves underneath the jersey look pretty iconic here I mean how about the nerve to rock number seven and come out here and and almost have the kind of impact that Carmelo had as a freshman I remember his first game in Madison Square Garden as a freshman he put on a Music Applause Music Applause Music show and theres McCrae and McCrae starting to come alive unfortunately for Jackson too little too late he does have nine points but all nine for McCrae coming here in the second half low drives dishes Austin back to low jab step NE to shoot Austin fires a three Applause nylon Applause Music Applause dunk there from Donovan Rivers for Music Jacksonville jayen low such a calm presence running the point for the Panthers who now lead by 37 what do you take Julius what can you bring into next week theyve got Florida then theyll have either Baylor or Oregon State and continues to get tougher Missouri in the ACC SEC challenge that one will be here in this building on November 28th on ESPNU then youve got that random ACC game sprinkled into early December which I know you love against Clemson yes sir I think um you know the main thing is last game it seemed as as if they got punched in the face a little bit and they handled it but it wasnt a team like Florida or power five you know opponent that theyre going to see so I think thats the main thing you know how are they going to respond to adversity uh because obviously theyre going to run into it when another team go on those 10 runs in a hostile environment um what is that going to look like are they going to start to panic are they going to start playing herob ball are they going to still trust each other when everything isnt going their way and thats why we talked about earlier fans coaches everyone surrounding the program sure to learn a lot about the team in that five game stretch coming up where they play consecutive power conference opponent in all five games on the upcoming schedule for the Music Panthers Deo spin move in the post like he might have gotten poked in the eye as false tipped down of bounds three and 1 half to play from the feet Panthers wire to wire Music ahead mentioned bub Carringtons efficiency from threepoint range he 5 for8 the team is 13 for 31 Julius the offense has been tremendous tonight and really all season for the Panthers yeah stretching the floor makes it difficult to uh get in the gaps and play defense on on the drives and then so you they compliment shooting the ball so well from three with having a guy like legot chew you up by get to the basket so you know the balance is really well yeah we asked je Jeff cable about that before the season as well they had some threepoint Shooters last season that theyve lost including Greg Elliott Nike sbandi Nelly Cummings was good for an occasional three so we said you feel like the threepoint ball will be just as efficient for you this year and he was confident he knew he had guys who could come in and shoot it obviously bub Carrington can Michael hwit Jr whos on the floor now is good for a three every so often weve talked about Zack Austin what hes done at High Point ishmail Leed coming in and of course cant forget about the returning Blake Henson yeah when he said that I have to be honest and say I didnt believe him yeah because that was just a lot to lose a lot of experience J Marius Burton I mean Nelly cumins was a lot of experience to lose I just couldnt really see them really you know filling those shoes but theyre doing a good job so far H Juniors three off Target but the tip in by the guo Diaz Graham who is up to 16 points a new career high for guo the Music Applause Music sophomore low dishes guo Diaz Graham he buries it Dio on fire tonight in Pittsburgh what a night for the Spanish sophomore I mean theres nothing you can do you have two Shooters coming off the hand off you have to help a shooter is coming off and its going to leave him open every single time I mean its just you have to pick your poison Jeff the takeaway look Applause Music out JP through four games very little to complain about you know outside of shooting free throws a little poorly coming into this game not a lot to complain about but you love to see this guy coming back after sitting out all last year due to Music Applause injury KJ Marshall from the logo plays would have erupted if that had gone Music Applause Music Applause down but they go back to William jeffr for a minute you know after sitting out all year last year Im sure its disappointing for him his mental you know Im sure it was a rough time for him but now hes back body looking better than ever looking strong understand his role accepting his role I think I read a quote he said he just want to win you know thats the kind of mentality you need you know from a guy whos been around for a while hes been here for those low times he remember what that feel like and he just want to win yeah dont forget he was was a really highly touted guy out of high school from Erie and chose pit over Baylor Memphis Villanova among some others as well came to fit and again that type of guy that impacts the game in so many ways Beyond scoring what a feed from Marshall to guo Panthers hanging 103 on Jacksonville Applause tonight you know its hard to believe JP that this team was picked to finish ninth in the ACC and of course a lot of season left but through four games they look like one of the top five or six in the conference at least you know thats why I put zero stuck intoe preseason rankings yeah you remember last year North Carolina no disrespect to them was up there but finish unranked so you cant put any stop into those preseason rankings this Panther team looks dangerous and they look like theyre going to be a problem for the rest of the ACC this year and as weve continued to knowe the next five games going to be very important how much can they carry this into some tougher Music tests and they get one right away against Florida a team that easily go nine deep so is this not going to be you know one of those team you talk about pit you talk about the Panthers having almost a 10man rotation well the Florida is not that far behind if theyre behind at Applause all and the tough ACC games too are really right around the corner end of December will be here before before we know it theyre on the road of Syracuse December 30th and then they playing North Carolina and Duke both here both in the first 10 days of Music Applause Music January its fun to have good college basketball back without a doubt you know with all of the different ways you can watch with the ESPN pluses and all all that stuff you know the ACC networks and I mean they make it so easy for you to be able to watch all of these games you could just sit at home be a couch potato for the entire night are the bosses paying you extra for this for this one listen they paying me to have the best seat in the house give them a shout out here end the game doing some free advertising you know it you know it I know my job Applause well a 51point victory for the pit Panthers as Jeff capable leads his team to a 40 start led by
