scoring points per game at 83 they like to get up and down SMU in the home white Cal in the road blue and gold and its the Golden Bears that start with the basketball they have won three straight games probably their best form of the season and theyve won the last two without their leading scorer Andre sto yakovich who is also unavailable this evening Mii Soko the best big man for Cal also not playing tonight in concussion protoc call so arguably the two best players missing for this Cal team on the road tonight theyre going to have to play a little bit smaller at times and its going to be really challenging to keep this SMU team in front all five starters averaging double figures this is a highscoring team that likes to advance the ball and score quickly in the shot clock and for the Mustangs SMU is without their Dynamic freshman big man cement yigu thats a big loss for SMU so both teams battling through some injuries here trying to finish January with a win step back three rattles in and out no good from Chuck Harris both coaches alluded to other guys stepping up tonight and for other guys stepping up for SMU Johan tror is one guy thats going to get a chance right here tonight as well and Lee Dort getting his first start in the middle for Cal and and that rolls in for the Arlington native hes back in his home state Reedus petrius opens the Music scoring SMU likes to play with that empty block down the lay scoop to the hoop for Chuck Music Harris driving lanes available when you space the floor so well and enfields team does a really good job of sharing the basketball and spreading the Music floor and we welcome those that just watched Mike young in Virginia Tech get a road Conference win in Tallahassee Debbie Antonelli Jay alter with you in Dallas Texas SMU and Cal two teams in very good form the Golden Bears have won three in a row and SMU right on the NCAA tournament Bubble at 15 and five heres boy Miller pull up Pops got it poopys the leading scorer for SMU one of Five Guys on the floor that averag in double figures they lead the ACC in scoring at 83 points a Music game Jeremiah Wilkinson the flashy freshman denied at The Rim that time boy Wilkinson is has played well for Cal coming off a career high 30 points in the win over Miami in overtime he has Ste due to the starting lineup with leading scorer Andre sakovich out and his average 24 points per game jovon blackshire ties HED four hes the dynamic duo with Wilkinson in the back court Im not expecting a lot of shot clock issues here tonight both teams are going to go up and down and youre going to its going to be about making shots because the floor is opened up the space is available in the middle and getting to the logo with 2 feet in the paint is a key for both teams and both teams not shy Debbie theyre going to let it fly all night long yeah Im good with that Im perfectly fine with that SMU leads the ACC 83 points per game we ask Cal head coach Mark Matson so do you want to try and slow the pace down and he goes no man we like to run so this could be first to 90 between Andy Enfield and Mark Madson coach teams I mean look at the numbers here for Andy Fields team you can see theyre first in scoring in field goal percentage one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the nation and they are second in the league and assist that is a good number for them because they move the ball in their spacing and they do a nice job of attacking off the bounce Harris lines up a three and buries it SMU is made four in a row both have smaller back courts both teams will play small to tonight with a small five or four guards on the floor and with Mi Soko out for Cal expect a lot of Spencer Mahoney hes in the bottom of your screen number seven in golden blue shot clock down to five black Shir Tangled Up in the lane puts it up and it rims out no Applause good here comes goofy Miller the transfer from White Forest leads a team in scoring trying to spin his way in at only 6 foot boopy Miller Not Afraid tirelessly all week okay weve got to prepare for the 7 foot two Center if youre Cal and for SMU youre preparing for sto yakovich and Soko you have to rip it all up Debbie and you know adjust on the Fly here well I think it gives other guys an opportunity theyre going to get extended minutes and this is what you do as coaches you prepare all guys to get ready to go so its not that tough of a transition SMU on a 7 nothing run after the boy Miller makes he has set the tone for this Mustangs team 10 new players one of them Miller P tritis right place right time picked it up and put it in and this was Cal playing with what I was referring to before a little bit of a smaller lineup with petritis at the four hell be matched up with Matt cross number 33 and white Music heres back cross with it now cross fading away left it short bet tried us told us today and shoot around hes making a conscious effort to get to the glass A little bit more you see him with back toback boards on both ends of the floor stolen away boopy Miller got a piece of it battling for the Freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson and he wents possession for the Golden Bears there is Mark Matson year number two is the head coach at Cal longtime NBA career with the Lakers and Timberwolves and we really enjoyed getting to know him and I think the ACC is really going to like Mark mats and his coaching style hes done a great job in his second year here at Music Cal I think he has done a great job he spent four years at Utah Valley as the head coach before he got the Cal job a lot of people remember mark from his time at Stanford or his time with the Lakers winning two titles with Kobe and Shaq DJ Campbell into the lane and Cal starting to get it going backto back baskets one possession game two feet in the paint all night both teams thats the goal if you can get there off the bounce because its not going to be with a penetrating pass neither team plays with a back to the basket post up guy a two feet in the paint again and it leads to two with bopy Miller I mean pound for pound poy Miller might be one of the toughest guys in the league he is consistently delivered offensively for Andy enfields Music team and again SMU forcing another turnover Harris everything but the finish and now Cs going to run the other way we told you both of these teams are going to push the pace and they have so far cleaning up the spill right on Q Jo Josiah Olo Joseph and Cal continuing the battle on the road early Miller pull up pop wave off the shot foul called on the floor theres Andy edfield his first year at SMU and he told us look were right where we need to be 15 and five his team squarely on on that NCAA tournament bubble and he believes in this team theyve won four out of five they do not have a bad loss on their resum he told us today hes not a guy that yells and screams at his players he comes at it as a teacher like his parents were teachers when he grew up in the Shippensburg Pennsylvania area grew up in ACCC fan he told us today also Jay how about that he he rooted for Maryland as a kid nice defense Jeremiah Wilkinson getting back to deny BJ Edwards tips and deflections is what Andy Enfield told us when he knows this defense is clicking and theyve had several already in this first half now this is a C team thats a very low assist team so they struggle to pass the ball effectively travel call there well theres a couple of ways you can look at a low assist team right one is that theyre really good off the bounce they can get to the paint because they do get to the free throw line a lot the other is that they dont really play through to three or four options they get to their first or second action and theyve got an opportunity because theyre a really good screening Music Team all 10 of the Golden Bear points tonight have come in the paint oh Joseph tried to change that there misfired bopy Miller in attack mode he always is it seems another offensive rebound leads to two BJ Edwards nice put Music back count it plus the foul the immediate answer from Jeremiah Wilkinson I was listening to Mark Matson this week on the ACC coaches telecon and he was talking about Wilkinsons seamless transition to the starting role how he can score at all three levels and what a great student of the game he has been and thats twice in transition that he is attacking the big at The Rim so he is fearless as well yeah the Fearless freshman and what a find for Mark mson in this Cal staff going into Powder Springs Georgia outside Atlanta and they picked out a diamond in the row off we asked howd you get him and he goes we we really like him and we identified him early and now theyre switching to Zone SMU going inside attacking that zone so Mark Madson shifting things defensively this is shaping up to be a good one Wednesday at NC State with that 15point lead they were able to survive an NC State comp back but you look at this no bad loss here uh and theyve got opportunities in front of them with the remaining schedule and you certainly have to take care of business here at home Ola Joseph makes it a onepoint game and this is a cow team playing with a lot of confidence despite the injuries to so yakovich and Soko they are in their best form of the season on a threegame win streak the lob and the finish a monster racket attack by tror its a great job off the timeout they clear out go naked side twoman game and leave it at The Rim really well executed yo on trior starting instead of Yu restores the threepoint lead Wilkinsons fouled watch right here the screen and then the roll and Dort is kind of caught in between cuz he likes to play Drop coverage the weak side of the floor is busy which takes help away its a really nice designed play you got to keep the weak side busy Jay you cant have guys just standing over there you got to keep them moving on the weak side to take that help at The Rim away coming for number so the only negative for Jeremiah Wilkinson moving into the starting lineup with sto yakovich out is prior to making his first start he had led all freshman who had not started a game this season in scoring so he had to wave that off but he has moved in 30o performance on Saturday against Miami he has looked terrific throughout his freshman campaign and off the made free throws extended pressure by Cal and I still think hes eligible for six man of the year so I wouldnt take him out of that conversation with three starts Im with you heres booby Miller everything goes through number two in white Step Back endu Off the Music Mark Joon blacker with 15 on the timer havent had many possessions with the shot clock under 10 but trius nothing but the bottom of the net and he fires the Golden Bears in front hes a 24 threepoint shooter but hes wide open late in the clock oh and thats going to be a offensive foul trayor just lowered his shoulder petritis is everywhere right now hes filling up the stat sheet offensive rebounding look at the close out it is a short close out on him because hes not known as a threepoint shooter you got to make a couple more before you adjust a perfect three for three from the field for petritis and then he takes the charge on the other end Midway through this first half its a good one on a Wednesday night in Dallas twoo Music game H bear is hedging on those ball screens typically when yigu is in the game they are in drop coverage so this is a different defensive scheme for Andy enfields team Cal has made four in a row and Mark madsons team has a fourpoint Music lead Matt cross trying to get something going hes been quiet in this first half right into lead door the big man making his first start of the season in place to Soko and how about the Golden Bears on the road playing without their two best players making a game of it I think SMU missed out on a couple of switches there that they had an advantage and you got to recognize that you know that Cals going to switch certain actions you have to be prepared to take advantage Cal has owned the last two minutes a s nothing run sees the Golden Bears up by four Music Lee D stolen away banged off his knee poopy Miller and a travel before Chuck Harris could put it up theres just something not clicking for Andy enfields offense usually they are so well they play fast and they like playing fast but yigu kind of gave them a rhythm that was slow down just a tad right so they could play two and through him its a little bit of a different tempo for them see theres cber cobbert with that with that hedge Matt cross SS out the rebound Music Miller he will initiate the offense two and white and youre right Debbie just maybe not as quick fire not as powerful offensively and its stolen away Ola Joseph battling with Miller will go Cs way just a little hesitation or just um you know making them Cs doing a good job getting back in transition so theyre making them hesitate think a little bit you want to be free flowing in transition up and down the floor I mean both these teams run the floor so hard a team that averages 83 points per game SMU in a threeminute scoring drought now credit cow they have not made it Music easy black sure pulls the trigger cant hit it I dont think thats the shot right there and then Ola Josephs going to pick up a foul on a reach Music in this lineup on the floor for Andy Enfield now has Matt cross at the four four hes moved between the three and the four all season long Andy Enfield says he prefers him at the four Miller that rims out no good nothing will fall for SMU right now A storing drought nearing 3 and A2 Music minutes black Shir spins kicks Campbell Music Petrus lost Applause it and ASU misses another layup your outlet to your five guy who pulls up and shoots the triple and transition well nothing going for the Mustangs right now they have missed five in a row a scoring crowd near four minutes and they Trail by four at home Music we Music for Cal here in his home state of Texas he hasnt missed hes got seven points and thats what he averages little loose change right here scoring in transition and then how about this little shot fake long a short close out and he sticks the triple and its a big homecoming for him hes proud of graduating from the O Bridge High School 45 minutes away in the Arlington area they brought 40 students to the game he said including family hes got more than 50 people rooting him on and his high school teammate Mitchell Holmes plays for SMU red shirting this year for the Mustang so a school divided tonight but its petrius who is led the way for Cal he told us Debbie I loved this I want to be the Josh har of college basketball do all the little things that dont show up in the Box Score I call that a right side of the box score kind of player he showed up in the box score tonight too leads Cal with seven Wilkinson Off the Bench misses that long rebound Falls to Campbell lot of quickness on the floor look how spread out five out looking for a cutter or a driving lane patrus launches the three too much on it and another offensive rebound blackshire lost his footing there just a slippery spot on the court o going to wipe that out how does SMU get going offensively Debbie they have now gone 4 minutes and 31 seconds without a point I think this is a possession where they got to get three sides move the ball instead of just going to the first action or the second try to get to the third right here and see if you can get a match up that you Music like theres a switch and Matt cross rolls blackshire down to the block they clear it out for him really good call by Andy Enfield he knows the switch is coming he calls the switch and puts cross at an advantage with a smaller Defender Applause Music Wilkinson right down the lane missed Music it and now a chance to take the lead from the corner no good BJ Edwards thats his sweet spot too the right corner hes been money from that spot so Matt cross sets a screen gets the switch hes 67 blackshire is 511 its a big size advantage and a nice clear out you see everyone else from SMU just clears it out and lets him go oneonone cross for the lead no good smus getting good looks Debbie they just cant knock him down in this first half yeah but thats the thing right there theyre getting good shots and you know they lead the league in field goal percentage in threepoint percentage theyre the top scoring team so you play the percentages there Im Im impressed with Cal playing without sto yakovich and without Soko yeah battling and the other thing is if youre SMU okay you youve shot poorly in this first half youre only down by two you are right in this thing Harris hits it SMU back in front thats situational offense and right now in the enfields team has been excellent on atoss and on 400 congratulations to coach young that gets their ACC record to four and six and remember not anything that these two teams need to worry about the but the bottom three teams do not make the ACC tournament this year for the first time you do not want to fall below the cut line and have your season end without playing a postseason game and thats U is still in the hunt for a top four seed which is the double Music bu Wilkinson hes not shy but tangled up with cross and its another turnover eight turnovers in this first half for Cal and taking Mahoney out of the game I think Cal just got a little bit smaller they might match up better right now with with SMU tallest player on the court right now for the Golden Bears is 67 Miller left it off whether is intentional or not Keon Ambrose Hilton puts it in and he hasnt scored in the last two games so hes providing a nice punch Off the Bench good kick to the corner Wilkinson cant knock it down itll stay cow Music ball poopy Miller doing a great job getting a piece of the paint dropping it off for Ambrose Hilton amb Ambrose Hilton last year has an SMU record 64 from the floor get shots like that close to the rim and the officials overturn their initial call so SMU ball here leading by three Matt cross they go they go clear out for Matt cross again this time he makes a really good decision he didnt have an advantage shoots the three and hits it Matt Frost has ignited the SMU offense here now he gets rewarded for his decision making not forcing it on the clear out in the iso you got to keep moving without the ball and he did a really nice job Cal on a 5minute scoring drout its allowed for for a 10 nothing SMU run Mustangs with momentum petrius Tangled Up crosscourt pass finds blackshire pull up Pop Goes Music begging another play by petritis DJ Campbell been quiet Wilkinson this time nothing but the bottom of the net for the freshman both teams battling on the glass too Jay making extra opportunities on the offensive boards and cow will hope that can get Jeremiah Wilkinson going he was just one of his first seven before that made Applause Music three Ambrose Hilton steps out not usually his shot another offensive rebound wide open three hell make you pay Chuck Harris drills it see right now Cal cant keep SMU out of the paint and its setting up their ability to spray it to the weak Applause side Harris is senior thats his third made three of this first half as SMU leading by six under three minut remaining in this first half Campbell on the drive rolls off the rim no good Miller pushing the pace thats what bopy does best the trailer cross got Applause Music it Matt cross off the last time out has played in the iso and has moved without the ball he gets rewarded off a penetration to the paint the skip to the weak side he buries it this time in the trail he does a great job boopy Miller of push it to the Baseline it opens up the top of the floor 163 run SM United this Mustangs offense that leads the country its scor well and in that 163 run he provided eight points so I I would expect Andy Enfield on an offensive possession to go back to mat cross Music a 163 run for SMU has opened up their largest lead of the Music night usually Cal one of the better teams of the ACC of getting to the foul line theyll go there here but they only have three attempts from the free throw line in this first Music half a gymnastic coming your way in the ACC Sunday afternoon eighth ranked count top 10 gymnastics team for the Golden Bears on the road at NC State in Raleigh we did look it up it is at Reynolds Coliseum that was a debate that our crew was having at lunch uh this afternoon thatll be a quick turnaround for the crew in Reynolds Coliseum theyve got the womens game on Monday alyo Caro endo right on Q I think Andy enfields bat a th off time outs and situational offense they have the momentum here as we head towards halftime it is all SMU right now and take another look at this I mean this is just a welldesigned play misdirection to the strong side great pass by BJ Edwards Music Cal just has made one of their last 14 shots they are struggling right now offensively Wilkinson much needed make there from The Freshman will you miss dakovich in situations like this 19 points a game one of the top scorers in the ACC and you missed a Soo from a rotation standpoint now Mahoneys getting some extra time hes a very good threepoint shooter hes made he made two threes in their last game hes a pick and pop four or five they got to find a way to get him free cuz he can shoot Music it know where cow was so effective without out their leading scorer Tonight is their defense setting the tone and leading to their offense theyre keeping SMU as Bay as the Mustangs have found their offensive flow and Rhythm its been difficult for Cal to counter punch well on Synergy smus best scoring options are in transition 118 points per possession for doing this right here so if you cant score on the other end youre playing in transition the whole game thats smus game smus defense needs to get a little bit of credit here because theyve gotten a lot of tips and deflections theyve been active on this end of the floor more active than what Ive seen on film without yigu right because hes a drop coverage guy clogging up the paint around the ACC area theyre playing a little bit more extended and a little more active in the passing Lanes even though coach Enfield told us they like to play in the gaps heres lee d the hammer at home ran into Matt cross whos called for the foul cross is begging his case yeah he thought he was vertical at The Rim see when you run when you hedge soft hedge lateral hedge whatever it is you got to have rotation somebody to tag on the back side thats cross hes late getting there hes trying to claim he was vertical the official in the trail made that call Applause Music Rus petritis checks back in for the final minute of this first half hes been the biggest bright spot for the Golden Bears on the road here in Dallas see I think the way SMU plays with the last minute right here I think they can get three possessions but Cals going to come with some token pressure try to slow it down a little bit I dont think anybody could slow down bopy Miller right on Q buries the three how good has bopy Miller been for SMU and Andy Enfield I mean we were talking in the break he looks more explosive than last year and he definitely was playing with a lot of confidence Jeremiah Wilkinson in attack mode off to DJ Campbell and SMU almost had another turnover wil goodon you know what I like the shot choice because they had rebounders under the basket and I want Wilkinson taking Music shots this is a good offensive substitution right here by Andy Enfield to put Matt cross back in the game and he has a use it or lose it timeout and he elects to use BS Zachs a good young coach Andy Enfield was singing his Praises good change to the Zone sorry today got 7 Seconds here at the end of the first half another alleyoop attempt and a foul called with 33 seconds remaining they go to Zone and thats a tough call right there I think he got him in the face thats why though you had pointed it out earlier you know Zach Chu and Andy Enfield and this coaching staff they were perfect out of timeouts whatever SMU has run out of a timeout in this first half it has led to points thats why Im sorry I interrupted but I like the switch to the Zone because you had to have two plays in that finishes the first half with a Chuck Harris Miss he had three threes in the first half at SMU takes a 10point lead into Music halftime trying to ISO Matt cross again this is a a set that they have liked in the first half and petrius is going to pick up a foul Music Andy Enfield SMU head coach told us that he felt his offense has been farther along than his defense but it was the defense that ignited the first half surge eight steals three blocks although they turn it over there and Cal opens the scoring in this second half a change for Mark Matson they trapped that first pass out of bounds and it allowed them to get the turnover the easy two maybe Cal using the SMU Playbook good defense leads to easy offense thats what they got there Edwards tough take follows his own Miss and cleans up his own Music spill Wilkinson poked away and it falls to petrius hes seemingly in the right position on the court every time he has played well and its sort of ironic without sto yakovich how the ball is moving and what a role petrius has played in elevating his Music play Edwards hits it again backto back baskets for BJ Edwards again SMU off the bouns having no problem problem getting two feet in the paint against Cal so the first set they take Wilkinson off a curl and they get a tip and deflexion this time they run him into a a cut to the strong side and he doesnt have anything really loading up to him defensively as SMU and rejected on his way to the rim trayor got a piece of it now four blocks in this game for SMU trying to cash in on the other end to no avail the trius with another rebound hes doing it all for cow without the two best players for the Golden Bears available tonight St yakovich and Soko Music 5 Seconds to shoot Wilkinson pull up pop off the Mark Edwards kicks it out Harris not that time he had three made threes in the first half though it was a good choice though cuz he had Cross or Harris and Harris because of that the threes he made in a first half I thought it was a wise decision to kick it to him Music D trying to back down cross turns around puts it up and in its a patient pivot on the inside by Lee Music Dort cross not easy to back down at 6 7 230 Music Music Harris trying to shake free and the floater Falls thats a beautiful move right there really good job of reading the Music D black sh the blow by but no finish up ahead Edwards SMU starting to run and Gun this is when theyre at their best Applause the Mustangs have opened up a 12point lead Good Help in the Gap blackshire drills it much needed for Cal blackshire doing a good job stepping into it sixth year after 5 years of Grand Canyon play in the ACC Matt cross cant answer on the other Music end blackers a guy that can heat up quickly just made that three passes it off here calls his own number again and that rattles in backto back buckets for Joon Blacker Music Applause So Cal cuts it to seven five minutes gone by in this second Music half cross attacking petritis shot clock down to five the foul called against Reus petritis well Cal not going away no Andre toy yakovich no Mi Soko and theyre battling Chuck Harris at SMU Mustang still in control with a sevenpoint lead 1440 remaining in this second half but you never know I mean North Carolinas gone in there the last few years and this I remember being in the building Theon night that North Carolina ruin coach Ks retiran Music party anything can happen and we just showed you Joe lard ESPN bracketologist has Carolina last for in obviously a win against number two Duke on the road would bolster their resume in a big way SMU also on the bubble they are next for out according to Joe lonardi a ninepoint lead which would improve them to seven and three in conference play Cal not making it easy though Golden Bears without their top two players and I think theyre getting good production SMU is at their five position without yigu theyve played a little differently on the defensive end and I think its made them you know more active theyre theyre energetic and theyre productive with this lineup Yus usually in drop coverage theyre doing some different scheming on their ball screen coverage under overhead strap ice Jam switch drop theres only eight different ways you can guard a ball screen with some variation what was that nothing but net tomorrow night following a double header on acc Network theyll take you through everything you need to know in the world of ACC womens poops Im still trying to figure out what you said under overhead trp ice Jam switch drop eight different ways to guard a ball screen with a variation there I love it and Mark Manson was telling us that cows used to play you know in the Pack 12 where everyones dropping SMU theyre not dropping theyre running and gunning another rack ATT attack off their ninth steal of the night this is SMU basketball at its best they are one of the highest scoring teams in the country they tilt the floor and theyve done that here in the second half their defense has generated opportunities like that at The Music Rim Dallas into dunk City his defense certainly looks like hes generated these opportunities we were talking to him today about that how often do you think about that 2013 run at Florida G coast and he said he he he rattled off the whole roster where the guys were what theyre doing right now I mean he stays connected obviously and thats part of why you get into coaching is so you can impact an in inluence the lives of the young men that youre dealing with on a dayto day so its rewarding for a coach to be able to go down memory lane like that now year number 14 is a head coach those first two at Florida Golf coast probably still most recognized for that historic run as a 15 seed trying to get back to the big dance with SMU in his first season here in Dallas 13point lead against C here foul on the floor D gets some position on the weak side and then you see Ambrose Hilton loses his balance and falls on the back side of Dort and Christian Tucker pulls it out for Cal now launches into the attack Campbell lines up the three no Applause good think at Mat cross just going to roll Wilkinson down to the Block its good recognition theres the double Edwards good ball movement but no finish thats an adjustment the first possession of the game we saw Cal double the low block looks like thats what theyre doing right now in the second half petritis got it back to a 10point game 1220 to play SMU balance scoring again and thats been their recipe all season long Harris Edwards and cross all in double Music figures offensive rebound cross trying to dig it out Wilkinson he is winning the 5050 balls right now what a pass a bounce pass full court and that three was halfway down but did not drop well they put so much pressure does SMU on your transition defense Campbell weathers goes up count it plus the foul and Cal is right back in it and one opportunity coming to make it a sevenpoint k Cal pushing up the floor making the extra pass Campbell with a finish and one coming back Andy Enfield he doesnt want to settle for the NIT this season they feel like theyre good enough to make the big dance right now in Joe lardys next four out theyve got to worry about closing out this game to Cal the Golden Bears on a mini run to cut it to eight poopy Miller back into the game for SMU as well as toet dorer Endo steps out and connect on a triple theres that hedge on the ball screen 10 steal of the N the steel and the Music slam I think its a big deal I think its a big deal the way theyre playing and their ball screen coverage its just giving Andy Enfield and his crew another layer to their defense another offensive rebound hammered home Lee Dort with Applause authority weve had a bunch of Rim rockers tonight between these two teams watch the Hedge right here good hands by Colbert he does a great job of getting the steel and then flushing it at the other end usually theyd be in drop coverage so they wouldnt be out pressuring that ball screen action I like it and Mark Matson told us he was looking forward to playing Andy Enfield in SMU because of that drop coverage thats what his offense is used to playing against coming over from the Pack 12 instead in the ACC theyre used to playing that hedge style and theyve struggled with it in times this season so instead Andy Enfield goes into his bag of tricks and says hey well well press out well hedge and its led to a season in high 10 steals tonight and its not just the pressure in that particular ball screen action its the way theyre rotating out of their hedging on those ball screens theyve been on Music it ACC PM right here on acc Network every week day four Eastern with Mark Packer the legend Mark packer he was talking about this game today we were walking out of Moody Coliseum after shootter around and pack was giving you everything you need to know as Music always two possession game 10 minutes remaining in regulation poopy Miller been quiet in the second half hits that there so strong off the bounce I mean bopy Miller really pounds it when hes going to the paint his first bucket since halftime restores an eightpoint lead for Music SMU Wilkinson trying to shake free cobbert doing another good job look at cobbert hes a better shot blocker at The Rim as well he is active on the defensive end fifth block of the night for SMU to go along with those 10 Ste culberts going to love his film session tomorrow because he has been active on both ends of the floor but particularly on the defensive end 48 seconds to work with on the shot clock for Cal have to get something in a hurry here got to get the ball in and a timeout granted right before a 5second violation was about to be called well the justing basketball smarts and Savvy around the world of Hoops not just worry about his team I mean he knows the league he knows the ACC disappointed he cant play oh he wants to be out there in the worst way 3 seconds to shoot blacker goes up with it cant connect po chases down the rebound launches right into the Music offense cross a deep three Music misfires foul on the floor on the rebound called against Lee Dort remember one of the things that Andy Enfield said to us today at shoot around was we got to get to the paint and play off two feet that was a perfect example right there by Edwards to the p paint the logo area playing off two feet and being able to make a play on balance Cal showing some Zone on this out of bounds play stays with the SMU underneath their own hoop after the Mustangs were six of 12 from three in the first half 0 of six from three in the second half that looks like it went off matross last wont review it right now with nine minutes still to go in this second half SMU shot 50 from three they havent hit one in the second half theyve gone inside BJ Edwards has been the Catalyst hes got eight of his 12 points in this second Applause Music half good ball movement Tucker cant connect and bopy Miller again all six foot gets the rebound goes up the court cant finish it though o quendo wide open in the Music Music corner D fails to get the rebound put up ahead Endo runs it down cross the trailer wide open SMU now has missed all seven threes theyve taken in this second half jovon blacksher will have two at the foul line when we come back 10point SMU lead getting to the paint all night against the Cal D good footwork on the inside to finish well Ive been impressed with smus defense and their ability to get tips deflections and 10 steals from five different guys so theyve been active Andy Enfield told us they like to be in the gaps but they have been aggressive on the ball bringing two to the ball getting tips and deflections and looking to turn that defense into some offensive transition points I mean everybody wants to talk about smus offense and for good reason they Le lead the ACC with 83 points per game but 10 Steals and five blocks its been the defense tonight for the Mustangs that has been the story and an offensive foul call so after two made free throws Cal has cut it to eight and the Golden Bears get the ball back to your point about SMU you have to be able to change the rhythm of the game and theres a lot of ways you can do that Cals doing that right now they come with a fullcourt pressure theyre looking to make a play on the defensive end its a really nice job they pick up the foul on bofy Miller now theyve got possession in front of their bench this could be a big momentum shift C trying to make it a twopossession game Music here DJ Campbell been very quiet shot clock down to five has to hurry Campbell into the lane Off the Mark see door is open in that short roll off that aggressive hedge on the ball screen cover they could hit him and play out of that they get numbers immediately when you get into the short roll heres Matt cross mismatch cross with a 4 in height Advantage working on Campbell this is why you got to have all Concepts in before conference play begins this is a concept that were seeing Andy Enfield go to with Matt cross and that is knowing he going to get a switch with a smaller Defender and they have isolated him multiple times tonight battle for the ball cross got there and wanted for SMU how about the hustle for Matt cross shot clock down to eight Edwards finds Miller heres bopy two on the timer pull up pop no good offensive rebound Edwards has it dork got a piece of it and itll be SMU ball underneath their own hoop when Mark Matson so animated over there really fired up his guys hes really working hard to encourage hes been all over the court too its hard to miss him right hes got a huge wingspan over there the opposite Andy Enfield very quiet head coach for SMU he told us thats by Design though that ball was halfway down and did not drop little bully ball right there on the way to the rim although enfields getting animated right now too but he he told us I dont like to raise my voice you the son of two teachers mom a sixth grade teacher dad in Middle School Edwards draws the contact this is a lengthy SMU possession thatll finish at the foul line sticking with Andy Enfield he told us how much hes enjoyed coaching BJ Edwards a transfer from Tennessee only averaged three points per game last season playing for the VA said he came in timid and has seen the confidence grow throughout this season and weve seen it tonight hes been terrific yeah you called him his best defender hes second in the league in steals behind Chucky heer at Lille SMU welcomes in Stanford for the third game of a triple header right here on acc Network on Saturday Virginia Tech Virginia at Florida State BC SMU regains the 10point lead six minutes and 30 seconds remaining here in Music Dallas dor really doing a good job of slipping out of that SC training action knowing that theyre going to hedge they just havent been able to hit him on the roll or the short Applause Music roll Bor trying to spin his way free and he lost the handle and its a turnover maybe trying to do too much down there on the Baseline well Andy anfield also told he trust poopy Miller in moments like this hes already hit a couple of gamewinners this Music season blacker gets the better of poopy there you talk about playing off two feet that was a going full pace and then stop and pop batted out cross couldnt keep it in play and SMU has missed their last five shots its allowed Cal to stay within touching distance here shot selections been the issue for SMU in those five shots I think they got to do a better job this is where were getting to winning time Jay you cant have game slippage so you you have to have strong habits on the offensive end Music Campbell spins his way free missed him kept alive but no finish patrus couldnt put it in from the Music doorstep this petritis again with a great hustle play short arms the first one but earns a trip to the line uh he told us I want to be the Josh Hart of college basketball thats a Josh Hart play right there currently leads the NBA in so many categories but my favorite is loose balls game thats hustle right there thats all out hustle got a double double his second this season he told us I got a rebound well he has done that tonight and a chance to make it a twopossession game and he does smus lead is down to six DJ Edwards has something on his shorts see if they got address Music Music Music Edwards allowed to return to the court SMU playing without boopy Miller lead down to six Zone no theyre in man show Zone stay in man Chuck Harris is cooled off after three threes of the first half going inside and a chance for a three the oldfashioned way count it plus the foul for Chuck Harris not only does Andy enfields offense take advantage of mismatches on a switch but they stay busy on the weak side so it takes help away so you cant rotate anybody over to help when youve got an an inverted guard posting Music up Harris leads all scorers with 16 the lead back to nine for SMU almost an 11th steal of the Night by SMU will stay cow ball underneath their own Music hoop give and go blacker cant connect and once again patri is making it difficult on the glass it will be SMU ball picking up full court pressure here SMU can burn you when you do that well they the way they pass and theyve got plenty of guards and you worry about backside scoring when you see pressure they have so much threepoint shooting remember theyre the second best by percentage in the lead unconventional and it almost led to an and one I think Colbert was just is trying to bounce it off a cal player caught underneath the hoop instead it found Ambrose Hilton who was fouled weve mentioned Cal missing sto yakovich and Soko but SMU without cement yigu their 7 foot2 freshman Sensation from Turkey whos missing tonight with a shoulder injury youve said a couple of times Debbie how much him being out of the lineup has changed the way SMU plays not necessarily in a negative way either yeah no I think its adding layers to your defense right I mean theres other ways that you can change the Rhythm you got eigo who goes ball screen drop coverage to having Colbert and Ambrose Hilton on the floor who can play ball screen coverage in a different way theyve been hedging all night Music see there there right there is a hedge and then a recover good tag on the backside good movement in rotation defensively by SMU blackshire good look cant hit it under four minutes of play SMU at 10point Music lead heres St Music cross contested three Miss fires cross the rebound puts it up and in thats the extra effort by Matt crosson staying in the play theres been multiple times hes had the iso couldnt find the Rhythm and then passed it back out and moved without the ball and got rewarded for it and how about this SMU has not made a three in this second half but it has not mattered theyve done a great job on the glass the defense has been excellent and theyve got a 12point lead Music Music Music Music from five different guys theyve been active and productive highly efficient on this end of the floor and its allowed them to transition quickly the other end theyre plus seven on the glass they have held Cal to 32 from the floor that is a team that we talk about the rhythm of their offense but the defensive Rhythm has been fantastic in their ability to play at actively and play deep into their bench and I think when you look at SMU and what the committee will ultimately decide for the NCAA tournament theyre right on the bubble where they sit right now 20 games in is their offenses NCAA tournament quality but Andy Enfield says his defense has not been as far along as his offense if his defense plays like this the rest of the way this will be a te see a team you see in March Madness suffocating pressure were talking about steals Cal pokes one away Wilkinson finds petrius who puts it in this is what you call playing with a sense of urgency right here Cals got a string together a couple of stops to get in a row poopy Miller back into the game for SMU Chuck Harris whos with the leading score for SMU tonight with 16 draws the foul and the Mustangs are in the bonus so Harris will go to the line to shoot one and one to your point Jay you mentioned that SMU second in the league in threepoint percentage hasnt made one in the second half but theyve done a better job calaz running SMU off the threepoint line and Harris hit three triples in the first half Music Ill put you on the spot as we were I was just talking about NCAA tournament aspirations for SMU you do the tournament you do a great job for CBS do in the tournament in the first and second round is SMU a tournament team do they pass the it test I think so I I think so because theyve added layers to their defense to your point before you know we talked about the rhythm of their offense and what a highpowered offense they have theyve have seven different guys that have been able to get draw fouls on Cal thats thats impressive as Cal hits the Triple A big three and another steal off the inbound and it goes off patriss foot so itll be SMU ball big three from Wilkinson to cut it to seven SMU needs to stretch this defense out like Ambrose Hilton needs to stretch stretch all the way to the Baseline on the other end and they got to cut hard to the basketball I love the pressure that cow is bringing right now with a sense of urgency now they have not made it easy on SMU 2 minutes and 20 seconds to go and Mark Madson team is come out here fighting on the road without their top two players available hold on a second theyve ruled it off but tried to but from that angle right there Im not so sure untra UNF flappable is Goofy Miller too Applause quick and with Harris and Miller SMU has tons of confidence in their back court closing out games Harris draws another foul that would be a great job of getting Wilkinson on your hip and keeping him there hostage dribble or putting him in jail whatever you want to call it really well done very well executed by Harris I might think a little token pressure here by SMU off these free throws cant let Cal get a running start going the other way number five Harris a perfect four for four from the foul line tonight 83 on the season poopy Miller coming out of the game putting Goran back in for a little more side on the Music perimeter Wilkinson trying to hunt the shot passes it up they feed it to Dort on the Block and he draws contact the door a 60 free throw shooter you got to be ready to rebound here if youre SMU Music poopy Miller going to come back in the game to handle the Applause Music press number two Andy edfield doing a little offense defense right now with boopy Miller putting five guards on the floor to handle the pressure Dort misses petrius tried to poke a hand in Music there a minute 30 to go SMU an eightpoint lead you got to get a stop right here if youre Cal you got to really dig in you dont want a foul and you got to finish it with a Music rebound heres Matt cross been terrific tonight night a scoop to the hoop and mat cross 15 points and 13 rebounds for SMU Wilkinson the immediate answer and one opportunity for the Music Freshman give Cal credit this team does not go away Wilkinson not having the best shooting night but makes a big play right here and one high off the glass maybe shaking off a cramp tell you what he goes one speed and that is fast uh he is fit in in this game both of these teams going fast tonight its funny both teams Pace has been fast and yet the game has been slow one particularly in this second half well both teams below their typical shooting percentage Yeah so a lot of possessions off the rim Andy edfield team has done a really nice job on the glass tonight 45 rebounds to CS 36 and theyve done that without their 7 foot2 freshman center cement yigu Music and Cal has been without any timeout since the 927 Mark in the second half SMU has two and boy Miller can restore a 10point lead with this free throw Music Wilson trying to get some fluids in giving the coaching staff a thumbs up to get back in the Music game you could use a three right here you need one time not on your side cam that thought it was a double dribble instead blackshire fires the three cant connect up ahead Applause Edwards and he is fouled and will shoot Music two so SMU will improve to seven and three in ACC play Jeremiah Wilkinson and Cal gutsy effort without their top two players on the road but will come up just short here in Dallas well Wilkinson coming off that careerhigh 30 points in the last game against Miami and OT just nine here tonight hopefully stovich and Soko will be back soon for the Cal Bears and for SMU their home stand continues on Saturday with Stanford coming to town through a little Zone that last possession Andy Enfield their offense was good but really the story for SMU tonight was their defense you look at those upcoming games for SMU you got to take care of business at home Stanford pit wake all coming to Moody Coliseum good opportunities to pick up some resume wins and bolster that resume particularly in February for a team sitting right on the NCAA tournament bubble I think their efficiencies have been good tonight their defensive numbers are going to be something theyre going to enjoy watching and film tomorrow you mentioned it at the beginning the last time they played here was a blowout by Louisville they rebounded in their win in the last game against NC State on the road and they played well here tonight after giving up 98 points to Louisville last time in this building they hold C to 65 the defense set the tone with a season High 10 steals to go along with five blocks 76 65 the final
