and like we saw Georgia Tech Miles Kelly Jayvon Franklin stars must shine this is the opportunity for those stars to have those Supply performances that lead their team to the next round survive in advance its that time of the year the Eagles will go without the most improved player in the ACC today the big man Quinton post who averaged 15 points nearly six rebounds it is an uphill challenge for Earl Grant they are not as good yes it changes everything they play through him hes ahead of the snake defensively they lag a little bit rebounding but most effect especially how they run their offense and their actions Louisville and Withers control the ball the cards are in red El Ellis and down low right away Huntley Hatfield turns and will draw the foul Jamel Spearman Bill Covington Jr mark schner on the whistle here in Greensboro Jaden Zachary draws his first itll be the first on Boston College and the Tennessee transfer Brandon Huntley Hatfield who averaged about five points and five rebounds in ACC play with scoreless in the start Saturday of the regular season finale in Virginia goes to the lot and the first one is good this Louisville team the struggle has been well documented losing four straight eight of their last nine four wins two in League Play heres all Kenny Payne has to show for the work he has done Huntley Hatfield knocks them both down a quick check as Louisville slips into some pressure of the Boston College lineup Makai Ashton Langford well keep an eye on he and Zachary explosive pair on the back line puts a lot more pressure on those two West having not your your anchor in Quentin post down low these two are going to hunt Theirs to get to be aggressive off to bounce pursue stuff in the open floor thats what Boston College is at their best Becker staff the law McLaughlin couldnt finish sophomore had it Bound Away and here are the cards with Ellis good spacing to play over the top from the box and get that look for the Post entrance early take into the lane and slapped out of there looked like Ashton Langford got a hand on her heres Zachary look at this give and go the passing drill and fast break with textbook yeah I wish Bickerstaff would have held on to that team made his own play played into some contact paralysis by analysis if you will Wes underneath and Bickerstaff a tough shot s covered it up nicely teams protecting the goal early on a lot of deflections playing at The Rim nothing coming easy Applause Jordan Louisville can do play free and faster today right thats all they should be and Coach Paynes done a good job of keeping them in that mindset look they dont feel like the world is coming down upon them he stayed positive and for that reason they should come out here and play basketball McLaughlin against Huntley Hatfield and a field goal and all four Louisville points belong to the 610 sophomore Brandon Huntley Hatfield and clearly theyre making that one of their offensive options here early on hes got the link hes got the strength and he is challenging McLaughlin early on and winning bicker staff got trapped off the dribble and now 10 to shoot for Ashton Lankford not a lot not a lot of movement very easy to defend right now that is a win for the Louisville defense not challenged at all standing in place Jane Zachary taking a challenge three Withers lost it on the way up against the Freshman of League Bay Applause here is the Freshman from Minneapolis Prince of League base three and itll be McLaughlin giving BC a second chance Bickerstaff the Baseline stop Music BC on the board almost three minutes in Applause trainer on the bounce to Huntley Hatfield hell turn with the right hand and score easily McLaughlin went down the whistle at Huntley Hatfields this is where Western Miss Quinn post thats a seventh that provides just a tad more resistance than what the Big Fellas seeing so far down low on the catch I mean right now just kidding whatever he wants is Brandon Hunter Hatfield and a whistle off the ball and I believe theyre going to ticket saw Jalen Withers itll be his first first on Louisville and there is Kenny Payne 56yearold native of Laurel Mississippi now the head coach of this alma mater terrific player terrific coaching Ledger and now the head man McLaughlins three just his sixth of the Year by the way George hes got a very big ceiling I think as he develops a comfort with that jump shot a versatile piece that can defend by Zinda what coach Grant likes to do hes a Boston College piece theres Withers it rolls out Music Applause rebound for Bricker staff and the Eagles now trailing one with the ball and a hand check foul out on the perimeter against the redshirt freshman Mike James thatll be his first and the second on Louisville and there is Earl Grant who we cant say enough about the work hes done we talk about bringing your own juice into an environment like this these teams playing on the first day of the tournament I look at a group like coach Grants you know theyre going to compete for 40 minutes every time they step on the floor thats a part of building culture when you take over a program Zacharys three rattled out Cardinals for basketball Ellis wants nothing more than to do this right here and draw a foul thatll take us to a timeout Louisville with an early onepoint lead behind Huntley Hatfield Music well Louisvilles got a 65 lead just better than four minutes gone the first half and we take you inside BCs locker room with the second year head coach Earl Grant we should be sweating were working we should run it we should we should all right so you got to get after the dignity and proud we talked about that look your teammate in the eyes and lets be true to alcohol lets be together and everything we do Applause Jordan I just like the approach always have now the success is starting to follow you know what I my what my ice go to the eyes of the players yeah is it resonating with the guys that hes talking to you see a lot of times coaches give you all that Gusto but theres no buyin all eyes were locked in on Coach which means its a collective buyer its after the rebound off the LS3 Ashton Lankford left open and knocks it down its big team that only gives you about six threes per game if Makai Ashton likes Langford can get some of those going it bodes well for an offense it can get stuck in third gear PC to a twopoint Edge you gotta get Huntley Hatfield back down low on that block McLaughlin has showed an inability to defend that Withers a long three and one and done again are the cards you see too much of this happen an offense that has found a solution gets bored with it and does what the defense wants them to do take a three Louisville also struggles from three theyve had consistent success with Huntley Hatfield down low get the big foul of the touch have to shoot bicker staff got it blocked out of there by Huntley Hatfield so not today nope trainer off to Ellis heres the dump inside kicking the corner James a three Mike James 35th three of the year he had 24 Saturday at Charlottesville in the loss of Virginia hes a scoring option a double figure threat good ball movement allows for the clean look and dare I say a little bit of momentum and Rhythm being discovered by this Louisville office yep McLaughlin hates to shoot quickly for the Eagles in this possession Ashton Lankford and it is a three another one for Makai and all of a sudden were trading the lead back and forth here thats a 30 threepoint shooter I mean youre not mad at it necessarily if you can test but what did I say in the beginning stars got to be Stars its got to elevate his game offensively inside hard take trainer will draw the BC foul here just I I love the movement here you know just a little delay dribble Lost in Translation Makai Ashton Lankford hes able to just catch and shoot then here not much in terms of pick and roll defense right there very soft in coverage it didnt even look like a drop coverage as much as a disinterested coverage and allows him to bang down another one for business trainer the free throw Cardinals shoot under 73 in conference play at the freethrow line as you see Chaz Kelly the third come out a freshman from Houston into the line of Pharrell Grand along with CJ Pena so here comes another big off the eagle bench to try and compensate for post nothing and its not gonna be good enough lets just be very clear I mean this most improved player in the conference first one in Boston College program history what we weve seen though that Makai Ashton Langford highlight of Threes is a disconnected group defensively that sometimes he with the effort sometimes they communicate sometimes they fight through but theyre the 14th worst defense in a conference because they lack that communication La pass what a ride you see that Louisvilles gotten into their bench as well 11 is Fabio bacelli the 64 freshman from Orlando and also Kamari lands with the ball there as a freshman from Indianapolis and Sydney Curry is also checked in the big fella to replace Huntley Hatfield and Cindy Curry should be another guy licking his chops down low hasnt had the season he had hoped maybe this can be that breakthrough game on a low block trainer for Lance all right Kamari lands left it on the front rim for CJ Pena the welltraveled CJ Pena by the way theres a lob and catch and a layup McLaughlin at the other end hes got five defensive mental lapses Boston College taking full advantage opportunistic in the open floor Louisville failing to communicate and identify a guy getting back in transition Eagles up three Applause vasilia bounce pass and this is curry and an offensive foul on Sydney Curry its a little bit different when Huntley Hatfield takes that and lowers the boom and hes strong entirely different scenario with big fella Cindy Curry does it theres a players boom and then theres a city Curry boom mclach in a great position off himself up to the basketball gods in that sequence you know youve had Louisville through the regular season I have as well every time youre around Kenny Payne he wants his guys to play free and play Fast right yes when they stop and start trying to sort things out thats when they get themselves in trouble he doesnt want those ball Stoppers he wants space Perpetual movement Cutters he needs to get some Shooters in here for the offense and he wants to run hell get there but yeah he hates the ball stop it yep here is Kelly trying to work on basily and with jazz Kelly threw that over the Louisville bench does Nolan Smith give the basketball back as the question well Nolan Smith of course his dad was one of the alltime great players at Louisville Derek and Nolan of course terrific at Duke and on the bench for the Blue Devils for years he flagged that down nicely thats a national champion and one heck of an assistant coach associate had that makes this this staff special yep trainer heres James again routing around and thats Demar Langford on the assignment 10 to shoot and heres Lance Matson moving his feet defensively to try and keep Lance from attacking made it a tough shot Curry tried to tap it around reset a fresh 20 now for the cards trainer and a foul on Kelly thatll be his first its the third off BC Eagles have got a threepoint lead eight minutes in game two of the first round of the New York Life ACC tournament well a year ago we were at Barclays Center in Brooklyn and we watched Hunter Couture go wild in the championship game Justin matzah exclamation point for the Duke Blue Devils now Virginia Tech wins their first ever Atlantic Coast Conference title now remember the Hokies werent going to dance unless they got that AQ as the seven seed there you go we see him up there in 2016 but whos the seventh seed entering this one thats knocking in unless they probably become an AQ or at least get to that that would be the University of North Carolina they can do it now they can do it Wes dont get it twisted it has not been the season that the Tar Heels have wanted it to be that crew can can bottle it up here come together maybe go on a run a special one here in Greensboro what a story that would be well well see the Hokies of Mike young tonight against Mike gray and the Fighting Irish in our last game of the first round here in Greensboro and theyre hoping to send uh coach pray on to the next Endeavor those Hokies coming out here at the mission thats a tough matchup for the Irish itll be a good one tonight well what an emotional scene you had last week at uh Purcell Pavilion theres a foul on the drive I wasnt crying you were crying Wes put me out there last time heres a look at the bracket and of course the New York Life ACC tournament continues all week on the ESPN family of networks and you see Virginia Tech and Notre Dame tonight at seven oclock Eastern here on acc Network Virginia Tech another one of those teams could be very scary down here threepoint lead for Boston College and Demar Langford on the back down trying to set up Lance now got caught inside and kicker staff could not finish it and here are the cards with a Chance lands with Ellis masilli is the Freshman from Orlando weve seen some more playing time as the regular season is wound down for the cards theres Ellis he is still scoreless in this first half Second Chance Vasily couldnt find it Mets in the rebound for BC got to be honest Curry on that rebound Id love for him to get right back and attack the rib two lacks a day school giving it to the cutter youve earned that rebound sometimes its big thats your only chance of the basketball go make a play but more importantly be aggressive with it Madison Ben shot Score first bucket for Mason Madsen from Rochester Minnesota transferred from Cincinnati and his averaged uh running about five points in conference play for Earl Grant and its B scene its so drastically different here open up the game oh for five and have turned it into six of nine from the field here as of Lee yeah halfway through this first frame the Eagles have kind of settled in maybe to a little bit better Comfort level than Louisville no question trainer running hook a little old school JJ trainers got his first basket from the floor trainer one of one of those guys with great length at the Wing Spot could be versatile against Virginia that length was disruptive from a few of those six seven six eight wiry sinuy long guys for the cards JJ trainer had eight doublefigure games or five double figure games in conference play 16 in the win against Clemson and he had a double figure game at Duke and theres a foul on the perimeter facility draws his first trainer at six eight gets the defender on his hip protects the basketball from Harms Way and elevates and extends has that angle thats a winning play from JJ Trader Junior fifth foul on Louisville has come back in the ball game McLaughlin weve got Ashton Lankford Zachary and Matson for Earl grants Eagles thank you McLaughlin Ashton Langford returns it right back to Devin kick out Madison and a rebound for curry Louisville just four of 13 from the floor here in this first half two of the field goals belong to Huntley Hatfield by the way who has come back on the floor for Kenny Payne lets see if Louisville tries to knock some high low here with the two bigs playing off of each other maybe they can find some offensive success there are only one assist early on into this game theres another guy they need to have the pilot light lit for and a foul on Aston Langford and if theyre going to activate him theyre gonna have to run him off some screens a heavy dose of those picket rolls where he operates at his best to come off the bounce and hit the midrange or get to the rim but youve got to try to get him involved more yep two on Ashton Lankford and here comes Jalen Withers into the ball game for Sydney Curry now this is where its got to be a little bit of L Ellis but then Huntley Hatfield as we talked about that early success wow nice bounce pass Withers the easy bucket Louisville to within one Applause McLachlan puts it inside Matson to catch second field goal for Mason Batson pinned him with the back screen allowed Madison to cut right through the teeth of the lane wide open for the easy Lane and thats gonna be a block on Ashton Langford thats his third all right this is just too easy right here Jalen Withers olig Bay was not even paying attention got tied up on the screen and able to get one then here on the other side oh he just slipped it just a slip from Madison I thought he used the screen actually just slipped a good read how do you play a bit of a dice roll by Earl Grant doesnt pay off here you have Ashton Lankford on the floor with two Jordan he picks up his thumb yeah thats definitely a roll of dice and it all goes back to Quentin post right yep you dont have that offensive presence out there with Quentin out still with the ankle injury you got to roll that dice in a bit him hell sit probably the remainder of this first half I would imagine youre right yep heres Ellis on the Drive Huntley Hatfield recovers hell draw a foul Ellis is still scoreless these are shots he makes no question there was one he came off the ball screen on left side of the wing pullup Jumper in Rhythm the release point was weird it was it the delivery was off and he missed that layup in traffic hes at his best couldnt convert there either got two shots for Huntley Hatfield on the Boston College foul uh first one rattles out dont forget Sunday night nine oclock Eastern right here on acc Network the ESPN app a full nothing but net mens and womens selection special breakdown the brackets preview all the games Kelsey Riggs leads the show Luke Hancock Carlos Boozer Joel Berry Muffet McGraw Kelly gramling and more Im sure its my kind of party right there its got the fist part from Luke Hancock hes ready to party his March the legendary Louisville Cardinal can he get up here and get some shots up for the cars Minister mop yeah I wonder if we could set a screen to free Hancock a league Bay a link made a fascinating piece yes he is talked to Coach green earlier this season about him and he said guy has a chance to be great not good to be great and thats a little taste of what he can deliver for midrange I tell you that he is one of about three young guys on this roster for BC three rattles out from James where Player Development in year two and into year three could be really critical nailed it you can check so many boxes he can guard guard multiple spots on the floor he can shoot it and put it on the deck physically he can Rebound in traffic presents a lot Applause Music Lamar Langford back in Ellis down with five to shoot James tried to dig in no Fall Away pretty shot from DeMar Langford for his first basket and now Boston College starting to find some offensive Rhythm let me tell you that was no no no until it became yes tough shot made from DeMar Langford back from illness Baseline jumper knocked away and last touched by Louisville so Boston College Jordan has kind of found some some options here offensively some easy some tougher right some versatile pieces too a league Bay pulls up handed his face for midrange book it then Demar Langford with the fade away gets it to go well there is plenty of conversation about the ACC postseason Awards Ill tell you this it was arguably one of the most difficult voting processes in 20 years you see of course Isaiah long Player of the Year Jeff Capel Coach of the Year philipowski runaway for Rookie of the Year Reese Speakman defensive player of the years Nike sabandi plays here tomorrow the Sixth Man of the Year and of course Quentin posts the most improved player in the ACC but not playing tonight because of a sprained ankles suffered in the Georgia Tech game on Saturday of course you see the foul trouble for Machias and Langford Jayden Zachary is scoreless from the floor and inside McLaughlin missed the layup Huntley Hatfield bothered it but now point tomorrow Langford going to give the Eagles another chance here inside the league Bay and thats what a league Ben do he identifies l smallest slight frame is defending him put my hiney on him back him down get to the place where I can offer that up in a painted area high IQ execution from the young guy lead eight for BC and a travel called on Louisville its just coming easier offensively for Boston College at this point the 10 field goals seven assists to convert those 10 field goals meanwhile its five field goals on two assists for Louisville yep cards got to get Ellis fired up here dont they they got to find ways to get him the bat hes got to want to go get him like he has all season wall Zachary on the drive and a block will be called on the aforementioned Albert Ellis III itll be his first and final six just was never a position right here wasnt a position to guard quite frankly on a catch from Jayden Zachary and James Zachary toughminded to fight to get to a spot to draw that whistle Zachary was a freshman transfer Junior College played just one year at Junior College went to Chipola in Florida where he played for Donnie Tindall and a year ago Zachary was a 10point scorer conference play and hes right in that neighborhood again and ah there is Mike young get your popcorn ready huh no question Zachary hits both free throws eight nothing to run here by the Eagles Boston College gonna like to go a little bit of pressure here lead is 10 for Grants team remember Earl Grant just didnt go up there and get the tshirt in Brooklyn a year ago he went up there won two ball games and nearly nearly beat Miami thats right to go to the semis Music played back to back overtime games after a racing pit in the first round by 20 and stripped inside and now we got a shot clock violation and I think Louisville wanted the foul his trainer got raked inside but no whistle there and some of that full court pressure actually voted well for the Eagles there short in the shot clock right Louisville got laid into their action at the time they wanted to attack El Ellis straws to double by the time he dumps It Off its a shot clock violation so good execution there defensively coach Grant Squad Jazz Kelly now the Freshman from Houston wearing double zero operating the offense here for BC Applause and unforced air there Lankford just turned it over hes got a capitalize here if youre Louisville cant get it going into half court youve got to be opportunistic when the Open Floor opportunities present inside five to go James on the drive the leaner and I believe were going to get a block onto bar Lankford itll be his first 18th foul all the eagles for the most part look Louisville you know theyre going to try and get downhill theyre going to lower their head and try and get into the painted Area Credit to the Eagles perimeter defense theyve not allowed much there theyve showed true resistance theyve made that meet a chest Ive been pretty impressed with what theyve been able to take away albeit from a Louisville team thats struggling I get that four for James Bickerstaff back for Boston College McLaughlin and Langford well take a seat for the Eagles Mike James is a guy who had he been available at Louisville a year ago probably would have impacted the cards in that 1319 campaign he ruptured his Achilles in October 21 and was lost for the campaign boy they liked everything about him though bright future for him too hes another one of those high ceiling guys no question got five here in the first half lead is eight for Boston College Zone provided by Kenny Payne Steve so you got a Flash and thats honesty where Prince is best being that mid post at the nail guy the most vulnerable part of that zone defense thats got to be a Personnel switch get a league Bay right there at the ACC logo and let him break down that defense read and react built for it trainer tees one up bodies down underneath the basket Bill Covingtons got a whistle and lets see what we have here Music theyre going to send everybody to the benches here I think theyre theyre gonna say is that bigger staff caught up there I think theyre going to look Jamal Spearman whatd he tell you George I couldnt see if the shot went off in time before the foul theyre taking a time out here so we will uh step aside come back and look at it well see if Louisville got the benefit of a three and a foul next Music well nice piece of work for our officiated crew here George because two sequences going on at once first of all were going to get the three and that is a trainer with the three balls JJ Trader gets the three ball to go now watch the low block Huntley Hatfield going head head to head there with TJ Bickerstaff theyre gonna call TJ Bickerstaff for the foul so that puts Huntley Hatfield to the freethrow line for a one and one potential for a fivepoint play yep first one good for Brandon who quite frankly buoyed Louisville early then he went to the bench and Louisville kind of lost a little bit of the Rhythm and I think theres a disconnect with this Louisville offense because Al Ellis has not gotten activated correct scoreless on 005 shooting and because of that theyre searching every time down for how are we going to score it when typically its llis dot dot dot we figure out what we can to fill in the blanks seven nothing run by the cards on a fivepoint trip changes everything absolutely one possession game all of a sudden for a game it feels like the Eagles have been dominated right yeah but to Louisvilles credit they forced nine whistles Matson into traffic Pena the three and nicely done on the box out its a good block out of the withers yeah sure was all of a sudden the cards have a chance here Ellis still scoreless heres James hard drive on Matson He will draw the foul Mason madsens first 10 now on Boston College there were two shots coming anyway for Mike James dont forget Saturday afternoon some of the top lacrosse teams in the nation highlight our triple header on acc network of the ESPN app Kayla trainers got Syracuse hosting Notre Dame presented by Ally and then well go to the mens side number one Ohio State visits coach cargen in the Irish there you go shout out to Coast Corgan absolutely and Notre Dames first family Lars Tiffany in Virginia hosts Towson another great day of Lacrosse here on acc Network credit to Mike James as we talked about the redshirt freshman in his ceiling what he has done right he has applied that offensive pressure that has warranted the whistle several times here early on he needs to continue that aggressive approach Louisville team that doesnt shoot it well they got to get into that painted area hes been the lead call in that operation solve a 10point average average 12 against the league hes got seven here in the first half and Pena gonna get charged with a foul how high did Withers get up yeah elevated to ground that one and again going back to the physical play this contact takes him to charity strike for two got up high not a clean catch Pena in no position but still elects to foul and you got to think if youre paying you that foul 94 away from the rim the other way does you no good and now its scoring altitude let me tell you about the welltraveled CJ Pena here Jordan here started his college career at Taylor University in Indiana where he scored 1148 points in three years pretty good then he went to Trevecca Nazarene in Nashville one year right at Trevecca division two 20 points 10 rebounds everybodys going to Nashville yes they are but he played basketball there so he spent three schools and yes hes a beneficiary of the bonus year so yeah I mean smart move yeah smart move 100 run and this thing is tied at 25 Withers has formed and L Ellis is scoreless and this is where the link in that zone Louisville could have some success but great move there for tomorrow Langford to get into the painted area play off of two cerebral execution 2725 heres Huntley Hatfield dumps it catch layup trainer method on the front rim paying you out of there with him trainer didnt know what he wanted to do hell fit her finger roller always elect to go with the former McLaughlin bothered by Huntley Hatfield cleaned up Withers cards hurry they may have a twoman Advantage here is Ellis to the basket and hes on the board that is huge not only because it puts Louisville in the into Thai ball game but it gets their star going an easy one for LL is gets him to see the ball go in the basket and now your leader is engaged offensively other end of the floor Withers draws the foul itll be his second but boy nice swing pass Withers gets it crosscourt and theres just a gap perfect Lane seamless Applause Music two shots for Zachary 81 percent on the year Boston College is just three for three at the line its Saturdays home loss to Georgia Tech eagles only took 11 free throws over the final day of the regular season from Louisville Im sticking with the Zone allow their length to provide a somewhat of an advantage there defensively for a group thats the worst defense in the conference right those are facts yep Applause Zachary early up into Ellis defensively now heres Withers another run to the basket and gets the roll its tough yeah it is difficult shot its harder to defend Maybe Applause Langford heres McLaughlin look at this inside little fellas to work hey hes got that in his game James Zachary is known to post at times hes a physical guard it doesnt have great size but he doesnt physicality to him something that L Ellis lacks Advantage Zachary on on the Block twopoint lead 100 seconds to play in the first half Ellis back inside and one whoa tell you he needed that bucket in transition he just needed to see one go in and now its back to the old L Ellis degree of difficulty in traffic amongst the trees high but how about Jalen Withers with the finishing in the painted area this is a Louisville group thats now getting downhill and over McLaughlin does a good job with that offhand shielding McLaughlin Away From the Block and generates an angle to finish so 31 all and L Ellis the 12th best freethrow shooter in the ACC to the line five fast ones for L Ellis I probably should have mentioned to you before we got started here every game Ive called in conference has been a close one this year so nice buckle up partner Dave OBrien and Corey Alexander wrote it to the final second why shouldnt we I am no damn bother I wouldnt even pretend to be thats a legend but I at least delivered good ones on the floor when Im sitting in this chair okay I cant promise that part all right Mark it down with 110 to go in the first half Payne is shooting BC cannot find the basket Louisville up one and here is Ellis spinning into traffic foul on fade away and Pena beats Huntley Hatfield to the bounce Applause a league Bay long two and the rebound pulled away by trainer its just a low percentage opportunity for elite Bay to just dribble dribble and settle us Kenny Payne gonna use his user to lose it 30 here final possession of the half coming up next you dont know who I am I am well you see BC the 10th seed Louisville the 15 and whos waiting on him seventh seed North Carolina see if they can find the magic dust the Hokies had in Brooklyn last year and the Tar Heels are on hand there is a former National Champion thats Sean May by the way Jordan Shawn may is the man yep I just dont understand why Ive been confused for him a few times here I dont I honestly dont get it yeah but if I was able to change lives with somebody Id take Sean May yeah Ill take it its amazing how many people have seen Jordan cornette and think its Sean May you got the haircut and everything hey if Im ever going to get a chance to sign an autograph in Greensboro thats going to be my Lane Ellis cant finish Huntley Hatfield spots it 11 first half points for Huntley Hatfield and that hit the back of the rim but DeVille takes a threepoint lead to the locker room Louisvilles ability to get down downhill the driving lane from Ellis that kind of Drive begets an offensive rebounding opportunity for Huntley Hatfield who got the game started the more aggressive team has been Louisville BC now playing on their heels well and the cards who close times in the first half and they go hes letting it come to him hell Alice is taking nine shots how many shots do you guys take in a game I dont even get it its unbelievable clearly youre talking to Hancock I mean those are volume guys over there clearly Hancock the directed of the combat Ashton Langford here let the game come to him on nine shots right down low heres McLaughlin VC goes right to the block and the sophomore from outside of Atlantas got his third field goal and theyre going to apply some of this pressure again they want to try and speed this thing up a little bit shorten that clock make well have to figure this thing out with a shot clock winding down it slows you its not a ton of pressure but now you get into your action a little bit later and now youre chasing a clock and a half court Center Withers had a very quiet six points in the first half of the cards averaged almost 10 in conference play Ellis in front of Kenny Payne and a front room Miss and then Huntley Hatfield is going to be called for the over the back and thatll be his first didnt like the possession from the beginning very congested in that mid area mid post it looked like BC was showing Zone clearly there is some confusion from Louisville in that first possession so heres Zachary hes got Makai Ashton Lankford TJ Bickerstaff Prince a league Bay and of course Devin McLaughlin who had the back basket a moment ago for Earl Grant who is 21 at the ACC tournament in just his second year well can add on to that win total boy Zachary oh a little digging dive for the three Off the Mark a league Bay had it lost it James had it for a moment and heres Bickerstaff in traffic and draws the foul a league Bay didnt get the offensive rebound but active chasing to generate a second chance opportunity thats what you want to see from a group that was kind of pushed back on their heels to conclude that first half come out here and provide a fight to open up the second stanza third on Withers second quickly on the cards and heres Bickerstaff whos played 20 or more minutes in each of the last two games after playing only 18 total minutes in the previous two Jordan this guy does not give him a ton of scoring and I say that recognizing hes got his third Point as you see Kamari lands come onto the floor to replace Withers but bicker staff seems to kind of epitomize all the little dirty things that Earl Grant wants to do and they got a few of those guys right and I think thatll be the evolution is adding some more scoring because they are kind of log jammed with those guys you know Pena is kind of one of those guys a league Bay whos got a way higher ceiling but currently serves as kind of one of those guys uh definitely have Grinders and thats why theyre always a difficult out theyve also got a young 611 freshman at nearly 230 pounds and Armani Mighty on the bench who does not play a lot but has the physical skills and the physical set to be a real Player Development piece for the Eagles heres Ellis on the drive batted out of there recovered nicely and stuffed home by trainer against the Zone I like Louisvilles bulb movement which ultimately ended up on a left side Baseline allowed Ellis to catch and drive in when he drives a collapse the defense offensive rebuilding opportunities wait a second how about that one a league Bay I think had it knocked and it carried off the window and went in like I always tell you Wes sometimes its better to be lucky than good oh they released it okay you let that thing off field his second but you know what he did he lost it midair collected it and guided it through so Prince the league Bay who attended the same high school as Jalen Suggs and Chet Holmgren Minnehaha Academy outside of Minneapolis cannot finish on the threepoint trip must have been a pretty good high school town just going to wager that was Suggs homerun in a league Bay they werent bad no whoever whoever beat them all to meet those guys yeah Applause Eagles by one Eagles playing this this extended 23 look and again the way to beat it at that ACC logo on the catch Ellis oh rolls one in on the baseline or your guards being aggressive and in all seriousness thats kind of what Luke and Joel were alluding to you got to be aggressive picking your spots Al Ellis taking it upon himself to be that guy aggressive against the Zone the guy most fully capable of beating him Ellis now seven in the ball game on his third field goal inside McLaughlin between two cards able to push it in nine points for Devin McLaughlin Michael mcglock to post yeah he posts with a passion shows two hands allows those perimeter guys primer guys with sized to want to feed it down low to him winning before the catch seems to play bigger than 215 pounds too three ball Ellis okay here he comes ah here he comes turns and shows Jordan the three fingers as he rolls back down the floor whoa a12 make sure you know Im over here yes sir Ashton Lankford fights through traffic and scores eight now from Akai Ashton Langford and its important to get him activated once more spent those remaining nine minutes out with this third foul gotta get him back in the offensive rhythm of things tied at 41 heres lands on the drive and thats got to count thats basket interference Bill Covington has got a foul on the Baseline and now Jamel Spearman and Mark schner gonna talk the foul is going to be on a league Bay thats a miss that should be in one that was basket interference on the rim while the ball was offered up take a look now League Bay is going to play at The Rim thats basket interference but two shots for Kamari lands Lance is scoreless 68 freshman from Indianapolis and that falls in this is Kenny Paynes first signee this guy right here out of Hillcrest prep in Arizona where he averaged 33 points and 11 rebounds he had verbaled to Louisville before Payne was hired and then when Kenny Payne got the job the first guy was Kamari lands two points for him and his ACC tournament to debut is push Louisville back in front driving is picker staff and a foul on trainer Jordan when Louisville defense are they giving too much on the first bounce question and thats something you got to tie it up but the guys called for L Ellis to put the team on his back West yeah and thats exactly how hes responded oh youre not going to respect me from three Ill give you a threepiece nugget and then Ill turn to Coronet in the crowd and say smooch Music I see some Talent out there on the court on in basketball in his purest form looking for a run here in the Piedmont are you there you go here is picker staff at the line 60 free throw shooter now three of three today this is game two earlier today Jayvon Franklins free throw with three tenths of a second left pushed Georgia Tech past Florida State 6160 so the jackets now move on to meet Pitt we had one of tomorrows second round games the winner of this one will see North Carolina wow what a theres a lob and finish by trainer will that ball the exact place he needed to traitor high points in and punctuates it cards back in front by two action Langford feeds thicker staff missed the layup and now here is Ashton Lankford who cant finish Bakers Tampa third try Huntley Hatfield has had three to four sequences where hes tipped into basketball as a defensive rebounder with his length size and strength grab that thing with two paws out let it go the other way thats on a big fella tied at 45 again Applause trainer and the rebound for Boston College I cant say enough about that alleyoop that degree of difficulty High yep they made that thing look seamless theres McLaughlin nice bounce pass and Zach Returns on Ellis and L Ellis will pay for it with the foul check out the vision here for Mel Ellis this is a threequarter Court delivery eyes up the whole time excuse me just across half court puts it over McLaughlin into the hands and he had his eye on his on his his wing the entire time right trainer goes up and gets that thing just impressive athleticism a vision from the score and play maker and LLS Zacharys got six 404 at the line and the front end Miss for Jake Zachary thats Boston Colleges second Miss in 10 tries today Eagles come in on almost 77 percent as a team in conference play 72 and a half in the regular season little things like the free throws Jordan and Louisvilles had a pension for fouling violating a lot here in the second half could come back to haunt him and a foul on picker staff Louisville is playing with a ton more energy than what we saw in half one yeah I mean you see this all the time last I think teams get shellshocked by the environment its a first day I mean theres that could be a ton of energy you get in that locker room you kind of get a a little bit of a lather and a sweat going you go okay weve got to do this and those teams kind of up the ante in the second half tend to shoot for James Applause trainer of a double team three to shoot back for trainer oh hes open for three couldnt buy it Ashton Langford to Rebound in the sixth foul of the second half of Louisville I like the decision from L Ellis to go right back to trainer because he saw the defense immediately move back in and packed the Paint clean look from from actually dont mind that look to kick it back and take the Baseline three from JJ so heres Boston College now one point advantage and Zachary lets that ball roll all the way into the front Court and now its Louisville showing Zone once again Quick Pass Jaden to shot fake carries the drive into the lane and a seventh foul on Louisville I mean this ones going to be against Sydney Curry were at 14 minutes left in the second half yep weve got a lot of free throws coming your way Mr Cornett yep and well have two shots BC was 404 at the line in the first half theyre now five out of eight at the stripe here in the second half and Earl Grant who grew up in North Charleston South Carolina went to Georgia College in Milledgeville as a player was part of two Peach Belt Conference titles at the division two levels and then has a remarkable coaching pedigree Wichita Clemson ran his own shop College of Charleston did a terrific job terrific at the college foul line jumper James and knocked out of bounds it will belong to Boston College great idea though Mike James flash is right there mid post area saw a jump shot hes fully capable of making had his decision made that he wanted to go ahead and take that shot so Im okay with that thats where that defense is most vulnerable is both sides showing that 23 zonish look so here is Zachary and Ashton Langford and Louisville popping back into that Zone look Music ER staff here is Zachary look at the spin and the score Jayden Zacharys second field goal hes got 10 Zacharys done a masterful job carving it up and getting into the paint hes been the one whos been in attack mode drew a few of those whistles that time gets clean to the rim for the Finish lead is four now for Boston College Louisville lead three at the break 11 to shoot lands a floater offensive foul says mark schner how about McLaughlin doing the little things he saw Lance coming with a full head of steam McLaughlin Elite anticipation and then on the other side swing past a Gamble from Ellis a spin to win against Withers Zachary gets in there for the Finish so the offensive foul on the Freshman lands his first Music eight of them on Louisville seven minutes gone in the second half Boston College who trailed three leads four idea getting Sydney Curry and pick and roll defense try and see if you can get Advantage a league Bay thats an air balloon out of bounds to Louisville Id like a a league Bay gotta be honest more is a four him play at this three hes out of position and I understand why theyre doing it because of the Personnel but its taking away his ability to be the player that he can be Id like to see a midrange low block and occasional look from three but hes out there pretending to be a position that quite frankly hes not right now Jordan he came into the ball game with 44 threepoint attempts on the year and shooting at a percentage of right at 30 percent six to shoot and Withers with four on the clock skips Ellis catches shoots nope and punched out of there last Touch by Sydney Curry so it will belong to Boston College game has kind of gone unhemed a little bit here at both ends of the floor yeah theres theres no real Rhythm on either side but if Im the Eagles Im continuing to be in attack mode because you can earn these unguarded from the charity straight as much as you want here in this second half if you continue to play aggressive Ashton Lankford on it shoots over a screen and Withers the rebound theres a Boston College foul on McLaughlin thatll be his third itll be the third on BC in half two first round action game two continues from Greensboro in a moment Music seven oclock Eastern time Mike Young Who won this tournament a year ago at Brooklyn and the Hokies meet oh theres a man huh ready to rock keep it Loose nothing to lose for the coffee Mike Bray in fact the only 15 seed to advance against the 10 was Bowie Mike and the Irish in 2019 at Spectrum Center in downtown Charlotte when they got 20 points and 10 rebounds from John Mooney to beat Georgia Tech 7871 it offset a 257 knight from Moses right Moses right how about the player he became a Georgia Tech and obviously the career for Irish fans that John Booty Had is this guy that got better every season yep Ill tell you what when you went Bonzi Colson John Mooney you did okay huh yeah Jeff Capel Coach Jeff Capel Coach of the Year Jeff Capel still talks about what he did at Notre Dame against Duke in a conference tournament said that guy was a bear yes he was flat out score yep had attempt to coach Chef cable by the way job well done yep nice to be recognized for the job well done very deserved Applause here is Lance teeing up one and good I like it Kamari lands a 32 threepoint Shooters got his first field goal of the tournament but when you catch youve got yourself in position shoulder square feet set no defense around you become a 45 threepoint shooter thank you Zachary hard drive into traffic nice pass the league Bay for the dunk Zachary is taking control of this second half driving it finishing it drawing whistles delivering it to teammates its been a difference here in the second half Boston College has equaled their paint total from the first half already here in the second half theyve got 12 in each frame and back to a threepoint lead hate to shoot trainer tried to bounce it to Curry left hand Hook is short and Applause one and one coming at the other end because we got a foul on trainer Kamari Lance is sitting here in position defense comes late good looking delivery hell get better as a threepoint shooter which will add to the ability and threat he presents it again that whirly derving likes Wheeling dealing just he he has a game plan and hes not going to beat you at quickness hes just Savvy with how he moves there draws Defenders kicks for the easy layin started time and time again here in the second half Makai Ashton Langford front end of the one and one is good he leads Boston College in freethrow percentage at 88 and here comes Huntley Hatfield back and hes coming for Jalen Withers and so Withers will check out second one from Ashton Langford hes got now 10 in the ball game Jordan third double figure effort in the last eight games for Makai lead is five for Earl Grants team Music deflection at the foul line and somehow rerouted back Dallas and then Zachary stole it Jayden Zachary against lands and swatted tell you what Lance has a chance to be special yep Applause how about the timing here elevation I mean he won that one from the time they crossed that timeline going that way Ashton Lankford oh my goodness folded up between two guys threw it up on the window and got the friendly bounce all right Applause six nothing run for Boston College has pushed it to a seven point lead trainer lands from behind Zachary almost followed that in foul on Zachary Mario Land starting to put it all together but speaking of putting it together Makai Ashton Langford went up and under I believe they call that in basketball the scoop and score as well they do they do and here is Lance back to the freethrow line and misses the free throw so Lance has shown you the ability to make the three the athleticism to block the shot in the open floor and the athleticism to rebound from the winged position and generate Second Chance opportunities freshman incredibly high ceiling is one of the pieces amidst this very steep challenge of rebuilding this program back to where guys like Luke Hancock once had him yep best post free throws seven point lead it stays for Boston College feels like a dangerous time of the game here for Louisville no question no question this thing could inflate the double figures or Louisville could turn around and come back in it Elite Bay to catch this is it thats where hes at and against James cant finish its okay but thats where he needs to Humble right now Louisville may need Ellis to turn it up into traffic and draws the foul Applause so free throws coming dont forget weve got ACC Baseball coming up game of the week Friday night how about Elliott Haven headed to Alex Rodriguez field at bark Light Stadium number 19 NC State Gino Demario Miami squirrel first game of their threegame sets on acc network with coverage at seven oclock Eastern and also available on the ESPN app fourth foul on Makai Ashton Lankford as Ellis misses the free throw with 9 25 to play and another free throw for L Ellis he had eight games of 20 or more in the ACC the regular season including a 30 burger against Miami 33 of them hes got that ability yep Look Away McLaughlin into the corner Madison lands almost able to punch that out of there Applause the lead is still six here for the Eagles Demar length returns missed the layup a league Bay collects and scores but again it was tomorrow Langford understanding I got LL assami I need to play in the post good shots we got good offensive rebounding opportunities and that sequence plays a success trainer three too strong James the rebound tried to reverse it up saved out of there and its Zachary on the run three on one Matson thought about the back out three boy lands did a good job to recover Madison wanted a fan out for three where I thought that should have been a catch take it to the rim inside Zachary and foul thats going to be 10 on Louisville Applause and its all Mike James its his third its been a complete flip of what the first half was it was BC Fallon a lot Louisville winning now the story has changed Irish are stretching in the hallway here at the coliseum in Greensboro the great coach Tony rolinski my strength coach been there for about 25 years Applause free throw by Zachary rims out thats the thing and we will get to that tonight you do what Mike Brays done at South Bend Indiana the impact that his administration has had on the program he took it from good to Great Jordan at a time where it sorely needed it yep you remember what the 90s were for Notre Dame basketball a little bit of a bounce around with leagues and things like that right there was no identity to the program and you knew for 23 years were going to score the ball take care of the ball and win games Huntley Hatfields first Barker of the second half comes on an easy layup great feed from Alice still a sixpoint BC lead that was five assists really Distributing that thing as well as sorry to score it here under eight to go now here in Greensboro winner gets Carolina tomorrow in the third of the second round games and theres a foul on James and that will be his fourth sixpoint lead for BC L Ellis is a flat out playmaker with the ball in his hands we know about his scoring ability but underrated his vision weights Huntley Hatfield says Ill go ahead and take that easy lay of Louisville fighting Music sixpoint lead for Boston College Jayden Zachary gonna go the line but Jordan were getting into some details now free throws are especially with uh two shots on every common foul the rest of the way for BC yeah it was Louisville pushing that aggressive envelope getting to the freethrow line in that first half and BC took a page right out of the cars book here in the second half and that guy at the free throw line is a huge reason why Jade and Zachary posting up driving it pushing it trying to push the pace at every turn and hes got a freethrow line and and drawing a ton of those whistles here in the second half Zacharys six of ten at the line and this is another one hes now missed three in a row and in this half Applause three out of five made the back end you know theyre eight of 15 here in the second half from the free throw line leaving a lot of money at the table yep nine to Fifteen excuse me seven point game Ellis on the drive oh whoa trainer went for the LOB and couldnt convert a trainer could have adjusted and said okay I cant catch and dunk it and I can catch and lay that thing in I saw Cameron corn do it in the first game right for Florida State Jayvon Franklin for Georgia Tech by the way like boss I didnt know Franklin did anything else other than grab 19 rebounds I mean every time he looked my man was grabbing one kick out three Zachary whoa Pena tried to flush it back it spun out and BC somehow ends up with a second chance here DJ Payne is taking it to 230 pounds plays a lot bigger looks a lot bigger four to shoot for Zachary lands defending now Langford shot clock going off and Matson in between three cards pulls it out for third BC chance and makes him pay so it goes live averages fail to locate a block out once okay twice the basketball guys gonna make you pay Earl Grant knows a 10point lead with 6 40 to go theres a heavy favorite for BC basic Matson mad dog give me all three of them the madness upon us Music Music its time to make some magic very quickly up Court gives it to the Freshman of the Year trailer Applause make some memories Make some noise Applause boys tell you what you get to Goosebumps dont you the buzzer beaters of Championship League already in the fighting Seth greenbergs are at the top how about it fdu in the build Southeast Missouri State for Mike Morrill at UNC Asheville done a fabulous job shout out to my man Amir abdur Rahim and the owls of Kennesaw State who go for the very first time thats awesome at the division one level with a terrific win against Liberty on Sunday afternoon well the story of this second half is free throw differential Jordan and second chance points BCs got 11 points on nine second half offensive rebounds and 12 for the game yep Louisville has lacked that fight on the defensive backboard here down the stretch Matson who had the three a moment ago gets the layup Music its the largest lead of the night Matson bangs down that three they respect him out there he attacks the closeout masterfully Devin McLaughlin fouls L Ellis Near the midcourt line so Maxson bangs down to three earlier so then Mike James gets up on him but James isnt in a stance does it close out on him properly and Madison says deuces heres Elle Ellis at the line 63 senior from Durham of course averaged nine points against the league a year ago averaging 171 sixth best score in ACC play coming in but not an efficient guy Beyond The Arc shooting 32 percent so McLaughlin does not need to close out with that Reckless nature and provide an opportunity for free from the charity strike it was noted this is the only true guard on Kenny Paynes roster and that has not changed this year this guy one of the league leaders in minutes you know what Id love to see Wes him come back and play off the ball next year well I kind of think a lot of Louisville fans would love to see him play off the ball next year yep ninepoint game cards got to get stops and then got to get Ellis going again here in the second half very eerily similar to kind of the storybook of the first 20 minutes Jordan Trail double figures found a way to fight back with a 196 run in the last six and a half gonna have to do a better job on a backboard defending the paint and getting some run outs three to shoot BC against wow on the clock down my goodness Zachary offensive rebound here is bicker staff turning and the follow by Zachary on the backside the undoing without question for the cards here is the backboard failure to defensive rebound locate bodies Eagles get whatever they want second chance Zachary now 13 in the ball game on his third field goal skip for trainers three and Pena will run it down in the corner well its a bad defense the worst in the conference the Louisville Bose gets infinitely worse when youre presenting Second Chances and third chances to the opposition and Earl Grant is content to wind the shot clock down on every possession if he can here Zachary runs it up on the glass and one Zachary has been almost with Team cleavesesque if you think of a name for March just a a physicality to how he gets there and how he uses his body creates that space with a little bit of the bump and like all great finishers keeps his eye on the goal through the contact now watch him top of the wing coming from the other side left side his own bar his own teammate Batson almost prevented the put back hes played with a level of aggression that has been unmatched here in the second half he has been the difference he has set the tone Zachary will go to the line trying to finish up this threepoint trip and the 15th point will not become the 16th point 13point lead which feels like a real big wide Gap with the struggles of Louisville at the offensive end trainer Miss time to follow they roll to the deck and out of there with it comes James Mike James back on the floor has now got foreign goal of the ball game and only eight points picker staff bounced it tried to go to a league Bay thrown away heres Ellis lobbing traffic trainer undercut a little bit by Zachary and thatll cost Jayden Zachary the foul itll be seven on Boston College but the Eagles are in command Zachary and BC with an 11 point lead ACC Network basketball is brought to you by New York light well were at day one first round action but oh dont you worry because Thursday the big rigs arrive top seed Miami second seed Virginia the third see Clemson Tigers and the fourthseeded Duke Blue Devils that will be quarterfinal Thursday at the New York Life ACC tournament look its in Vogue to take shots at the ACC this year and it seems to happen last few seasons by the national pundits often but I look at that field and I look in four five six teams that nobody wants to see in the madness nope assuming those six can all arrive trainer hit the first second but also pointingly through for JJ train Applause any of the four I think are capable of winning the event but then throw NC State in the mix throw pit in the middle you put Carolina down there Cinderella seven in the first half I think people want to play Carolina if Carolina Carolina gets into the tournament tell you what somebody flips the switch the history of this event recently let me just this ones gonna be a buckle up situation this week well heres the story a little bit for you on this right you got to remember how the seeds have gone down here in the last few years the seven won the event last year for the first time and they add to it right in the hoagies I mean the six has won the event five times Duke won it in 17 playing four days Jordan right now theyre healthy and I want to give a hot tip to coach Shire the job hes done any other year coach Shire is the coach of the year undefeated at home sweeps Carolina right put together a 20 however many win season and when youre around him and that program you go oh yeah hes the right guy to replace Ken yeah hes got this thing in a good place fouled in the mid Court area theres going to be on Mike James thatll be it for Mike James pay attention to that guy in the right of your screen Nate lashevski capable of going for 30 Id be interesting to see if he has it in the tank as we get ready for Hokies in the Irish out of Jupiter Florida kind of a quiet finish to the regular season for lashesky they called the foul on lands I inadvertently awarded it to Mike James so the foul on Kamari lands is Jayden Zachary comes back from Matson ready for a second free throw what I was going to tell you is the top seed has won the title in 69 events only 32 times since 1974 the top seeds only won it 17 times so youre trying to talk me off my confidence Im just bringing the scope of the event where things get crazy and I you you and I talked about this Ive said for two months Wednesday at noon begins what might be the most competitive true days bounce pass and McLaughlin couldnt finish the dunk no whistle BC bench wanted to foul didnt get it heres Lance a three ball spins out Zachary the rebound nine point lead for BC and Earl Grants teams going to Salt the clock a little here Music Makai Ashton Lankford Demar Langford Prince a league Bay on the floor and there is a foul inside Applause and without the two to go a nine point lead and oh hey now lets check in there they are Joel Berry Carlos Boozer tell you they need security over there yeah they do nothing but net crew will be back after our ball game of course and Kelsey Riggs Point PG maintaining the order 6 30 tonight and also nine oclock good to see big number four in the house hey booze man best dress yep even close its GQ yeah Music Mike James yeah its been a long season yeah hes gonna be a really good player hes got a lot of Great Moments ahead for him sure does and a league Bay will go to the line Music everybody getting ready well bring you Virginia Tech and Notre Dame at uh certainly after seven oclock tonight it looks like here in Greensboro Hokies and Irish Applause two teams and if they get hot could light up the scoreboard could be a drastically expected to be drastically different feel I mean from the game we currently have about two minutes left a lot of the game will be played behind the line tonight yep a lot of skill guys will be some five out facility and then you got leshewski on the other side those guys who are Padula bucket Getters butts Dane Goodwin and Goodwin is a buck again yeah JJ Starling might have saved his best for the end of the season here well stay tuned yep darling did not play in the final what three games of the regular season four games and JJ JJ is lost for the rest of the season okay theres the lob and the catch and layup from McLaughlin thank you for that reminder heres the other part about this with 125 to go and now a 13point lead for Boston College Earl Grants getting ready to go three and one in his first four games at the ACC tournament hes building wow Applause I cant tell you how impressive the two and one Mark was a year ago and hes going to add to it tonight and oh elipe was trying for the no look bounce pass but thats dead it got deflected out of bounds by Louisville yeah the oppositions foot give yourself another possession coach I couldnt catch it I was trying to keep the possession boy or Grants got a good staff doesnt he oh my goodness Anthony Goins Corey McRae Jim bolinary terrific head coach as you know Jordan Music Boston College is going to go to 16 and 16 Music and Louisvilles incredibly difficult year is going to come to an end the league Bay of the layout and Kenny Payne I think Applause thats got five guys at the table but lands the shot were gonna go ahead and get him in right here and gonna put five on the floor here its Ashton miles DeVore and Percy Miller has come onto the floor as has Roosevelt wheeler Devin Reed a 68 freshman has checked in as well for the bill and Boston College does the same Quinn Pemberton is into the lineup hey bataya has checked in Andrew Kenny a senior from Seattle and there is the aforementioned the Mari mighty on the floor we talked about in the first half survive in advance West yep thats the name of the game Boston College the expected favorite here and took care of business in the second half by quite frankly being the aggressor winning on the backboard Second Chance opportunities getting to the free throw line getting Louisville getting into that bonus early on in the better part of the second half and was really in firm control Andrew Kenny with eight to shoot three ball away and good Noel scores Jonathan Noel the younger brother of nerlands Noel out of Everett Massachusetts and Music will be that 8062 and the bench erupts to hug Jonathan Noel good for him a first basket of the year yeah group having fun thats what March is all about theyre going to stick around a little bit longer here in Greensboro and try and play disruptor have a second half like that
