three hes back hes starting and Davon Smith didnt play on Wednesday with an ankle injury hes available to come off the bench in this one and hes been a double double threat yeah hes getting his Playmakers back hes getting guys in Smith that can make plays hes getting Terry back whos a 34 threepoint shooter were talking about making shots those guys will need to step up and make shots today we go the start of a loaded day in the Atlantic Coast Conference Georgia Tech on the road in the Grays they control it with Kyle Sturdivant to add 17 in that loss Wednesday you can see the game playing right away first possessions to attack Burns they know how important he is keep an eye on that DJ Burns has a tendency to bring his hands down when he calls up that time he got a deflection and created a tournament and Georgia Tech is going to shift defenses and they force him NC State turnover Casey morsel out of bounds on the sideline Josh passners group led by Miles Kelly the leading scorer at 13 points per game we told his Sturdivant he scored it well on Wednesday and Jayvon Franklin four and gray he had a very good game in that loss as well he did and even Miles Kelly starting to come out of that shooting slump he had 16 against Louisville theyre going to need guys to make shots again thats the killing heel for this team perimeter shooting and just making plays the start of it Joiner and missed in the midrange and burns gets the rebound down the game is to check out the NC State starters hows Josh passner gonna deal with that big three theyre going to change defense Josh passengers known the triangle ensue to matchup Zone to 23 Zone and one three one mantoman theyre going to change up everything just try to give this team fiction just slow him back listen to the crowd when DJ Burns gets a touch they love this guy hey in my opinion hes The Unofficial mayor of rally you know offense to Murray game Baldwin if she goes to reelection that might be who shes doing shes running against we are looking at The Unofficial mayor right there we will have more on that coming up later in his first half his personality his dance moves Electric Applause the accs top scorer you just cant defend that I mean his range is unlimited when hes making those kind of shots you just tip your hat to him and just just wish him luck theres nothing you can do against that and thats what Josh pastner said to his pregame yeah Burns could get 20 but were really concerned about those guards and if Smith is making shots like that its going to be a long day for Georgia Tech they both are Elite at creating shots and thats was just a guy that can has unlimited range sliding you dont want to see the first one go in like that Kevin Keats is heated he is figuring out which sub to put into the game right now as Georgia Tech had a backdoor cut that frustrated the NC State head coach Russell Scott Im reporting mistake you can tell hes upset with that because you have to keep everything in front they run this Princeton style offense so theyre going to cut and back door cut hes just sending a message early to his team you got to come out and establish ourselves on a defensive end early you cant let this Jordan Tech Team get going early yank Casey Marcel hes got this group at 185 overall winners have seven of their last eight they demolished Florida State on Wednesday late shot clock for Kelly who gives it up got a shot clock violation outstanding defensive execution there even in a big denying that when the Clinton gets a Princeton style they want to catch it low as possible DJ Burns gets up he denies it guards are getting through handoffs just an outstanding defensive possession there lead five nothing three minutes into this one Music theyre susceptible in the corners cant out of the corner finds Smith Wiggles by Kelly and throws up a wild shot and a strip by NC State looked like Dan got his hand on it dark Hill Joyner off the bounce burns the offensive Reba Coleman Captain alive to Franklin finally able to secure it Terry in transition stay patient for two thats where Georgia Tech has to get better at rebound push they struggle in the half court offense right now so if they can rebound and get out and get some transition baskets itll be great for these guys they need to get easy buckets they dont want to sit here and go against half court of course some turnovers like thatll be great Kelly off the pick Applause just careless is with the basketball there you know thats what the 131 does they want you to air air mirror those kind of passes growing up give them time to rotate over Franklin does a great job of getting his hands on that one then a hand check foul up top on Miles Kelly well the ballot might have a new name for mayor like you said more on DJ burns when we come back to Raleigh campus or around Raleigh and would show up because who is having more fun than the big fella masas I dont know anybody you saw that first note the shades he had on earlier what do you think I think we look better in the heater but he wears them well I mean everybody loves them on campus hes a he just has a Magnetic Personality everybody wants to be around him and hey hey hey hey yeah he told us yesterday that the origin story on the sunglasses was of course from the Duke game Christian Reeves big guy for Duke poked him in the eye and so DJ just went through a CVS bought some cheap Shades rocking them and they have made their way around the NC State locker room well that tells me hes superstitious because he started to feeling well and as hes playing well and everybody starts noticing it and you know what and just a credit to him hes just such a great personality playing good basketball they have a giveaway with the shades of course last month here at PNC and hes a guy whos playing so well right now his best basketball this season a week ago Saturday in WinstonSalem went for 31 a career high 23 in the second half in a very big road win and then he followed it up with another good game against Florida State Wednesday playing with a lot of confidence I think the best thing that hes done so far is hes adapted to playing on both sides of the block he used to be a guy that lined up on the other side and as you see there his ability to pass I think hes the best passing big man in any ACC in one of the better passing big men in the country hes a gifted passion and thats why its so hard to double team him right you know against Wake Forest I think is a lot of crowd and everybody was wondering you should you know double them he is not just a passer of the basketball he he passes to the right guy to score and I think thats what makes him so dangerous is the classroom great offensive rebound and stick back from Jayvon Franklin the sixth year senior South Alabama transfer for coming off a very active game Wednesday against Louisville like we said and Josh passner had a lot of praise for him post game on Wednesday seven but he plays like hes six nine six ten averages nearly three official rebounds a game so offensive rebound so thats something that he he does a tremendous job Kyle Sturdivant from straight on drills a three and Georgia Tech powers in front by two the grace off with him theyve gotten Vasquez in transition and theyre making jump shots again theyre mixing up the defensive coverage because theyre active they got a full complemented roster here so this team is not going away theyll play a little better than you expect from a 111 ACC team uh the LJ Thomas Miss into the game off the pack bench Miles Kelly by the way top scorer for Georgia Tech hes still out there with his two fouls he picked up early after Franklin from Sturdivant and Georgia Tech adds out I think the matchup you got to watch were talking about Burns but theyre going to put Burns in ball screens and theyre going to attack him and watch where they catch the ball when theyre able to get into Princeton offense and when they cant theyre going to put them in ball Springs and rotate that time you saw Franklin catch a lot rotation was late just a strong finish there lot from Smith you want to do a really good job defending NC State so you want to keep him in half court you dont want them to continue to score so they can set up their full court pressure confident great quick release there still have been hit the last two jump shots there great sign coming off 17 points against Louisville right now hes an experienced guard hes a customer coming off the bench and starting Burns goes to the spin on Franklin for two just getting to that middle with turning over there you get to that right shoulder shooting that Lefty hook its a difficult shot to get around and get in front of him and hes just so much bigger than Javon Franklin I think hell hell be able to get that shot whenever he wants it was oneonone coverage hes got 61 pounds on Jayvon Franklin thats all how much okay in the midrange but theyre going to pick him on his other end at some point when you have a big like that with Burns he has to be dominant and effective I should say on the offensive end because theyre attacking him right now hes the gameplay every time down the floor Georgia Tech is going to look to put him in ball strange to get a jump shot for a dump into one of the goals Smith off the offensive rebound misses another its Sturdivant goes crashing in to run it down and draw a foul on LJ Thomas so for Josh passner so far this has gone about as well as you could hope because he has lamented the struggle scoring really all ACC season and he has said they need to score in transition if not a little bit of that they gotta have second chance points theyve done some of that as well but theyre hitting midrange shots theyve hit two threes so again theyre seven and eleven right now for a team that struggled to score this team has defended you know their problems when youre so ineffective of scoring a basketball you just wear down and you lose energy and right now they got everything going the hitting midrange shot for getting in the paint theyre getting threes and now Kelly hits a three and Kevin Keats needs a timeout pick up a start on the road for George to Tech up by eight Music Georgia Tech is on a 154 run and Josh passner has said look its been our Achilles heel being able to score this year well no problem so far for the jackets I ended up stepping into it and theyre making shots their plans relaxed I mean you come in and get at the record we just think this team is getting healthy they have their full complement of players and theyre just coming out theyre confident the last thing you want to see if youre a State fan is a team that has shot it poorly come out of hit shots like Jordan Tech has so far this first half you see what Georgia Tech has done making its last six shots and seven of its last eight a game after they shot a season low 30 percent from the floor against Louisville made Seven threes in the first half then went over 11 from three in the second half in that loss to the cards well the most important thing is theres seven of their 11 I mean seven of their 19 points as transition points you know before team theyre struggling the last thing you want to do is give them confidence early you saw Keats go to his bench early and really animated and getting on his team because he senses theyre not ready to play theyre not dialed Into The Scouting Report and thats something that happens when youre playing really well and the team comes in struggling losing a straight you think its going to be easy cake while anything but that you got to come you got to earn it and so far wolf Packer struggled out of the gate foreign clock below 10 for burns backing down from the threepoint line on Kyle Sturdivant and scoring over the top hes just so patient he gets it they have no problem giving him the ball 15 17 feet from the front of basket we call it using an old Charles Barkley move just playing Bully ball dribbling you down to the bank where he feels comfortable on scoring like that thats the Barkley just just volleyball just getting it and just putting you on your hip just like the round Mountain rebound would just get you put you on his hip and just drip it on you cant get around him you cant stop him from getting to his spots and he just gets to a spot elevates open he can do that over anybody in the country Kevin Keats told us yesterday at NC States practice I get frustrated when a big guy takes three dribbles dribbles as Casey morristell six of three but Cottage coaches know hes an unbelievable Pastor so if youre playing against these guys you wonder why your coach just lets him because that and you dont want that backcourt and we just saw there giving up a three you dont want Casey Marcelo to Craven Smith with jaquel Joyner getting threepoint looks Terry with a chance at a threepoint Play Welcome Back Lance Terry theyve missed him so much I mean hes a heck of a shooter now hes getting the ball turning the corner putting Ross on his hip you see guards playing below the rim they cut the angle off and shot the reverse layup Ross could do nothing to foul Gardner Webb transfer who last played two and a half weeks ago against NC State in the first meeting which was a 12 point wolf pack win in Atlanta and Terry is back that game was a very competitive game in the first half they pulled away late the second half but that was a very close game and were seeing why so far the first half of this first game Josh passer loved that they took care of the ball only 10 turnovers especially the way the Wolfpack Forces teams into turnovers but Georgia Tech just two for 21 from three Burns scores again they have no answer for burns inside but States at its best when they can get up and down and they can turn you over right now they got to get back to defending this on this end of the floor theyre trying to put DJ Burns in another ball screen and the fouls on Casey Marcel thats his first difficult I thought he was just being physical and guarding the basketball and you know you put so much pressure on your guards when they play and drop coverage and what I mean is Burns job is to stay between the ball and the basket guards job is to be physical get into the ball get through the screen and Casey Marcels pleading his case to the official like that thats what thats what Im coaching to do Josh Pastor goes deeper into the bench here Jalen Moore comes into the game and Jordan backup enters in the front Court probably the bang with Burns to grab that rebound but I need as much sauce as they could possibly have and burns is really hurting them right now getting that ball right there and hes got 10 points early on wheres my shades many machines back on to watch out I need to hes on Pace for 40 hey putting on a clinic right now hows the vision for you Kelly had it blocked by Marcel whos blocked a lot of shots over the last three games Casey Marcel is one of the elite defenders in his league and just so underappreciated in this style of play but hes a the ultimate three and D guy in the ACC ENT good rebound by Jordan Mecca Sturdivant pulls up oh he is feeling good third three for Kyle Sturdivant he is in a groove right now again hes played well last game following up with a strong first half so far he is filling it from behind the yard senior from Norcross Georgia Burns can hit that as well try to defend them he took he cant tonight hes got 12 quick ones here now hes pulling up hes got to the basket they backed off now hes knocked down a shot he has that in his game but right now hes got to pick his job pick it up on the defensive end as well just enjoy the tech this Georgia Tech team is getting whatever they want and leads by three Tristan Maxwell carved to the bucket got his own Miss lost his footing Gant goes diving the pack has it the lob too tall for jarkel Joyner right see when youre playing against Georgia Tech and you know teams want to deny that high post right there this is the counter to it they just step up and run into a ball screen and so when you play on top now you cant help on the ball screen and the guards are getting to the rim just a great adjustment by Georgia Tech and something to watch as they continue to try to deny that High poster because they run a Princeton style offense so its typically post players at the elbow passing from there and hurting you well getting is so deep catching at the elbow catching the free throw line they want to be able to catch as low as possible every team wants to push it deny it pressure him get the ball up as high as possible Jordan Texan Georgia Tech now is countering that by setting a ball screen if youre denying it big block from Greg Gantz Tech by three coming up on eight to go first half and a carry is called uh Jalen Moore I think the concern if youre coach Keats is that Georgia Tech is really getting whatever shot they want theyre not making the Miss right now when Georgia Tech just misses the shot its just because theyre open theyre getting in the paint theyre getting in the rim theyre making jump shots Georgia Tech is gonna I mean just interstates gonna have to take something away from them and theyre changing defenses now theyre trapping out of this one three one and keeping a wolf back off out with burns on the bench he beat dewana into the game 21 in the creamcolored alternate UNIS Joyner lost the handle and started into the loose ball diving on the deck and Josh pastner will take a timeout Georgia Techs got the threepoint lead on NC State on the road here in Raleigh he is having his weight I mean theres really nothing that Joe detect has shown so far to be able to stop him hes gotten the ball wherever hes wanted hes just such a difficult guard because hes not and he starts knocking down to 15 to 17 foot jump shot and look out you know and this is why the NC State is as good as they are right now theyre not shooting the ball well from the perimeter but then hes the guy thats been able to score effectively inside to give them time until the jump shot fall its why theyre only down three and giving a big the perimeter guys time the backcourt was too talented theyll eventually get it going but hes just been able to give me a great stop Gap but they continue to this is what theyre good at picking up the full court pressure 10 second count ER found I think they call it 10 seconds before the foul lets see Mark schner steps in Jamel Spearman had also been considering a foul and it is a 10 second count and now Josh pastner is pleading his case and has to watch his footing Applause when a whistle blue one called 10 seconds and one call to foul I think theyll and theyre gonna call a foul now after conferring Applause yes yeah well it wasnt quite yet the file was called before 10 seconds so they you know now they call time out they get a new Fresh 10 to get it across but theres a little bit of confusion there on the call but again they call foul they end up siding with the foul prior to the second call yes and after all that its picked off by Brian Passion Smith cant hit battle on the board secured by Mecca those are the kind of shots that I know Tequila has been working on he has a limited range but could have shot near the line and a great block there wow how did Ernest Ross get that on Debo Coleman Applause Smith off the shot big to Ross chance through the contact Ross is bringing a lot of energy on both ends of the floor great job he gets rewarded there on the assist from tarkwavian Smith but the play he made on the block shot the other end comes down run the floor gets himself in a position to score benefits from the unselfishness of T Smith has a chance to go to the line and one its the guy Ernest Ross who not only is bringing energy he is so confident that after the win over Miami earlier this year he said in the locker room we gonna win that Natty Too well live Derek Wittenberg was here Nick that crew of guys into the 83 team thats kind of confidence they had knowing that that backcourt that led that team to a national championship so it starts with confidence you dont need everybody else to believe but as long as you believe tied at 25 Georgia Tech has to be careful with turnovers theyve got seven of them so far Josh pastner said to his pregame they cant be live ball turnovers and a lot of them have been and now they are forced into a timeout well take it with him back to Raleigh in 30 seconds a big double header right here on acc Network and the ESPN app hit Louisville 7 Eastern then off to Charlottesville for the pack against number six Virginia who right now in Blacksburg Trails late in that second half against Virginia Tech who really needs a win thats a mustwin game for the Virginia Tech at home see some of the upcoming games today we told you at the top it is a loaded day in the conference top 25 Showdown will follow our game here Miami at Little John against Clemson and theyre trying to bounce back I think theres a lot of great games in the ACC the Miami Clemson game thats Syracuse BC game is going to be a good one foreign that time he just kept it faking hand off and dribbled and drove the basketball so what do you like around the ACC today we got big games we just showed them to you Miami Clemson who you saw this week Boston College big time win for Earl Grantsburg great win by there those guys its amazing just watch the teams Now teams are starting to get healthy like even this Georgia Tech Team you know we talked about Terrys been out for a game Davion Smith Davon Smith missed the last game so you know teams that are getting help this NC State team does not have their starting four and five man and with Jack Clark and dushon Merchant Mercy hes been out so lets just see who gets healthy and continue to you know finish season strong I mean these games now Road games are already tough but every game matters if you close your resume trying to get into the NCAA tournament and Georgia Tech has a onepoint lead after Jayvon Franklin splits at the strike Music Applause Music Burns right there catching the ball from point of Threes hasnt had a touch yet Smith moves it more cell Rises short rebound start of it thats the way youre gonna attack are you gonna attack it in the Middle with burns with Corner threes like that just gonna get shot just got to make Terry Lance Terrys got a Music Applause Franklins doing a heck of a job of Rim running and is forced a car to take him in transition and they werent able to match up and end up giving up a threepoint shot there Lawrence fires one underneath Terry might have got a piece of that against Ross great pass great find Applause Music Ernest Ross his energy so far in his half hes come off the bench giving this team energy on both ends of the floor theyre gonna need more of that again but right now the game is being paid at a pace that Georgia Tech likes foreign Quick Step on burns Kelly too strong Applause Music Smith fires one in good defense from Franklin a fifth NC State turnover Sturtevant skips Coleman thought about it now back to Kelly Applause Music theyre going to put Burns in a lot of ball screens NC State handled that one well Terry shutoff on a Baseline Drive matched up with Marcel with the shot clock winding down and Casey Marcel is out of bounds along the sideline so it stays with Georgia Tech with 32 to shoot oh theres Ross just comes in from the free throw line no box Ill disguised in and wont get it easier too than that right there Strong finish by Ross whos been outstanding on both ends of the floor hes giving his team so much energy more importantly hes come in and changed the tone put a wolf pack on the defensive end of the floor three seconds off this inbound for Terry couldnt hit sorry he needs to draw the foul he got Tuck waving in the air there instead of taking it off balance shot Applause well defended great defense there Music Applause they have the match up there Smith wants it hes just checked in but he got burns on him I think hell wait for him to attack really tough shot for Davon Smith youd love to get to the rim but Burns moves his feet hes like a dancing bear man he got great feet and he moves a lot better than people give him credit for it and again heck up a job about him on the defensive end against one of the more quicker athletic guards in the league good battle on the boards by Debo Coleman off the Smith Miss hes now one of six from the floor Applause approaching four minutes to go in the second half hits Georgia Tech by two Franklin double delay on your head Ross I mean just a great catch there by Franklin Javon Franklin catching it filling Burns trying to overplay spins off of him drives it down the lane and its because NC States trying to deny that passes so again its so aggressive Music or sell met by Terry a smooth looking shot from Casey Marcel hes as good as there is at three and D great on ball Defender Applause make shooting over 43 from behind the arc and very capable of putting it down one or two dribbles and pulling around myself how about Jayvon Franklin hes got nine points now to go along with three rebounds and three assists as well building off what he did Wednesday hey hes just letting Burns know whatever you do I can do also taking that midrange jump shot there catching a drive man Applause cross the Franklin Applause uh Franklins coming in here catching this ball in the mid post just spinning off going down there taking no disrespect for anybody hes not playing like a 111 team he doesnt care about the records hes coming Virginia Applause talking about the civil rights movement and having social justice is crucial Im here now I have the right to vote all because of what they did in the past that showed the ultimate sign of unity across the three conferences that were brought together it was almost like my own little piece of History here during Black History Month NC State wearing its honoring black Excellence jerseys part of an Adidas initiative celebrating the achievements of black individuals and Black Culture as a whole some really neat looking uniforms for NC State and Georgia Tech not wearing its honoring black Excellence uniforms in this one but theirs are very sharp as well I wonder if we can start getting some uniforms you know we split when were home one were away like some of these words is a nice man get our own number on them you can wear them in your league when youre playing youre feeling creative man Im just you know I got a good nights sleep last night I think is what it was yeah you know yeah it was the brisket from what Longleaf fly its exactly where yeah it was good Leslie I highly recommend it I go if youre here in route you did not get up any jump shots yesterday here at NC State practice though I did not I think my jump shots pretty good I dont need to but if one of us needed to work on one of us didnt could take from Lance Terry he continues to have a great return after missing four games with a hamstring injury and its the jackets up by four with two and a half to go in this half darkell Joyner is still scoreless and between him and turquoi Beyond Smith just three points on the mate three from Smith early on theyve gotten good looks for them I mean they theyre theyre tough difficult shot takers but theyre tough difficult shot makers and right now theyre just not making shots its why you see Burns and why hes so effective just finding him and get him getting to his spots like that thats why I got my shades on for them I mean its DJ Burns party all day long bracket hes just hes unguardable for these guys but this is what hes meant to this Wolfpack team when theyre instructing and making shots and theyre not forcing turnovers hes been the reason why theyve been so consistently good recently because again he can keep things going until the other two gets it going and again Josh pastner is okay with this he said to us today we think we can win even if Burns is going to go off for 20 plus Georgia Tech turns it over here he just didnt want Smith yes and Joyner and Marcel to have big games theyre just too explosive from behind the line and when those guys get it going because again they take shots against good defense and they make them theres nothing you can do when this group is making jump shots thats it you cant guard them chalk it up games over Ross Ross gets it to the ACT thats only his third three of the Season he was two of 14 coming in shooting 14 but again when youre in these kind of games and you come in with the right attitude Off the Bench creating on the defensive end it amazes how things go for you on the offensive end Ernest Ross has 10 points in eight minutes off the bench a guy who averages three and a half per Applause Sturtevant drops it in for Franklin and it swirls out Music good possession there by Georgia Tech you got it deep just wanted me to convert the shot Ross and undercut and fouled hard fall there he fell on his elbow hope hes all right great thing about being young get to bounce up this is this is the key to this game against his Zone theyre vulnerable in the corners for threes and the guards hadnt made it so Ross said you know what get out of the way Ill step up Ill knock it down what a half for this young man told you 10 points for Ernest Ross remember he was huge in that overtime win against Miami Off the Bench earlier this season 17 points and nine rebounds hes a 52 freethrow shooter whats been so effective for him is he hadnt been able to get going in early games Thursday night womens basketball doubleheader Olivia miles leads the number nine Fighting Irish against Pitt at six Eastern and then number 15 NC State against Wake Forest right here on accn and the ESPN app see the lady Deeks can bounce back and get him one at home the Ross has just been outstanding and hes coming in bringing so much activity see now when when NC State scores theyre able to establish their full court pressure but you see the counter there Burns is not going to come up so not many teams has a center that they can use to initiate offense the way Georgia Tech has Franklin defended by Burns dribble head off for Sturdivant around the curl handed out and burns secures the rebound and NC State can hold for the final shot of the half leading by three if you look at the score and were having a great game here Georgia Tech has played extremely well extremely hard to foul to give there against NC State but lets you know credit to these guys it feels like NC States controlling the pace they have a game plan theyre executing that theyre just going to have to continue to find ways to score and keep base with the number one offense in the ACC and right now Jordan attack me NC State is just pushing pushing Pace right now trying to keep this game up into the 80s which is their average of scoring Kevin Keith told his team at the end of practice yesterday first meeting with Georgia Tech we didnt play our best game he told us that he thought Georgia Tech outplayed them in the first half and in this first half tight as well Smith skips Marcel Jacks ahead of the horse Jason Paul salesman dont forget about me in that big three we might have a big four instead of a big three knocking on that three putting wolf back up six just a great look I mean just a great file catches it in rhythm pictures of what they want to do just three points for the accs top scorer turquadion Smith jarkel Joyner Whos fifth in the league in scoring he was scoreless yet NC State leads by six as we open up the second half lets see the cat and mouse game there they got Debo Coleman on on Ross and hes able to beat it up to help Defender they got to provide help its just going to be too easy Debo Coleman trying to block out Ernest Ross but its Coleman who gets whistled for the foul theyre committed to just heading Franklins going to guard them oneonone if we talked about it they got enough Bots Im surprised to see you know he doesnt have any hell Rodney Howards not pleasant played a minute the first half and he he said healthy scratch right now and hes big enough from a physicality standpoint to guard Joyner to dump off the burns you to guard Barnes and there he is again yeah you saw that look at Rodney Howard on the Georgia Tech bench we got word at halftime theres nothing wrong with him hes available to play six foot eleven senior 256 pounds averages 20 minutes a game played 16 minutes on Wednesday against Louisville and just hasnt played in the first half so I will say Franklin does a really good job hes a better passer from that from that high post position so thats a great thing about having him he gives up some size here but again Scotty reported that okay giving that up hes missed his last two theyre okay with giving DJ Burns that hes got 16 despite those misses Hal sturdivin had a great first half for Georgia Tech and he gets the roll hes got a team High 11 such an experienced guy hes playing so well right now for the shoulder Tech Team and hes been living in a paint just getting there off the dribble he hadnt been able to contain him and tonight hes knocking down threepoint jump shots as well Music got some space hits you dont want to leave that guy open there again against the short attack Zone weve said it a million times the corner threes are where theyre vulnerable and obviously NC State knows that and Casey Jose wants to score so he knows to get there fifth three for the pack it feels like four of them maybe have come from those corners Franklin an answer Franklin just said hey doesnt care if he called me 11 points four rebounds three assists and his hands full with this guy credits of the NC States team I mean he misses last two how many teams would allow a guy to miss two and then go right back at him for his third third shot Franklin goes right at him and couldnt score and then weve got a held ball and the arrow will keep it at this end of the floor with the jackets yeah theyre making Franklin bring it up and theyre allowing I dont know if you want to get into it the pace the pace is picking up Georgia Tech is playing well in the offensive end but theyre playing in a much faster Pace thats what pressure does to you you just put your head down and you drive but youd like to see them execute a little bit better on offense and just slow this pace down Kelly spinning by Ross and scoring with the left hand I just think hes such a talented young man that has so much more to give on the offensive end he said hes their lead scorer and for them to pull an upset off here I think Miles Kelly has to get going Kevin Keith told us yesterday at practice that Miles Kelly was the guy who scares him most on this Tech roster he does I mean because hes just has so much size and shot making ability like this guy does hey Smith whos one of seven from the floor one of five from three Applause passion is yelling for his group to get into their Princeton offense and again hes going to overplay theyre going to run a ball screen to get in to get in the offense Sturdivant had it poked Away by Ross Marcel hits the deck and its another held ball so the NC State this time Ross just gets a hand on it and creates the turnover like I said hes been doing we talked about him scoring but the defensive end of the floors where hes ignited the wolf pack foreign ER pushes off and Lance Terry draws the foul on sharkell Joyner Like the Wolf Pack fan not a fan of that call I dont know if he got in front but yeah extends that arm a little bit and thats what gets the call on Josh passner told us earlier this season Lance Terrys their best perimeter Defender so he has scored and he comes back and brings that defense as well it just knows how to play guys like that you pay attention to the scouting report if you know John killed joining likes getting to that right hand and Terry was isolated at the top but just paid attention to start recording Coleman pulls up has a lot to give Id like to see Debo Coleman do a little bit more of that hes so much size and physicality I think he can get to his midrange jump shot whenever he wants has to figure out a way to get himself going in this in this game Applause look at Burns starts outside the threepoint line starts backing down Franklin couldnt get it to go but Ross kept it alive Franklin on the way up itll stay with NC State when we come back and now they flip the call itll belong to Georgia Tech when we come back we promise unless theres another reverse oh running a food pantry can be a lot of work so hows this year gone for NC State their best overall record and ACC record to this point since 17 years ago when it started 71 in November the loan loss to Kansas but ACC play began at one in three in League action since then though a very hot January this team has won eight of its last 10 in conference action and they have a tough schedule the rest of the way down the home stretch at ACC play but you cant look too far ahead but every game at this point in conference play is tough no different than the ones theyre in now but they got three straight road games starting with that and starting at Virginia who lost today at Virginia Tech its just no give me give me wins and winning on the road so far Franklin missed it on the log Kevin Keats said that for the first time in the brief history of squad one two three four he is talking about that with his team before games hey this is a quad core game we cant lose this one hey this is quad one not as many opportunities as wed like to grab those types of wins thats interesting because you know staff talk about it it was just surprising to hear a coach talk to that amongst the players and its but its so true I mean you preferred us NC State team this is like a nonconference game thats a quad four I mean its just crazy to think that youre in conference play and playing in a home game or a road game and its part four its just something that I dont think many people understand honestly I dont know if anybody understands coaches are frustrated by it that they dont know the magic sauce necessarily that impacts it up or down whichever way it goes yeah a Tuesday college basketball doubleheader for you right here on accn in the app hit Louisville 7 Eastern and then the pack in one of those big games in Charlottesville against number six Virginia who you just said they lost in Blacksburg a game that Virginia Tech had to have Tech had to have that game I mean they needed that quality of wind and just like they did a year ago they turned things around in February and made a run to become the ACC Champs and punch their ticket to the NCAA and theyre going to need another to a Repeat Performance if they want to get back to the NCAA days this year Greg Gantz split at the stripe and started it misfires from Deep Franklin tried to keep it alive Applause blocked by Franklin I think he blocked that with his elbow he was so high above the basketball at the time he blocked it I think he stood in the air and levitating and waited on him to block that shot he is having a ball game Jayvon Franklin the sixth year senior Kelly hits much needed threepoint game four communication there on the defensive end between the guards at NC State both went with the guy at the back door cut just what the Princeton offense does if you dont communicate on switches you teach your guys to talk touch and take and they didnt do that and gave up a three foreign kept it alive shot clock done reset Joyner Applause and he used every part of the rim can honestly look good when he left his hand as I forwarded directly to the rim I started to yell out earlier thats good Applause three points for both him and Sir quavion Smith the great thing is its not affecting his defense you see him there good ball pressure surprisingly Keith said he thinks he may be his best defender Casey Marcel is great but when Jack Hill joined is locked in he comes up with steals like that one right there off the pick he pulls up no nice yeah he didnt say maybe he said he is our best defender I think you and I were both surprised by that I think everybody when you when youre defending he starts on the ball but I think Casey Marcel gives you just more versatility in guarding bigger Defenders there he is on start of it Kelly no run down by Joyner he was always so fast with the ball in his hands this is where Burns helps them so much right theyre getting the ball in his hands right there great passer Gantt got his own Miss Terry strips him and Kelly threw it away Kelly had time there to kind of gather himself and pass through a teammate its not the old rule where if youre rolling over you can its a turnover like that burns a low pass Coleman stepped in front and now Miles Kelly connects Music thats two in a row for Miles Kelly and wide open for a young man thats been in his shooting slump hes knocking down shots today and again so the tech team is not going away third three for Miles Kelly hes got 15 points and weve got a threepoint game with Under 12 to go in the second half in Raleigh Georgia Tech LED for a majority of the first half and theyre only down by three here second half and remember this is a team that lost by 43 one week ago today at home to Duke and afterward Debo Coleman called it embarrassing and Rodney Howard started his postgame comments by apologizing to the fans because he had felt they had a great turnout for the game but this is a team that hasnt stopped fighting all season long no thats a credit to passenger and his staff I mean these guys are competing their tails all today they got four guys in double figures led by Miles Kelly number 15 theyre at 11 in the turnover you know as far as turnovers and I think they need to stick around that number and not go above 15 thank you because as you see shots like that for taquavius Smith as much as he makes shots again he can take some really difficult shots in Music so detect does a great job of just executing his sets right now theyre getting in theyre gonna see how they plan to attack you know theyre going to put them DJ Burns here in ball screens Sturtevant skips it Debo Coleman again gets to the midrange and youve talked about him playing inside out yes I think at times weve watched him play so much he settled for jump shots hes too big too physical that he can get to his spots has a really good midrange shots he has to figure out a way to involve himself more in basketball games instead of setting great defense from Lance Terry on Joyner or Sal no I got a foul on NC State getting back defensively they tag Casey Marcel with his second yeah see stay starting to get a little jump shot happy here I would expect coach Keats and these guys to try to tell the guys hey let Burns touch it you know hes playing well hes effective inside they dont really have a matchup form I think the biggest concern with DJ Burns has just been the conditioning of him having to play so many minutes the officials will go to the monitor here we will have a look ourselves looks like Josh pastner maybe wanted that and yeah you see more cell grabbing Debo Coleman from behind yeah I mean he just I throw a flag I guess pass interference you know its a DB running by you cant grab put your hands on him man its a its foul even in basketball Laughter you know interesting thing here were talking about here this we had Bojangles at halftime whats the first as many times youve been in North Carolina that was the first time you had Bojangles yeah are you kidding me am I allowed back Im almost embarrassing to tell you that flavor one foul is intentional yeah I mean its its an intentional foul yep I mean its its thats an interesting call as well I mean they call that foul and we watch the you know we watched the call how its been called throughout the year I know fans are always disappointed in how thats called I mean the flagrant too is when its really done in deliberating intentional but its the correct hole I mean you cant grab somewhere by the waist because you dont run back again in the mens college game theres no intentional foul theres no clear path foul but effectively thats what this is a flavor of one yes and it puts Debo Coleman at the line for two free throws and of course possession as well gives him two shots on the ball and Applause I know Keith doesnt like the call but it is the correct call and someone with the experience with Casey Marcel difficulty shot that corner three and wanted to get back in transition yeah we certainly agree this is the definition of flagrant one and Casey Marcel gets saddled with that Coleman splits at the line Georgia Tech has the ball and we are tied at 52 Midway through the second half that also has a game heres another ball screen theyre gonna put PJ Burns in the ball screen again his job is to stay between the basketball and a basket on all ball screen covers Kelly attacks Marcel got caught in the air and its back to the pack Applause State teams at his best and they were able to get active with their hands and creating Steals and great job there about forcing a difficult shot to pass there all right at this end for NC stayed offensively first one of its last 11 and you say he needs more touches touch the ball theyre getting jump shot happy and when you shoot theyre not a great shooting team theyre just an explosive shooting team and looks like theyre gonna go with another perimeter never a Bad Thing putting the ball in this mans hands Smith follow away he is still cold and burns didnt get a touch and now Georgia Tech Runs Franklin thats why he needs to touch the basketballs because hes at a disadvantage in the transition Javon Franklin knows he can beat him down the floor he needs to touch the basketball theyre just getting jump shot happy and thats not a great shot tarkwaven Smith like as I said before he takes and makes difficult shots and that was a onelegged Runner and I think Burns need to touch the ball instead of just getting to Boston spread out hell find you and let him go to work here he is with Georgia Tech leading for the first time this half more cell back for burns shot clock winding down cant hit and a block by Franklin on LJ Thomas and itll stay with the wolf pack I just plays so big but he knows again his job is be the better athlete run down the floor hes giving up size inside but hes done that several times in a day hes played well on both ends of the floor he had four steals three blocks Wednesday against Louisville hes got two blocks and a steal in this one to go along with 135 and four Barnes hes a duck in here hes settling I think of just being able to dribble the ball offside he can get it as low as he wants the rim and Kelly clears it again hes going away from the basket hed like to see him get something going away but this is what happens when youre a jump shooting team you know you live and die by the jump shot and this is the way State plays and theyre gonna have to continue to play this way until shots go down but the one thing about this team they will continue to defend Franklin blocked by Ross great defensive rotation there by Ross its a really high level play game right now both teams are playing really well Franklin Gamble gamble Burns man at the rim and ripped down by Jayvon Franklin foul just an excellent play Music boy this game so far has gone exactly according to plan for Josh passner Burns can get his gambled that the guards are not going to have the best shot selection for NC State and a dangerous thing right now if your industry State fan is that theres so many theres so much balance scoring here for Georgia Tech we got four guys already invite us foreign State and Tony Burns and Ross that are playing well Georgia Techs coaching staff cannot believe there wasnt a foul or a deflection on NC State I think he left his feet playing for the foul and they didnt call it it he was driving a score there I think he even maybe gotten a call Applause Yellow Jackets by two under eight to go second half here in Raleigh NC States last field goal came at the 1333 Mark turquoia Smith on the perimeter weve got 7 47 to go a good one at PNC Arena come on back for the Finish its bow time leads NC State and Raleigh theyre running their offense and theyre getting open looks but when things break down but you see there Debo Coleman drives the closeout pullup but this is where theyre hurting them in transition they got 150 this game in transition baskets so theyve really been taken advantage of but Burns not getting back in defense and enforcing them to get caught in these mismatches and theyre theyre in this game because theyre sticking to their game plan theyre executing and the most important thing is if your yellow jacket theyre making shots and this is something that faster hadnt had the ability to to depend on all year long you said theyve got 15 fast break points I would have thought that would have been the other way around they have none its a 15 I mean its and again and a lot of that is attacking Burns and sometimes when they get back its forcing a guard to match on Jayvon Franklin and then Terry has gotten threes and a few times another senseless careless turn over there and its a technical foul on top of that maybe Mark schner did not call the technical Debo Coleman and Georgia Tech pleading for it after turquavion Smith got caught in between turned it over slammed the ball I think thats good by the officiating tonight he wasnt showing him up I think he was upset with himself because he created a careless turnover NC state has made one of its last 15 shots Terry wraps a pass out for Coleman driving on Joyner forces one up and it rolls up got his own Miss Franklin kept it alive Kelly got stripped and it stays with the jackets at this end its a really good offensive Rebound in front line by the Georgia Tech and like I said Debo driving in there and you got to keep a body on Franklin hes so active he gets his hands on it now the guards are chipping in team isnt going anywhere Casey Marcel picks up his third foul he was trying to stick with Lance Terry who was bouncing around on the Baseline underneath for Georgia Tech this is part of the game the Georgia Tech needs to be effective as well scoring a baseline out of bounds thats your execution you dont get it and go right into your half court Princeton style offense which will be put Burns in the ball screen here if he overplays his post then make it a ball scream this time he catches it Javon Franklin back out for Terry who had 10 in the first half scoreless in the second and he turned it over Smith in transition Applause Music fast break basket of the game for NC stated how to make top 10 wow start of it shielding more cell underneath Franklin for two and a foul great response get into his spots off the ball screen again finding Franklin wow great job one of the full five by Casey Marcel in the left hand coming to your living room Casey Marcel but great response there by jvon Franklin and finishing him with the potential and one 73 percent free throw shooter this year stamp a threepoint play and the jackets lead by three with under six and a half to go headed back to the one three one the changing up defenses now and again this is where they Voldemort Corner threes thousand Debo Coleman he was jockeying with the much larger DJ Burns I think he tried to get around in front a little bit 14 fouls on each side Applause Joyner here tarkwavian Smith are only two for 14 from the floor right now they need to take better shots Applause Ernest Ross has given a huge lift for NC State Smith no he is still cold is that a shot you like well its not that its a bad shot he he shoots it from so deep I dont think he needs to be eight feet behind a line I know its something that the staff and Joe Justice was working on him with and reminding him that you dont have to shoot it from the logo every time and I think if he did get a little close I think his percentage would be a little bit better but hes just such an explosive Dynamic player late shot clock for Sturdivant Kelly too strong great defensive possession there like possession like this is Joyner attacked the rim and he had numbers four and four in transition defense retreating hes getting the pain foot pressure on the ramp post entry for burns DJ burns with 18 points going to work on Franklin who sticks with him anyway with a flex taboo wheres my shades wheres my shades get the big man in a rock let him know hes flexing on them Shawna this is he burns they got to give him the ball and get him to finish more of his half I just dont think theres an answer to him Javon Franklin theres great defense hes playing for that right shoulder thats where his games improve hes gotten better on that block he used to be so dominant catching the ball on the right post so he can turn middle now hes been a better score on the left lock and hes turned himself into the heck of a player I mean hes a big South Player of the Year and he told us yesterday he didnt notice the biggest jump jump into the ACC at all no you asked him Sturtevant got him off no foul he scores anyway the transitions the theme theyre trying to push the ball team not getting back no excuse for the NC State guards not getting back off a free throw four in double figures for Georgia Tech start events up to 13 the lead is three with five to go killing Jordan Tex has so many attack in so many different ways and right now its not outside of burns its just not a whole lot right now going well on the offensive end for NC State Franklin got another block and now trying to go coast to coast and it rolled off his ability to do that is putting so much pressure because now guard has to match up on him and burns has to take a guard Joyner no offensive rebound more cell in the putback timeout with 4 23 to go Georgia Tech leads by one on the road big finish on the way Music success looks different for everyone succeed on your terms at University of 8 30 Eastern or thereabouts the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the ACC highlights and Analysis of all the mens games and a look ahead for the upcoming week right here on acc Network and the ESPN app and they will be talking about this one one way or another Georgia Techs got the lead by one jabon Franklin has done everything hes got 16 points seven rebounds he has matched a career high with forces and matched a career high with those five blocks please dont Mr do it all right now hes doing everything I think the most impressive thing hes done is once hes rebounding hes putting so much pressure on his NC State team and transitioning theres a big reason why theyre up 172 in transition points which is the biggest difference in this game they got to get it over the timeline they barely threat a pass and Kelly lays it in again Javon Franklin right there catching the ball Middle with a press driving it now many Sinners are able to do that hes undersized he talked about him playing bigger but his skill set is giving these guys you know tremendous boost right now hes just Mr doodle NC state has only scored 17 points since halftime Burns going to work I took my shades off he gonna make me put him back on he keeps playing like that I mean hes just was it deflected they say no its thrown away by Javon Franklin and its a Georgia Tech turnover Josh pastner frustrated one point jackets lead on the road Applause let me show you all the swag I got right here Virginia is rolling Kevin Keats couldnt believe that a game like this in the conference against the team thats already defeated a top 25 opponent in Miami would be a quad four game but thats what the numbers say and Georgia Tech though theyre 111 in the ACC and sitting at the bottom of the conference theyve got a one point lead here in Raleigh they do theyre healthy they got a full complemented roster of guys and theyre playing like a team with a renew confidence and his Tech team is just doing what theyve always done I mean just competing and playing hard in state again the guards hadnt played well but theyre Gamers and you just need to finish the game strong and be interesting to see how the last three and a half goes with Randolph Childress Mike Monaco our entire crew with you Ernest Ross working on the Baseline a cutting Smith and its intercepted by start of it the jackets run start of it at control that pass from Coleman they reset with 20 to shoot NC States really vulnerable in transition defense right now and its Joe detects really exploited that Applause Sturdivant searching Kelly I think he was too open but hes been hes knocked down some shots today but hes playing really well this group is really sharing the ball and everyone on the floor has had their moments and I think thats why this team has been so why is NC State vulnerable in transition d one because thats not Burns we talk about Burns and as effective as he is sprinting down the floors not and Javon this week Jerome Franklin is just better hes a better athlete running down the floor and hes rebounding and hes pushing it hes leading a fast break and its creating matchup problems for NC State Burns heaven and he will go to the line so when he when he pushes the ball a guard has to match up that leads Burns to match up on a guard and they dont want to do that they want to so hes running back to the ball and hes creating this these issue but the way you combat that is give him the ball let him score so you can set your defense after a made baskets Burns at times has struggled from the freethrow line you see for the season 64 percent over his fiveyear collegiate career 62 percent and the other thing is when you started the year you thought he was going to play 20 minutes and hes pushed himself to plus 30s Thursday night womens basketball doubleheader Olivia miles and number nine Notre Dame against Pitt at six Eastern that NC State and Wake Forest right here on accn and at the app yeah the minutes sword Burns it 36 and Counting NC State leads meanwhile Georgia Tech they have not subbed in the second half yes this is the team that bench leads the ACC and scoring and they have zero points from an event and they got another turn over here this is how we see State wants to play the pressure the pace 94 feet of defensive intensity just created another turn over there but if you enjoy the tech youre okay its not a live ball turnover you get to establish a defense which has been effective in this game Applause theyre back to their traditional Zone matchup Zone where youre trying to keep the ball out of the middle but thats acceptable to this corner three Marcel On Cue now when they score like this they get the matchup Tech did a really good job of pushing it even after me Music 70 Run for the pack and Georgia Tech needs a bucket they turn it over instead and Coleman fouls more cell great defensive intensity there by NC State just picking it up on the defensive end for Georgia Tech you got to settle down here you got to get a stop Applause Music there is still 149 to go the momentum is with NC State and Casey Marcels hit the line where he is an 85 freethrow shooter this season and its his first trip this afternoon yeah its hes 85 but its the first one in the last minute and 43 of the game its a big free throw here because its one and one first and hes frustrated Applause difficult when you havent shot many youre not in a rhythm no matter what your percentage is and Casey Marcel missed the first and hes upset with himself about that Josh pastner will take one of his two remaining timeouts well take it as well and then well come on back to Raleigh needs to get your windshield fixed Safelite makes it easy you could NC States got a fourpoint lead now on the strength of this 70 run meanwhile you go inside this Josh passner huddle where do they go for offense because theyve now gone two and a half minutes between points I think you got to go back and put the ball into it I mean Javon Franklins hands and again he doesnt have to to to attack but hes creating off the bounce and force and rotation I think the gallon that they have out there all those guys have had their moment they just need to execute their offense when the play breaks down to set up Offspring and put DJ Burns in a ball screen its been effective form but the surprising thing from them is just a bit I mean this team leads the agency and Im shocked I mean hes constantly rotated guys we talk about him having his full compliment a roster and then he plays Five Guys he has not subbed in the second half of this game but weve taught Davon Smith might play a big role in this one in his first game back after missing one with an ankle injury he played four minutes in the first half and thats it and then meanwhile Jalen Moore talented six foot seven sophomore who scored 17 in the first meeting between these teams hes only played three minutes and then Rodney Howard their 611 veteran big guy hasnt even gone into the game at all no Hey listen its work this game is right here its competitive game its a one possession game I mean two possession game they just got to get a stop there they gotta gotta get a basket here and a stop put the pressure back on NC State but this is a big possession here you said get it into Javon Franklins hands four in Gray he has done everything for the jackets in this one and Sturtevants been really effective off the bounce as well but the ball screens coming took Burns Out defensive sub there putting dawana and Coleman pulls up cant hit rebound Smith thats a shot that Georgia Tech would want there coming out of a timeout Applause big possession here you got to get a stop dont want to foul the drill detect with burns on the bench EB dewana came in for him charquel Joyner and a foul with seven left on the shot clock as Kyle sturdivin went reaching Zorn is just not the guy you want to put at the line I mean hes hes just thank you 83 shooter but hes just really really comfortable and tough in these moments and he wants the ball and its just not a guy you want to put in a line right now its the one in one for jarkel Joyner sixth year senior and hes made 29 of his last 30 at the lot super super soon Applause stays hot hey our next all access the ACC life very special one premieres Monday an emotional Journey with ACC student athletes from all 15 ACC institutions they go to Montgomery and Selma Alabama seven Eastern right here on accm and the end back into their defense hes a shot blocker gives them more defensive versatility for DJ Burns is out of the game right now allowing him to match up Terry around it out rebound Ross and Kelly thousand with 47 seconds to go and NC stayed up by six and Kelly Ross and Smith getting separated by Ron Groover now youre playing against the clock so you got to commit some of those fouls NC States got to make free throws and Georgia Techs got to get theyre not built to play this way they got to get quick shots quick baskets and try to set their defense to get five seconds or foul you can almost hear what Josh pastner will say post game as well if it ends up this way that thats a pretty good look for Lance Terry and he likes that down the stretch and how close they have been and they have led for a lot of this game as well its been a Michael Kors under the season for Georgia Tech just not having the ability to knock down shots and put so much pressure on the guys who are their Shooters like Terry NC State ended the first half on a 100 run theyre on a 100 run right now inside of the final minute of Regulation and Ernest Ross hes been so good today more important not just the offensive end its his defensive intensity and pressure thats just been outstanding and outside of burns I think hes been the best player on the field for state Georgia Tech down eight they got to go Coleman contested no Terry the offensive rebound blocked by Tawana 30 seconds left Coleman connects fivepoint game 28 seconds to go and a timeout so now the good thing is if your NC State fan you just got to put the ball in one of your three guards hands here because Georgia Tech has to foul if he dont get a five second count theres enough time on the clock if youre Georgia Tech you got to set up a full full pressure try to get a five second count if not if you can get a good track and then if you dont get the ball you gotta foul youre playing against as much as the clock right now as youre playing against the team you dont have a lot of time to waste believe theyre having a look at whether that was a two or the three as it was called for Debo Coleman Music well definitely a three thats for sure and then Josh pastner took the timeout perhaps just adding a little bit of time back on the clock it looks like a few tenths of a second and well we got a moment a reminder still wants to come in the ACC including just minutes from now we will catch it a little John for a top 25 Showdown Miami and Clemson coming off a loss they still lead the league and remember Virginia lost earlier today as well so lets not forget about both of our Alma Maters are playing each other today yes has that game gone final no it hasnt it beaks are up 15 late Applause 8164 to Dukes well over Notre Dame over Notre Dame wow big bounce back for Steve Forbes they needed that one after the four game losing streak yeah you gotta foul you gotta foul if you gotta foul Holmen goes for the pick on Ross and there is the fact yeah once you establish the Trap and you get dribbles out of it you gotta foul all right well heres the deal Ernest Ross is five of five at the free throw line in this one and a guy who normally oozes confidence maybe even a little more in this one normally a 52 free throw shooter coming in yeah but theres not much pressure on these free throws youre up you know youre okay with him just making one I mean this is a its a two possession game you know its not the end of the world if you Misses both so this isnt a pressure free throw Tom we just he should be easily relaxed and really hoping just to make one like that you guys you dont feel pressured like the rest of us no its no pressure on him hes you know hes comfortable with that hes one whos played tremendous game right now hes like I said decide to Burns hes been the second best player for NC State today and just this energy and both ends of the floor and credit to him hes deserving a knocking both down just the basketball guys rewarding the player whos played his tail off today he had 17 in the win over Miami hes got 16 today Franklin had to save it on the Baseline seven Rises too strong rebound more cell and hes fouled with 112 left NC State winners eight of their last nine cemented themselves as the fourth place in the ACC start a little slow but there are no gimme games I mean this team credited him they jumped out early on Georgia Tech Georgia Tech has responded played themselves a heck of a game with this NC State team didnt play his best on the offensive end but they competed in the defense again hats off to that man Javon Franklin he absolutely battled for Georgia Tech which emptied the tank now here in Raleigh no reason to hang their heads now they came out and they competed today NC State looking to improve to 19 and five overall we told you coming in by that record and by ACC record theyre having their best season since the final year of herb send them 17 years ago I played against when he was but just got to State and again 19 and five and nine and four in conference play for this team that started one and three playing really good basketball right now on both ends final seconds roll off in Raleigh and NC State State four in the ACC they survived the very best from Georgia Tech today its a great job by NC State just coming out getting the win and credit to Georgia Tech given the effort a reminder still to come Miami Clemson a top 25 Showdown with West Durham and Dan Bonner for Randolph Childers our produced
