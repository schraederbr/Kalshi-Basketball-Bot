Those are thats just awesome And we will find out whether we have one of those tight games here tonight as we will tip things off and follow the bouncing ball directly out of bounds possession to Seattle to start this basketball game The Red Hawks coming in at 3 and one fresh off a convincing win over Idaho State and Stanford a perfect 40 The Cardinal took care of Louisiana 9366 on Tuesday night Cardinal opens and will play predominantly straight up mantoman as you look at the Seattle starting five Maldonado cut off by Benny Geler whos been a great story for Stanford The first shot of the game is a threepointer from John Sako Man he just looked at him Jab jab looked him in the eye knocked down a tough three to start the game Stanford starting five We talked about Aorei and Akara Benny Geler a steady senior at the guard position Aiden Camman has taken a step forward for the Cardinal and AJ Roi an impact transfer from of all places Claremont Mud Scripps the basketball powerhouse We have our first foul of the game Itll be number six Itll be called on Huran Dan one of five players from China on division one rosters this season Well talk about the uh Asian infusion of talent on the Seattle program It is significant as Aorei begins his night with his first point And we talked about Aorei Ashley but 25 and a half points a game Thats second in the entire nation Add to that four rebounds three assists Hes got nine steals on the season He has done everything for this Cardinal team as a true freshman And hes a threelevel threat And thats what makes him so good He can attack the rim He has an explosive first step and he plays with a great change of pace Seattle bigs are capable of stepping outside particularly Yo who hit that first three and now its Dan inside So you see Huron Dan who is by the way another of those Asian players who have come in and made a real impact Theyve got players from China Theyve got Korea and Japan on the roster And theres a missing close for Stanford And back the other way we go Will Heinbro who missed the last game with a concussion Hes blocked by Aorei Yeah he can do that too A Cororey got up there Yes he did In transition Akara missed the layup cheering So an opportunity there as Stanford runs the floor but cannot finish I mentioned Heimbro 67 player from Sanelmo a local guy as Seattle turns it over Another look at Aorei Thats 62 A Cororey on 67 Heimbro man A Cororey just got up there skies and gets the block So 51 visitors here in the opening minutes Stanford trying to find its footing Apara cut off baseline by Heimbrook Rajosi right hand jump hook And this is I think one of the X factors for this Stanford team Ashley is AJ Roi He is athletic He is a legit post presence And I think that the coaches are still figuring out how good he can be at this level after transferring from division 3 Oh yeah He was a superstar at the D3 level Came back to D1 What an amazing story and really a huge piece for the Cardinal Youve got Dan and Cameron Little hand fighting inside And theyll call the foul on Cam And a quick entry for Cameron Grant who came off the bench and knocked in five threes in the win over Louisiana So Kyle Smith hoping for more instant offense from the red shirt sophomore Catch and shoot Maldonado And that is no good But weve got a foul and its going to go the other way Stanford looking to improve to 50 for the second straight season The Cardinal hasnt accomplished that since 2000 2001 as Rajosi scores in tight again against Stanford taking advantage in the paint They said that was an area that they wanted to attack against Seattle They have the size advantage down there Inside out and thats Malik Arrington cut off baseline Gives it up and Dan is fouled Another look at Rajosi going to work down low And Aorei just draws so much attention He grabs two defenders down there in the corner Thats a great cut by Rajosi Aorei finds him Easy layup And I think thats an underrated aspect of Aorys game at least in these first four games You know about the scoring you know about the defense but the vision and the court sense And anytime he has the basketball in his hand hes going to draw one to two defenders maybe even three sometimes if he gets in the paint And his floor vision and the ability to find his teammates is another reason that hes just so good Its just a freshman as Huron Dan hits the first and hits the second and he will take a seat in favor of Austin Mau a legit sevenfooter out of Medford Oregon Aorei pulls the trigger Short with the three Rebound to Yo Heimbro goes to work on Apara Pocket pass Thats pretty but the shot from Mau is errant And here come the Cardinal again Apara has it knocked away by Mau And here comes Maldonado No numbers And hell pull it back Tough shot in tight Cameron Grant with the rebound So Maldonado finding life on the road A little bit difference at least to this point in the ball game and Aara turns it over for a second time cheering Ashley this is the first road game of the season for Chris Victor and the Red Hawks How much does that matter Especially when youre used to playing in a gym that has a capacity of 999 and you come into Maples Now Maples isnt packed by any stretch but this is a I 7X times capacity gym that theyre used to playing in Yeah Yeah Well I mean its a much bigger stage that theyre on and it just it changes the the way you shoot the basketball The depth perception in the gym is a little bit different So it could take some time for the Red Hawks to get a feel for the court Yo feeling it early on That may be a bit of a heat check but he missed it wide right Brian Agarwal has checked in for the cart Rajosi will face up baseline Reverse layup too strong And here comes Arrington for Seattle Malik Arrington Maldonado Catch and shoot three from Mau is no good The bigs will shoot it And theyre going to get another chance Heres another catch and shoot three And yo splashes another Junuk Yo hot start for Seattle and thats Heimbro with the ball in his hand He draws the defense Stanford gets a little too far over and helpsside finds the wide open shooter in the corner Two early threes for Yo the senior from Seoul South Korea Again the only player from Korea on a division one roster Its a transfer from Gonzaga A Cororey the drive the deuce and the damage Thatll take us to our first media timeout Good start for Seattle but Aorei making his presence felt putting the ball on the deck and the finish Red Hawks by three music So accurate gives you something to fight for during the during the preseason Little bulletin board material Uh you dont need to look any further than Stanford for that as a nice pocket pass and finish by Mau for the flush Stanford last year picked 17th in the ACC finished seventh This year picked 17th in the ACC The media didnt learn their lesson Like you said a little material for the team to work for Even myself as a player we had a couple of seasons where we got picked low in the rankings That was on every wall every scouting report Always a reminder there Jeremy Den Smith has checked in for the Cardinal Heres a Cory whips a pass to Grant Catch and shoot three Floating to his left He wasnt set there and it may have cost him Quickly the other way Maldonado And they swing it to Mau And now Arrington Shooters going to keep shooting And that time Mau is long with the three cheering A Cororey got bumped And see he will learn right As great as hes been thats a play where you feel the bump and if youre Steph Curry you throw it up to the rim and youre shooting too But he passed the ball off so its ball out of bounds right And just plays with such great pace and tempo He gets in there cool calm and collected with the ball in his hand takes the bump able to draw the foul And like you said next time just toss that up there Get to the free throw line Apara up and under and up and under again Got it to Camman who is fouled by Mau And Aiden will head to the free throw line Seattle scores 83 points a game So the Red Hawks have put points on the board with regularity The concern I think for Chris Victor has been at the other end of the floor and keeping a Stanford team that has scored more than 87 points a game at bay One more look at Akara passing out of the double team Big to big Aiden Cammon 610 230 redsh shirt sophomore out of Andover Massachusetts Same uh region of the country from which both Apari Akara and Aorei hail from Got three New Englanders in this Stanford rotation Shout out to the East Coast Harrington using the screen and he has fouled underneath the rim Den Smith didnt like the call but thats Arringtons game He has shot a grand total of one threepointer so far this year So Ashley this is his game right here right And then he just does a great job of not picking up the basketball Feels the defense pushing on his hip towards the sideline Keeps his dribble takes the contact gets to the free throw line Trying to extend an early threepoint lead cheering And the 75 free throw shooter misses the first Arrington transferring from Idaho State So the last game for Seattle was a uh revenge game for Malik Arrington if you will He was an all all big sky defensive player at Idaho State cheering And he makes two or excuse me makes one of two Benny Geler back in for the Cardinal Roi as well And here is Geler And now Agarwal They really theyd like to get Aggerwal going He started the first game as we have a foul from Heimbro Agarwal upperassman red shirt Jr started the first game I think he expected to to be a fixture in the starting lineup but he missed a game with illness and he hasnt been able to really rediscover his footing to this point Well and I mean what a a tool to have for Kyle Smith to be able to have an upper classman with the skill that he has to come off the bench comes in the game right away gets a bucket and right on Q And and this is a guy who can score he can do a little bit of everything And if they can get him going its just another weapon for an offense that has already been a fairly welloiled machine here in the early going Yeah having a a sixman that can come off the bench and and score the way that he can is is really huge Hebrew misses the jumper Den Smith in the front court for Stanford A parro wants it He gets it Nice find Geler See if he goes to that jump hook again He does and he scores Easy money I mean he just gets to the middle of the court Nice little touch there Floats it on in Jojo Murphy with a basketball and he turned it over Geler picked his pocket Its a fouronone for Stanford Aaro will finish What a nice pass getting it out in transition Drops off the dime throws it down cheering The Cardinal very comfortable playing up and down as is Seattle but you certainly dont want to do it like that And a near travel there from John Christophus Winds up a three from Heimbros So its not how you draw it up but theyll take it It works Got a bucket He bros shooting 55 from the threepoint line Likes to get that one little dribble to the left Stop and knock the three down And they really missed him in the last game when he was out with the concussion Timeout on the floor as both teams are finding their sea legs offensively 1140 to go first half Defense into offense Benny Geler the spark plug Chisumak para the finisher music 18 But neither Kyle Smith nor Chris Victor cares a whole lot about those previous six games Yeah its all about right here right now Whos going to come out on the winning side tonight Aldonado almost turned it over but the Red Hawks maintain possession Shot clock under 15 Nice back door cut Kristophus Thats a tough shot and he buries it Well Stanfords guarding the first option in Seattles offense but they have to be able to guard the second and the third option And thats where Seattle shots have come from so far I am guessing though if you offered Kyle Smith that shot on every Seattle possession he would say Were okay with that Good defense even better offense There you go Good match up here up top with Ger and Maldonado A Cororey comes to the scorers table as AJ Roi has eight points Can we talk about how Benny Geler just set an amazing screen down low that got him open I mean that thats one of the littlest guys on the court setting a big screen gets his big man open And that is a guy as Den Smith commits the foul Benny Geler who absolutely had the attention of Chris Victor I talked to him at shootaround today and he said Benny Geler is the epitome of toughness of smarts of versatility in his game He can beat you offensively He can beat you defensively We saw the steal a couple of moments ago and thats playing out before our very eyes Yeah and those are the small things that make a difference Those are the things that win you basketball games Nice spin move by Dan but Roosi didnt foul him went vertical and gets the rebound cheering AJ Roosi kind of putting on a show here early Thats a kick and itll stay with Stanford So Rajosi has eight of the Cardinals 17 points and you look at the points in the paints its 144 Stanford Cardinal havent hit a three yet Agarwal is a guy who can shoot it but he picks up his dribble and finds somewhere to go with it Heres Akara Aara Nice pass down low and keep on adding to the tally I mean he is just eating them up down low having his way down there on the block And Seattle doesnt have an answer for it yet They do not And coaches are pretty smart If somethings working theyre going to keep going to it If its not broke dont fix it Dont fix it Exactly Nice pass from Dan to Heimbrook So Heimbro with another bucket that gives him five points averaging 17 a game A par strong to the tin and the finish Aara fakes the handoff there beats the defender finishes Nice touch off the glass So these teams on pace to play a game in the 80s which is exactly where theyve been throughout the season And a boy Cororey thought he had position and took a charge from the 610 230 lb Huron Dan Lets take another look Yeah it looks like he might have got there a little bit late Little bit late And Dan was able to Good body control right Get just enough to the left where he didnt hit him square on Yeah Try to avoid him Clipped him on the side just a little bit A Cory just a little bit late there So this would be Huron Dans first free throw attempt of the season And there you go Seattle up 2321 Nine minutes to go here Oscar Hilt has checked in for the Cardinal as the ball is tipped out of bounds by Arrington Hilte another interesting story one of two European players that Kyle Smith brought in with this recruiting class Hes a true post shot blocker Had some back issues early in the season but hes healthy now Yeah getting some good minutes for Kyle Smith as just the freshman Two blocks in their last game So really a good piece down low Great pass by Geler to Agarwal and Hilte the follow No but hes fouled A nice rebound in traffic by the big fella Yeah active on the offensive glass there Gets good position down low for the Oboard and just snatches it up over Maldonado Puts it back up Gets to the free throw line You cant teach Heighten Hell take just one of two from the foul line on the season See there from Bilzen Belgium He and Christairs comes over from Latafia Both going to be very interesting players as they get acclimated to college basketball Yeah continuing to develop him and both players getting pretty good minutes for their respective teams and that type of stuff matters come postseason time conference play getting these minutes right now is really big Well and depth is not an issue for this Stanford team You know they they have gone from a club that was lets be honest very Maxim Marino centric as Heimbro scores for Seattle uh to a team that we expected to be fullon by committee We did not see the Ibuka Aori show emerging in these first four games at 25 points a game So theyve still got one guy whos kind of leading the way but a lot of contributors early on this Stanford team as Seattle forces a turnover and the Red Hawks will push No foul on the play There was some contract contact but Hiltte cleans it up and a Cory in the front court Agarwal drive it looked like he got kind of caught in no mans land but the ball is tipped out of bounds by Seattle and it will stay with Stanford Hey the Red Hawks giving the Cardinal all they ask for here at home 2523 Seattle with the lead Were back to Maples after this Right now he gets a wellearned breather as Stanford goes to its bench and the ball is tipped out of bounds by Maldonado whos been very active defensively Quick hands or excuse me by Arrington And we have a not a 5second call and theres a foul away from the ball Okay so they get John Suck Yo on a foul and Stanford in the bonus So Apar is going to shoot one and one Thats a big call Seattle likes to be scrappy aggressive get their hands in passing lanes and for them already to be Stanford already be in the bonus theyre going to have to be smart for the rest of this first half And Stanford is a really good free throw shooting team with the exception of AJ Roi whos not on the floor right now But as a team Stanford is dynamite 77 as Apara hits both Last year they were 83 as a team Best in school history 2525 Good ball game here at Maples Seattle and the Cardinal Brock Felder with a basketball and Aara knocks it away Felder tracks it down cheering Hilt doing a nice job deeing up Big on big and Yo is going to jack a contested three Not close And Geler rips down the rebound Oh and theres a steal Its a threeon one in the front court They go to the perimeter Christophles misses the three That was interesting Ashley Im not sure thats the option that Chris Victor wanted on that Yeah you got two guards down there in the paint Take advantage of the twoonone Stanford gets the transition three from Cameron Grant and he cant get it to go So backto back miss jumpers and we remain deadlocked again Grant had the five threes against Louisiana on Tuesday night Heres Maldonado Spins on Geler and a block by Heilte Tremendous help defense Heres a Cororey oneonone in the front court Step through and score it Gets a big block on one in heel tay And then A Cororey in transition is so electric Gets a little euro step Finishes at the rim That is how you draw it up And Aore is fired up defensively Got called for a touch foul against Arrington But heres another look Oh hell take great help defense and then let Aorei get downhill in transition youre in trouble Nice little euro step finishes at the rim Substitutions for both teams By the way Ashley theres 621 to go in this first half Braden Maldonado has not scored I mean coach told us at shoot around it was going to be about defense Theyve got to pressure Seattles guards And so far Stanfords done a better job guarding the perimeter 23 points a game and nothing here tonight 0 of three shooting Hes got the ball now And Roosi with a foul as he goes over the back of Austin Mau and Seattle will shoot free throws Rajoss been great at the offensive end That was a mistake defensively Yeah you cant get he just gets caught behind there You have to side deny that or get in front and know you have help side behind you But either way you just dont want to reach from behind like that Its the first foul on AJ Mau on the season 0 for six from the foul line We do love small sample sizes And there it is Hes on the board Yeah To start the season you look at the numbers and theyre a little skewed Only played a couple of games maybe look to last season to see what a player did but I mean so far youve played five games and these this is your sample size One for seven sounds a lot better than 0 for six And two for eight even better than that Theyre like the opposite of the broadcasters jinx Its the reverse jinx Exactly Miles Amos has checked in Nice pass Rajosi rejected at the rim by Heimbro Stanford maintains possession and hes rejected again by Heimbro Boy that looked like a terrific pump fake He went up and under cheering Just times it perfectly down there And then you get Rahosi with the pump fake Helpside from Heimbro Blocks it again at that will go on the Will Hebro personal highlight reel for all eternity Well and I think whats more impressive is he did it from helpside That wasnt even his man No No As Jeremy Den Smith knocks down the three First triple of the day for Stanford Cardinal with its biggest lead at 3027 Theres a fly by and a three for Christophus and he is fouled by Cam Grant That is the Cardinals in basketball You dont want to foul a threepoint shooter Great focus there by Chris to take the bump and be able to still knock the shot down Pun intended Cardinal maybe a little bit Mhm Okay Christophus 60 from the foul line and he is good So the fourpoint play and a threepoint Stanford leads lead becomes a onepoint Stanford deficit Well and thats been the difference in the game so far is the threepoint line Seattles four for nine from three Stanford only one from four Evan Stinson he can knock it down but instead he goes to Raosi Geler the open shooter The rainbow three is no good And Maldonado with the rebound Its a tough cover for Den Smith on Heimbro Nice find Amos Mau And thats just good ball movement all around Yeah Seattle does such a good job of that They attack the paint collapse the defense and then kick out to the open person and attack again So you got to be able to guard their secondary options Red Hawks 15 and a half assists per game Theyve got five here tonight Geler missed another three So Stanford continues to struggle from deep Another good pass but Christophus you can see the anguish on his face as he knows he has had an easy layup if he catches the ball cheering Cory and Akara back in for Stanford down by three as we approach the 420 mark of this first half Den Smith who just hit the threepointer guarded by Jojo Murphy and A Cororey whos been relatively quiet Almost turned it over Quick hands there on the defensive end by Arrington Akara Uh well call that a pass off the backboard for Rahosi And he missed the shot Well give him the benefit of the doubt How about the ball fake by Yo Loose ball picked up by Aquara Red Hawks do get back defensively Good screen by Chisum Cory no good on the jumper And here comes Seattle So Stanford right now just not shooting it Jojo Murphy tried the pass in traffic and Aara again So matching turnovers back and forth these last few possessions Evan Stinson will shoot the three and that is good Exactly Just a little easy screen and roll action at the top You find your open shooter in the corner Easy basketball Keep it simple right now for Stanford First three of this season for Stinson who missed the first few games with injury Now trying to D up the sevenfooter Mau He poked it out of bounds And that will take us to the under four media timeout 246 to go in this first half Evan Stinson the corner triple and its 3333 here at Maples Open shooters We kind of talked about Stanford being able to guard their secondary option Cant trade twos for threes And tough place to have to inbound from in the corner there Benny Geler did a nice job of bothering Arrington and forced to call the timeout I think the other thing that jumps out to me is Stanford has been proficient at turning over its opponents Almost 18 a game thats second in the ACC And I know Chris Victor was really concerned about that And you know what His team has done a terrific job taking care of the basketball Just two turnovers so far Yeah I mean you got to take care of the ball Sorry five turnovers So still not bad Not bad at all But you want to take care of the basketball Possessions Possessions are huge And in a game like this where its tied you know forcing in the second half if it comes down to the wire possessions are going to be so important You got to take care music of the basketball So Arringtons going to try it again from the same spot This time he gets it into Heimbro and Agarwal pokes it out of bounds So a near turnover right on Q music And Aores off the floor again for the Cardinals as is No Aquar is back on the floor Bro spins on Apara hangs and misses badly Shot clock was about to expire so he had to chuck that one up Dual point guards for the Cardinal with Geler and Den Smith Agarwal can handle as well Shot clock down to 10 Jojo Murphy doing a nice job defensively on Den Smith Aara wants it Aparas got it And Akara buries the straightaway three Again the screen and roll action draws the double team The one more pass Stanford does a great job at that off par knocks down the three So the Cardinal back up by three 3633 Murphy into the paint And youre not going to win that battle Hell with another swat out of bounds And you know Jojo Murphys an interesting player for this Seattle team And heres a guy who a year ago at Chico State was 21 points a game He was the man but now you come to a situation where you have to adapt to being a complimentary scorer and Chris Victor said that has definitely been somewhat of a struggle for him Yeah all American at the D2 level You come D1 its just a different type of basketball Stanford gets the turnover here Akara with the turnover and the transition opportunity And then Heimbro says Uhuh I block shots too Its great hustle Theyre getting back transition defense turnover You get back and get the big block Heimbro just has such a great feel for the basketball and without fouling I mean thats tough in that situation Apara up and under Runs into Hilte Boy I thought he might have got away with a little mini travel there but count the bucket Pump fake Pump fake Defense flies by Chiz loves the He loves the pump fake Maldonado and the eraser does it again Hell and andro just back and forth with the blocks Theyre just taking turns down there again Thats helpsside defense Hell helps out Geler skies up and sends that flying out of bounds The law firm of Hilte and Heimbro with a veritable block party on a Friday night Maldonado catch and shoot And finally with a minute eight to go in the first half hes got his first points Yeah that thats more of his game coming off the dribble stops hits the leaner jumper If hes going to get in the paint like that hes got a pump fake Den Smith to the corner Good close out by Maldonado Den Smith drive it Tried to dish to Hilt but its broken up And now Seattle will push Tough pass intercepted by Agarwal No numbers but Ryan will step through and turn it right back over And now weve got a run out opportunity Brock Felder lay it up and in Thats a tough break there for Stanford Not necessarily the play you want if youre aggrawal You got two defenders Bring it out Shot clocks running down Get a good shot Thats a tough one Tough break there Cardinal will play for for the final shot of the half Shot clock is off Den Smith cut off by Arrington Now Jeremys going to have to step back and launch No problem That works right That works Just like Kyle Smith drew it up The end of half magic from Jeremy Dent Smith on their shooting stroke there toward the end And again well see if that carries over here into half number two Well also see if that guy Ibuka Aorei picks up his scoring Little surprising to see him with just six points after averaging 25 and a half a game through the first four Uses a Cammon screen mismatch A Cororey recognizes he draws the foul Then well go to the line I like Stanford going straight to him out of the half pretty quiet first half I mean for a regular player you might be like Okay six points One of the best scorers in the nation only six points Were not used to seeing that from him So I I really like Kyle Smith going to him right out of halftime getting him to the free throw line You knock down a free throw Sometimes that opens up the floor And we look at the last season recap of this Cardinal team And remember again picked 17th in the ACC They finished seventh They were above 500 in conference They won 21 games 17 wins here in this building matches a program record Not bad for a team that nobody expected anything of in its first year under a new coach And then Kyle Smith what was the Pack 12 Pack 12 coach of the year I mean what hes done so far in his just two seasons here at Stanford has been so impressive Impressive is the right word to describe Kyle Smith in every aspect of the job And impressive there from Huron Dan as he follows his own miss and scores Quick little bunny aggressive on the offensive glass and steals two points By the way that foul on Yo at the other end is his third So well keep an eye on that A parro going to work in the low block And that time just enough on the pump fake gives a gets Heimbro up and then goes around him and finishes Akara quietly with 13 points to lead Stanford Heimbro beats Rajosi to the rim Missed the shot Rebound Stanford And here they come Aorei floater off the glass and count it the touch that he has finishing in transition Once he gets downhill youre in trouble at that point Hes heating up And thats going to be ball out of bounds to Stanford cheering Attack the middle Gets the defender on his heels Puts it right off the glass Beautiful finish Great body control Just another of the tremendous assets that this young man possesses His bag of tricks is substantial Well he hangs in the air just long enough to let the defender go by and still able to finish Uh tried the wraparound knocked out of bounds off of Dan So itll stay with Stanford And again the storyline we talked about at the start of the game Aorei four games at Stanford 20 plus points in all four the first freshman to do that for the Cardinals since Brook Lopez in 2007 No freshman has ever scored 20 points in five straight games here at Stanford Well and I think as good of a freshman that he is hes still a freshman And so what hes done so far in his first few games hes drawing more defenders Hes drawing more attention People are going to watch film on him scout how he plays his tendencies and what he likes And so now hes going to have to pivot shift and move learn how defenses are going to play him and then attack them in a different way Uh hes up to 11 points now and I think thats an excellent point Weve seen evidence of that tonight Obviously he has now quickly become the focal point of every opposing coachs scouting report They actually missed one but Stanford gets the offensive rebound and Aorei going right back to work Nice defense there by Arrington Apara up and under Missed the shot and Roi will give him another possession AJ good footwork and gets the shooters bounce AJ Rahosi has had his way on that block Hes so patient down there Seattle again has just not had an answer for him Id like to see Stanford continue to force the issue down there Thats 12 for Rajosi one shy of his Stanford high of 13 Side step and a foul on a three on Cammon So the second time tonight a Stanford player fouls a Seattle player on a threepoint attempt The last time Cameron Grant was the guilty party and it wound up a fourpoint play This time the bucket wasnt good But youve got John Sako with three free throws Well you just got to be disciplined there right If if youre a coach youre okay with that shot Hes shooting a floater three leaning to his left If he knocks that down hey thats good defense even better offense But you dont want to put a threepoint shooter at the line like that I dont think Cal Smith cared for the call by the way It was on the tickytac side First free throw is no good So Seattle last year its first in the WCC Kind of a mixed bag 8 and8 in conference under 500 overall But again when you talk about the WCC you know the deal going in You got Gonzaga youve got St Marys and youve got to contend with the two behemoths at the top every year Its also been a much improved conference I think the last few years Uh and early returns this year Santa Clara looks really good early on USF has had a nice run these last couple of years So I think the WCC is definitely getting better Yeah And on any given night any team can can come out with a win Really got to show up as your best self in that conference Off the Accori miss here come the Red Hawks Camman good job keeping his feet Arrington throws up a wild shot over Aorei Not close And Camman with another rebound for Stanford Cardinal with its biggest lead of the day 5041 And looking to add to that Camman wants it Hes got it faces up triple teamed and gets to the line I guess sometimes you just say Im going to shoot this thing Im putting my head down and whatever will be will be Yeah Camman has three defenders around him and someh somehow still able to get himself to the free throw line Raosi was right there on the block At that point when you see your big man with the ball kind of step to that little short corner area get out of his way let him work a little bit cuz now his defenders right there and help doesnt have to move Oh Cory will take a breather and Jeremy Den Smith returns Hes got a couple of threes tonight including that impressive launch to beat the first half buzzer and another offensive rebound However Akara a little too feisty and he gets called for the foul Foul number 10 First foul on Akara Red Hawks down 10 with the ball Trying to regain some of that momentum they had early on They actually led for most of the first half and that guy was a big part of it Will Heimbro going to work on Chisumak Parara And that is good footwork by the big fella Roi Heimbro I mean the way that they pump fake and keep theirel keep themselves under control in the paint is so impressive right there Just being patient letting taking what the defense gives you and finishes AJs got it The double does not come but he passes out anyway And theres a near steal by Malik Arrington A par and the travel we thought we saw earlier we certainly saw right there So a turnover by the big fella and that takes us to break 1558 remaining here at Maples And when we talked to Kyle Smith at shootaround he told us that they like to take teams out of what they like to do ie Braden Maldonado filling up the stat sheet So theyve done a really good job defensively holding him one of the best scorers in the nation right now What is the danger Ashley when you are a scorer and you dont score 25 minutes into a game to start pressing Its easy to get in your head right I havent scored I need to force the issue Well no You pick it up on the other end Play defense get to the free throw line Those are the small things that you do to get yourself back in a rhythm Speaking of small things that was a block from behind by Ibuka Aorei Thats his second block of tonights game contributing in so many ways Dense Smith looking for help He gets it from Aiden Camman Shot clock is at 10 And number 10 under the hoop Back to Camman Catch and shoot three No good Cam doesnt shoot a lot of those Thats just his sixth threepoint attempt this year Hes made two of them Maldonado And thats looked like he looked like it might be a carry but I guess he got bumped Number 11 John Christophus and number 11 Under 15 to play here at Maples Stanford clinging to an eightpoint lead And Heimbro I dont know if that was blocked by Apara but its going to be out of bounds Right back to Seattle Well this has been a fun matchup to watch all evening Heimbro and Apara down there in the paint banging That wasnt blocked He just missed it 5 ft short but it did go out of bounds off of Apara So Seattle with another shot Arrington deflected by Camman and a transition opportunity Heres Agarwal Akara on the wing Blocked out of bounds by who else Will Heimbrook Thats his fourth block of the night They are trading blows down there Hebro gets back Just sends it Pins it on the glass Thats not my house And its just its such a skill to do that over and over as Geler cheering Did he bank that in from the corner From the corner That looked like a physical impossibility What just happened That is probably the most high level of difficulty shot to make on a basketball court And I dont I dont know if he did that on purpose Did he call if this were horse you have to call that keeps his pivot foot and a miss by Maldonado and an over the back against Busan Dan Were going to take another look to make sure this actually happened Theres the shot Yeah it kissed off the glass He shot that like hes done it before So may maybe that was on purpose And knowing Benny Im sure he has done it before In fact knowing Benny he might work on that Gives Stanford its biggest lead 5443 And a travel by Agarwal Is that the call Yeah for the Red Hawks So Ryan Agarwal still trying to get his legs under him after the illness early in the season But again this is a good player who is really going to help this team once he gets right and just give them another weapon at both ends of the floor And were playing a lot of basketball early on so you forget that the season just started Teams are still finding their footing learning how to play off of each other All of that stuff is going to come with time Well how about that drop pass by cheering Arrington and it sets up Dan to get fouled Kind of a wraparound pocket pass Thats Thats high degree of difficulty Yeah Somehow threads the needle through there Gets the ball through and Dan just patient lets the defense fly on his back Free throw line So Dan who came in without a free throw make this season made his first three before that And Oscar Hilt returns for the Cardinal He of the three block shots here tonight cheering Dan hits the second Maldonados a little gimpy here as a hitch in his giddy up as he retreats defensively Theres a steal by Arrington A race in the front court Arrington knocks it out of bounds The officials looking at each other palms to the sky Neither one has any idea who its off of Im fairly certain the ball went off of Arrington I think he just tripped cheering Well get another look at it If this isnt a foul on a Cororey and I dont think it is Yeah it looks like Arrington almost kind of wrapped around his leg Yeah the feet got tangled Well but you love it because you want to get the call right Being able to go back and check and make sure is so important Absolutely Some backcourt pressure now for the Red Hawks as Maldonado is trying to make a Corys life difficult Probably because the shot clock is winding down and Im not entirely sure why as a Corys blocked at the rim but there was a change of possession Why was there the shot clock at 10 when they inbound Anyway Chris missed the three and well settle things down at the 13minute mark of the second half Hell over the back commits the foul number 15 We may have to consult the digital rule book laughter And again this is new this season as Hilt steals the inbound So there you go You commit the foul you get the ball right back Akara top of the key Agarwal gets downhill and hes blocked at the rim The blocks are coming fast and furious tonight Agarwal reloads Corner three is short and hell take very much over the back of Heinbro and he commits his second foul in about 35 seconds Seattle just all over the glass tonight They are blocking so many shots down there in the paint And that was a big question that Chris Victor had heading into this game How would his team deal with the physicality of Stanford And so far I would say theyve acquitted themselves quite well Yeah theyve handled it on the defensive end doing a really good job but now offensively they got to get something going And thats a tough shot by Yo the 18 ft twopointer and he missed it And Stanford which has been a little stagnant here the last couple of possessions Aorei trying to change all that No Aggerwall got the rebound and were going to get a tie up Possession arrow is Seattle So a nice job by Ryan Agarwal knifing to the basket to snatch that offensive rebound and had a pretty good look at the putback and he just missed it A Cororey just three of eight from the floor He does have 11 points Five of those coming from the charity strike Again the uh subplot here tonight is Aorei trying to get that 20 point mark for the fifth straight game Become the first Stanford freshman ever to do so And the way that he scores the basketball that is certainly not off the table Not even a little 11 points Its been a quiet 11 but it is is ab absolutely still on the table with the way that he can score and score in a hurry and the fact that he is proficient from the foul line and a guy who will have the ball in his hands more often than not down the stretch if the game is still close Right now he gets a breather and Jeremy Den Smith returns for Stanford Malik Arrington with it Nice defense by Geler Amos retrieves the basketball Hell back it out And an errant pass Here comes Evan Stinson leading the Cardinal break Geler on the wing Stop and pop for three Benny Geler knocking it down again The confidence to come down in transition stop on a dime and knock down the three Thats super tough by Geler I mean this is a kid who has come so far in four years at Stanford He was a walkon earned some minutes his second season earned a lot of minutes last year became one of the important sort of role players on this team led by Maxim Reno Now hes a starter and a lock down shooter Heres Den Smith and he cant net his third three But Aara how about the offensive rebound Oh Benny Benny didnt get the roll Evan Stinson nice effort for the offensive board but Benny Geler making it rain for the Cardinal at one end as Evan Stinson starts the break Stanford opening up its lead Its now 135744 music in the last 241 Got to do a better job of taking care of the ball again We talked about it earlier Possessions are huge You got to be able to get good shots within your offense If you turn the ball over you dont even give yourself a chance And true to form Jeremy Den Smith errant on the three So the drought continues for Stanford Seattle meanwhile shooting just 18 from the floor since halftime Thatll help as Yo gets in close and lays it up and in Still plenty of time in this game 1030 and change But here youre Seattle you want to maintain contact Right now theyre down by 11 Stinson quick trigger on the three Missed it badly So Stanford won for its last nine from the floor And a bad pass is intercepted by Geler Benny No numbers So hell wait for his mates does a good job there recognizing you dont have numbers Pull it out get a set and get a good shot Nice pass inside And another block by Heinbro against Hilte Well Heimbro is a ball magnet I mean if if a shot is going up hes going to come flying from one side of the court and get his hand on it And Hiltte fouls Heimbro So honestly I think what needs to happen is after this game the fans clear the gym and we bring those two back Heilte and Heimbro play oneonone I want to watch that I This has just been such a fun matchup The athleticism of Will Heimbro on defense the smaller defender still able to get up and like weve said all night to do it without fouling is such a skill Hibbro 17 points a game Hes got nine tonight trying to add to that from the foul line But again its the defensive effort that has really made everybody sit up and take notice Cory hes got six blocks Six I had to do a double take that on the stat laughter sheet cheering And he made both free throws So the deficit back to single digits 5748 And this is where I think maybe you look for a Cororey to try to force the issue a little bit and either score or get to the line And this is where he has to not be a freshman be aggressive want the basketball in his hands and go attack Yeah I dont think he knows hes a freshman I dont think thats a problem Hes got such a good head on his shoulders actually got to spend some time talking with him today Really really impressive young man As for these Seattle Red Hawks look this is I think a program on the rise Uh not a large undergraduate population just over 4000 uh just getting their feet wet in the WCC And of course you think basketball in Seattle U you think Elgen Baylor you think movies in Seattle U and you think Clint Eastman But Chris Victor doing a real nice job with this program ushering in the transition to the West Coast Conference 83 and 54 now in his fifth year Three straight 20 win seasons I mean that is not an easy thing to do No And in fact uh they havent done that at Seattle U since the 1950s A parro will drive it Hell force the issue No And we have a whistle and a foul underneath And I believe that is going to send Oara to the line And if thats on Yo its his fourth Boy thats rough You take an elbow to the chops and you get whistled for the foul Tough break there But I mean I that just shows the strength and physicality of Apara when he gets in the paint Thats a big body You cant let him get down there to his spot on the block Dont let him catch the ball down there You do Its bad bad business down there He is a load at 68 240 And you talked about it earlier how he was he was a strong dude and well put together last season but he spent this off season chiseling that body even further or should I say chisming that body even further Um although he just missed two free throws And how about the play underneath by our man Ibuka Corey chasing down the loose rock and throwing it out of bounds off a Seattle player What a heads up play there Steals an extra possession for his team So smart Such a young player but so smart Wise beyond his years Stanford one of its last 10 from the field and the two missed free throws by Oara So Cardinal even though theyve got a lead they need a bucket Rajosi to Giler on the perimeter up and under Nice defense by Maldonado Benny will launch from 30 in and out No the bank from the corner was a way harder shot laughter As we approach the 9minute mark weve got a ninepoint game here at Maples Arrington drive and kick Amos for three And that is just the second threepoint attempt of the season for Miles Amos I mean he knocks it down when his team needed it the most Knocked the three down in their last game as well Thats a big shot That could be something that opens the offense up for Seattle Hes shooting 100 for the year Hes two for two We got a sixpoint game Ashley Heres Cam into a double team Tough pass to a Cororey Catch and shoot three No good And whistle and a foul underneath And thats going to be against Malik Arrington as Cameron just had too much of a size advantage Shot goes up trying to box out but I mean thats just thats just a big body You cant really do much about that when you let him get that low under the hoop No I mean thats thats 63 on 610 and those things will happen Cardinal desperately need a bucket though Geler Raosi and AJ missed from in close There is a lid on that basket 805 to play Dont have to guard Dan out there You do have to guard Maldonado even though hes been cold tonight Opposite corner Catch and shoot Air ball and Rajosi saved it Nice job cheering McCori picks up his dribble at the elbow and now back to the perimeter So Seattle doing such a great job here defensively Geler opposite corner Aorei got the fly by wide open three They need it They didnt get it And Seattle with another rebound Outlet Christophus and he scores off window We got a fourpoint game And just like that it it happens fast You have a couple of missed shots on one end Seattle comes down on the other and takes advantage So timeout Kyle Smith as hes got to find somebody who can put the ball in the bucket Athletic and that can bother a guard whos a little bit on the shorter side So its been interesting to see how Stanfords defense has bothered Seattles guards Stanford desperately in need of an offensive answer Well see what Kyle Smith dials out of a timeout They wanted the back door to Geler It wasnt there and Cammon just double dribbled So thats the last thing you want when you are one for your last 14 and youre coming out of a timeout right Its out of a timeout Thats the biggest thing Execution out of a timeout is huge You never want to have a turnover Its almost like a wasted timeout Got to do a better job executing and getting the look that they were going for Stanford hasnt scored in more than four and a half minutes and its allowed Seattle to creep back in this game And theres a pass to a wideopen Dan and Raosi denies him at the rim and gets called for the foul Its just late rotation there You have two two guys on the ball and then Roi just there a little bit late I like the aggressiveness on the block but he gets there just a half a second late and it results in the foul So Huran Dan back to the foul line cheering where he has been a lot today These will be free throws six and seven cheering cheering applause Dan averages only three and a half points a game That is his 11th point here tonight So we talked about the guards struggling for Seattle but you know what Theyre only down three That means somebodys got to be providing offense and its been the bigs Yeah Dan and Yo have both done an impressive job tonight of scoring And there is the answer finally from Benny Geler off the penetration by Ibuka Aori Benny Geler loves those corner three balls Decided to play that one straight up and not shoot it off the window cheering The lead back to six Geler with nine for the Cardinal Arrington not a threepoint shooter Cut off by a Cory and he scores in close So right on Q We talked about the guards not contributing offensively One of them scores a big bucket Thats a tough make there for Arrington in the paint Almost a turnover by Aorei And theres a foul at the rim as Dan and Aara collide Hopefully Chis is okay That pass was almost intercepted but it got through and Apara did the rest Dan goes in there no fear Hes ready to throw that ball down at the rim Takes the contact Hits the floor hard Gets to the free throw line Akar is a good free throw shooter but he did miss both the last time he went to the line And Miho has missed three in a row And Ashley at what point does that start to get in your head a little bit even for the good foul shooters I mean its tough And as time winds down this is a team that shoots 76 from the free throw line Normally struggling tonight from the free throw line Big time 11 of 18 and that one stays down So now 12 and 19 and its a two possession game again Were under six minutes here at Maples And this is very much an open question A car the near or a Cory rather the near steel Yo thought about it Now hell drive it and swatted away by Aorei Its a foot race IA layup with a left hand is good Defense to offense playing Arrington straight up Driving kick yo for three Count it for the Red Hawks Thats his third three tonight The first two came early That one the biggest of the bunch Fourpoint game Boy look at a Cororey backing down his man I dont love that shot however as its rebounded by Yo And here comes Seattle Well theyre going to dare Arrington to shoot it And just like Miles Amos Arrington is now two for two on the season shooting threes Not necessarily his game but the senior he knows his team needs that three and he knocks it down 6362 How will Stanford handle the adversity Geler with 10 to shoot Hes got a big on him Benny back to the perimeter Aara blocked by Heimbro got it back but its a shot clock violation Did not get iron And that would be block number seven for Will Heimbro I mean Will Heimbro might mess around and have a double double with blocks but right here what a huge shot by Arrington Thats not necessarily his bag but he finds a way to knock it down Well this is definitely danger time for the Cardinal once up by 13 cheering A 6 run by Seattle has made it a onepoint game And obviously the Red Hawks can take a lead with a bucket here on this possession as we approach the 4minute mark Heinbro intercepted by Den Smith Stanford just two of their last 13 field goals They really need to get a bucket here A Coris on the bench A par spinning They get it to Den Smith Camman wants it on the block Its Raosi AJ cheering dump it down Big to big Camman fouled And well go to the line when we return Strap yourselves in We got a barn burner at Maples Stanford 63 Seattle 62 3 minutes 40 seconds remaining Friday night basketball on the farm Stanford 0 and6 all time Stanford looking for five and0 starts in backtoback seasons And Camman misses a free throw It just seems like nothing is going right for the Cardinal in about the last 10 minutes Yeah were getting to a point where its going to be winning time here soon Somebodys got to step up Yeah thats tough And you know whos not on the floor for Stanford I Yeah Heinbro has it Top of the key Off a screen It is Yo Missed the three badly And here come the Cardinal cheering Accorey at the scorers table So hell be in next dead ball Cameman is mugged by Heimbro cheering And thats going to send Aiden Cammon right back to the foul line which was not kind to him 30 seconds ago Yeah Right here You just got to step up get there with confidence take a deep breath knock down a shot 67 from the line coming in but tonight hes two for six Cameron sophomore from Andover Mass And he hits the front end Thats a big one A Cororey back on the floor And it looks like Cameron Grant will check in for Cammon should this free throw go down It does and he will So a small sigh of relief from the Cardinal faithful who are getting a little nervous here at Maples I mean no time to fret We have tons of time left in this game and its just simple Take care of the ball Get great shots and defend You make it sound simple laughter Mau who hadnt been on the floor in 20 minutes scores in tight and its a onepoint game It sounds a lot easier than than what it actually is Jeremy Denn Smith running the point See if Akara tries to take it to the rim Working on Heimbro Chis up and under Heres a Cory corner three No rebound Heimbro A Cororey is 0 for five from threepoint land tonight Normally a 42 threepoint shooter but it happens to the best of us You have those off nights How are you going to impact the game in other ways Well right there he fouled Arrington on a basket and Seattle has the lead and a free throw cheering Malik Arrington normally a playmaker but hes taking the ball head on tonight hit some big big shots tonight for the Red Hawks Seattle down 13 midway through the half Has come all the way back to take the lead cheering And the free throw is good So Stanford now down two as Geler returns Well this is the first real test for the Cardinal this season 40 Heavily favored to go 50 but this is why they play the game Aorei around a screen by Rajosi Akara hell drive it Chis blocked at the rim Rajosi got the rebound and the balls blocked out of bounds And I tell you what the story of this game Ashley is Seattles interior defense Another blocked shot I mean yeah What What can you say at this point I mean so skilled down there Two minutes to play Cardinal down two and they are two for their last 15 from the field Aory hesitation move drive missed the shot in close rebound Mau and they cant get anything anything at the rim And right there you got three guys standing around the perimeter You see a shot go up Everybody should be crashing the glass and have one back for defensive purposes You got to give yourself a second chance opportunity at the rim Oh this is a massive defensive possession for the Cardinal And that is the last thing they wanted to have happen A wideopen bucket underneath for the MVP of this game Will Heimbro Aorei turns the corner Layup No foul Hell go to the line Just a heads up play there by Okori Gets in the paint hangs able to draw some contact and you give yourself an opportunity to score with the clock stopped Of course the foul line has not been kind to the Cardinal for the first time this season A Cororeis free throw is good They are now 15 for 24 as a unit Minute 22 on the clock And Aorei hit both So hes got 15 Twopoint game And Stanford needs to lock in defensively Red Hawks are going to I would imagine kill some clock here Heinbro nice pocket pass inside and Yo with the finish I mean its a tale of two interior defenses And this wasnt a problem Ashley for Stanford in the first half But in the second half Oh I I mean Okore is your your guy right You want the ball in his hands but I think if he gets downhill can get to the basket and drop it off to a big thats a way for them to get a bucket down low And thats what they try Instead its a Akara step back three straight away He knew it was off Chases down his own rebound Goes up and under And another rejection and a foul by Akara And that sums it up right there I Yeah I mean thats the story for the evening The way that Seattle has been able to block shots down low I dont know if thats necessarily the shot youre looking for but I love that he follows crashes the glass but I mean just even better defense right there They get the block That is it says officially nine blocks for Seattle but it feels like 19 And AR is a little gimpy too which is obviously the worst thing for Stanford cheering And so Maldonado who has been silent tonight their leading scoreer at 23 a game that is his third point And I think that shows you how good of a team Seattle is with their depth Their leading scoreer is cheering you know struggling tonight You have Heimbro 13 Yo has 15 Dan has 11 I mean up and down the score sheet theyve done it as a unit in the last 10 minutes 40 in the game Got to have a basket Got to have it quick Geler Cam Grants Apara drive kick A Cororey Somebodys got to shoot the three instead Dense Smith He contested two and its no good And again that pretty much sums it up 22 seconds left cheering I mean the ju just that sequence right there the offense just feels a bit out of sorts for Stanford tonight They really have struggled to get into a rhythm And I think you got to credit the defense of Seattle It appeared that nobody wanted to take the shot Yeah I mean they swung it across One more pass One more pass It touched a fury You think that he would maybe want to take that shot but on a night where he struggled he passes it up and you know Dent tries to make something out of nothing and it just doesnt go down Maldonado free throw good And one more look at the sequence Geler under the hoop Benny knows he hes good at math He knows you kind of need a three here Down by six So theyre looking for it and Den Smith instead drives it Missed the shot Rest is history And this one is all but over Its an eightpoint game with 20 seconds to go A Cororey off window is good Timeout And its a sixpoint game but 16 seconds Its unlikely barring a on Thanksgiving Day So a Big 10 opponent coming up for the Cardinal But uh they got some work to do after this one as Heimbro gives it up And Stanford not fouling Boy they let four and a half seconds go off the clock there You know this is with Stanford You look at it on the surface and you say theyve got 11 returning players and you think okay this is an experienced group that is used to playing with one another However you consider that Aorei whos been their most important player in the early going is a freshman Jeremy Den Smith who has been an important role player often with the ball in his hands is a transfer AJ Roi who is one of their important post players is a transfer So there are still theres still an acclamation process with this group And I think weve seen that tonight Yeah And it takes time You learn how to play with each other play off of each other That that kind of stuff is going to take some some working through And a Cory with a near turnover I guess with it being an eightpoint game with 7 seconds left the only drama here is will A Cororey hit a three to get him to 20 points laughter Thats thats the drama to make it five games in a row And theyre not even going to let him touch the basketball Its Cam from distance Thats no good And the final seconds are going to tick off And a stunner at Maples as Seattle comes into Northern California and knocks off the Cardinal
