Music our officials tonight Ted Valentine Lee Cassell and Keith Kimble we are underway in the ACCC on a Tuesday night a critical conference Clash two teams battling on the Music bubble while handling the pressure of NC State uh we to talked with Tony Bennett prior to this game he said look we must handle of the press that NC State tries to apply on the defensive end mcne right to the rim rejected it stays uvas way under three seconds left on the shot clock and thats a great recovery that time by Casey morcel looked like mcne was going to get a wide open layup mcne fires it as the buzzer sounds off the mark no good offensive rebound finds beakman pman still with it swatted out of bounds Applause Music again well contested shots both these teams do an excellent job contesting shots a very long opening possession third opportunity for Virginia Ro cant connect and another offensive rebound maybe fourth times the charm bman draws the foul well early on rebounding was one of the issues uh for Virginia and they start this game off multiple Second Chance opportunities doing a great job on the offensive glass heres Jordan Miner hes emerged in the last handful of games for Virginia missed it there and see State finally gets the ball after more than a minute of Applause Defending take a look at the wolf pack starting five team trying to bounce back Casey Morel of course its the former who who opens the scoring for NC State and thats a great opening possession for NC State and Casey morcel you said it thats a beautiful Baseline Drive and finish and Morel swipes it away bakman the rejection Taylor cleans up the spill but Casey Morel has dominated this first two minutes playing back in John Paul Jones Arena of course started his college career here in Virginia for two years and now this is his third season with the wolf pack well defensive pressure this right here though just great effort on the second chance opportunity off the miss that time and again you cant ask for a better start if youre Kevin Keats on the road against a team thats a very difficult to beat at home Andrew roie hes had two good looks failed to knock either one of them down and this is DJ horn swings to Taylor DJ burns with it puts Miner through the spin cycle that rattles out no good and thats I think a key theme to watch Burns they stayed home no double team on that postentry Applause pass Virginia has now missed their first eight shots to start this Applause game shot clock down to 10 morcel on the Move in attack mode puts it up and it rims Music Applause Music out beep in to blow by gets to the rim lays it up count it plus the foul Rees beakman well he is so tough oh this is a difficult runner in traffic that time take the hit his eyes never left the rim and that is a strong finish by reys Music beakman again uh NC State uh theyre so good at pressuring the ball that time though Kevin ke talked about it straight line drive the help was there late so if youre Virginia you start the game shooting 0 for eight and yet youre only down one thats the beauty of playing consistent on the defensive side of the Applause ball heres Michael oconnell into the game swiped away beakman went through Miners legs great recovery by NC State and now its the wolf pack with the numbers okono scooped to the hoop thats a tough finish in transition by okano I felt Virginia on that fast break three onone they were really really too unselfish that time and NC State forced the turnover and KC morcel is really pressuring the ball on the defensive side Ean lines up a three Miss fires andc state had a foot on the line so itll stay Virginia basketball when we come back a defensive battle as we expected early NC State up 63 trying to build a tournament resume and I think the Log Jam the beating up that weve seen of each other in the ACC of turnovers and Virginia one of the better teams in college basketball uh right now theyre number one in college with the fewest turnovers only 82 turnovers per game they have three early on and think about that they only average eight over 40 minutes three in the opening five here against a Wolfpack team that gave them fits 18 days ago in Raleigh won that game handily by 16 76 60 and look how they pressure the ball again theyre fighting and then theyre trying to pressure every ball screen and also a pin down theyre trying to make it difficult for Virginia to run their offense thats two teams that run at completely different tempos Kevin Keat and NC State they want to go fast that time went a little too fast and turned it over Virginia obviously wants to slow things down and the one thing uh when we spoke with Tony Bennett that NC State does a good job of they will switch so pin Downs or ball screens they will switch and again that makes it really difficult when youre trying to run any actions uh their guys will switch and try to uh make you go in the opposite direction that you want to on that particular play Virginia started this game shooting just one of 11 and yet you only find yourselves down Applause three and right now the Cavaliers and Tony Bennett own the longest active home winning streak 10 and0 this season but dating back to last year its 20 in a row here at jpj difficult place to play in coach ke talked about that Inc State look this is a hostile environment and uh they obviously are very good at home D getting to the rim virgins gotten both of their baskets tonight at the r thats a beautiful move by Dunn great body control and showing off that length modara backing down done trying to spin his way free all ball Ryan Dunn dialed in on the defensive end oh there was no help coming on that one right there again Im just going to go man on man first you see who can win out and Dunn wins out on this one again two long athletes going at it thats a great defensive play by dun 5 Seconds to work with heres Taylor and trouble and now just 18 on the shot clock here for the wolf pack and watch how Virginia defends ball screens again thats going to be key in this game NC State likes to run a lot of ball screen actions pass Hees it up way too much on it and thats a shot clock violation they love that here at Charlottesville well both these teams uh two of the better defensive teams in college basketball and right now both of them making it difficult on each Music Applause end this game will very much come down to who can first find that offensive Rhythm and flow going to be easier said than done against these two talented Applause defenses n for three got it Isaac mcney who leads the ACC at threo percentage shooting better than 50 shows why there and what a screen that time as well too tapped around Harris emerges with it andc state has now gone three minutes without a bucket mcne the hot hand cant connect that Applause time thats great transition d by Virginia that was another key in this game when we talked to Tony Bennett he said look our transition D must be good against NC State and midd Brooks the transfer from Clemson misses the layup NC state has missed their last five at a scoring Dr of 3 minutes and 30 seconds here thats a pretty good look for Middle Brooks again two feet into paint but just unable to Music Applause Music Applause finish 8 seconds to shoot beakman dun lines up the three too much on it buchanons there goes right up with it didnt have the angle turns it over thats multiple shot clock violations caused by both these teams and again they do such a unique job in terms of how they make it difficult for you to run and that possession right there NC State just didnt allow the ball to get into the paint again great job forcing everything on the perimeter end result shot clock violation you know whats incredible to watch Huck is everything is contested not just the shots the dribbles the passes you cant take a breath without it being cont tested in this matchup and I think the key in this one in particular on this side for Virginia with a Burns back into the game how they double again when they try to isolate DJ Burns in the post lets see uh if they choose to stay manto man or double up pull up pop horn Off the Mark the scoring drop continues for the wolf pack its been nearly 4 minutes and 30 seconds without a bucket haris the floater too much on it Miner the offensive rebound puts it up and in Virginia on a seven nothing run well Miner has been great for them in this last three gain stretch but to start this game off hes been excellent on the offensive glass Virginia has nine offensive rebounds theyve catched in for a couple Second Chance points including this one and the whoos on a seven nothing run to take the lead here the first them to stay single coverage and you take a look at his uh profile a defensive player the year last year in the NEC the interesting thing though they played z uh we talked with Tony Bennett about that when he was at mirac he played they played a lot of zone so hes learning uh New Concepts and I think hes sinking in nicely well going manto man there against DJ Burns and gets the stop he has made the transition here in January and since he has come into the lineup Virginia has been a totally different team Miner getting it done on both ends as were talking about him and as the Cavaliers try to make it three wins in a row you point to well whats changed Jordan Miner it has and again uh physicality uh you take a look at him at the free throw line L right now hes built like a defensive lineman great build and thats something that they were lacking that physical presence in the post if youre walking around campus here at Charlesville you probably think hes a football player a great slate of ACC basketball continues on Saturday double header that tips off in blackburg with Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech and then NC State at Syracuse right now the Wolfpack have their hands full here against Virginia they started this game shooting three of six since then theyve missed seven straight shots well if youre in state I think you got to get DJ burn set him in the ball screen and then dive him to the post let him get a a paint touch a scoring drought that has lasted longer than 5 minutes and 30 seconds Casey morcel finally gets a bucket for the wolf pack well he has been the bright spot early on for NC State his pressure defensively and then now his ability to get into the point paint thats twice now in this game uh hes been able to dribble drive and get layups and the former Cavaliers is the one who ends the drought Miner goes Lefty up and in Jordan Miner backto back possessions where hes catched in morcel trying to answer draws the foul hell head to the line for two well I like what Casey Marcel is doing but you take a look right here at Miner theyre isolating him against DJ Burns at the F line again theyre not trying to traditionally post him up trying to force burns out on the perimeter and let him go to work from there nice designed play on the other end Casey Marcel has been aggressive attacking the basket early on you never know how a player is going to be when he faces his former team particularly on the road at the place he played last year morcel came into jpj and had 18 points so that will give him confidence coming into tonight well certainly hes familiar with the environment and again obviously theres a little extra added uh he wont say it no coach will say it but obviously going up against the former program where he started off at uh but certainly he has turned into one of the better players in the ACC you know he can defend but Ive been impressed with his Improvement offensively a lot of credit to Kevin Keaton staff hes got six of the wolf packs 10 and what has been a defensively dominated first half so far heres Leon Bond Off the Bench tried to squeeze it to mcne and it rocket it off his foot NC State ball well nice back door cut that time McNeely you know hes going to get a a lot of attention trying to come off screens its a nice cut the pass was just not on Applause Music point DJ burs calling for it and gets it scoreless so Applause far spinning comes up short Jordan Miners done a great job on burds key thing is hes not let him getting into to the paint hes pushing him outside the paint that time forces him into a tough Applause Music Applause turnaround heres Mig Dy catch and shoot Isaac mcne its what he does best his movement without the ball I would hate guarding him again he is just a NonStop motion thats a great curl cut on the other end though now NC state has found success attacking the paint again another dribble Drive helped Applause late Harris on the Move in trouble kicks to grov bond left alone he cant Applause convert Marcel MCN all over him this is some out standing defense on both sides a very few uncontested shots jump shots by either Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause side 5 Seconds to shoot Harris in trouble has to heave cant connect B round Miner with a major Jam well he has won the Battle of the paint and thats what Kevin Kei talked to us about at shoo around he said we must win the paint early on a miner has been the dominant force uh his energy and second chance opportunities created theyre really huge in this game six points to lead the Music Cavaliers stolen away up ahead oh my God morcel cant control it so EDC state has to settle it Applause down inside to burds his first bucket of the night and thats just a beautiful play that time nice action put Burns in the ball screen and then dive into the post beautiful turn around and as the young men weve tried to to work keep joy in the um in the practices and and handle the losses with perspective and handle the wins with perspective and then just you said just dont grow weary just keep putting another good practice and performance together great message there from whos head coach Tony Bennett that after the win on against Georgia Tech Saturday backto back wins for Virginia now trying to make it three in a row shot clock down to four deep three MCN Off the Mark but going back to Bennett Huck a message that needs to be heard not just by you know Virginia but all college basketball players that even if the results dont break your way continue to put in the work and they eventually will easier said than done when youre on a losing streak and certainly uh much better when youre on a two game winning streak but I agree with you wholeheartedly and I think a big reason why uh their rebounding has been so much better uh during this stretch an air ball from the former Cavalier and the home fans are going to let him hear it and on this side right here NC State again Casey Marcel continues to pressure of the ball and Coach Keats talked about Virginia being one of the better teams the last 10 to 5 Seconds of the shot clock scoring and said we have to be consistent and disciplined in our defense another offensive rebound Falls a Buchan and dun trying to keep it alive thats now 11 offensive rebounds for this Virginia team up ahead diara rejected Ryan dun got it again and it bounced off the head of di so its Virginia ball well just when I was going to say try to keep the ball in play to keep possession done swatted it off his head again just great outside defense that time and what looked like there was going to be a uncontested layup done come from the weak side and gain possession for Virginia unbelievable defensive play leads the ACC in blocks already has two tonight beakman trying to wiggle his way free stays with it so crafty ree beakman delivers and thats not bad defense By Di he looks like hes going to have to come out of the game but hes there with them for about a good 10 seconds beakman was trying to shake him and thats a tough I dont know if if you want to call that a jump shot floater but look at this again hes right there with them staying down not going for the ball fake and then right here thats just a tough uh jumper or little a short jumper that time through contact the officials are going to go over to take a look at the monitor at the contact you know whenever theres noses and elbows involved the officials feel obligated to take a look so well step aside as the officials review close competitive game in the ACC Virginia up Music four first season officials went over to the monitor nothing in it play on yeah I didnt think there was much there and initial again thats ree now if anything you can say again thats a charge re Speakman leading with that shoulder but again I think the no call and obviously uh nothing flagrant about that at all B easy decision for the referees NC state has struggled offensively 18 days ago when they beat Virginia they shot 50 in the first half tonight shooting under 30 only down four though right in it on the Rope heres middle Brooks driving into Buchanan ripped away by the freshman Music wide open Ryan done hammers it home Kevin Keats is hot right now just a breakdown with the defense and Virginia on a little roll up six six Kevin kes not happy after a defensive breakdown there and he knows his team can play a lot better than they have so far in this first half yeah and this is a important game obviously we talked about it the standings resume building for both of these teams and Kevin Keo has done an outstanding job uh with this uh NC State program he knows the significance of this game and certainly how difficult it is to play here at UVA again we talked about it the longest uh home win streak in college basketball going back to last year Applause and with quad one wins at a premium this is a big opportunity for the wolf pack on the road deep three Off the Mark you take a look at the remaining quad One games for NC State they dont have a quad one win yet this would do wonders for their resume and Jay we talked about it as well too though all of these opportunities at the exception of one coming up are on the road Applause Music Applause you Cannon and it drops in largest lead of the night for either team Virginia up by eight well Kevin Keats talked about ball movement against this Virginia team he said the ball must move left to right offensive foul DJ Burns who battling with the Cannon and its going the other way yeah and thats an easy one to call right in front of Ted Valentine thats an easy call to make he had his hands elbow up in the head Music Applause Music Applause area now this was a close competitive game for much of this first half Etc state has started to unravel at a scoring drought of four minutes its allowed Virginia to take a commanding lead here at the end of the first pman just lost the handle there turnover thats now seven in this first half for the Cavaliers team that averages only eight turnovers a game and credit NC States defense again when theyve had their opportunities theyve made it difficult for Virginia six of those points off of Music turnovers heres Conor Woods the drive missed the layup thats now five misses in a row the scoring drought continues for the wolf pack nearing five minutes without a bucket and thats just a missed opportunity right there again just missed the Applause layup heres Miner spinning everything but the Finish but it stays UVA ball the creativity by Jordan Miner to keep it alive and right now it seems like any 5050 ball loose ball is going the way of Virginia and certainly on the road again all these extra possessions for Virginia mean a Music lot 12 offensive rebounds for Virginia four of them belong to Jordan Miner and thats been the story of the game right now again Virginia a low possession team anyway and if youre NC State again you keep giving them those opportunities theyre going to continue to run Applause Music clock beakman in attack mode T in perfect position to tip it in they have dominated the offensive Blass a 13th offensive rebound and the defense is clamped down EDC State 5 minutes 30 seconds without a point and they throw it Applause away minute three left in this game first half excuse me in the first half key stretch right here for NC State trying to get this thing to single digits again theyre struggling to get the 20 in the first Music half Murray got Music it UVA on 110 run Applause BDS draws the foul trying to stop the bleeding here the scoring drought has now lasted more than 6 minutes for NC State and Jay theyre just having issues entering the ball and to DJ Burns right now again credit uvas defense theyre just having difficulties running their offense NC State Applause Music Applause Applause every Thursday womens basketball double header for you right here on acc Network tomorrow its Florida State at Cameron at 6 and then Miami at North Carolina at 8 that is tomorrow Thursday right here on acc Network Burns misses the second so just one point now for the wolf pack in the final 6 minutes and 30 seconds of this first half its allowed Virginia to take a commanding lead and the Cavaliers are looking for more Applause Music Applause Music here Applause beakman finds Groves for the three missed it but Virginia closes the first half strongly it is all Cavaliers impressive defensive possession off they did and I think a couple of areas we talked about the offensive rebounding I think also though uh the defensive pressure really they were disruptive against this NC State half court offense what needs to change offensively for the wolf Packers uh they got to try to get get uh this guy established right here DJ Burns let him go to work and then play through him burns musling his way through drops it in to open the scoring in the second half right on Q I think the spacing key on that right there and now Virginia again theyre going to be forced to make a decision as they get a 5sec count so again thats a great start coming out of the second end of second half for NC State again you established DJ Burns pick up a 5sec call gain The Possession back and NC State knows they can beat this Virginia team they did it 18 days ago in convincing fashion 7660 offensive rebound Parker denied he was really quiet in the first half the Freshman Dennis Parker Jr who had 15 points against UVA in that win 18 days ago key gang again right here Casey morcel continues the pressure of the ball again handling the pressure I felt Virginia did a better job late in that first half handling the NC State pressure shot clock under five mcne Morel all over him forces the airball thats great mantoman defense by casy morcel forcing a tough pullup Jumper by Isaac mcy Applause right back to Burns puts it up before the double team comes and DJ Burns has backto back buckets to start the second half his basketball IQ off the charts great passer and then he just sens the double team coming spun away from a quick soft touch beakman spins his way free right to the rack for an easy two Music and thats just too easy again you cut it the single digits no help and Reese vman drives right down again theres certain guys again maybe not get up on him force him to shoot jumpers but thats just too easy for Reese Applause beakman looking for burds has it here Birds just musling his way in and make it three in a row for DJ Burns decision again we asked Tony Bennett he said look were going to try to play single coverage but if he starts getting to go we got to start sending guys thats three in a row they got to send some help DJ burn starting to get on a roll now for NC Music Applause State taks it off to Dun now Burns has made three in a row but Virginias answered it on the other end a beautiful find by McNeely and theyre going to continue to go to DJ Burns now the problem is hes an excellent passer out of the double team so you better disguise your coverage double team came in stolen away by beakman Kick Out Murray passes it up right back to beakman Miner another offensive rebound and he cashes in Jordan Miner hes been a mtis on the offensive glass its the exact word to describe them he has been a menace on the offensive glass step back three Taylor goes begging the wolf pack 0 for four from Deep Applause today yet to make a three Music Applause Music Applause Music beakman into traffic misfired and its stays Virginia basketball with a fresh shot clock more of the same for the Cavaliers in control here in the second half of 12 the shoes True Blood herself three summers ago diagnosed with leukemia there she is with the Virginia head coach she teamed up with Ben Harold who they decided to just paint a pair of shoes and that is where shoes for Hope was born and you know its just so simple the act of painting a pair of shoes and hockey go such a long way yeah remarkable story and shout out to Tess had a chance to speak with that uh young lady this uh afternoon before the game and inspirational story and really I told her too I got to see if I can get myself a pair of those shoes as well too uh great cause and certainly again credit goes to Virginia and all these other universities raising awareness and much needed funds deep three off the mark from McNeely NC State still trailing by 12 they have been stifled on the offensive end all night long Taylor with dun swatting it away wins it to himself risky crosscourt pass Taylor got there before beakman and youre right that was risky that ball seemed like it was up in the a for an eternity and almost picked off right now again uh and State trailing by 12 but again the way Virginia plays you might as well double that again they run so much clock and so patient offensively very few offensive possessions for the opposition dun fading away hits it Ryan Music dun Virginia on an 82 run largest lead of the night Applause and midd Brooks couldnt hang on to the Casey Morel feed take another look at this Ryan dun move yeah thats a pro move right there again smaller guy on you Im just going to take him down low in the blocks turn around and just raise up high elevation on his shot thats a big time move by Ryan dun 107 rebounds and five blocks for Ryan done he has done it Applause Music all stolen away DJ morren whos still scoreless tonight still cant find his first bucket the Ste but nothing to show for it and the Wolf Pack have fallen into another scoring drought of longer than 3 minutes and thats a Miss opportunity right there again turnover your end transition again theyve had a few opportunities like that where they just miss Music layups the block Falls right to Don Fades away this time comes up Music short and Virginia has done a great job misses uh or turnovers and transition defense again thats so key in this game and they continue to force NC State into difficult Choppers and DJ horn last three games averaging 21 points per game tonight zero he has been shut down and as a result the wolf pack have looked lost at times offensively and thats what can happen when you come play Virginia particularly in this building where they own the nations longest active home winning streak of 20 games its just so funny cuz 18 days ago these two teams played in Raleigh in NC State they looked great offensively well I think Jordan Miner again I think that has been the key piece his emergence uh really in this last two to two game stretch uh for Virginia I think has been huge but I dont think anybody saw 15 offensive rebounds by Virginia in this game thus far I think that really has been the story line of their dominance on the offensive Music Applause glass heres mcney floated it up and stolen away Music well the one area NC state has been really unable to get to is the paint off the bounce foul called oh Connell went right into Harris there and they need more of this Jay right here again theyve been settling for jumpers contested with the exception of DJ Burns they have not been able to attack the Applause paint now Friday night the ACC brings back wrestling duels you dont want to miss it a top 20 matchup Friday 7 Eastern NC State and pit the wolf pack they got one of the best wrestling programs in the country thats s Eastern right here on acc Network Music dangerous pass morcel reads it the steel and the two thought he was going to jam it home and that change up by NC State and now theyre running and jumping again before they were staying straight man and now theyre deciding to trap foul called the Trap forcing the foul and thats a great change up by Kevin Keaton in NC State again theyre just trying to get uh Virginia out of their comfort zone theyve handled the manto man straight up pressure and now they throw a little twist at them as soon as they got the half court now theyre starting to trap Virginia needs to be conscious of that now in the half Music court Rees beakman back into the game for the Cavaliers on a great feed from Harris Buchan and lays it up in in oh banan has given nice minutes off the B four of Virginia hes done a really nice job finishing around the basket okono calling for it gets it feeds it into the Middlebrook whos fouled NC State battling on the road still down 12 oh theyre trying to hang around right here Casey morcel but with the steel 12 minutes to go Virginia in the driver seat leading NC State by 12 Jay alter Malcolm hucke with you good shoot around earlier today we were speaking with NC State head coach Kevin Keaton and he was telling us that you forget how much talent theyve Lo lost off this roster to the NBA and how hes kind of had the reload every single year it seems like TR quavon Smith obviously a bright spot in the back court not too long ago for the wolf pack who just the other night scored his first NBA points he did yeah Kevin ke shared that with us and two threes uh Na a win and certainly again having that type of talent but losing its certainly an issue but this guy right here I think casy morcel has been a bright spot uh for NC State in this game his defensive presence and that time a huge three Buchanan left alone everything but the Finish great hustle to disrupt Buchanan there Music Applause Morel leading the wolf pack with 10 gets it here his former teammate reys beakman all over him shot clock down to four morcel step back rims out no good offensive rebound Keeps The Possession alive and thats a great job by Middlebrooks Applause stolen away Harris but kept alive great Hustle by Thomas Buchanan delivers the block thats now seven blocks of this game by Virginia and thats not a good decision that time by Thomas again a new shot clock no need to force that shot beakman draws the foul look at the rebounding disparity there 38 to 18 and thats the story right there again uh in this game and thats something again that was a concern for Virginia coming into this one could they handle uh NC State on the glass that question certainly was answered early on in this Music game now two teams sitting at 13 and five both right on the NCAA t tournament bubble we said before the game this would be a critical game resume booster for the winner and right now its Virginia with a ninepoint lead andc State battling though still 10 minutes left in this game H splits the double team missed it middle Brooks in perfect position to clean up the spill and just like that its a sevenpoint game NC State hanging around in this one and its been because of their defense again theyre getting stops Harris pull up pop missed it and a critical defensive rebound the wolf pack have failed to close possessions this game they did so Applause Music Applause there morcel goes Baseline has a step and uses it Casey morcel against his former team you cannot go to the basket any harder than this right here right spot fourth NC State in this game right here beautiful pin down out of bounds underneath grown man move right here going to the basket he has been huge for them 13 points five of 10 from the floor to go long with two steals now the wolf pack Trail to this game by 14 right now theyre on an 112 run to cut it the five and the Catalyst has been Casey Morel the former Cavalier who transferred to NC State now back in Charlottesville Nick Neely missed it another offensive rebound thats a season High 17 offensive rebounds tonight for Music Virginia can they catch in on the extra opportunity Harris steps into it cant knock it down thats a pretty good look that time off of excellent ball Applause movement Virginia in a scoring drought thats lasted more than 3 minutes NC State on a Mini S nothing run but if you stretch it back to when Kevin keatss team was down 14 on an 112 run and you get the feeling momentum is Shifting here in Charlottesville it really has shifted and I think a big reason this guy right here with the ball Casey morcel both Applause Music ends 5 Seconds to shoot Jaden Taylor pull up pop great defense by Virginia and just not a good offensive possession by NC State late in the shot clock forced to take a difficult pullup jumper heres Ryan Music dun mcney for three got Applause it thats just a breakdown again Isaac mcdy one of the best threepoint Shooters in college not just ACC you cannot lose track of him that three ended a 4minute scoring draft for Virginia and DJ horn buries a three of his own an immediate answer for the wolf pack degree of difficulty off the charts of that last theyre going to call it a long two theyll review it in the break right now scored is a Applause two Music minute Mark to make his first shot and itll count as a three clearly behind the line so it is a fivepoint game with 702 remaining in this second half this has been a fun back and forth game Virginia separated themselves right at the end of the first half NC State is punched back brilliantly and now the wolf pack giving everything the Cavaliers could handle and thats a tough thing to do particularly here at John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville which is home to the nations longest active home winning streak 20 in a row and it is on the line in the final seven minutes here DJ Burns back into the game for NC State lets see how Virginia elects to play him if they throw it to him in the post horn with a step off the window rims out no Applause good Music now the thing that Virginia did early with Burns in the game they put him in a lot of ball screens and also pin Downs diara strips it away and slams it home Mo diara on a wreck attack Sports Center I put that one right there Ill put it in top five Big Time steal and finish his head was in the rim on that one my goodness and just like that a one possession game with 6 minutes remaining what was once a 14point Virginia lead is down to three burns the block NC State with all the momentum right now on the Applause road horn pull a pop missed it and a frustration foul Jaden Taylor reached in on the rebound take another look at this well you cant ask for a better finish right here diar showing off the Hops head in the rim Sports Center my goodness that is a big time Music finish the pressure Jay really uh in this last five minute stretch has been the key for NC State theyve been able to pressure Virginia and then get out in transition Miner spinning his way free missed the layup offensive rebound Falls to Dun and he lost it right back to diara Mo diara he is taking over and its a onepoint game again transition Kevin Keats talked about that but we have to try to get out in transition before this Virginia D can get set its taking him into the second half to do Music ITC State on a 143 run over the last seven minutes mcne that goes begging Virginia has fallen ice cold a scoring drought of three minutes here pull up Pap oono got it Michael oconnell fires NC State in front time out Virginia and thats the wolf Packs first lead since it was six to half but NC state has made that lead evaporate transition buckets their defense has put them out in transition right here backto back by diara first to steal and slam and then another defensive rebound get out and transition and here you have your game summary right here Jake despite Virginia dominating on the offensive glass they Trail by one a 163 run over the last 7 minutes and 15 seconds a mini N9 nothing Run for the wolf pack in the last three minutes Virginia trailing for the first time since he was six to five at the start of this game mcneel a three missed it and thats a break though uh by uh NC State again McNeals the one guy on Virginia Squad you cannot leave open hooked away MCN has it leaves it for Murray the trailer fires Virginia back in Applause front OK conell all the way to the rim and quiets this crowd down and thats two huge buckets of by okano prior to that the pullup jumper that time high ball screen no help by Virginia foul Music Applause called back and forth we go in the ACC and right here great denial by miner again in transition of the helping is not there and then on the other end okono beautiful dribble drive to help wi it a rare time straight line drive no help by Virginia two teams sitting at 13 and five a critical conference game and a resume boost at stake beakman the floater rolls in plus the Applause foul well you need your stars to step up at the end a ree beakman ACC player of the week thats a big time finish through contact again hanging in the air take the hit eyes on the rim the entire time and he cashes in the and one twopoint Virginia lead with three minutes to play the crowd comes alive to Roar on the Cavaliers defense Applause he horn dispossessed Virginia ball well the key thing right here now uh Kevin ke is going to get Casey Morel back into the game the former Cavalier who is a big Catalyst to start the comeback effort andc safe Trail by as many as 14 took the lead but now its Virginia clinging to a twopoint Advantage mcney fires and Applause hits Virginias made three in a row regained a fourpoint Applause lead two minutes left to play ripped away batted up in the air Miner could not keep it in play so itll stay NC State ball 9 seconds left to shoot well Miners doing a great job every time theyre trying to post entry pass whether its to Burns or Middlebrook hes getting a hand on that postentry Pass Time Out 55 to play Virginia clinging to a fourpoint lead and they have run some great offensive sets down the stretch and they have to communicate better NC State again on that curl a couple of possessors The Bigs were switching out they didnt switch no communication mcney comes off clean that cannot happen you either have to switch or hedge you cannot let him come off cleanly offensively right now NC State the postentry pass has to be clean DJ burn has to do a good job sealing minor into Morel the former cavaliere against his old team kicks it out to Taylor right to the rim missed it burns keeps it alive four and a three he cant connect who touched it last they say NC State this will obviously be reviewed and they got a pretty clean look Second Chance opportunity kick out horns wide open just unable to convert that three and the reps are going to take a look to see whether or not uh it went off NC state the rule on the floor was Virginia Applause basketball and based on The View we had I think there its going to be really really difficult for them to reverse this lets take a look yeah that looks like its going to stay with Music Virginia yeah even from that angle again right here lets take a look it was Ryan dun who put a hand in there but was that enough to say it came off of dun last instead of morcel Im with you Huck I dont I dont know how you can definitively overturn the call yeah thats I think thats the key thing uh is there anything clear on there and again I just dont think from any of those angles that you can reverse that yeah again that angle certainly looks like it went off of moreel a minute 39 to go end this game NC State trail for obviously youre going to set up your fullcourt pressure uh if it is in fact staying Virginia Music Applause ball and then for Virginia obviously youre going to work some clock going down the other end obviously mindful of NC state has ran and jumped at times uh end this game so any traps but you have to be good with the ball Applause Music Applause Music the home fans starting to wonder whats going on theyve seen it on the big board here weve shown it to you a few times the officials confirm Virginia basketball now we have had four lead changes in the last 3 minutes and what has been a close competitive game game down the stretch Virginia got up by as many as 14 thats usually a safe lead in this building credit Kevin Keat at NC State to battle back do they have a final push here down the stretch on the road NC State definitely trapping again you got to be good with the ball if youre Virginia dun smartly pulls it out Virginia going to kill Applause clock trying to keep the nations longest active home winning streak Applause alive shot clock down to five Harris great defense Jaden Taylor but he cant get the ball Tony Bennett is Applause livid they call a foul against the Cavaliers Tony Bennett cant believe it the foul called against Jordan Miner and lets see right right here ooh now again yeah I think its more the second action him diving into I think thats where the foul is the initial I dont think theres a foul I think what theyre saying is uh he dove into the back of the legs of horn and took out horn exactly and I think thats what they got him on nonetheless though the Virginia fans are not Applause Music happy now theyre reviewing the clock Tony Bennett will take the opportunity to go and get a chirp into the officials Applause ear they cant review the call they cant but I I think and thats huge again three more seconds on the clock for NC State Applause obviously oh in this situation right here J again a minute n left you dont necessarily need a three you got to go quick you have time to play through DJ Burns but again you got to go quick if youre NC State easier said than done going against this Virginia Applause Music Defense inside to Birds trying to spin his way free the Lefty hook got it to go DJ Burns cuts the lead in half footwork plin thats tough defense by miner a Jordan Miner cant play him any better uh he had him and then thats just a guy and DJ burns with soft hands look at his spin little Run and Jump hook and a touch thats a big time finish by DJ Burns again not bad defense uh by Jordan minor thats just a tough shot of by Burns andc state who only had 15 points the entire first half has put up 30 in the second half an incredible second half effort twopoint game 58 seconds ago Virginia trying to cling to another home win it would make it 21 straight which is the nations longest active home win streak and weve seen some home winning streaks go down in recent weeks and what that bucket does is allow uh coach Keats and NC State to sub uh defense to offense now you got diara and also Middlebrooks uh back into the game uh for defensive purposes and now uh burns on the bench but again a great end of game situational basketball right here by both teams twopoint game Cavaliers trying to cling to this win this is who you want the ball in the hands of reys beakman the goto guy all season for Virginia trying to break free Ryan dun almost followed it with a jam missed it what do you do here if youre NC Applause State you do that right there call time out to get DJ Burns back into the game again end the game clock management really has been good on both ends but right now Kevin Keats are really again managing the timeouts and situation to Perfection so if youre Kevin Kats and you trailed by 14 with 15 minutes to go you would have signed up for this situation only trailing by two on the road in a tough place to play a chance to tie with a two or take the lead with a three he uses his final timeout to draw something up yeah and again interesting DJ Burns not sitting down on that bench again initially I thought he called a timeout to get Burns back into the game offensive possession it looks like he is not going to be in again uh 262 seconds left you got to imagine its going to be something going towards the basket uh they have not had much success from the threepoint line NC State uh in this game for the game there two7 Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music 28 interestingly enough weve had had five lead changes tonight but we have not been tied since he was 0 they have it I think also if youre Kevin Keats youre also talking about if you miss and burns does come into the game so again youre going to play through him the question is does Virginia send help if they throw the ball down low do they dig or do they double or do they stay home I think you got to send somebody at him with the Dig heres Casey Morel the former Cavalier into Burns working on miner lowers his shoulder goes up doesnt drop there to tip it in Michael oconnell ties it at 47 5 seconds left beakman lost the ball morcel heeds it almost went and we are headed to overtime here at charlotts on the line wow and this one right here again Virginia still owns the longest home winning streak in college basketball and I think if you have told Kevin Keats youre going to give up 17 offensive rebounds in regulation and youre going to have a chance to win the game hed probably say no way uh but thats what this team has done so buckle up on a Tuesday night in the ACC overtime in Charlottesville and its NC State who starts with the ball in the extra Applause Music session guts the effort to battle back from down 14 to now Force overtime morcel denied by Music dun Ryan Dunn has been brilliant defensively Applause Music Applause tonight now heres done on the offensive end tipped in Jordan Miner clashing the grb class again hes been terrific six offensive Applause rebounds NC states trying to enter the ball in the post to DJ Applause Burns and they get it to him Birds doesnt drop Virginia basketball everything working through bomb Birds down the stretch for the wolf pack and this defense by minor again the big thing is hes forcing him into tough chots again uh winning that first bump and then forcing burns into a tough tough jump hook uh his defense and in particular his offensive rebounds bounding and this game have been huge for Virginia 20 offensive rebounds as a team Miner has six for the Music Applause Cavaliers deep almost lost the handle shot clock down to four Ryan dun explodes and draws the Applause foul Music well Jay what Virginias doing when Burns is on here again theyre trying to put him in ball screens and now NC State in a scramble of situation again a heads up play by Virginia theyre putting him in high ball screens or pend downs and trying to get DJ Burns in a defensive position again theyre trying to exploit that matchup double double for done tonight off the mark on the first attempt a foul shooting has been the one Achilles heel for done this season shooting under 60 from the free throw line got that one though threepoint Virginia lead with a little more than three minutes left in Applause Applause overtime morcel on the move step back left it short ripped away by Applause dun Murray left open for three buries it Tay Murray delivers from Birds going right at Miner and he misses it again how good has Jordan Miner been here at overtime well the key thing is again another shot by Burns outside the paint Virginia outscoring NC State 6 nothing in the extra session trying to close a home win which would extend the nations longest active home win streak to Applause Music Applause Music 21 and thats not a good foul that time by Morel putting beakman on the line close to 78 from the free throw line This is the front end horn hits it cuts the lead in half DJ horn from Applause Music three 96 seconds left in overtime that was a big bucket for the wolf pack back within Striking Distance beakman tried to create the separation and a foul Music Applause called so back to the line reys beakman goes after he just missed a free throw Applause and Beakmans doing a great job of snaking these ball screens again they continue to put DJ Burns in that and then Beakmans just snaking his way down the lane being Music Applause patient right back to burds this has been the set the wolf pack have worked through in the closing stages foul call Virginia had one to give NC State with one timeout remaining trailing by four 56 seconds remaining in in overtime Wolfpack roared from 14 down to tie this game and force the extra session Tony Bennett elects to take a Music Applause Music timeout good mental reset hu when you think of the Virginia players who up 14 in this building you feel like the winds pretty close to sealed and you got to find a a short memory to come into overtime wipe the Slate clean and go out and try and win this game its been a long time since somebodys won in this building uh outside of Virginia again uh its a gutsy performance I know Kevin Keats and staff they dont believe in moral victories but the performance just to even get to this position uh really remarkable youre right down 14 and this building feels like a call it 28 and they RI themselves back four down and theyve continued to play through DJ Burns I think they need to get more ball movement again try to get a little bit more ball movement go quick and then let him go try to get Cutters going to the basket but the defense by miner really again to keep him out of the paint again thats forcing him into a tough a little short jumper uh jump hook again right here not letting him catch the ball two feet into the paint and then forcing him again into another turnaround contested a short jump hook the defense that Jordan Miner has put on DJ Burns to go along with their offensive rebounding uh to me really has been the storyline in this Applause game Music so four different Virginia players whove scored here in overtime to separate by Music four yeah the rebounding disparity continues to Rock It Off the box score 5131 in favor of Virginia I give a lot of credit to NC State after only scoring 15 total points in that first half to battle back and score 32 in the second to even be in overtime but as you said you know no moral victories when youre sitting on the bubble and youve got a quad one road win there to try and take well triling four 56 seconds again Ive been impressed with the patience by NC State they need to get more Cutters though coming off DJ Burns again whether hes on the right block or on that left block hes a very good passer trying to get some more actions going on away from Music him and and then Virginia I like their offensive strategy theyre just putting beakman and high ball screens with DJ Burns morcel for three out of the timeout missed it batted around Murray has it and a foul called and so they elect to go to a corner three for Casey morcel again not a bad look but not a place where theyve had much success tonight shooting the ball from the threepoint Music Applause Music line oh Murrays been great tonight Off the Bench nine points and again right here out of the timeout again not a bad look but still plenty of time Im not sure you necessarily need a three in that situation sixpoint game andc stayed in now or never territory horn Hees the three got it DJ horn delivers again hes H big threes to keep NC stay in it when in doubt te it up wow contested step back three I mean the ones that they have hit uh the step back three degree of difficulty right here again look at this a nice little action and then right into that three contested by McNeely thats tough all of the threes theyve had have been contested in this game hanging around really has been the theme for this NC State team and DJ horn has all six of the wolf packs points here in overtime two big threes to keep NC State within Striking Distance Music Applause now depending on the lineup they have out here obviously McNeely beakman you want to keep those guys off the free throw line obviously if dun and also Miner are in the game for Virginia you want to put the ball in those guys hands if youre NC State trap get the ball out of MC or Beakmans Applause hands now weve said it all night in the ACC so close so competitive this is the seventh overtime game in ACC play this season and now Tony Bennett counters putting Groves Murray Harris mcney and beakman on the court all good free throw shooters m the Music Applause inbounder into beakman who finds Murray and Murray heads back to the foul line where he just hit Music two now two teams that came into this game knowing that this was a potential resume boosting win sitting at 13 and five squarely on Joe lonardi ESPNs bracketologist Music bubble and Virginia trying to cling to this Applause win and Murray has been huge for Tony Bennett Off the Bench in this Music game left to J Short rolls off the rim four point game heres oconnell horn Hees up a three missed it Miner the rebound up ahead Ryan dun seals this in style Lee Cel running to half court blowing play Applause dead you couldnt even can hear the whistle thats how loud it is here at jpj now Im trying to see whether what theyre looking now right here again Kevin Keats is mad he felt like uh they should have called the foul on miner or excuse me they were trying to foul Applause Miner and thats what Kevin Keats is talking to him now of there trying to foul Miner and Kevin Keats is like well what do we have to do to get a Applause foul again right here theyre trying to foul thats a foul hes trying to foul Miner in that situation and certainly thats the person they want on the free throw line if youre NC State and Kevin Keat is I think got a valid argument again they are trying to a follow him Casey morel trying to put Miner on the Music line horn missfires and that will do it Virginia wins in overtime and the nations longest active home winning streak continues here in Charlottesville
