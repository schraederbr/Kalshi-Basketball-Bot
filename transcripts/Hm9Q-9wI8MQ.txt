they are Lo missing three guys theyve had some injury problems this would be a a major type of win for them today and Duke this may be one of John it may be his best team and defensively I think it is his third years Duke K coach his team starts with the ball e Cel Tommy morresy Tony Henderson our officials teams that split a couple of very close games a year ago Georgia Tech on a court where it took down three sweet 16 teams ni defense Dongo with a steel to start the game and this is just about how it looked in the final minute of the game last year n George to Dongo that was the game ceiling duck this is the first pass thats some play to started out I mean Duke was patient and they just made a little mistake and Georgia Tech took advantage of it good team nine and two five wins in a row KH kiple hoping to get him going from three come on malawat on the offensive glass lost it and a turnover to missed the first two possessions for Duke they just dont understand why hes not shooting it better hes a great shooter 95 free throw shooter and he just can not get it going and thats something that dukee needs for a tech off the doo slam with Nate George as sophomore leading the ACC and assist Lance Terry their leading scorer mustaf a terrific freshman and Ryan Matos played very well in two games since returning to the team had been away after after the loss of his father dmbe Matumbo a couple of months ago on the drive mustaf got it on the rim Tyrese Proctor with a rebound for Duke starting five for Duke seon James making his fifth straight start with Proctor kiple flag who is fouled and malawat Jim Cooper flag coming off 24 points he scored 24 of Duke 68 in the win over George Mason and oh by the way nine rebounds four assists three Steals and a block hes going to do everything and this is what he does best go to the basket and you know get foul draw fouls very physical tough driver and hasnt shot the ball well and thats something that uh I think Duke as a whole I think thats what theyre looking for you know theyve got more Shooters this year more guys that can shoot and but they havent really shot it great and I think theyll capable of it flag of 76 free throw shooter ends a streak of 13 straight made free throws another thing you got to remember the first road game in the league oh things are different its just different when you go on the road different intensity John sh will have reminded his team of that this a place they lost about a year ago to the day early in conference play what was the first leag game last season for these teams Georgia Tech offensively what do you like for them you know they theyve had so many injuries its hard for them to get any consistency and they havent shot it really well either but theyve got five guys that score they all score 10 12 points so theyre theyre balanced and thats good in some ways but its also bad that you dont have that guy to go to you like to have that guy youre Ching the flats for Damon stmy and people really like the energy hes brought to the program recruiting has ticked up in a major way they were 14 and 18 but again had some huge wins his first year flag drives it turnaround shot rims out and rebounded by Ryan Applause matambo Georgia Techs getting off to a great start this is a good start for them George sophomore averaging six assists per game out of Toronto for pretty young Yellow Jackets core in a mataba over malawat follows his own Miss Ryan matambo denied it out typically when theres a matambo down there hes the one blocking the shot but B watch with a little D kimbe well we lost his father this year who was a great man a great player I know he blocked a lot of cuse shots I was right there watching him his Suns gotten better he struggled a little bit at Georgetown but he is getting better tech one for five to start deep shot clock for geord got the switch on the big malat flips it off the glass and good prayer answered that happens once in a while its a coach you just cant stand it when you play great defense and and that happens but thats thats thats basketball over a 75 wingspan for the bucket heres James very physical guard seon James the first D field goal I think hes been a good steady player for them hes uh he I think he f in I think he does the things they need to have done and uh I think you get a fouryear player you Proctors in his third year B Brown well see coming in as in his third year those veterans are going to help this Duke team George on the long possession against this Duke defense once again finds himself in the match up with malawat got a step on him lost control and then his prayer is short grabbed by flag he could be a one man fast break but Nago got back quickly thats what he does he takes it and goes kiple good look and good for three thats a big shot they need to get him going they talk John TR talked about it before the game today and you know he shoots it in practice every day so they know he can shoot that been just four for 18 three in the last four the potential lottery pick KH kiple Dongo its in trouble throws it inside but tumbo bails him out back to Dango shot fake and mumble with a stun very nice play you know you got the shot blocker there youre aware of him he made a great pass and thats what they have to do ryos first bucket Georgia Tech three for eight Duke two for four in the early going a Duke team that has done everything pretty well offensively nothing Elite flag misses a three thats a part of his game they hope will grow its not there yet 10 for 42 Terrys three not there as an answer and James with a rebound Hooper flag 0 for two start with a made free throw and tyres Proctor will score at plus a foul to take us to our first stoppage a Cooper flags got a point in a rebound here celebrating his 18th birthday its been a its like when the dream team played the college kids beat him supposedly in the first scrimmage and then the next day they woke up and it was different right well youve been around USA Basketball lot how many 17year olds even get invited no they dont they dont sometimes theres some young Kevin Durant was young when he came but uh its unusual uh its a tough Camp they bring in really good NBA players usually and then the great players threepoint play for Proctor out of the timeout its 96 Duke in the lead Malik Brown Isaiah Evans on the floor for Duke that shot left short by georgean saved by Brown in flag they make it hard for you to get a good shot you know everybody thinks they shoot bad against them but they they shoot bad for a reason the defense is that good flag ha as he typically is in the paint hell get to the line for two more and the foul is second against Ryan Mato Georgia Tech starting center you know he gets in there against big guys in colge imagine what it was like in high school when he got in there against 64 guys he just was dunking and throwing things up down hes just tough to guard down there hes just mobile he knows how to play and hes hes just if you get to him he he can pass it whats the next step in this game well is is its shown right here his his shot is good it looks good its just not quite there yet and thats the only thing he has to do its when youre in col when youre 18 years old the only thing you have to do to be a great NBA player is shoot the ball better thats not thats not bad he doesnt have to get stronger he doesnt have to get better with the ball he doesnt have to get smarter he hes all that he just got to and hes got a good release hell hell get better fourpoint lead for Duke projected number one pick JB and McCollum two on the floor for Georgia Tech right now Terry loses control to Proctor here is flag on the run and stop yeah he just hes different you got to enjoy him while hes here hes only going to be here one year oh he had that one that was going down too foul on Isaiah Evans terminated what would have been a pick six and what would have looked like one of these theres just nothing you can do with him in the open court I mean when they get turnovers and going that way you you just cannot play with Duke Duke only behind Tennessee in terms of adjusted defensive efficiency in the country theyre top eight field goal defense scoring defense and John sh said it to us the offense is behind but I dont mind that this time of the year no I mean their defense is going to keep them in every game even if theyre off a little bit their their defense is going to be good nice drop by The Freshman jadeen Musta really nice drive thats going against Malik Brown whos a really good Defender I know I had him I recruited him at Syracuse hes really good Defender and uh that was a big time move for a freshman freshman out of the overtime Elite program which is just a couple of minutes from here kipo P his second three and a good screen you dont see it but Malik Brown got him open with a great screen thats what Malik Brown does defense rebounding and screening if there were shot stats kept for deflections and screens leading to open threes be the top five well you know he was three in the in the League last year in Steels as a center and he just got another one another one they do keep stats of deflection to Duke they tell us he has 69 in 10 games what a tough finish that is Tyrese Proctor around the rim and the lead for Duke is Applause nine Blue Devils have hit their last four from the field at three will go big shot out of the corner dunan Powell you cant let these guys get away if they get away early its its almost impossible to come back you have to keep in touch first May three for Georgia Tech team that shoots it about 322 kiple will drive it this time into Malik Brown creating space and finishing with the left he finishes left better than right he uses his left hand better than his right hand thats what unique about him dke now seven for 10 from the field make it five straight makes for the blue Music doubles how just hit from three takes it into the teeth of brown and flag rips it away from Dongo had Evans for a moment now Evans will shoot it and Evans will hit it when Duke shoots the ball well from the perimeter I dont think theres Applause anybody here in mamers December 2nd 2023 Georgia Tech got out to a hot start first four baskets were threes LED 122 LED most of the away trailed late but by Dango with a goahead dunk in the final minute and the yellow jackets stunned Duke 7268 I know its a different team for Duke but it seems like John Shys team has got when you can rely on your defense when your offense is off a little bit thats thats how you wait only scored 68 Tuesday but they only gave up 47 for George Mason theyve gone through some prolonged scor scoring DRS this year not today six for their last six lead is 11 Damon STM took a timeout and sent us to the last break Georgia Tech has not had easy shots heres a drive a Miss from Lance Terry their leading scorer who still has not found a basket every shot is Applause H Caleb Foster boy theyd love to get him going for Duke James for three its good seven in a row from the field for Duke seon James with a three just a different team this Music year Powells hit one from the corner gets around flag nice Applause finish when the big guys out they dont have that presence in there the shot blocker Fosters this three snaps the streak of seven straight makes for dke Browns a really good Defender and gets his hands on a lot of balls but is not the shot blocker when the big guys not in the game and I say the big guy because I cant say his name oh you got it come on malat yeah malat I got that I should know that the really big guy 72 yeah Power pullup now he got fouled by flag in front of the Duke bench three free throws as Cooper flag gets an exclanation for Tony Henderson you just cant be near the threepoint shooter whether hes moving in or not you got to give him room to land the problem was of course it took place right in front of Coach Tri so he he had a good look at it but I as as did we as you can tell yeah I think its uh he moved in a little just enough second straight game flag has fouled a threepoint shooter tonight right here on acc Network in the ESPN app this is an ACC game now our Prime Time West Coast match at least half an ACC game with Cal against number 23 San Diego State Andre sty yakovich 20 or more at six of his last eight for I know you have to get used to this ACC team now its hard it is hard presidents have no idea what geogra I think they all failed geography in meico but uh they uh yeah its different but just think how many books you could have read on the flight to Berkeley thats true thats the only time I read is on the flight so I read a couple I read at least one full on just the way out little Zone here little try something different Dukes pretty good against zones because of their shooting and they rebound the ball so well so itll be interesting Foster fine extended for Mason Gillis getting his first time good good good defense thats sad for a coach they did a great job and a guy that you really probably want to shoot a jump shot shoots it but he makes it most of Mala watchs shots are dunks or layups extended range there for 12point lead Powell trying to keep Georgia Tech in the game hes got seven as that three swirls out strong driver cion James hesitation and an off hand finish for James and one probably go try our things I think hes right on that theres a lot of contact Zeon James is three for three for an early seven game high lead of 14 for fifth rank Duke Musta worms it around to George in and out for Applause three hesitation by Gillis was not shot at well this year little pressure when you come in as a shooter and you dont get to play a lot of minutes it puts a little extra pressure on Foster Gillis is open Gillis has a look Gillis too strong and malawat slams into Powell for a foul yeah its its tough you know Gillis play to Purdue used to shooting a lot of Threes gets in doesnt get many thats not easy to be in that position and John sh said hes been what they want from a leadership perspective the locker room but 47 at Purdue year ago right now hes just 8 for 31 its just the numbers when you dont get the numbers you know if you if you shoot Steph Curry went 0 for S the other night the next 70 takes youll probably make I mean its just the way it is when youre a shooter youre going to miss something you said it earlier we talking to John sh your son Buddy b 17 nonconference here and then 41 in the league that could of a shooter you want Mason Gill to keep putting him up yeah you want him to shoot I think Dukes a little Zone which I have not seen from them in a long time I think both teams are just playing Zone cuz youre here I they must I think they feel I need it or something I need to look uhoh here it is and thought he was going to make that hes on hit his first couple Mal watch on a de ties it up itll go to Tech but the Duke Ben to our right screaming as loud as its been all game its easy to tell energy when youre next to one of the benches but this has been a Juiced up to bench the first 12 minutes or so well when youre making shots there everybodys a lot happier thats just the way it works did you like noon games you know I I didnt I really didnt cuz I Im not a morning person I stay up late but when you do play him youre done and three you kind of feel good you dont have to worry about when its 800 you worry about it all day George on a slip for Dogo H watch is there to deter him Dango just couldnt get around him too big canle Foster was out of bounds so Duke will turn it over for the fourth time thats the worst thing a coach I I think you can see when it the Courts been painted for a 100 years its they dont change the lines theyre there and youre out of bounds Duke shooting at 65 but they know it step on the endline great start for the Music Devils love to see that you know to get your players involved Community is something that can last them a lifetime and its its a great tribute to him and you know as a player he just brings so much stability and hes not you know hes a team five team first guy he can score but hes solid in every aspect of the game what do you like about them moving him into the starting lineup for foster I just think its been good I just think hes a really proven player a really good player and you know I think Foster will contribute Off the Bench but I mean his kids ear the job I think its his hes got seven today three for three two rebounds and assists no turnovers theres Caleb Foster Duke is 11 for 17 from the field four for9 from three leading by 14 in a building they lost a year ago Powell already above his season average for Georgia Tech yeah hes been a bright SP Dongo has taken just one shot in the game his second will be short you know last year he was a physical presence inside and this year he looks like hes trying to play on the perimeter proor got three from the Malo screen missed badly he must have had a premonition which wasnt very good dke doesnt take many shots like that just kind of a quick look coach youre going no and then if it goes in you go oh yeah good shot nice play what I wanted all along yeah first foul on canle its Dukes fourth flag back on the floor four points on his 18th birthday couple of rebounds and assist D go three nice thats good like to see him get going I mean he had a great freshman year youd like to see him get going this year just is fifth attempt third make from three on the Year back to the zone work it into flag flag trips got rid of it to Proctor the late discharge looking for flag knocked Away by George and then George is called for a foul I dont know about that theyre both going for it but you know the Zone has been a little distraction for for Duke they havent really got it to where they need to yeah thats a good call once in a while they get him right just get that on a loop you saying thats a good call yeah I hate to admit that that they do they I I tell them all this is Its A Hard game to officiate its very hard but they get most of them right dont tell them I said you know its recorded go back and sound just between you me and the millions of people watchingo with a three his third thats what coach Trier said before the game they thought this is the guy we got going and maybe today hell go going and get going he is and its a difference in the game nine points for K kiple 67 freshman from Milwaukee looks it into D quick double team freshman mustaf will drive Dongo again starting to try and exert his will on the game against that zone again and you know he made a really big time move over the big guy thats uh thats very good for Georgia Tech to see that from him up to seven 21 against Duke in the win here last year James on a hard drive went right into Ryan mumo standing up with two fouls Terry and he flips it in really tough play great play very hard play the life care come on its Terrys first basket flag initiating malat well thats an overpowering mismatch on the 63 George and theyre lucky it wasnt a threepoint opportunity well thats what you do against the Zone trying to get in the high post flags a good passer he gets it down low and they scor really good fast break finish thats a tough finish by Terry thats Terry 15 and a half a game he missed all of last year or most of last year with a C injy for Georgia Tech malawat at the line rattles it Applause in should say it was all last year he was cleared to practice in December at Lance Terry but he decided to take the year and red shirt and he said it was good for him to see the game from coachs perspective yeah I think sometimes that works hes had a hes off a really good start this year and its good to have the veteran guys big guy comes out that opens it up a little bit for Georgia Tech to get to the basket if they can get past the initial defense free throws good for malawat who over 80 from the line Malik Browns back in Duke leading by a dozen Dongo again oh good take you like him being a little more aggressive yeah hes this is much better hit that shot and it kind of got him going a little bit and that was a good Music Applause move round for flat got a screen from Isaiah Evans and hit a three thats what theyre looking for when that Music happens hes you cant guard him you have you have to play off him a little bit mustaf Cowell Soares in to grab the ear ball and and patiently Powell no on the second chance stays with tech its a little different when big guys out of there they have to fight a little bit harder for the rebound theyre pretty small Dukes pretty small when they go with this Music lineup George at the inbound now six point per game score on the year hes got seven and a chance for more musling his way into flag and thatll be the second foul against Cooper flag John Shys going to call him over not take him out I never took a guy out when he got two I learned early in my career great player Derek Coleman when he got two if I took him out then the next game he wouldnt guard anybody bu after he got one so you didnt want come out so I I would leave smart players you can leave them they theyre careful they know what theyre doing some guys you have to maybe take out but some coaches take it out with two and thats it for the half I Ive never never felt that was a good way to coach but a lot of a lot of coaches think thats a good way John shy listening to your way hes leaving flag out there with two fouls 13point luxury Applause Proctor jabbing his way in Tyrese Proctor the option is flag h a three on the last possession drives it into traffic here and turns it over Cooper Flags got seven everybody has players with the transfer portal helps everybody and it helps teams that are down all of a sudden they get two or three key guys it happens you really see in football Syracuse just couldnt win any games last year we got a quarterback that Ohio State gifted us thank you and we won nine games and it just turned everything around and so you see it basketball too but everybodys got some players hes got the trans for James whos scored seven couple of freshmen who played really well today with him piple and flag 6 for 12 from three and theyve also been their typically St defensive team holding Georgia Tech to 3 6 Bo under the shot clock I think they let him shoot and he made it yeah they I used to say all the time you know you think a guy cant shoot but when you let him shoot they make them so dont let him shoot just his fifth three of the year The Applause Freshman flags on the bench right now with the two Applause fouls Gillis and Evans on the floor together heres Mason Gillis shot fake off the three elbow good thats good for him to get that going that was a really good move and get in and get a shot you can make a little bit easier than a three first basket Powell will answer theyre different when the big guy is not in there and when Cooper flags not in there theyre just not theyre look at their team theyre 64 64 65 64 and blee Brown is a really good Defender but hes probably only about six seven right on Q flag and malat and games all go to the scores table Yeah coach didnt like that layup this is when Duke gets super big but theyre not small because all their guards are 65 are up but when you go flag at 69 and malat by the way canle 67 play him with the two or the three they become super big yeah they look different when those two guys arent in there though theres your average height scholarship players all 65 are up for Duke malat will screen for proor and Proctor goes all the way and go to the line and you you know you really cant trust some of those sizes on guard sometimes theyre 64 and listed 66 too you you got to be Proctor definitely with his hair in 6 set right sure but uh yeah when those two flag is in there with the big guys its just a different Music team well college football playoff first round continues today two ACCC games SMU Penn State going on right now tntm Max Clemson Texas to follow after the games the Huddle crew breaks him down coach player interviews on acc Network and the ESPN app right now SMU trailing 7even nothing with the ball near the end of the first at Penn State know youre all of a sudden you look up its a 10point game you make a good possession here and now you think youre in the game again so thats that can happen quickly in college basketball Powell its already tied a season high with 11 he looks comfortable out there three to shoot it Dongo just PS it up a prayer is answered with 15 on the shot clock this is three or four times that Duke has played really good defense and the GU is in a really tough position not much contact there pretty straight up sometimes the offensive player gets off balance and isnt really fouled but thats kind of what that looked like but again you got to give them you know got to give credit hes coming back and hit the three got to the basket hes missed a couple close in there so you have to give Georgia Tech a tremendous amount of credit they were you know 13 14 points down in trouble and now they got a chance to get it back in again big big free throw here round it in makes it at 9 to2 run yeah I mean its basketball is a game of runs this happens and but its important to get the big guy out of the game hes a factor all the time theres malat a second foul as well so he is on the bench flag playing with two hosting Powell Powell knocks it away mum for Georgia Tech the other way WPS it inside and dungle finishes time out and this has been dangle I mean this is his comeback really hes been right there and Powells been tremendous they havent worried at all this has been a really good move back in this game a 15point Duke lead Less Than 3 minutes ago cut to five by Georgia Tech yeah I mean this is what happens in college basketball you get R and all of a sudden these things happen that was a great I that was a really he lost the ball and got it back and again I give Georgia Tech a lot of credit especially Dango and and uh and the ter I mean theyve been really good 122 run Damon Styers Yellow Jackets hit four consecutive shots off of John Shys timeout Duke ball with a minute to go Brown Dango tried to intercept that pass a cutting flag will flip it home little contact there too I dont know I dont think coach TR was happy with that n call there nine for Cooper flag Musta Strip by Brown flection King Malik Brown is always got his hands on the wall always Terry rattles at home I like the fight from this Georgia Tech Team this has been good Dukes playing well and theyve kept fighting dke can hold for the final shot half where the Blue Devils have shot 65 50 from three kiple turn around to strong and Georgia Tech goes into the locker room on a 144 run having made its last five shots looked like a runway for a little while keeper Flags but just a little bit just a little not a lot oh some are worse well you got another half left well see how bad it gets fivepoint lead for Duke yeah theyve got to Dukes got to get back in control the game and they kind of lost it thatll help canle for malat a slam to start the second nice pass very good play on kipples third assist he also hit three threes in the first half nice 20 minutes for him Coach Knight always said the first four minutes of the second half thats when you get got to be good and I think hes right want to be good skip pass Tango across the way and Terry finishes good answer they thats a big answer right there how about Tango is a distributor three assist to go with his 12 points oh this is the best that Ive seen from him this year I mean hes been really good Proctor has an open look and Proctor hits it long skip pass from cion James I think that both teams are into the game now and a little bit more more fluid on offense hares Proctors got eight Duke shooting 65 George against flag Give It Up to Musta the Tombo not a clean catch T hand Dongo into malawat Dongo puts his head down and left it short goodful Big 10 thats what they need from him hes capable of all that and he hasnt done it yet this year 114 canle right around his season average George couldnt finish off the window and then James throws it off of the knee of Doo you know this is off the dribble he doesnt do as much off the dribble thats thats good when you get a shooter to get into the lane and pull up thats a everybody says you dont want to take twos but those kind of twos I think you do want to take those are easy twos when you get in there kipple was a fivestar kid but with Cooper flag and Mal watch and the hype train he got a little lost in the shuffle and then broke out the summer and Im curious your perspective when you have a kid whos well known but not a top prospect and then all of a sudden a couple of games people go oh hes a lottery pick what what can that do to you yeah I mean I dont think hes a lottery pick I think hes a good player I think sometimes we get carried away when guys have a good year Good Start um its a its not easy to be a loty pick another nice pass two good plays and a and a and a good pullup really good plays hes a really good sometimes we just cant be happy to say this is a really good college player lets not talk about the lottery the draft yet I mean some guys just are really good college players and maybe they can move on but lets let be a little patient with them hes got four assists now kle two to malawat in this half malawat Walling up Dongo George in the corner no and kept Alive by Ryan matambo hell get it back too hot for Dango to handle you just cant you cant score inside when the big guys in there hes just too much of a Music presence grou with nine points and not yet three three full minutes theyve scored on every possession in the half flag is Applause Music bumped when you have a center he doesnt have to really score I mean its nice if they do but when a center can control the inside like hes doing it just makes it hard for the other team one of the better field goal defenses second best twopoint defense in the league as Mato blocks games just like his father I didnt see a finger wag at the end no well hes not as F that fou will go against Dongo is going in for the rebound and hes going to get called for it this is a good defensive play hes back and he comes up quick and gets the ball and gets the rebound as well first memory you have of the Matumbo uh they had him and Alonzo Morning they just blocked everything we we we said for one time we said okay lets shoot some jump shots lets not be going in there right away but I had a couple guys that could go in there Derek Coleman dumped down a couple times pull up for flag is good hes got 11 back in that zone Thats The Sweet Spot the middle is open and you if you dont if they come up they dump it down so zone is not a good answer against Duke theyve got too many many good passers too many good Shooters youre just not going to be able to play zone against them 90 run and a timeout Georgia Tech Music play off I know youre a big football guy who you got you know I I think its hard to pick just like its in basketball I mean Oregons been good but theyve had some narrow escapes all year so I think its hard I think Syracuse should have gotten in there they might have won but no I mean thats that might be it might have give Notre d a better game than Indiana did last night see flag could believe each with 11 Duke is 5 for six in the second half on a 90 Blue double run well theyre shooting 60 from the field and 50 from the three I mean theyre theyre theyre hard to beat when they shoot like that and theres another block from the big guy Georgia Tech hasnt scored more than 3 minutes over for its last five see the 20 for 30 number for Duke a lights out offensive performance I went to Syracuse my math isnt that good so I think that 66 six isnt it 66 6666 repeating for nice defensive play there by what was your major I think it was um Social Science History you know it was a good one when you start with I think it was I think it was yeah probably first of all that was 60 years ago you know major of basketball score in the SEC ACC challenge Duke had one of the two wins over Auber and then Clemson over Kentucky what do you make of the rest of the league right now under Duke its its really I like Clemson I think pit could be good Carolinas probably their history theyll probably get better theyve lost to really good teams um but the rest is its up in the air right now its just every year theyve said were down and I felt every year that we would do well in the tournament and we had five or six good teams and we have every year this is the first year where thats in question and the coaches are going to have to get things going and teams can improve we a long way to go but to me knowing the game knowing whats going on having a feel for other coaches other conferences its about you you have to still recruit but you have to have n and I think weve fallen behind in the ACC I think everybody knows that and I think that thats something that has to be corrected moving forward when the lawsuit gets settled I hope this summer I think itll bring some clarity to it but its about nil right now flag up the Miss couldnt finish K an uous threepoint possession for Kaman malawat hes got 11 hes really going to be a good big factor this year as the year goes along hes quick long athletic he got good hands good feel for the game Georgia Tech hasnt scored at 4 and2 minutes this is now the largest lead for Duke pow three he hit that one in the first half when they needed it now they really need it FL drive and going to be a blocking F no its going to be a charge after a discussion between and wellerson this the one of the hardest calls in the game hes moved and theres no way thats hes moving he moved in never never gets his position established I hate to be a referee but somebody has to we like you to be a referee I dont these guys are good theyre good rest but they miss calls everybody does Flags Music third now 5 minutes without a basket for Tech Terry not close to ending n what is it about obviously its the length for Duke what else makes them Elite defensive theyre good theyre get good position they get good position ball wise they stay in front of people so that theyre not putting their back court in trouble but when they do get beat they have the guys back there you know flags a big time shot blocker is you know you dont expect that from a perimeter guy that can do all the things he does but the big guys really good hes hes a Difference Maker Georgia Techs going to try to slow him with his Zone I think thatll be hard Evans is in the game flag for three malawat just right over the top of the TBO and then nobody guards Cooper flag no offensive rebounding always hurt zones theres nothing you can do about it and they get easy basket I like coach Ry leaves Cooper flag in theame the two fouls in the first half three fouls in the second half he leaves him in the game another ear ball for Terry we got a foul here well keep it with Georgia Applause Tech well we know he can do Music that big guys just such a Difference Maker he just really should say it was just an out of bounds call 12 to shoot a 14 nothing Duke run this ball thrown into the back for Terry didnt realize kiple was hot on his tail out of bounds hes going to go back to Tech with eight to shoot the K canle nearly stole that one and then Cooper flag gets a pat on the back for racing down the court big effort plays from both those guyss big effort plays when you really good and you play that hard its a difference it was Proctor who came sliding in so Tex got to go the Lan of the floor with eight to shoot JB McCollum yet to score today throw it up top and theres the Finish theyve been waiting for it ibraim Suare the red shirt freshman ends a sixminute scoring drought and a 14 nothing run and then kiple answers with three more hes coming out hes having his coming out party today on Cooper flags birthday not nice to steal the birthday Spotlight well he hasnt stoen that completely true Cooper did get the assist there hes doing all right for himself yeah hes doing five to shoot for Terry oh itll go against Evans his second Music cler and Gillis will come in flag and Proctor to the bench its a great opportunity to get these guys try to get these guys going in a conference game they got enough margin that you can get guys in there and get them to try to hit a couple get comfortable its its great opportunity in conference whether the league was up or down did you feel like something would shift when conference play started you know it its always different in conference play and you just you just have to wait and see how it how it goes this year were coming in as down as weve ever been nice three from the corner there the column theyve been waiting for him to get going so thats thats a good sign back from the percussion a couple of games ago DAV McCollum LED Oklahoma in scoring last year yeah hes a good player and he hasnt got it going hes out for a few games but they need him to play better there are a lot of good scorers on this team that theyve had so many injuries its hurt their Rhythm and and Duke is an exceptional defensive team they dont make they make it hard for nice play kiple with a takeaway and kipple will finish another timeout taken by Damon STM its a Music runaway to nipple has been really good this has been his half the shooting thats what theyve been waiting for hustle play hes got four assists and against a top 25 Nebraska team that game on acc Network extra a lot of ranked teams a lot of quality teams womens Hoops in the ACC mens ACC certainly lagging mahay in the early going Duke ranked fifth pit fell out Clemson ranked for a little while has lost to straight and Duke has Georgia Tech on the ropes here with Under 12 to go Georgia Techs having trouble getting a shot not just making a shot theyre having trouble getting a Applause shot nipple emerges from the prey here illis back from Foster get it out maybe a good stretch for John Shire to try and get Gillis and foser going a little absolutely absolutely thats what youre trying to do right now theyre both good players and you want them to have some success in a game even if its a a margin like this second half Duke not scoring Tech 218 flag has seven and a half nipple has seven and a half those two each with seven Tech with eight as a team theres a deflection by Mason Gillis how deep do you see Duke going barring injuries by the end of the year well these two guys can play both of them Evans can play and Malik Brown we got nine guys I theyve got minimum minimum of nine guys they can play Terry D in on Evans The Freshman holds up well and Evans running the break ahead of canle Evans denied and Chase down blocked by Suare stays with Duke in turn very strong move I mean heres a guy not playing much hed start for most teams in the ACC hes really a good player Evans is a really good player Malik Brown would start from most teams in the DC Music tremendous depth good on offense and good on Music defense phis with the foul there six freshman on this Duke team they had a ton of players transfer out Jeremy roach Mark Mitchell among them Jared McCain Kyle filipowski went to the ACC lost all that Talent ENT but John sh thinks this is his best team I know you share that yeah I agree 100 I think its his best Foster Dillis once again will drive it and hell finish this guys a really good player and hes play playing what about 12 minutes a game so I mean he just thats how good there when you got a guy like that coming off the bench Applause they have to play hard CU they know that if they dont theres somebody on the bench thats going to come in and take their place and thats a good thing to know another log possession there have been a lot of deep shot clocks in this game as D finishes theyve scored five or six times at the buzzer on the shot clock on tough Music Applause Music shots Foster Gillis Sev Brown Off the Bench along with piple facilitating and tripped up and fouled by George thats not what he does best pick and roll stuff hes more of a catch and shoot guy nipple and Evans will take a seat Gillis as well flag back on the Music floor as you said you didnt like to go go too deep in the bench but when you had a team that had a a key seventh eighth nth how would you try to keep those guys engaged that they werent playing as much well the eight seven and eight you can play thats a guard and forward and center you can play all night long and once in a while you can go to the ninth guy but its hard to you need to have a definition of whos playing and whos not doctor is it is it harder to find definition in the game than it used to be just because of the portal and the worry that you dont play somebody hes going to leave well there you know thats always a k thats always a problem thats nothing new if a player didnt play he was going to leave but its its the guys that are playing are leaving thats what the problem is today starters are leaving and thats a problem but sometimes its good like I mean roach was a good player Mitchell was a good player but I think they got better with the people that they brought in so and and those guys are good those guys are good players but it just looks like a better chemistry it looks like a better cohesive team overall and part of that is Cooper flag he kind of PS everybody he does a lot does a lot of different things which helps Lee Brown is an unselfish player just wants to set screens and roll hes not concerned about his points uh you know seon seems to be that way as well they just are much more cohesive as a team this year last pass it was the Foster 3 Suare commits a foul comes out its been noted by John shy and a lot of other folks how mature this team is for its age in flag and malawat have two of the five youngest players in D1 yeah well Cooper flags different you dont even talk about him in comparison to other players but Malik Browns and Junior Fosters as a junior you know bringing sien over here uh four four years at toan Powell trying to clean up his own Miss gets fouled it has been a really impressive second ACC game for Duke and Cooper flag delivering 18th birthday Joy for the Duke masses John sh said I hope he gets me a gift for the birthday got quite a few yeah hes hes thats you Music Applause w Applause 16 points four assists and the threepoint shot finally starting to come yeah when when a guy like himim starts making shots it just changes their whole outlook they passed they hes got four assists made a couple good defensive plays he even dunked one barely but he got it he got there hes hes really hes going to be a good player for this team he needed this kind of shooting night and uh and he got no question about it hes hes going to be a Difference Maker when you have somebody who is that good of a shooter and theyre not hitting shots do you always tell them just keep shooting just keep shooting you you you shoot you do them some do some shooting drills with them in practice and you say okay see its the same basket were going to play in you know its the same basket well get you that shot and youll make them and the good Shooters do they theyll make them eventually its its still worth what 10 games we games we in this season 11 games so theres 20 some games to go freshman with 43 of 69 for Duke kiple gets tripped up by mustaf by the way the last free throws for howwell those were the first points either Powell or Dongo scored in the second half they had 23 combined in the first well they were the difference in the first half and they just cant get anything going Dango is going up against the monster there so thats thats not easy but he did it in the first half he made a couple shots over them made a corner three but uh Im not sure why theyre playing n out there at the point hes uh hes really more of a shooter flag and canle on the perimeter right now pull it into Cooper flag locked by Dongo good play good defensive play mustaf barreling his way in illegally put your head down and go you cant do that hes a freshman too third foul on mustaf is there a right way to coach somebody to to drive into a Defender well you get you have to have an angle and you can go but once youre going straight at him theres no right way just cant do it three on moop 6 and a half on Tech tough finish by a proctor hes got 10 four out of Dukes five starters and double figures they just have too many weapons and I I give Georgia took a lot of credit the way they fought in the first half and got back in it but too many weapons here we go travel against George will turn it over eighth of the game by Georgia Tech its a great game for Duke you get on the road and youre playing in front of a tough crowd and you just keep them quiet you play good and you get everybody in the game everybody gets an opportunity balance has been a staple Dodge teams more so than never here in his third year by the way its his 400th game on staff today John Shire and Duke with him on staff obviously under Mike sheski for most of those years 308 and 91 theyre going to be 309 it looks like and Kaman malawat has been a big big factor well hes hes just a good player hes hes got good instincts for the game hes got good hands and hes got Good Feet he moves hes and you know what hes big sometimes they list guys at 72 and theyre seven hes 72 I think I dont think theyre cheating on his size he he has a standing reach of 98 which doesnt sound like it should be physically possible well I remember playing against Patrick and Matumbo and M morning they had the same thing it wasnt fun drive by Proctor malawat and a foul may have been before he went up how many 72 guys did you coach legit 72 thats probably not most guys are 611 even the SF Footers are 611 but some guys theyre 611 play 72 you know theyre longer and quicker you know you dont get too many 72 guys started playing at age 13 malawat join the NB Academy Africa in 2021 actually played in the Olympics this summer with South Sudan well the future is coming from Africa 20 years from now the majority of big guys in the NBA will probably be from Africa just scratching the surface over there right now theres an open shot they dont get many of those Daven McCollum hits it he was so surprised he was open that he may he almost didnt shoot it Duke just doesnt give him much they just dont give him any shots geia Tech 39 from the field they actually shot it better than that from Three 6 for 14 flag slips somehow kept his dribble alive yeah Im not sure how he did that shoot it and to the shot Applause clock kle fighting hard hell be called for a foul thats the seventh on Duke flag is going down a couple times he gets a little bit sideways and kind of gets off balance and stuff hes look hes hell get better at I mean sometimes we think that these guys are there hes a long ways from there hes really talented hes really good but hes going to get a lot better he works hard he understands the game and he hes got all the skills balling passing skills you need and hes got a good shooting stroke uh its just its going to be fun to see a guy like him as he develops very few guys now in college can go right to the and make a big impact its hard to do those guys people dont sometimes realize how good those guys are Cooper Flags a guy they might have a chance to go in there and do something right away sometimes people forget like Kobe Bryant took a year or so you know most guys take a year or to to get going very few exceptions LeBron you know might be the exception a couple guys but this kid is he just does so many things even if he doesnt shoot well he can help a team and he defends Chris Carells Dukes associate head coach said he could score six points and be the best player on the floor oh 100 100 nice drive by kiple give him 18 yeah keep flag scoring is a bonus in for him he he does so many things to help your team switch is on everything he can help on everything he can block a shot really good passer I know comparison can be the thief of Joy but but are there players he reminds you of that versatility I mean he does so I mean he does so many things uh you know I mean not that hes better than a lot of guys he just does more things in college I mean how many I Michael Jordans a great player Kevin Durant they didnt block shots I mean they didnt do some of the ball handling things they were primarily scores in college this guy is a pass a rebound comes across block shots I mean he just does a lot of stuff that we dont see we just dont see it Evans three so people what theyll take out of this game the aggregators will say Jim beheim says Cooper flag better than Michael Jordan and Kevin dur College not really he does more things is what we said oh dont worry somebody will oh yeah absolutely 100 under Ford timeout its been a terrific day yeah thats thats I want to wear the auto wants one game with Duke and him Coach K wear the Duke bu devil but I dont think he would I never really asked him I dont think he would have you want you wanted to be just as Auto during the game no no before the game before they G and you wanted yeah Mike to come out as the Blue Devil the Blue Devil I never asked him I dont think he probably probably would Im guessing Im guessing he wouldnt maybe hes sitting in homeone I cant believe I just found out about this now I totally would have done that Id be very upset if he is cuz I really wanted to do that you should have you should have pushed it harder I know I were friends for a reason I dont ask him to do things have you worn the auto costume ever not just before yes I did you were Auto I did once I forgot it was a while ago but I did I I am not ashamed of it I wore it and you you dont know what the occasion was no I dont remember it was a picture thing or surprise thing something I love uto nobody can talk bad about OT I love UT love OT greatest orange circular mascot all of sports ever and a fruit and of course one of the great fruit mascots along with the uh I dont know banana slug of UC Santa Cruz half half fruit yeah thats Gs gonna run out of time shot thats tough P curious so uh I know you didnt ask John shy to wear the blue devil but did you see John Shire as a player did you try to recruit him no he we didnt recruit that much I tried to recruit Mark aguire and after that I said were not getting a guy for money here so that was it was it that was it foric and he made a half shot against us too and had 30 on us so yeah John was a really good player good shooter smart Applause player Elite Brown for three come on hit it its not his strength but hes he can make that shot hes now one for six on the year hit the one against Kansas luk has emptied the bench a little bit here Patrick gungas on the floor Darren Harris who by the way are both fivestar freshmen who are basically relegated to to garbage time as deep as his team is yeah theres Georgia Techs not going to even get an easy shot now thats thats the thats the problem Georgia Tech shooting at 377 number one field goal defense in the ACC number three in the country Duke Applause better days ahead for Georgia Tech his team still not holy without Luke OBrien they without kaasi Reeves today Gan onu freshman is out personal reasons yeah hes got to get everybody back and you cant go by these games when you play a team like Duke you just cant you have to just forget this game get ready for the next game its not going to be like this D STM who was obviously a phenomenal college player at Arizona long NBA career and is in his second year as a Georgia Tech head coach did you ever coach against damid no we um played Arizona yeah I think we did I think I did Coach against him I think we beat him I dont know how but I think we did not many did his time there mustaf Dongo second half his first basket by Dongo he beat Arizona home and then next year we beat him in Arizona I think he was there for one of those years but they were good it was one of our better ever Road victories he uh ended his career second alltime leading score at Arizona by the time he left school Brown thinking about another one he was a really good player I think hes a very good coach too I mean this you know he he gets his players to play hard he understands what theyre doing Ive watched him coach in practice hes going a very good basketball coach and and as is John charotte you know when you get to this level of coaching you probably got a good idea of what youre doing its not like theres bad a lot of bad coaches out there theres a lot of good coaches out there free throw good for Evans Cameron Sheffield has come in for Duke STM was at Pacific for 5 years which is not a job where you typically win a lot and his last full year they were went 23 and 10 yeah yeah he did a good job there went to the Celtics as an assistant for a couple of years after that near to it Georgia Tech they have another great Freshman Class coming in they have some really high level recruits the next couple of years hoping they can build something been a good little run for Georgia Tech Athletics a football team had a nice year beat Miami going to the Birmingham Bowl womens team is 120 they play at 530 today against Nebraska hoping the mens team can move up after for ACC game number two but this ones going to belong to Duke as most of them will conference for them its going to be very hard to beat this Duke team I mean the league is down as weve talked about but a three for Isaiah Evans 10 most programs in the country would give anything to have a guy like that he might not play much if at all here thats the challenge you when you go to do if youre not one of the can be really good and not play a lot its just the way it it works still active defensively Evans getting the tip Its s GBA messes with that shot Duke can dribble it out a 56 shooting number for Duke today their second ACC game a blowout a building where they lost last year and they were never close to it today most of the people standing our Duke people by the way it was a
