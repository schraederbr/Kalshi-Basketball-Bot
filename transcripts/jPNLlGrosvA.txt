manto man and this is Wiggins and an early look hter for sheflin wide open 20 and3 of the year for Ian cheff and Georgia Chuck talked about that today not getting too far off and he got too far off and he getss a wide open easy three mate George sophomore from Toronto Canada operates the offense for Georgia Tech one of the best in the league in assist Javen McCollum by Dongo on the pick and roll out of the corner heres Lance Terry missing with the three and the rebound for Suarez George right back to the rim scores on the layup Nate George averaging almost 12 against the conference and hes been really good the last few games so hes a Difference Maker now hes scoring not just passing hes right there in the lead and in assist in the conference but hes starting to score now Zachary looked at shefflin fires it to lockin jump hook rattled out lockens been a really good addition to this team he gives him a big that can score George a pullup jump shot and that spins out his end of the floor tigers in transition Hunter is dangerous here coach yeah I mean hes they dont run a lot but when they run they usually get something off it locking a standing three that bounced out Hunter got the offensive Applause rebound youru balls he love to get them locking tried to help eight to shoot for Hunter against George hell fire a three back rim missed third try for the Tigers no block Wiggins a three thats spun out L of wide open shots theyre going to start going down pretty soon lob intended for Suare from George deflected out of bounds itll stay with the jackets you cant keep giving Clemson those shots theyre going to start making those theyre good Shooters good shooting team one of the best in the ACC from the threepoint line yep Clemson comes in they are number one in the ACC just under under 39 behind the line they are fourth in conference play at 39 McCollum with sheflin defending thats a three and its good boy Javen McCollum who was five of 11 for a dozen with four steals in the win against Louisville puts Georgia Tech in front much better hes been much better than he was in the beginning of the year lockin had it bounce Away George to the deck and a whistle and foul going to be called here and it is on shefflin his first and the First on Clemson looked like me like he went down and then he kind of got touched a little bit but yeah a little contact there little contact George is kind of thin little bump and he went down theyre going to call it that sheflin out of the ball game here early Dylan Hunter has checked in for the Tigers Terry Baseline heres George from the corner another three thats good what Georgia Tech hit eight threes in Saturdays one Over Louisville and two of their first three field goals are from behind the line different team than they were early in the year when we saw them Wiggins up strong and scores coach what about them is different obviously their shootings improve their scorings up a little bit as well well guys that werent playing good are playing good for one thing theyre healthier and you know they theyre just shooting the ball better and thats a big factor Hunter missed the dunk McCollum the rebound missed opportunity there George to the trailing Lance Terry down the lane theres nothing worse than that Miss a layup give up a layup at the other end I mean its just thats why coaching is so much fun locking a three good 15th triple of the year those shots theyre going to start making those shots almost four minutes gone here in this first half Georgia Tech with an early twopoint lead on Applause Clemson George backs out lobs for Suare and turned over to Wiggins hard to do that against Clemson theyre good help defense inside got a big mismatch inside Hunter tried to get by McCollum heres Wiggins a long three and the Tigers win yeah take the lead on a three by Chanty Applause Wiggins McCollum threw it away trying to go to George thatll get up to a timeout a 6 nothing run by Clemson the last one a deep three from near the tiger paw from Wiggins for death yeah good place and again I paid which is power for the course Clemson will have the ball as we get started here out of the timeout and substitutions both ways Christian Reeves has comeing to replace Victor lockin in the tiger order he doesnt get a a lot of playing time so its important that he does some stuff out there Dylan Hunter the younger of the hunter Brothers in the game and heres Zachary a triple from the left and Duncan Powell whos been terrific the rebound and the outlet to George that Zachary knocks away to prevent the easy transition basket for Georgia Tech what a block and Lookout here on the lead coach look like he hit him on the arm and I think he did but referee was a little out of position heres McCollum pull up jumper blocked by Hunter we said a moment ago he does a little bit of everything for him good player Zacharys really helped him hes given him really stability on defense and he can make a shot Dylan Hunter tries to weave through traffic What A Catch by Chase here goes Chanty Wiggins attacking poell eight to shoot for the Tigers Chase Hunter tries to rck pull up three out front back rim Miss Reeves tried to keep it alive itll belong to Malla they talk today about making it hard get into him and they made it hard on Chase Hunter hes not getting easy shots Hunter 0 for three heres Nathan George a front rim Miss Long rebound will stay with the jackets and Powell shooting onepoint lead were 6 minutes into this first half Dylan and Hunter all the way through the Music runner and Powell tried to save it but did to the Tigers Chase Hunter a three got it theres are his first points of the ball game and thats where you get an open look off a offensive rebound you save the ball in your own basket it doesnt matter where you throw it if you throw it to them theyre going to get a good shot Clemson up four George pull up at 15 is good they get that big man and the big doesnt come out hes going to make that 15footer yeah Nate George is averaging almost a full point more against the league Chase Hunter missed the layup thats two hes missed Yeah couple fresh string misses by the tiger star and keep playing hard on defense and here he goes to the other end layup good thats when you do that when you have a disappoint this and you come back and you make a great defensive play like that thats shows me you know he didnt hang his head he came back made a great defensive play and thats what you want to see from your best player CLS him by Applause four Applause McCollum heres Terry with five to shoot on a hard drive and Hunter going to get called for the foul itll be his first and the second on the Tigers Chase Hunter checks out of of the lineup and Damon stms in year two in Atlanta and of course a very decorated playing career All America at Arizona terrific Pro in the NBA for years had a couple runins with beheim every once in a while as a college player yeah I didnt like him usually hes pretty good Nate George has got tell you what coach Nate George has done a nice job here early thats what hes been doing yep picked up nine now on his fourth field goal he leads Georgia Tech fact he leads all scores in this first half Baseline for Wiggins Christian Reeves the rebound got to find somebody to bail out and its Jake Hy breeder had it poked Away by Dongo theres Wiggins cutting in the lane around Powell had it partially block Reeves collects it from behind Dongo made the save two to shoot Wiggins off the Baseline slapped out by Reeves hi breeder gives Clemson another crack at it offensive rebound extra possession boy Georgia Tech trying to stick with him defensively Wiggins a three yep eight for Wiggins second three they did a real good job defensively didnt get the rebound twice so I mean thats just a death sentence heres George and now Music McCollum fivepoint lead for Clemson T to shoot for the jackets George a runner with a right hand off the glass at in boy what a terrific start for Nate George Jim hes keeping them into the game by himself I mean without him theyre in big trouble in this game hes just been terrific H Hunter a fallway couldnt knock it down George a pull up three pumps going with a lot of their bench early here was just in a little bit and now theyve got the on the drive Music Wiggins Hunter hi breeder attacks slips it inside and it rolls off for Reeves Duncan po pulls the rebound away pumps is missing a lot of pretty easy shots so far tigers are just seven of 22 from the floor Applause unofficially Georgia Tech meanwhile seven of 13 George a Fall Away got it boy theyre getting the switch the big man is just not coming out and theyre not hedging theyre switching and hes just backing out and shooting a 15t jump shot theres a brad Brown Elon out hes seen enough under 10 to go in this first half Chase Hunter made a defensive play and a transition score but at the other end the story of this first half for Georgia attack her teams got a onepoint lead here Nate George has been the early story for Damon star huh hes the whole team right now hes just playing terrific on both ends but hes hes the guy thats scoring heres hot breeder off a a back pick he couldnt pull the trigger you know you come out of the timeout you get your shooter a shot hes supposed to make that 10 straight double figure games for Nate George he didnt wait around to get it tonight heres Lance Terry for the lead and to two for Terry its his second field goal and Georgia Tech back in front of Point locking on a dump for sheflin whos back in the game against Dongo now shefin to work and good boy what a rugged tussle with he and Dongo at the at the Block they went at it they let him play and he made the play they go back and forth here now ahead of nine minutes to Applause play 15 to shoot for George and a switch with sheflin Dongo missed the jumper shefflin the rebound Ian had 16 points six assists seven rebounds four steals in the first meeting against Georgia Tech heres lockin who hit an early three Zachary slides to the baset scores and draws the Applause foul you dont want a double team down low make him try to make a tough shot what do you see coach well he just the double team gives Zachary the opportunity to go and he gets by and gets to the basket and gets to gets to the line again good pass from the big guy but you dont want a double team down there hes going to make the right pass Zachary has a free throw spin out rare Miss from him against the conference fifth best free throw shooter in AC play Terry a three long rebound car himed out Suare collected for Georgia Applause Tech George for Terry hell take off down the lane against locken had it blocked Zachary the deflection Jaden Zachary with Powell will slide it back for hi breeder three got it what a look by Zachary really smart really smart Damon stmy punches a timeout hes really upset with his teams defensive transition just a terrific pass from Zachary to high breeder tigers by six e hes went at NC State and you and I were talking today what a great job hes done here but he shouldnt have been and now hes proven what kind of Coach he is so Georgia Tech I think its Lance Terrys basket that is now a three its just been changed to a three for Terry well double check that and ball out of bounds its a travel for Georgia Tech thatll send it back you cant do that so theyre changing fifth turnover for Georgia Tech by the way lost the ball he didnt really try to pass it I thought you could recover it but the ref gave the signal that he passed it oops here still by Dongo theyre going to get the points anyway y they got first basket for by Dongo eighth best rebounder in the ACCC thats called basketball Bo right there they intervene so Clemsons lead is just three after the adjusted score during the timeout and the steal yeah and thats right locking with eight to shoot Terry trying to help him the Dig Down against the big fella missed the jump hook rebound shefin fresh 20 went right back to the basket and going to draw a foul and shoot a couple of free throws Applause offensive and theres conversation you see the Dongo pick and flush and lets see weve got is this a question about who who committed the foul I theyre going to the monitor here for something is whether the knocking shot hit the rim that then was possible shot clock violation before the score I thought that there was Applause I think it goes back to the Victor Lock and jump hook it looked like it hit it Im with we saw the play but were not usually right on review anyway so here is the first shot oo thats close the ball changed Direction at all here cuz thatll be what theyre look for what do you think coach after the view the team still had 23 seconds to shoot shoot the ball so we have two shots for okay thats the shot the jump hook over here just Applause Music raised it was it was not easy to see that hit the rim from Black second foul on dun and Powell by the way that got lost in all the uh investigation of the shot so heres shefflin at the line for two and that rattles out dont forget weve got ACC Network basketball tomorrow but were going to look ahead to a week from tomorrow Stanford Georgia Tech and Atlanta at 7 Cal visits Duke late night thatll be where coach bam Cory and I will be at Cameron to see the Golden Bears and the Blue Devils I can climb up to that yeah boo youre looking for oh youll be fine Ill be good yeah six for sheflin lead is four for the Applause Tigers George to Powell for three boy Duncan Powell who was on a burner when Lance Terry was hurt he was really good hes good right there Georgia detecta within a point Hunter clutched on a deep three hell drive through lost it and theyll go to the deck and possession will belong to the yellow jackets so Duncan Powell knocks down his 243 here coach and then hes looking right at the bench wow you I dont think you can do that unless unless he didnt say anything maybe maybe he didnt say anything well go with that close jackets to within a point heres Powell into traffic tend to shoot Fall Away on sheflin and Hy breeder the Applause rebound locking quick bounce for shefflin threw it by him and Victor thought it was deflected it was not so its turned over to Georgia Tech substitutions both ways Wiggins back for the Tigers Suare returns for the jackets this was relatively not many turnover game until the last couple plays here onepoint lead for the Tigers heres Music Applause McCollum 12 to shoot into traffic double clutch and foul going to be called on sheff thatll be his second third on the tigers with 539 to go partisans here dont like the call of course hit him a little bit right there on the Music shoulder and theyre going to give no free throws here no Baseline pass Applause Music okay Dongo collects and back for George on the cut the catch rattled out for Bongo get on the Applause board Wiggins at 15 ft back rim Miss Suare box out of lock in for the Applause rebound McCollum and then turned over to Hunter Chase thought about the pull up tried to go to hi breeder and Dongo and McCollum have collided Dongo almost killed his own guy and McCollum slow to his feet here he got he got hit yeah theyre going to get him out of the ball game George with a dribble in 13 to shoot here McCollum still hadnt look for the ball hes in the corner Georgia Tech playing four on five and Ibrahim Suare gets the basket to put the jackets in front McCollum has gone down down in the corner here they got to stop the game heres Hunter a three its off the mark Wiggins the rebound back for high breeder and now were going to get a stoppage of play as both Brad Crow the Clemson trainer and Richard Stewart Georgia teex basketball trainer are down tending to Javen mallum I dont think they saw him go down over there because they gave it too long if they did see it thats a rule Ive never agreed when a guy goes down that hard you have to stop the play can he went down hard Im just thinking they maybe they didnt see it yep and cuz he kind of walked down the court but once he went down youve got to stop to play they always say let the team run the I dont not when a guy goes down like that so with 421 to go in this first half and theyre going to take the under four here I think well step aside at Little John Coliseum they tend to jav and McCollum its a onepoint Georgia Tech lead e e Music a onepoint lead for Georgia Tech at 2827 and you see Javen McCollum is being helped from the floor here and were going to kind of go back and were going to show you theres the collision with by Dongo and McCollum stays down now Damon STM according to referee Matt Potter who visited with us during the break said go ahead and play and so you see McCollum go down here in toward the corner hes going to end up toward the left corner of the floor in the Georgia Tech possession and they throw the ball inside to Suarez who gets the basket so the ball starts back up the floor and then McCollum goes down and Matt Potter said they turned to watch the ball they didnt see him they never saw him right they never saw him he if they have seen it they would have they would have called so the collision with Dongo and mallum oh boy what a hit he got hit Y man if that had been a hit by the Clemson guy it would have had to be something so the ball is going to belong to Georgia attch with 421 to to go here in this first half and the onepoint lead after the basket for Ibrahim Suare so Damon stmy without Javen McCollum whos averaging 14 against the league and left the floor with a threepoint basket Clemson has missed their last four shots and theyve got three turnovers in the last 245 and the Tigers and jackets are fitting themselves for a fairly competitive opening 20 minutes here that ball touch last by Clemson so itll stay with Georgia Tech with 20 to shoot and Terry will Loop it all the way out for Dongo against Dylan Hunter and heres Nathan George 10 to shoot George for three and its good what a first half for Nathan George hes just so improved from the beginning of this year 16 in the first half for George Chase Hunters having a down night yep Tigers who now Trail by four Dylan Hunter got the roll first bucket for the Junior Hunter its still an 82 run by Georgia Tech for this twopoint lead Dongo for Lance Terry Terry looking for help now Dongo against lockin remember sheflin on the bench with two fouls theres the fallway by Dongo suar the rebound and Zachary took it from him hell ball called by Kip Kissinger goes to Clemson so Nate George Jim is on fire in this first half with 16 hes just hes getting free hes getting his looks hes driving hes making passes this guys second assist guy in the league too so but when hes scoring like this thats such a plus for Georgia T and the other guys arent having good nights so its a hes keeping them in the game right now seven of 10 from the floor 16 first half points for George Darion Sutton has come into the ball game for Georgia Tech to spell and heres Chase Hunter left all alone for three good wow eight first half points for Hunter and that was deep his brother wanted to help him and he got him a great look Tigers back in front brotherly Applause love Terry back for Powell and another three rebound by Wiggins Dylan Hunter there goes Wiggins into traffic thats going to be a hand check on Sutton that was a hand double hand to the B Darion Sutton will draw his first freshman from St Charles Missouri its the third of the half on Georgia Applause Tech Zachary trying to get it in bounds Ops for Miles Foster whos checked in we havent seen much of him no first time weve seen Foster tonight hes averaging inside of five minutes against ACC play did not play in the first meeting seven to shoot for Chase Hunter squaring up with Nate George heres Dylan Hunter on the drive with Terry took the contact flipped it up and thatll be a shot clock violation so itll go back to Georgia Tech on the fifth Clemson turnover this first half Georgia Tech got six in nice job defensively theyre making it hard on Applause come heres George Terry getting Baseline now to pow quick ball movement heres George with t to shoot good recovery pow on the the drive the scoop and score for Duncan Powell jackets by one with one 17 to go really good defense but better offense there heres Hunter Wiggins thought about it into traffic with the right hand hes been really good thats 10 for Applause Wiggins and Dongo frees up George and then a foul called on Wiggins as Dongo got it back going to the bucket Chanty Wiggins his first fourth on Clemson another look at the offensive set here with Applause Powell he had nothing there he made just made a great play oh my God referees made a good non call back here on this screen Zachary kind of faked it a little bit so these these three guys are really good final four refs by Dongo 60 at the free throw line 57 in conference play and the first one no good dont forget weve got a Another Sunday afternoon of womens basketball will start at noon Commonwealth class Virginia Tech at Virginia and then coming up at two Notre Dame number three in the country with the great Hannah hadalo welcomes Cal to purcel Pavilion 200 presented by food line its for you on acc Network Dongo second is no good Dango hasnt been what we thought he hasnt made that step up had a great freshman year and he really hasnt made that step up Wiggins tried to get it inside that ball got knocked away locking for Hunter out of the right corner and the rebound for Terry Chase cant get going onepoint lead for Clemson 25 seconds to go in this first half George Frozen dribble then turned it over 6 seconds to go heres Chase Hunter with four Dylan Hunter out of the corner for three rebound stick back Zachary no and the tigers are going to take a 34 33 lead here to halftime coach missing a lot of easy shots they theyre going to start making some of those but its Nathan George Nathan George is just keeping him in the game he terrific game 16 first half points for George Chase Hunters got eight Chanty Wiggins has 10 for the Tigers Clemson try else to go Dango is the guy that surprises me he was so good last year he was right on the verge of being the best freshman in the league and he just hasnt made that step up you know you see the summary one tie eight lead changes five was the biggest lead for both schools if youre Brad Brownell and Damon STM what are you talking with their team about as the second half starts you know Shins got to St Shins got to stay in the game hes out with foul trouble hes a Difference Maker down low Wiggins has been really good they you know Chase has been okay but they need more from him and Zachary has been a contributor offensively but not tonight yep they need to get 810 out of him and Chase needs to be better and then then thats when theyre at their best Jaden Zachary hell take Nate George as we start half two in the 148th meeting all time between these two tigers have won two straight five of the last six the loss was a double overtime defeat to the jackets in this building locking on the Applause Music rejection heres Chase Hunter on Q for two thats the way he needed to start Terry just takes the ball sometimes and goes from 25 ft that gives the big guy a chance to come over heres George firing again that rattled out sare the re rebound and a foul on lockin thatll be number two on Victor lockin Tigers doing things at both ends here coach yeah and this is a great block hes made two great blocks and just like the first one they get down the court Chase gets a good open look coming off the big man doesnt come up the big guys are need to come up on those heres George inside Suare missed the dunk Damon St on one knee across the way just drops his head heres Chase Hunter back for sheflin locken thought about it Hunter on the attack with a right hand locking the rebound skips it back out front Wiggins will fire back rim Miss of a three thats the shot you want to get Lance Terry fifth year senior from College Park Georgia started his career at Garder web playing for Tim Craft whos now the head coach at Western Carolina lockin picks up the foul thatll be his Applause third and the second of the half on the Music Tigers hes he dropped his arm down you got to keep your hands straight up if you keep him straight up you can bump the guy soon as you bring that hand down theyre calling free throw by Duncan Powell no good Dylan Hunter replaces Victor lockin Georgia Tech comes into the ball game at Applause 649 as a team at the free throw line in conference play that is dead last in the ACC you see their regular season numbers and Powell missed them both theyre 0 for four tonight Ultra hter tried to get the ball screen couldnt Dylan Hunter back for Chase tend to shoot tried to wrap it around shefflin caught it on the deflection left open and then Dongo slapped it out of there five to shoot itll stay with the Tigers he had the drop down Applause pass pretty athletic play by bad Dongo coach but he had the drop off he should have passed there Applause and now all of a sudden we got a stoppage of play in a review here so the question is did the shot hit the rim four and a half to shoot here almost two minutes gone in the second half and Matt Potter over for a check the shot was complet right I didnt think it got to the rim did it no it didnt even hardly get out of his hand so they didnt need that review this should be pretty quick if we can call it then its they definitely didnt need the review right thats right although I always thought I could tell a little better from 50 feet away than they can when theyre four or five 2 seconds so were going to put the game clock at 1810 and 6 seconds on the shot clock all right so 1810 on the game clock and six to shoot so it wasnt about the rim it was about the timing mechanism of when the ball went out of bounds and how much was left yeah the the clock ran two seconds you know thats the difference six to shoot and Clemson will have it on the Baseline with Applause Zachary for shefflin boy what a leaping catch against Dongo hell wind go to the basket with a right hand and draw the foul on Dongo I believe the sophomore from Western senagal by Dongo first and that is the first of the half on Georgia Tech this is a really good play just not much time on the clock just go to the basket contact oh no he needs to do the Jaden Smith thing so sheflin first of two dont forget ACC gymnastics coming up Sunday afternoon number 22 Clemson number 23 North Carolina theyre at Carmichael in Chapel Hill coverage starts at four on acc network shefflin is now three for four at the line hes got eight points and four rebounds tiger leads grown to five two minutes in yeah you got to keep it cant let him get away from you especially in here Zacharys really pushing up on George hes not letting George get anything theres Terry on the drive and it rattles in what a tough shot and make for Lance Terry those are the shots you look at no what are you doing and then okay its good seven for Terry that is a tough shot Hunter sheflin heres Dylan Hunter who replaced Victor lockin after he picked up those two quick fouls to start the second half and and theres a foul on Darion Sutton thatll be his second thatll be the second on the jackets here in the half this is a really really hard hard shot man its good as long as it goes right thats a hard Applause shot here goes Zachary into a double team and took a hand in the eye and thatll mer another whistle and thats going to be on Sutton as well get your players under control third on Darion Sutton and the Third on Georgia Tech Zachary I think is uh I love to sit in here the student section because you start to wonder these kids actually go to college some of this stuff they come out with yeah so Ibrahim Suare is going to check into the game to replace Darion s Zachary Brad Crow the Clemson trainer checking on him after the inadvertent hand in the face from der on Sut there its nothing its just Zach on a baseline out of bounds play Sutton got two fouls in about what 30 seconds if that yep there goes Zachary made to shoot lost it on the dribble to Suare and a foul will be called Matt Potter gets Jaden Zachary for his first its the third foul on Clemson in the half Techs doing a good job of making Clemson put it on the floor thats not what they do well in the beginning of the game they were missing shots but they were running their offense and getting good looks they just missed now theyre dribbling a lot and thats not really what Zachary does or thats not their game heres George tried to rip one inside Terry lost it over the end line last Touch by the Tigers coach heres the other thing too the the the complexity of the game what looked like it would be a highscoring game at the start is now kind of turned into a grinder here well theyre not shooting well but both teams are good defensive teams they really miss D Suare recovers second field goal for Ibrahim Suare you have to remember these two teams are defensive oriented teams theyre coaches theyre defensive oriented coaches Dylan Hunter its a onepoint game again after the Suare Music Applause bucket heres Wiggins three ball from the front back rim Miss shefflin to rebound and a foul on Duncan Powell would be his third thatll be the fourth on Georgia Tech Damon stmy doesnt go particularly deep to his bench and Sutton has three and Powell now has three and Javon McCollum is out of the ball game with the injury in the first half Geor Tech still has two or three guys that have been out all year practically and now Mallen being out really hurts heres Wiggins against Suarez into traffic goes Wiggins back inside and it rolled off the back iron theyre just not good at backing guys down and scoring there Dongo the rebound and here is George on the attack Nathan George a pull up two is good thats his thats where he wants to get to he wants to get that midrange and theres nothing wrong with midrange you know theres too much emphasis on the three hes getting right there George had 20 in this building a year ago and a double overtime Georgia Tech win hes got 18 tonight 15 to shoot for Chase Hunter working against Dongo trying to beat him on the drive and does Dylan Hunter his second basket every basket is pulling teeth in this game its nothing easy Nathan George going to start the offense hes been a lot of it tonight Terry for Powell out of the corner for three and a long rebound for Music Wiggins Zachary Wiggins again ins Chase Hunter a shot fake and into traffic and missed the layup Powell the rebound for Georgia Tech jackets trailing one were 5 minutes old in half two Chase Hunter has to get offensive mind hes their best player Lance Terry Suare gives Georgia Tech an offensive chance George on the drive in the air now Powell with eight to shoot into traffic scores and draws the foul muscle up basketball from Dylan Powell coach he just stayed with it the whole way and wasnt going to be Toni foul is going to be on Dylan Hunter itll be his first it gets us to a timeout Georgia Tech has taken the lead on a dig down score from Duncan Powell back to Little John Clemson and Ryan Matumbo likewise for Georgia Tech as Duncan Powell is going to tow the free throw line here to see if he can complete threepoint trip coach yeah you know it really hurts mallum being out its uh hes such a factor for them and Powell misses the free throw Reaves the rebound jackets are now 0 for five at the line 0 for five yep its not a number you want to hear or talk about Dylan Hunter on the floor remember sheflin out there locking on the bench with the fouls heres the kick and the throwaway by Chase Hunter and Chase almost reminding himself to slow down trying to get maybe too much too soon there no I mean it was a good play he just didnt look he looked away instead of just looking at him and throw it to him yep Nathan George defended by Zachary Zacharys in him big time hes really being physical with him now the switch in the mismatch Matumbo defended by Zachary as George has shefin now heres Reeves thats a mismatch eight to shoot step back three Nathan George and Matumbo the rebound gives Georgia Tech a second try Powell into traffic and Dongo over the rim pushes it back in what a finish by B Dango that was almost in the cylinder pretty close here is hter circle now Zachary Georgia Tech by three heres Hunter Clemsons just one of their last seven sheins three front rim Miss George the rebound this a good opportunity for George to take get a good shot right here and Nathan George obliges but Reeves the box out in the Applause rebound and heres Hunter now Jaden Zachary shoots to Tai off the mark Dongo the rebound for by Dongo not scoring as much as he does coach but affecting the game in other ways defense and rebounding lockin Wiggins and hide breeder go to the table for Clemson on the next dead ball Nathan George got Zachary off of him kicks for Terry oh Powell winds into the lane Fall Away on shefin rebound pulled away Chase Hunter Clemson one for their last nine and its some missing but some defense too its a lot of Defense Chase Hunter the shake and the three ties the game wow you cannot back off him you have to make him drive and theyre just backing off there bad look for Ryan Matumbo Hunter ties the game on the Applause triple tiger faithful to their feet here in the Coliseum George for Terry four to shoot leaner at the foul line rolled out Dylan Hunter saved it good defense again Applause Hunter oh my God and now Zachary out front settle down settle down Powell switches off onto Chase Hunter he cant guard him out there hes going to heres a screen bounce past Zachary with four takes George into traffic Fall Away in the traffic Reeves the rebound Christian back with the right hand shefflin couldnt time the rebound Terry collects it for the jackets thats the one you throw back out Chase Hunter standing on the threepoint line wide open heres Nathan George Lance Terry for the lead Reeves another rebound T getting a lot of opportunities Applause here trying to get something for Chase Hunter here there it is and he rolled in it dead leged off the back of the iron and fell in 16 now for Hunter that ball on a live Rim is at half court so by Dongo shoved home a Georgia Tech Miss to give the jackets the lead and now Chase Hunter tees up a three so Clemson returns Victor lockin now Jim in the lineup with 107 to playing with three well they havent gotten much out of Victor hes been in foul trouble down the stretch he should be more of a factor I think George with Terry Dongo Powell and Ibrahim Suare on the floor for the jackets heres Lance Terry shefflin on the switch Terry a step back two is short and locking clears the rebound him under 10 to go now Wiggins on the drive had it blocked and here goes Nate George the other way in transition and tter slapped it off the window Dongo back the other way and hes fouled thats a play of the game right there that should be a sports center deal hunter with the block and then he picks up the foul on the carum to Dongo and and thatll get us to a timeout but what a defensive effort here and a hustle play by Chase Hunter just a great block unbelievable block so Terry the block for Georgia Tech and at the other end Applause Music Hunter seven from the floor gy and have gone four minutes without a field goal well you know this is the kind of game your Clemson youre 184 you find in your home you find a way to win this game somehow and George George Tech could help himself they make a free throw that would help there that theres one y but this is the kind of game you try you find a way to win and get to the next next game you know its not your best youre struggling but you find a way first conversion of the night for the jackets at the line and Dongo hit them both so the lead trimmed to one here and Jake Hy breeder has com into the ball game Zach and Dylan Hunter on the Clemson Applause bench shefin for high breeder against Nathan George heres lockin against Suare and thats going to be on Ibrahim Suare he had him in good position he didnt need to reach its the fifth on Georgia Tech its the first first on the red shirt sophomore from Applause Guinea and the inbounds for lockin heres Hunter nice pocket pass for lockin skip to highy breeder Wiggins will fire back rim Miss look at shefflin collect skip it for Chase Hunter yeah it right there Lance Terry out trying to help theres Suare on the double team High breeder eight to shoot beats Nate George to the basket skips it back for shefflin now lock in a three and shefin tried to keep it alive and going to commit the foul thatll be his first of the half and his third of the ball game six now on the Tigers boy Brad Brown Ls team got great looks here Jim yeah theyre just theyre not making them tonight I mean they started out making some in the first half but theyre struggling inside and outside now here comes Zachary back in the lineup boy Jaden Zacharys done a terrific job defensively here in the second half on Nathan George they need him to score eight to 10 points tonight hes got two but hes a really good defensive player hes not letting George get anything Powell against shefin lines up takes it to the basket scores Georgia Tech back in front and Pos got nine well poell and Terry see that George cant get anything and theyre taking charge which is what you want your veterans to do heres Hunter back for locking to the basket blocked by Dongo out of bounds another terrific defensive play by sophomore Bango really good defensively and heres the pow basket to put him in front locking inside the up and under only the second field goal for Victor lockin they need him to get going they need to get Hunter a couple open looks 8 minutes to go onepoint game again George Dongo the catch Baseline Suare block lock it and a foul going to be called on Victor Lock and itll be his fourth all theyve come here in the second half I think its over there isnt it couple shots coming four on locking when we come Music Music back gotten good shots early in the game well maybe theyll no you know Miss missing some easy ones theyre nine of 29 from two tonight Jim yeah they theyre theyre making n of 25 from the three which is okay we live with that but they cannot make twos here is Suare at the line he is five of 21 this year theres almost no chance he was making that one its a onepoint Clemson lead Id say this is less than 5050 Ibrahim Suare Red Shed a year ago how about that oh good Im happy he made that I tried to reverse Jinx some tied at 48 now look at you getting into worrying about the media Jinx Im not really I no youre not Zachary with Chase Hunter Jake Hy breeder Ian shefflin and Chanty Wiggins that ball got deflected out front High breeder for the lead Off the Mark Terry the rebound boy Duncan pow wanted to train transition chance and they didnt get it to him yeah he wants to go one one against hes going to try to get the ball yep Zachary against Nathan George uses a Dongo screen the L and Dongo the flush six and the half eight in the game for by Dango STM Myers team back in front ahead of seven minutes to go Wiggins quick look shefflin the catch and score they work on that high low play this morning at 800 and thats thats a great play for them tied up at 50 under 7even to play George to work again now Powell against Chase Hunter T to shoot Powell thinking about taking hot breeder 17footer missed everything Bongo wanted it inside and he had the little guy on him and he just should have probably got it in there one more look at Nate Georges setup here for B Dongo coach great pass he cant get shots but he can make that pass so were tied at 50 Hunter to work all the way to the basket took the contact from Dongo and hell shoot a a couple of free throws second on the sophomore from imoro in Western Sagal its the sixth on Georgia Tech and Chase Hunter who Ive always been told really good Shooters are 54090 guys right thats a really good shooter Chase Hunters 50 from the floor thats fifth in the ACC second in free throw percentage at 90 hes number one in threepoint percentage coming into tonight I figured thats why you brought that up free throw by Hunter gives him 10 and a half you coached a lot of really good Shooters whats the whats the similarity in all of them they got good releases and good grips on the basketball and they practice a lot thats what they do so Hunter now with 18 in the ball game 10 here in the second half tiger lead is two again Nathan George trying to free himself from Zachary now Dylan Hunter switches off Zachary or George the pull up it goes and hes fouled Dylan Hunter going to get called for his second its the eighth on Clemson Nathan George has got 20 tonight and a chance to make it 21 at the line look at this shot Jim this is really hard and he hit him too right on the arm Ill give you my C are once you grab the arm you might as well stay with it and make him make two free throws cuz theyre going to call that so George will go to the line hes 81 its his first trip tonight thats the first time zackly hasnt hasnt been on hes got 21 now hes really improved from the beginning the year we had him early in the year and hes just Music different Georgia Tech back in front of Point under six to go hunter for hi breeder boy he was left too open shefin will pull the trigger three good theyre making threes they just havent been able to make twos seven and a half 13 now for Ian shefflin Clemson back in front two Dongo for Powell against High breeder theres Powell hell knock High breeder over offensive fouls is fourth pretty headyy play by Jake hod breeder here coach well he never got really square but he was there so I guess thats what theyre going to do theyre going to give him that he he just put his head down right at him yeah do that goer Hunter go back for shefin one hard dribble into traffic back for hide breeder in a three what a turn there he was waiting he was waiting and the lead quickly to five Applause time out two theyre making threes and they cant make twos and but that again this goes back to when youre good youre winning games you find a way in traffic Dongo lobs for Powell and B bothered it will be turned over to Georgia are to Clemson he got it he got the ball and it went right back off how about that fivepoint lead four and a half to Applause go o e i Applause e hter Terry helping Suare was looking to help on the double team there goes Hunter right corner Zachary a shot face now going to skip it for Wiggins out of the corner for three and loose ball finally gathered by George they need a good shot here Nathan George on the drive Terry for the tie I know and a second chance here for Georgia Tech jackets are eight of 25 in the second half Clemsons eight of 24 there goes pow on the drive he lost it but High Breer stepped out of bounds theres 10 to shoot well he hey Julie they had mayonnaise on the burger for him today thats what my wife does cuz shes from the south thats right they treed you right its been a bit of a grinder here in the second half hadnt it heres George thats a two and Dongo tried to clean it up and I think lockin just committed his fifth well see nope theyre going to tag yeah they did get locking thats five hes had a very short night yeah about 17 minutes hes going to foul out with 334 to go in the game that is the nth on the Tigers I think Nate George got fouled just on the play before that but they didnt I dont think they well I know they didnt see it so lockings done tough night for Victor by the way as coach told you dong go to the line hit two a moment ago he not helped himself El from the what they call the free throw line theyre four to Music 11 and locking now out of the game and you see sheins got three Powell has four Darion Sutton who is not on the floor for Georgia Tech also with three and Dongo got the back end he is three for six at the line fourpoint game three and a half to go dangos got 97 rebounds tonight solid very solid couple good blocks here is shefflin Tigers had a lot of momentum at both ends before the timeout Hunter for shefflin three ball back rim and Terry pulls it away he had the shooter in the corner too George knocks Zachary over no whistle Terry a three ball and they go for the rebound dangos got it and hell throw it back up on the glass Suare the rebound third chance for the jackets inside three minutes to go and a fourpoint Clemson lead George slipped and went down threw it away to high breeder and Nate George is shaking Applause up and theres a foul by Suare on Wiggins oh my God let go go Nathan George took a nasty spill on a damp spot near the foul line he got up hobbling Im not sure why they dont stop that hes hurt theres no fast break yeah so why dont you stop the clock stop the game right there so the foul on Suare stops the clock George is still on the floor and Damon St told Suare to foul Wiggins to stop the clock or to stop the play because George was hobbling but hes still in the game so yep one and one here Chanty Wiggins 74 first free throws of the night good 11 now for Wiggins so you may have seen the note when hes 10 or more Clemsons undefeated well thats not thats an unfortunate foul situation where you you know youre you cant give away two points here trying to push the lead to six it would be the biggest lead of the night for Clemson and he does Wiggins now with a dozen and a half dozen rebounds heres George and a foul going to be called on Zachary in the corner itll be the second on Zachary its 10 now on Clemson so two shots for Georgia Tech on every common foul really good officials but that is exactly how hes played him this whole half and George will go to the line for two 20 toight for the sophomore from Toronto and the free throw good 22 now on his second free throw he made a quick recovery from the injury seems to be okay seems to be good and line violation mango will wipe off the free throw unforced a there coach you do not like that especially when hes a good foul sh hes probably going to make it anyway and youre going in the lane 22 tonight for George its season High the fivepoint lead for Clemson was 10 years ago Buddy Hunter to work sheflin helps with the screen pocket pass hiy breeder turned over heres Lance Terry open floor and hell flush it what a great defensive play Cut the lane yep wow nine for Applause Terry and Clemsons going to take a timeout its its a threepoint game under two to go Damon St hun for the open shot and he cut the lane Is got to fake it and then hes got the open three we saw bod Dongo do the same type thing in the first half Georgia Tex made some really good Applause Music plays just the eighth turnover of the night on Clemson heres Hunter now Terry picks him up bounces to shefflin T to shoot back to chase Hunter flips it to shefin theres the catch in traffic put it up draws the foul its going to be on Dongo its his third nine on Georgia Tech and you look at this play he really didnt have a shot he kind of went into the defensive player Damon does not like that call so couple of free throws for Ian Music shefflin hes now got 14 eight in this half and hit them both Clemson third in conference play in free throw percentage fivepoint lead again 90 seconds to go George Applause on the dribble pushed it up got the bounce hes just playing great is great game against a really good defensive team 24 now for Nathan George back to a threepoint game again with 70 seconds to go they almost threw it away again sure did sheflin heres Chase Hunter shot fake on a three now cuts it Loose itll Bound Away tried to get the rebound and the foul is going to be on Ibrahim Suare Damon STM not happy third on Suare 10 on Georgia texo two more free throws for Clemson as we go under a minute to play we get another look at this coach well theres so much going on down there you cant you cant tell not from that angle remain first two for shefin thats one thing I dont miss about coaching when that call comes late in the game like that yeah I dont like that you dont miss that part I dont miss it sheflin six for six at the line the second half lead is back to five now George trying to find a crease out of the corner Terry Off the Mark George Will scoop it it up high breeder there defensively heres George back for Powell hell fire and hit Duncan Powell out of the corner Damon stmy going to burn a timeout itll leave him with one to go I think or no hes out now use the clock up get a shot but make sure you get back and make them get a tough shot in nine 8 seconds but Georgia Tech might choose to go for it and foul well see we have the B inbounds for Dylan Hunter theres chefin defended by Dongo and now Dylan Hunter against Duncan Powell nsec differentials coach told you its a twopoint lead for the Tigers theyre going to if Chase Chase should just keep the ball now looks like whatll happen tend to shoot here heres the screen chefin sheflin trying to help pocket pass sheflin kicks it Dylan hunter from the corner and it rolled out Powell the rebound was seven heres Georgia Tech front Court out of timeouts Powell launches Off the Mark cleans It Up Overtime God overtime at Little John Coliseum on the follow by Dylan or Duncan Powell and he takes a terrible shot and then gets the ball back 64 all is the Applause overtime one more look at this exchange it ended up in the hands of Dylan Hunter Duncan pow took a tough shot and then a follow coach I mean he just threw it up from three and it got the floor Georgia Tech just his battle I mean this has been just an unbelievable effort yep but Clemson made the plays they had to make until the last play Clemson shot 296 from the floor in the second half they were eight of 27 and they live to tell about it and get it to overtime Georgia Tech does almost thrown away look out theyre coming our way will stay with Georgia Tech I was not taking the charge oh you werent interested in that were you I was bailing out heres a look you see Music Applause the 42 tonight from Georgia Tech 34 from Clemson Nathan George has just given Georgia Tech the lead in the overtime really terrific terrific game yep hes got 26 tonight thats the 19th lead change 6664 remember they went double overtime here a year ago go George had 20 and Georgia Tech one theres sheflin and he got fouled by Dongo couple of free throws for Ian shefflin on bongos fourth foul great play great movement great look one more look at this oo wow physical but I dont think its anything its a basketball play he just went went to block the shot come on and Matt Potter and Ian sheflin I think the referee tonight just wants to make sure Ians okay he took a hit Applause yep couple of free throws for shefflin and that ones good there you see kind of where everybody stands Dongo and pal now with four each for Georgia Tech shefin hit them both thats great to go to the line after that contact and make them both sheflin now with 19 and seven rebounds tied again at 66 lob for Powell against Zachary Powell knocks Zachary over and scores crowd here doesnt like it Pals got 16 there was a lot of contact there all the way in but probably a good no call Georgia Tech back in front with three and a half to go heres Hunter trying to find a crease skips it for Zachary Jaden on the drive high arcing shot good for Zachary just his second field goal of the night coach that was needed just a really great basketball game and these two teams want it and theyre going for it four for Applause Zachary into the corner for Terry T to shoot on the drive against sheflin blocked out of there with six on the shot clock this a cramp and sheflin goes down and already theyre starting to stretch him out he wanted to go to Powell there I think he should have he waited for Terry to come over poell had Zachary again so I think its a cramp it looks like it yep Clemsons basketball trainer Brad Crowe and Ian shefflin going to try and get to the bench area hes not going to play for a minute I dont Applause think so get a look here at the contested shot against Terry just tightened up yep so Christian Reeds is going to go in the game remember locking this is where the Locking foul out kind of tightens things up in your rotation oh yeah Reeves have played and mean hes got some play hes got a season eye tonight career high rebounds and he gives him a bigger guy out there too played about 9 and 12 minutes all in the first half six to shoot here now for Georgia Tech Nathan George hanging two rolls in wow some of the good bounces he had in the first half have returned here in the overtime tremendous game and a timeout taken Brad Brownell will use it here because theyre going to try and get Ian sheflin back in the ball game I suspect on the offensive end and thats George a while to get to the scoring level he was passing making plays but hes now making every in that 15 to 18 foot range hes made a couple threes tonight inbounds heres Hunter quickly to wiggin shefflin is on the floor as we suspected hell hand to Hunter Chase to the right side Dylan Hunter trying to take pal cant tend to shoot now heres Chase Hunter all the way to the basket and went for the dunk and either Suare or Dongo has committed the foul the foul is on Terry I was wrong all the Applause way look at this dunk attempt Chase oh its Terry on the arm yeah the other two guys might have mocked it should have stayed out of the play and let the big guys try to get it so heres Chase Hunter to tie the game if he can knock down two more free throws I tell you the busiest folks in the building here have been the folks with the mops in the second half from under each basket well the difference in a close game like this free throw line Georgia Tech Miss seven and heres Hunter at the line couple of free throws to potentially tie the ball game back with 227 to Applause play first one good 19 now for Hunter yeah hes come out in the second half slow first half slow start but and Georgia Techs done a great job on him too and that one rolls in so hes got his seventh game of 20 points or more this year and his fifth against the conference B time players make those free throws when you need them 220 to play heres George lost it out of bounds on the pressure of Zachary Zachary did a great job 11th turnover tonight by Georgia Music Tech Le turnover have been good Applause really sheflin at the front heres Chase Hunter pull up at 15 spun out on it great shot great look still a two for now tied at 70 still under two to go Nathan George trying to find a window 12 to shoot hell take get on the drive flip it to Terry hell slide Baseline blocked by shefflin with six to shoot its just a great basketball game these teams both teams deserve to win this game Georgia Techs playing without mcau I me theyre really playing with Five Guys most of the game again we have bodies on the floor after the block by sheffa whos got three rejection tonight Dongo five to shoot heres Nathan George from the tiger paw its spun out Chase Hunter the rebound that would have been the cap of a Applause night under 90 seconds to go in a tie Applause game Dylan Hunter tried to make make the pass to chase threw it by Him Zachary couldnt save it Georgia Tech will get it on the turnover with 117 to play unforced Air by the Tigers there coach Brothers you wouldnt think they would make that mistake ninth turnover by Clemson Georgia Tech got 11 pretty clean game for overtime the way these defensive teams have both played Applause yeah oh theyre going to try to go with Nathan George Im sure Zacharys been good Suare trying to help with the screen sheflin against George and Chase Hunter the hell ball and possession will go to Clemson what an extra effort by Hunter defensively he just held it long enough it was really almost so the hell ball goes to the tigers with 62 seconds to go and if he didnt call it Terry had a wide open look with three from the corner so fourth steal of the night for Chase Hunter great defensive play its a career high for it 50 seconds to go heres Hunter into traffic scoop and it rolled out again look at that glance Terry the rebound sheers you cant come any closer 15sec differential shot clock to game clock tied at Applause 70 Suare trying to set the screen Nathan George foul line it rolled out Dylan Hunter the rebound last shot Chase Hunter into the front Court standing dribble with 15 seconds to go I mean those two in and outs right there and down here Tigers trying to win it on the last possession of the game dont take a three drive drive three two Hunter for the win back rim Miss double overtime at Clemson why I dont know why hes just been good to them difference in the game really swar and Chanty Wiggins will help us start the second overtime and possession to Georgia Tech here is George on an ISO screen with Duncan Powell Zachary defends Powell now Dylan Hunter on the switch nine to shoot for Powell it was poked Away by Dylan Hunter Powell with five into traffic got Dylan Hunter to commit the foul itll be his third and two free throws for Duncan Powell hes a hard guy to guard down there hes so physical and big enough that he keeps the ball for 10 seconds and hes hard to stop down here so Powell to the line in a 70 all game with four and a half to go in the second overtime and that barely got to the iron killing themselves at the F line Pals got 16 points and six rebounds BS thats the foul miss 10 and the second one good he is now one for five at the line and has 17 in the game its a onepoint game sheflin Dylan Hunter Chanty Wiggins thought about it and he traveled turnover on the Tigers itll be the 10th on Clemson tonight and Brad Brownell not sure that was the category travel but nonetheless its awarded to Georgia Tech that was pretty close second overtime heres George attacking on the dribble pull up jumper on Dylan Hunter rolled off tapped around last Touch by Chase Hunter and that will give Georgia back of fresh 20 almost a minute into the second overtime I tell you what this these teams I cant believe the intensity theyre playing at both ends of the Court George trying to set up Dongo with Zachary defending seven to shoot heres George he had it poked away Dylan Hunter now SW shot clock thinking about going off Powell with the horn winding and sare had and threw it away here comes Zachary hell take it in scoop it up and he got fouled he kind of got off balance there sure did and the foul is on Nathan George its just his first but Jaden Zachary is going to go to the line and a chance to tie and perhaps give Clemson the lead here no foul Zachary who had been double figures in five of his last six and nine of his last 11 has just four points tonight first of two five now for Zachary George basically just got out of the way on that play that was Zachary got off balance and that blow the whistle and and Zachary missed the back end so were tied at 71 all going line thats it Applause Terry thought about it and took a side shuffle step Jim I think to gather himself and fell out of bounds yeah hes had a tough game but George has got to be tired of Zacharys playing him so hard yep well they Clemsons got to go with Chase Hunter now hes hes got to touch the ball watch this you see Terry trying to gather here just miss step yep well they got to go to Chase Hunter they got to get him and chefin in some kind of action get the ball heres Chase Hunter ahead of three minutes thought about it oh he had it dumped it to sheflin hell turn against Powell and score shefin with 21 tonight Clemson in front a basket at Applause 7371 Dongo the catch feed Suare fouled by shefflin its the guy you want to foul fourth on shefflin Ibrahim Suare will go to the line hes one for two and 6 for 23 this year hes the guy you want to F he made his last one so hes got a little positive thought in his head right now but really good basketball play by Georgia Tech and shefflin now becomes the latest tiger with four lock and fouled out with 334 to go in regulation which seems like an hour and a half ago it was Suare to shoot a pair and knocked it down really nice release on the on the last two yeah I love to see a kid go and do that I thats not easy to do lefthanded red shirt freshman how about that thats pretty good three for four which makes him now eight of 25 on the year he made three in a row which thats pretty good ties the game at 73 heres Chase Hunter squeezing through tried to fire it into the corner to Wiggins and Georgia Tech will be the beneficiary of a Clemson turnover theyre second in this overtime the 11th of the ball game he got bumped and he probably should have tried to finish the play they would probably give you the call on that jackets with a chance to go back in front George picked up on the dribble heres Suarez setting the screen they lob it back inside Dongo the catch put it up Zachary the rebound got the mismatch and Dylan Hunter front court for the Applause Tigers Chase on the drive had it poked away from behind Georgia Tech three onone with Wiggins the lob and they couldnt finish the dunk Dongo does on the follow what a great jackets go back in front bodies down at the other end Zachary hustled front court with it jackets with 90 seconds to go have taken the lead down low on the Block heres shefflin in traffic around Suarez scores tied at 75 now what a great game two two teams going all the way 23 for shefflin Dongo by the Ways got a double double tonight tend to shoot George against Wiggins forced it up and a foul is called wow and its on Chase Hunter itll be his third theres the LOB what did he do Dongo got the follow and all of a sudden at the other end sheelin wheels on Suarez you know the theyre going to miss some calls theyve been its been Fair they missed one a couple each way but nobody has a complain about the fish spins out on Nate George if they cant win this game theyre going to look at one thing the foul line thats all theyre going to look at Music George has got a career high and misses them both wow how many is there Georgia Tech is now nine of 19 tonight coach timeout Clemson well keep it here at little might try to go right down see what they can get and then take a timeout but both teams deserve a win here tonight you feel bad when whoever loses loses loses heres Chase Hunter on the weave Dylan takes it into the corner for Wiggins and Chase Hunter wants the ball wigg Chase Hunter here we go eight to shoot for Chase hell work on Terry pull up at 17 good wow thats why you get him the ball timeout taken by Clemson so Brad Brownell burns the timeout here with with 32 I mean if you get one the threepoint line tonight therere 25 I wouldnt go that way so Dongo will put it in play and heres Nate George Clemson showed put guys on the back court but the pressure fell off two second differential roughl Nate George on the drive feed Suare theres the dunk with 151 to go and a Georgia Tech timeout Ibrahim Suare has four of Georgia Tech seven coach see Chase Hunter and please dont just take a step back three inbounds to Zachary back to Dylan Hunter well I hope they can get it to him FR Court heres Chase 7 Seconds ball five four Hunter a three for the win nope triple overtime wow 77 Applause all yeah but those guys are dead that were in that coach come on now theyre gone come on Coach that was 30 years ago all right mate George the ball sheflin on the switch they try to go to Dongo and Dylan Hunter picks up his fourth dangos been fighting down there all night and theyve gotten that switch they just havent really gone to him and B Dongo is going to go to the line where hes three for six tonight at the stripe these are his first free throw attempts in the overtime sessions this being the third one and that puts the jackets in front hes got a good release 10 and the half 12 in the game for Dongo whos got a double double Applause tonight and that one fell off the rim until then six double double for Dongo by the way this year fourth in the last six games for the sophomore from Western sagol onepoint lead for the the jackets Zachary into traffic kick out for Dylan hunter straightway three that spins out Suare the Applause rebound Nate George will walk it into the front court inside Dongo had it poked away but right to Suare eight to shoot Terry the catch in the corner goes Baseline back for Suare heres George on the attack with the right hand it fell off Powell the second chance follow Thomson doesnt have much energy left on the board 8077 boy Georgia Tech has got 21 offensive rebounds Applause tonight 22 offensive rebounds and 25 Second Chance points and Wiggins Nails the three to tie the game that is Chanty Wiggins first field goal to the second half in any of the overtimes lets see game changing three they needed at least a two but it frees even better Zone this is a good look right here George wants a screen Terry for three good but its a good look Lance Terry his first points in the overtime thats when you make the right coaching move and they make a shot Hunter and foul from Applause behind so big shots now both ways Terry draws his second foul and Hunter will go to the free throw line 8380 Georgia Tech with 256 to go in the third over time Terry was four for 19 before that shot and the free throw good and one for N3 so I guess you just he was due yeah were going to okay well go with that well go with that 8381 Chase Hunter 6 for six at the line hes got 24 now they missed two free throws so 11 George and the jackets protecting a onepoint lead hell fire again wont go sheelin had it Dongo cleans it up Applause underneath by Dongo with 12 rebounds to go along now with his effort of 14 points offensive boys heres Hunter leaning in it rolls in and his eigh field goal of the night for Chase Hunter and its a onepoint game with 221 to go and now all of a sudden were getting shots to fall dribble penetration sure fatigue has got to be a factor of some of this well theyre just killing them on the offensive glass its not even theres not even a contest theyre just grabbing it and putting it back in the last two buckets so its just physical yeah Dongo there and heres the leaner by Chase Hunter and Wiggins and sheflin going to the bench were hearing it yeah from Coach Brown L is what you would Music expect so with 221 to Applause go you see possession belongs to the Tigers each schools got a couple timeouts were in the third overtime and Georgia Tech the ball in a onepoint lead at 8584 they need to theyre going to try the Zone again it even though it didnt work I think this is the right coaching move heres George Duncan Powell a three no rebound long terum to Terry now they go man lob inside Dongo the catch hell turn with a right hand and score by Dongo makes it a threepoint lead at 8784 heres Hunter takes Terry on the drive spot up at the foul line is short Dongo the rebound monster 100 seconds to go monster rebounding game Applause Monster Nate George Waits on the screen threepoint lead for Georgia Tech George a step back three is off the back rim Chase h the rebound Here Come the Tigers Suare chases Hunter score heres shefflin with Dongo defending kick for Zachary returns it to shefflin in traffic Scoops wont go rebound for Powell and Clemson trying to time up Duncan pow lets traffic clear we go under a minute to go and George walks it into the front Court threepoint lead here you got to just hold the ball the whole time and get some kind of a shot and its thr away to Hunter Chase hunter in traffic layup is good 303 left they got to do something Zachary trying to stay with Nathan George shot clock and game clock are almost simultaneous and here goes Powell down the lane hell leave it for Suare and out of bounds but a foul is called wow wow wow and Suare I believe will shoot the free Applause throws the foul is on Wiggins oh no and going to the line will be Ibrahim Suarez theres the foul hes made three in a row so hes got to have a lot of confidence two shots for Suare onepoint lead for Georgia Tech missed it he had three in a row but percentages were not good 132 left to go do you play this live if he misses this one I do but he may it depends how they practice I get it to chase Hunter and say go but every coach is Applause different and it falls out Dongo had it Zacharys got him Chase Hunter front court with 10 go ahead go ahead Clemson going to go for the win hunter lost it on the dribble tried to get it back Dongo the recovery of the turnover and a foul he did the right thing but it didnt work foul is on Dylan hunter or chase Hunter its Dylan Hunter and its his Applause fifth go inside went to his knees lost it and heres another look Jim he just lost it it was contact but not youre not going to call that when he goes to the floor and Jake Hy breeders is going to come in the game its a onepoint game in favor of Georgia Tech and by Dongo at the line for Two Applause Shots first of the two is good for Dongo hes got now six in the third overtime hes been a monster inside tonight 17 points 13 rebounds for Bango second one good and a timeout taken by Clemson its a threepoint game at 8986 so well keep it here at Little John Coliseum 35 left to guys you know too much but so Ian shefflin who had one point in his middle school and high school career was a quarterback hes going to put the ball in play with Ibrahim Suare and Chase Hunter has told Keith Kimbell if I catch it I want a time out and now Damon STM is going to burn one of his Wiggins is at kind of that top of the circle area and Chase Hunters in the right corner Duncan pow right there with him and so here is sheflin to put it in play going to throw it midcourt timeout probably should stay on top of that Applause not theyre going to move guare back to Wiggins nope theyre not theyre not sure heres Zachary 32 left into sheflin it goes Ian will turn get it to chase Hunter at the horn for the tie nope Georgia Tech wins in triple overtime tonight you got a good shot thats all you can do the jackets post their second consecutive quad one win Jim they beat Louisville on Saturday they valid eight and double down and get Clemson on the road tonight I mean this was a heck of a win for Georgia Tech to come in here Clemson played well and georia
