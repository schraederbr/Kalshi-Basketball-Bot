Miles Kelly happy to be in the starting lineup for Georgia Tech who didnt start the first five games of the season but turned it around and has become spectacular as a starter as of late hes been the yellow jackets best threepoint man Georgia Tech coming in six and three this is their ACC opener North Carolina all in one in the conference five and four overall they win the opening tip then we are underway as you mentioned North Carolina back home for the first time since November 20 its been a whirlwind of travel man are they happy to be back in front of the home fans and look to see Armando Baker get his hands on the basketball early in the painted area thats a folks of Huber Davis coming into this Davis on the drive off the window the follow wont go second one wont go battle for the board the yellow jackets Come Away with that a look at their starting lineup we talked about Kelly Gable Coleman whos averaging about 10 points per game on a turnover On The Run black and took a hit at the first minute of play a foul here against the yellow jackets and that one will go against evokona North Carolina theyre starting five includes RJ Davis at 15 a game Caleb love leaving him with 19 points per game they caught at 16 and 11 and you see immediately Obi on the first possession baycott covering up the rim the block shot but I will say that I was a little concerned watching him come back down the floor Im not sure if thats more about the conditioning or if he actually felt that shoulder once again after blocking that shot he blocked it with his left hand something for us to keep an eye on throughout this game youre calling the sprain or a contusion suffering the first half of the Indiana game when he took that knock Applause a difficult time to spike the numbers been a lot of turnovers with him it really has been the case and again when you want to get the basketball off the hands of your best player on the interior they have a responsibility of taking advantage of it a one to three an assistant turnover ratio for Bangkok over the season shot clock in three on the drive of the paint more still working it shot clock expires as he gave it up to Franklin so Carolina would have stopped right away and a look there at Josh Pastor in his seventh year at the helm but a yellow jackets hes now been in Atlanta as long as he was in Memphis and then when you consider Josh pastner he let us know he says hey I think that Carolina is going to get it together we just hope its not this afternoon he wants to take advantage of the team that hasnt been playing as well he had that look at his eye like I I hope its not today I think everybody in the conference realizes its going to happen for Hubert Davis he said this week after the loss at Virginia Tech he said I told him Im not panicked Im not any of that Im convinced were going to have a great basketball team by the end of the season I agree with Huber Davis and I dont think its time to panic Im just think it is time to change your sense of urgency however and thats one of the things that with those losses I believe he has the attention of his players Coleman jumping into the lane tough shot got it to go and Evo Coleman known as a shooter but doing a much better job of being more versatile and tacking off the bounce former Florida Mr basketball Davis will bounce that one in the paint and into traffic they got taken down on a blocking foul against the yellow jackets Applause attacking the rim is unable to get into a legal defensive guarding position Franklin with the personal hes been to Yellowjackets best rebounder so thatll put Bangkok to the line where hes 67 percent of course last year a monster season with 31 double doubles he tied David Robinsons single season NCAA record for double doubles and so far this season is four a great company to be in with the biggest key for Bangkok this year has been finishing plays the finishing possessions the turnovers have been an issue for him and when you consider who hes been great you know handling the basketball for a big guy throughout his career but when you look at the 34 turnovers per game for him he leads Carolina in turnovers even though he played one less game right then the guards and thats saying something thats a big number and Im sure something that Armando wants to clean up 27 is a team High those turnovers Franklin with a quick step but hes denied Bay College some good Dean to follow him right through the lane Yellow Jackets fresh off a dramatic victory over rival Georgia by two points 7977 at GameStop 18 lead changes heres more with a three that climbs away and Davis in transition threepointer has been a real problem for North Carolina the guards just havent been hitting them at all as a team 29 percent love got it back somehow was able to finish that one well Im wondering if Bangkok gets an assist on that one again it did hit his hands he touched it right back to Caleb love Im not sure it was intentional however it still ends up as a buck its a tough officiating decision he gets no assist on that he may want to go to the monitor Franklin will give it up here for more who had a huge couple of defensive stops and a great win against Georgia shot clock again down to five Smith with a pass in the paint Franklin no tough for Franklin to maneuver against much more size on the interior and UC bacon puts so much pressure up on the defense trying to stop him in the painted area beautiful Sprint post and finish well you called it as we were coming on the air It could wind up being a very big day for baycott the 611 senior but switched in by Coleman and Coleman who saw one go through early only shooting 33 percent from three on the year thus far was a much better threepoint shooter a year ago making it to happen early Davis and deflected away and Nifty stopped there by Coleman Coleman has another one right now he didnt find him he had an opportunity to let another one fire and of course as a shooter you see one go down youre ready for that next shot Applause Kelly long distance but no Applause he has been their top threepoint man Carolina wants to run but a great defensive stop by Smith and Smith on the other end well feed into the paint heres more but no from close range Georgia Tech is content to run with North Carolina they may have picked the wrong battle because thats what Carolina does best what a tremendous job now changing the angle with the body to get that one to drop in and a 95 lead for North Carolina well its been about the interior points in the paint it started with passes from Caleb love inside to Armando baycott and then love getting out in transition finding Nance for the Finish Caleb dishing his big finishing dupix it helps you do

in the country at the beginning of the Season it dropped out of the top 25 of course so much talk about these two guards love and Davis and the shooting although its really not that much different from a year ago its really not and both these guys have hovered around 40 percent career field goal percentage Shooters so you see those numbers where they were a year ago and where they are now Caleb loves field goal percentage is actually up from where it was but both players are shooting 10 percent less from three 36 percent down to 26 percent thats been the biggest difference in the shooting for both RJ Davis and Caleb love this year and love of course a real issue when youve taken by far the most shots on your team and youre hovering around 41 percent Smith up top here for Coleman Carolina getting it done in the paint so far and defensively as black picks it and leaky one of the better defenders in the country and thats going to be a traveling violation right back over to the yellow jackets thats number two for North Carolina itll be that traveling violation was based upon Caleb love thinking should I shoot this three in comparison to playing confident in just his natural game where he would just caught that and shot it hes thinking about it and thats one of the things where Caleb love has to grow out of that and simply just let it go or drive it make it a quick decision and keep playing basketball its the same guy who took 36 shots in a single game against Alabama and hes been criticized a lot for that but I dont have a problem with it because he played 58 minutes in that game Kelly on target from way downtown with the threepointer onepoint game Miles Kelly is really starting to come on as the leader for the rambling wreck of Georgia Tech flips it up kind of a wild shot Kelly had it knocked right to his teammate and Kelly will set up the offense Georgia Tech with losses to Utah Marquette and Iowa overall at 63 Kelly front rim that one you can tell Kelly hes going to be aggressive Josh passion does a good job giving him his opportunity of love doesnt get there they caught battling for the rebound and whistle will stay here with 1419 to go Applause puff Johnson on the floor now for Huber Davis and coming up next itll be number six Kansas and Missouri on ESPN in the app at 5 15 Eastern so stay right where you are in a busy day of college basketball on ESPN thats all throwback big eight matchups Big Time rivalry between those two schools Lance will swing it out of the corner trimbled said tremble the freshman Wisconsin Mr basketball and Gatorade high school player of the year in Wisconsin they really like his defense a great deal Johnson will pick up the foul here for North Carolina and we could see a lot more of Seth trim were actually playing the point guard position with both Caleb love and RJ Davis on the floor the three of those guards together because hes more of the playmaker with those other two guys on four scores also expecting to see Jana Washington the 610 freshman Smith with a pullup pop at the elbow cant get that to go Davis with the rebound and North Carolina on the Move pushing the tempo any chance they can get but another theft for the yellow jackets great job defensively stepping up and stopping what would have been a sure two points if that pass have been connected with Nets Sturdivant that wont drop and a rebound controlled by North Carolina and Keith Nance against about six a Game Boy to Tar Heels Music and a whistle in the corner with 13 minutes to go buses to Iowa State and in four overtimes to Alabama and Portland followed by a defeat at Indiana and then at Virginia Tech so that has Carolina reeling coming back to Chapel Hill yeah they played a football game there 60minute game youre talking about a long time to be on the court man and it immediately went to Bloomington didnt come back to Chapel Hill next game in Bloomington not coming home so that was an extended road trip to say the least for the Tar Heels schedules been grueling not a lot of time for Hubert to do any coaching with all of those stops shot clock is down to four for Carolina to get in the air crowd wants it in the shot off Tanya Its A Little Fall Away sweet shot and Pete Nance just tell everyone calm down I know whats happening right here let me get into my bag of tricks right at the shot clock buzzer to knock down the two you have to appreciate that the crowd is in it like that though oh I mean and again this crowd has been great here especially considering that the student is just finishing exams its a great place to watch a college basketball game it is a major college basketball game shot clock to four and swished in and Kelly thats happened a couple of times right about the Horn of that shot clock right Nikki black just closing out a little short on that one not running Kelly off the line knowing that he is dangerous from Beyond the arms thank you with a foul with 1207 to go in the half and hell pick up number one actually number two on him Music and he will take a seat and Master goes back to his bench and well bring on the right Ive never seen this before that is new Javon Franklin Andy traitor come out of the locker room and instead of walking around the court they run actually across the court across the floor good thing we got a great officiating crew because thats a technical foul you cant do that Roger Ayers bird Smith and Kip Kissinger really really good crew trouble with a little pull up but that wont fall for him Kelly with a rebound Yellow Jackets typically have really had a hard time shooting the ball you know 4142 percent thats a really tough shot by Kelly Davis will fire away and thats RJ Davis playing to his Natural Instincts he is a Score first guard you often see him times in between whether he doesnt understand whether he should pass it or try to score hes just better off when hes playing to try to score stood have been lost the drib a little leaner and he air milled it right to Davis he is not waiting around a whirling dervish RJ Davis he was a blur from one end to the other the game is not difficult if youre wired to score just go score RJ Davis putting it in drive and he is not doing it 55 foreign The Venture xcard from Capital One gives you premium travel benefits like two times miles on every purchase the noise canceling

as the season get out of the way North Carolina was the number one ranked team in the country and they played like it early on as they raced out to a 50 record absolutely nobodys surprised by that but its been full of surprises since then two straight losses at the fill night and again four overtimes against Alabama consecutive Road losses to Indiana its an outstanding team and so is Virginia Tech of course Tar Heel fans right now wondering what is going on is that an emoji is that what that is trying to figure out which Carolina is going to show up today and how theyre going to shoot the basketball and when you look at the numbers of the 50 start in comparison to the the fourgame losing streak the biggest number that stands out is the minus three rebounding margin for me theres never been a time that I can remember where North Carolina was getting out rebounded even at times where they werent playing well they werent winning games they still were winning the rebound battle and thats something that Huber Davis talked to us about earlier it is very uncharacteristic of this program traveling violation here on Jalen Moore and thatll be number three on the yellow jackets he was very specific too when you talk into Hubert today about offensive rebounding that has been a staple of North Carolina basketball as long as I can remember it absolutely has been and again against Virginia Tech you play without Armando baycott as well as hes injured in the Indiana game so that was a big part of those two games not having him on the floor and healthy can definitely affect the rebounding battle guard DeMarco John as a broken bone in his left hand hes out as well so theyve had a couple of injuries lately that have effective play Terry in transition now for Georgia Tech trying to win their seventh game of the season Applause Coleman has set it up shot clocks been a factor already several times for Georgia Tech and its inside 10 now way downtown and theyll catch nothing but Iron by Terry Music Applause Davis gives it up for love and pretty quiet Imaging 19 points a game coming in Tyler Nichol the 67 freshmans Into The Fray now baycot working working Johnson with the rebound and back up and down and thats where Bob Johnson can have an impact bringing that energy bringing the effort and of course as Huber David talked to us about offensive rebounding those Second Chance points which are always so crucial for the hills you know what Hubert didnt look today he didnt look nervous at all about his teams performance as Smith got a good look cant bury it a nice kick ahead but another turnover Ford North Carolina and the turnovers are coming from the two guys that they need to handle the basketball both Caleb love and RJ Davis somewhat understandable there though because Davis saw Collision coming tried to go around the back to preserve The Possession but kind of giving it away Coleman with a tough drive and a nice save down into the corner there by Terry and they convert the two you know one of the areas we havent talked about as Georgia Tech gets an easy bucket on that possession is the defensive end of the floor which has been a big difference for the Tar Heels Applause he heads to the line they run the play for him and you talked about this in the opening tip they were going to look to get him the ball a lot here in the first half and you can tell that Caleb love and RJ Davis have made a concerted effort to get the basketball to Armando baycott to get it to Nance on the interior oftentimes theyve tried to force it which is turned into turnovers but on that possession of Caleb love with a nice fine and the finish for Mondo who doesnt look himself yet Obi you can tell that hes you know hes dealing with something on on the floor right now and its that right shoulder that shooting shoulder Applause and of course after missing the Virginia Tech game conditioning could be a factor as well Coleman stepping into a triple and nothing but net Nebo Colemans playing with confidence here early shooting 33 from three on the season but off to a great start knocking down his second one here in the first half they made points Steve North Carolina Applause do it offensively a little step back way downtown but that didnt even touch the iron with a threepoint attempt but if you want to understand why Caleb love is shooting 26 from three thats a perfect example because hes shooting tough shots that is a difficult shot early to shot clock that wasnt necessary Howard around the foul line for two Applause so Rodney Howard in his third year at Georgia Tech after transferring from Georgia makes this a onepoint contest and call the emotion and everything in the building give the yellow jackets credit for hanging in right now and the longer this game goes as they stay in the more confidence they gain make a little pullup yeah he can do that Tyler nickel can score over 2 900 points the Virginia High School league alltime record two score Morris High School coach Carrie keys not the greatest and one game more off the window a sweet shot yeah because you can see right now this is one of the areas that Huber Davis was concerned about they were getting destroyed in the paint and right now Georgia Tech is making an effort to continue that getting the ball inside Applause baycod will try a long one rebound poked away to the yellow jackets they have a chance to grab the lead here more in transition sophomore out of Birmingham Alabama up top for Terry another transfer several of those for the yellow jackets hes out of GardnerWebb will lean in cant get that one to go and reaching in for the pick very quick Hands by Smith off to Terry black for the foul on black the crowd didnt think so Georgia Tech is hanging around leaky black with the turnover but its been about the threepointer Debo Coleman in transition stepping up knocking it down and then the interior once again North Carolina losing that battle in

his best at USC in year one turning that program around thats going to be my guy who you going with Im going with Georges thats invented because George is going to win everything okay and they should is is that because of your ties to Georgia might be because of several tuition checks but also Im a big Bulldog fan yes well you also were the voice of the Bulldogs I was so yeah Im sure you are a big Bulldog fan certainly in college basketball and rattled in by Lance Terry so Georgia Tech in North Carolina locked up in a tight one that was our expectation coming in Georgia Tech with the ability to and I mean this in all the best ways kind of junk it up defensively they absolutely can Josh pastner has brought that to the ACC his switching defenses between man and Zone keeping offenses off balance never allowing them to be comfortable on that end of the floor you can see a North Carolina team that averages close to 80 points per game for 21 right now black on the spin to the Baseline they came to defend quickly its Tapped Out high for Davis Applause down to four to get off a shot from threepoint land that wont go as black with a misfire and back on the run the yellow jackets tied at 21 with six minutes to go in the first half here at Chapel Hill bounce feed for more Applause lets see if love starts to get rolling 19 points a game for him but hes had a couple of shots just like that they got hit in the deck Im not sure Im wondering why Mondo hit the deck on that but once again no shot clock reset Davis nope and a foul is Armando going down for it you know I wonder if that was just he was falling down at that time no one else coming after the basketball but with that shoulder the way it is you know and maybe stay up exactly stay on your feet Ford just picked up foul number one and she will send RJ Davis to Lions an excellent foul shooter you could tell missing that game last Sunday its affected Armandos condition and thats one of those things again when you when you have to miss time you can tell hes breathing relatively hard here you look at his numbers 1096 he won away from another Virginia guy George Lynch and mondo could leave as the career alltime leading rebounder here and no asterisks beside it because it would only be in four years you know not not a covered year for him a lot of Virginia flavor my God Tyler did but I talked about is coach Carrie Keys who I played High School against and Tyler Nichol from the valley a lot of Virginia tires at Carolina and of course you always talk to Huger Davis about the same a Virginia guy or well back it out heres Coleman Smith with 16 last year against North Carolina Terry with a three got it Stewart and Georgia Tech has shot the basketball extremely well here today this is not a team thats been making shots on the season so Josh Pastor has to be happy with the offense for his team and now gaining the lead its a team that only makes 30 from threepoint land Davis will try and answer and he does he has so the heels back up by two Smith running the point across the board 10 points six rebounds four assists he does a little bit of everything he really does and again the six rebounds at the gar position is spectacular hes going out getting almost three offensive rebounds a day which never happens for point guard hes 61 Terry again off the back of the iron snatched away by Nance are Applause and its finding bacon a dribble now hes denied its a smart play by not forcing it on that possession getting it back out making sure the team gets a good shot Smith high in the air shot clocks to 10 black on the attack shot clock at four Trimble off the front of the rim Coleman wont wait Applause foreign Applause UC Trimble is a pass first guy one of the reasons why Hubert Davis likes him this North Carolina team is going to grow with him having the basketball in his hands more often Applause deciding Let it Fly Howard they let them wide open he said why not and the second time Howard knocked down that 16 foot jump shot right there Bangkok contesting that one but how were still confident enough to knock it down Davis into the lane and Howard tried to contain him and he commits the foul number two for as long as I can remember one thing you know about North Carolina bigs they run the floor and the guards have to deliver Trimble to bacott for the easy flush Music

over on ABC well get you uh also set up on some of these other games weve seen in a stacked schedule what do you make of our game look North Carolina Superior Personnel Elite level Personnel but they do not play like an elite level team at some point theyve got to find that chemistry that theyve had late last season Army Navy tied at zero first half David Corey back to you guys Chris John thank you very much big cot having a pretty solid first half maybe not a hundred percent which youd expect for him and I think theres a lot of focus on what they did last year and the expectations obviously went through the roof because they were incredible the last couple of months of the Season obviously in the NCAA tournament they absolutely did finish the season 112 but they were coming off of a stretch where they were beaten here on their home court versus Pittsburgh they were losing a number of games but everyones trying to figure it out but the reality behind it and we look at all the offensive numbers and we talked with Huber Davis about this earlier its about the defensive identity they found out what their defensive identity was going to be the last 13 games of the season they have yet to find it for this season they had them right down what they think the identity defensively should be for the Tar Heel team individually yeah and he made it clear to us hey look this is their team Huber Davis has been constant with that since hes been the head coach he wants this to be about their experience not necessarily him as the head coach Smith at the line air matters that one buckling down on defense leading it 3026 here over the yellow jackets they caught Another Touch thats just about Unstoppable and when you can see the front of his jersey you see that five he gets the basketball but more importantly he is finishing in this game he hasnt finished as well this season as he has in the past but hes been finishing here today came out of nowhere to scoop up the loose ball needs to be fouled by Miles Kelly to prevent the layin North Carolina forcing a turnover Yellow Jackets hardly ever do turn it over only about 10 a game one of the stingiest in the country in a category trembled to the line freshman out of Wisconsin played a careerhigh 23 minutes in the last game against Virginia Tech so getting more involved and what a womens basketball double dip we have for you tomorrow afternoon red versus blue our first matchup one oclock Eastern on ESPN the Cardinals have won the last five in this rivalry then at three on ABC number six UConn down to four healthy guards have to step it up against Diamond Miller and number 20 Maryland should be another great afternoon Hoops on ESPN That was supposed to be a homecoming for easy foot but AZ out in Atlanta for the Huskies Maryland will absolutely be waiting lets see if Gino can hang on and keep it rolling they were playing so well UConn was Smith back to Kelly biggest lead of the game here for North Carolina no place for Kelly to go heres Terry shot clock down to two Sturdivant steps back fires and here come the Tar Heels very quickly on the other end Trimble leaning in get a rough shot right there by Trimble one he could have pulled out but at the same time when you have the defensive effort that he played on that last possession coach Davis will allow that Applause started into the Baseline and hes on the line and well give it away its their fifth turnover North Carolina standing up quite a bit on the defensive end of the floor starting to change things around and thats been the difference over the last couple of minutes of this game and we see once again Trimble with the basketball I believe theres something developing here right now Hubert Davis is starting to find a lot more trust in the Freshman paycock with a difficult catch Davis off the fake gave out very unselfish this is a nine nothing run for North Carolina at the tail end of the half and theyve done it by sharing the basketball North Carolina won the lowest in the country on assist to their field goals but sharing the basketball here this afternoon crowd likes it Terry with a three and now Ill tell you what Seth trembles everywhere how about speed strike by North Carolina and they lead it 3926 well theyre closing the half in style they absolutely are and if theyre able to get a defensive stop here the roof might just come off of this place Smith wants a triple no chance for a heave here by an ads and got the backboard and thats it but that was an impressive run to end that first half 3926 North Carolina they went 110 down the stretch 110 to end the half and you see already two Targets part of the reasons why they hold the big lead unless that Trimble beginning the second half on the bench for North Carolina but there arent that many minutes out of Caleb love only played what 11 minutes in the first half and had some turnovers and this at this point Caleb love is a leader for this team really now has to lock in establish himself defensively and also as a playmaker after watching his team operate better the offensive in the floor without it Miles Kelly with a pretty drive to open up the second half here for the yellow jackets give him eight points came in averaging 13 very quickly a strike nice pass by RJ Davis there to get baycott the easy bucket you see once again the concerted effort by the Tar Heels to get the basketball inside getting bacon his opportunities on top 4128 North Carolina Applause Holmen trying to negotiate his way into the paint but he stops Kelly working on black Scoops it up and in very difficult shots and Kelly continues to play with confidence on the offensive end of the floor love added tips that one knocked away on the other end heres more into the paints will start to break and kick ball with 18 39 to go in this contest Applause he talked about a moment ago RG Davis to Armando bacon off a horse that they caught just finding that sweet spot right in the middle Rodney Howard caught in between RJ Davis delivering the perfect strike for the assist his first assist of the game swung up top for love Applause spots you need to see from cable love come out into the second half make plays on both ends of the floor and play Within the framework of how your team needs to operate to be successful because he was magical in the Tar Heel run to the NCAA Final hit that dagger three with 24 seconds left to beat Duke in the National semifinals one of the Great Moments in Tar Heel history thats saying something more power on his way in OB let me make it clear the Tar Heels cannot be a national championship Contender without Caleb love Davis keeping in for two 15 points for rgds and right now RJ Davis has figured out how it is that he needs to play for a team to be successful they need for Caleb love to do the same on both ends of the floor now were not a high pose bacon out to guard Kelly catches and shoots but its not there they got well on his way to another double double he has seven rebounds already into double figure scoring Applause love will swing Davis bouncing for baycod who came in averaging 16 points in 11 rebounds a game Davis gets himself a good look and drains it I honestly believe the message was made clear Caleb love is now being more aggressive but finding his teammates being a playmaker he created that last possession RJ Davis was able to get an easy bucket because of Caleb attacking getting downhill and making the right five more will fire line drive three killing more of the 67 sophomore with nothing and its been a youth movement for Josh pastner He said clearly get old and stay old will be the motto for Georgia Tech as he switches to now what looks like a 131 Zone but hes gone to the youth movement getting his sophomores into the starting lineup and this benefited the young guys as well as the team did a great job staying home forced a turnover and then draws the foul and then Georgia Tech last year 1220 very long season 5 and 15 in the conference but lucky to take a big leap forward this year in starting the season with Kyle Sturdivant and Davon Smith both in the backcourt Rodney Howard in the front Court and after five games makes the change to get Kelly and more into the starting lineup going to Franklin in the starting lineup and the rambling wreck have played better with a smaller lineup and a younger lineup so North Carolina with a 4835 Advantage going downstairs for baycot and hell draw the foul and as he was hit by more picks up foul number three weve got to mention Javon Franklin who started the game left after the first time out we havent seen him back on the floor dealing with the right quad contusion had the heat pack going earlier hes the best rebounder one of the best shot blockers in the ACC so he has missed another whistle there on the Baseline Kissinger has a foul yeah Franklin 22 blocks per game second in the ACC and more importantly 26 to only eight turnovers for the season with 27 offensive rebounds so thats a big Miss right now and hes doing all this listen at six seven Im not certain hes that might not be program hype he may not even be six seven so playing undersized but being very productive Jayla Moore with his fourth foul he is six seven so hes in trouble shot clock right now down to four heres black with a pullup and the rebound picked off by the yellow jackets they want to run Sturdivant back out for Kelly North Carolina doing a good job getting back defensively times today Howard went for the bounce pass and a whistle as that one bounces away a foul on the play 1538 to go here in the second half of Chapel Hill Music I met this Wing Joy telling people that Geico has been offering savings for over 85 years thats longer than the buffalo wings been around dozen wings and did you know that Geico offers more motorcycle insurance now my lips are actually burning Geico over 85 years of savings and service see how much you

need for cancer research this is game changing research helping save lives you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research and of course Jim Valvano the headliner in that fight but so many others Robin Roberts and of course North Carolinas own Stuart Scott who ended up losing their battle to cancer but great speech was also understanding the responsibility that he has to never give up and carrying on their legacy from Jim Darnell Kelly on the line so theyll turn it over theyll do that very often Georgia Tech by the way been badly our Rebound in fact North Carolinas doubled them up 2814 but Georgia Tech does not have an offensive rebound do they come into the game averaging 13 offensive rebounds per game one of the better offensive rebounding teams not only the ACC but in the country as Caleb love gets downhill I love the response from Caleb he had to sit and watch was not in foul trouble but was benched in the first half because Seth Trimble was playing better but did not pout coming out in the second half has played defense has played well on the defensive end of the floor knocked down to three now getting to the basket but playing much more under control and composed here in the second half yeah threepoint play Kelly with his second foul North Carolina looking even more comfortable on top down 5135 biggest lead today Applause now enough to set the screen and thatll be a foul on the offensive side with number three so 15 minutes to go here in the second half North Carolina trying to shake off a fourgame skid we mentioned theyve dropped out of the top 25 it was the fastest a preseason number one and done that since UCLA in 1965 on top heres love rebound and it spins off the Iron by bacock and although that ends up being an empty possession for North Carolina its a shot creative 4K above by someone else its an offensive rebound for Armando baycott those are the ways that North Carolina has to play to be successful even though its no points Huber Davis has to love that type of offense Applause beyond the threepoint line Applause got it back his way in on black black sticking with him denies him tears away the Miss as well Davis has been the offensive star trying to add to his total he goes he got hit pretty good foul by Georgia Tech with 1415 to go hell go against Lance Terry and North Carolina came into the game 349th in the country out of 351 division one schools on assists to field goal mix and of course theyve always been great at that but this season theres been a struggle but today 12 assists or 19 made field goals so basically 63 percent of their possessions theyve been able to assist on the Mayfield goal sharing the basketball this has been more characteristic of the North Carolina offense weve grown accustomed to along with four assists tremble with three Davis with a couple so sharing the sugar very well and theyll be RJ Davis has at least eight rebounds right now we can see RJ coming up with a double double in this one impressive rebounding from the point guard position no hes not as you said Howard knocks it down I wish someone would lie about my height like that hey youre six feet oh yeah no thank you its in the book now on the air Denise Davis outside the three Love is open again not this time Smith with a rebound but its a good look you can appreciate that someone else created a shot 4K of Love they want to appreciate that is Josh pastner because Huber Davis never wants to see anyone going Coast to Coast getting an easy layup against his defense for the entry pass so tough to stop 14 for Armando today and bacon having to jump up and down to allow his teammates to know he had a mouse in the house and Smith and some pain as he hit the deck Davon Smith the point guard from Loganville Georgia I think its a nice hand from the Carolina fans as he gets to his feet Smith had to be the guy down there trying to defend bacott as he gets buried behind baycott trying to attack him lands on Rodney Howards foot Howard coming down to try to help out you can see him land on that foot coming down so Smith off the floor explosive playmaker yeah hes had hes had a strong season for Georgia Tech they started the season out playing with Beau Smith and Sturdivant both point guards in the backcourt but its Ben Smith whos won that position to this point we mentioned six rebounds a game two and a half offensive rebound Kelly straight on with a threepointer 13 points for Miles Kelly thats a season average That season average I think is going to go up is the longer we go into the season this is his fifth straight game in the starting lineup hes getting better and better each time out so well defeat to Bangkok left it a little short but Tapped Out high for Davis picked off here come the yellow jackets nice long Spin and well draw the foul now there will be a lot of people upset about the turnover from Caleb love on this possession but if you rewind that back earlier Armando baycott missed a wide open layup they should never got to that point and thats been one of the differences this season with Armando in comparison to The Seasons past he hasnt finished as well around the basket as weve grown accustomed to watching it got a theory on why that is because its like waking up in the morning for him well it absolutely is but one thing I think hes been playing a lot of this season in foul trouble and trying to stay out of foul trouble which hasnt allowed him to be as aggressive as he normally is and when you look at his numbers the 545 percent six six for 13 today under 50 and it becomes just not finishing around the basket plays that weve watched him play I mean you look at his his freshman year almost 63 percent from the floor last year close to 57 AJ Davis picked up his second foul a moment ago Georgia Tech with it trying to cut into this deficit Applause and just going away theyve turned it over nine times today its about their season average Music say youre looking for the perfect present you might try looking at the perfect place a place with gifts that light up a face as well as a

transition pushing the tempo the spin the finish and then going stepping out knocking down the threepointer but Davis has been aggressive attacking the basket not just settling for jump shots and the deficient first time so sorry fishing game thus far four RJ Davis six with 10 from the field but also eight rebounds two offensive rebounds for RJ getting involved in the mix Huber Davis said he wanted his team to be better on the glass and they have been just that here at home I think there are a lot of things I think youd agree with this that he has talked about in the last several days of practice that they had put into play for them they have theyve really put that into play and again theyve had an opportunity to practice we talked about North Carolina being away for 20 days from playing games here the majority of that was a long road trip as Seth Trimble gets him gets his first field goal of the day finds a way to get inside that zone but they havent had that practice time yeah when youre just playing games you know and youre making mistakes and losing those games and you have no time to correct it really its very frustrating for a head coach so having these few days has been a godsend for Hubert Moore denied in a lane but hes gonna be fouled on the play by Buck Johnson number two on Pop his first career starting his Virginia Tech last weekend with Bay caught out he played 12 minutes he did not score in that game but I like this lineup were seeing on the floor right now with Bob Johnson at the four but youve got the three guards Seth turbo at the point with Caleb love and RJ Davis off the basketball this could be a dangerous lineup especially with baycott in the middle and help shot clock at five Maxwell off the fake got into the paint Scoops it but missed it and its poked out by more of Georgia Tech so back over to the Tar Heels trying to snap a fourgame skid here today in front of the home fans and final exams last night here in North Carolina the students hung around and supporting the Tar Heels this afternoon Davis weaving his way got a good look and kickball here says Roger Ayers Applause ACC opener today for the yellow jackets in North Carolina trying to pick up their first Conference win of the young season Moore will set it up now for Josh passers team and whistle off the ball and Bert Smith saw a foul underneath with 10 23 to go I believe they got tremble on that one now dance will come in and replace baycott whos got his win here played the first nine plus minutes of this second half it has been effective coming back to the program deciding not to go on to the NBA North Carolina fans absolutely thrilled by that Prospect trying to make another run of the national championship Applause so is Mondo got more commercials than exactly right now just saying something out of the way by Howard Stripped Away Davis is tripped up and fouled down he went he appears to be aokay but I can tell you that it has been a welcoming sign for the Tar Heels to get back on this floor you can imagine throughout the fourgame losing streak this is the first time in three weeks that theyve had someone cheer for them you talk about the Phil Knight Invitational the number one team in the country going in so everyone wants to see the number one team in the country but if its a close game they want to see the upset as well theyve been cheered against against Iowa State and Alabama and then of course going on the road to Indiana and Virginia Tech no one was going to be on their side in those games good for Huber Davis and his Squad to be here for someone to cheer for them all right Jay Davis having a really strong afternoon 91 percent the foul line which is the best on the team and looking for his 19th point today here against the yellow jackets and more up for the rebound 5642 under 10 thats going to be officials that we were watching there because they disagreement on that fire but the great part about it is they come together they have a conversation about it you see the shoulder is lower and Roger Ayers has a great look on that but Kissinger sees is where is RJ Davis at the time are his feet in the restricted area basically allowing Roger Ayers to know he felt like he had a better look on that one I can appreciate that both the officials coming together and talking about it and heres the interesting part are RJs feet his feet are in the restricted area so that can be considered a block because he is the primary defender in that restricted area its not a popular call here Roger Ayers had it going the other way because he saw the shower lower but that foot being in a restricted area I believe they got it right Jay Davis with his third foul Georgia Tech barely at the line so far today only four times Applause Nance theres trouble really been outstanding today the Freshman hoped out by more with 9 37 to go so North Carolina really taking control of the game in the last few minutes of the first half on an 110 run to build up a healthy halftime advantage and have generally maintained it and a reach in foul by Maxwell and Georgia Tech giving North Carolina a steady diet of the Zone here in the second half oftentimes Josh pastner will switch his defenses at halftime not giving the opposing coaches an opportunity to go in and talk to his team about it but North Carolina has been ready for the zone here in the second half Pete Nance the grad at 1810 against Virginia Tech in that defeat last weekend and rolled that in the annual ACC huddle Bowl preview special coming up Wednesday at 6 Eastern on the ACC Network and the ESPN app its a look at the nine ACC teams playing in a bowl game with breakdowns comprehensive analysis and a lot more the ACC has sent at least nine teams to a bowl every year since 2016 thats impressive thats an impressive stat nothing as impressive though as the field hockey coach here at North Carolina my goodness I mean did she win a National Championship every year feels that way its a great Athletic program here in North Carolina is Kelly Kelly denied in the paint more working on Nance with the spin shot got it thats a pretty play 13 for him you can see Georgia Tech these young players are growing up would you consider more Miles Kelly Divo Coleman the sophomore class this is a group that if they stay together can do some damage on the flats 16 for Armando Bangkok today and the crowd with them step to step heres Kelly and the kick 8 36 to play switch to Tech coming in at six and three in North Carolina and five and four Obi baycott with 14 field goal attempts in this game that is a high as of late he hasnt been getting this many touches in the post area and you see doing the job defensively and thats often the thing for big guys if you want them to defend and be involved in the end of the floor youve got to feed him on the offensive end of the floor and you see the energy and the effort from Armando bacon has been different in this game and what we saw from him in Portland and at Indiana coming back from that shoulder injury maybe not all the way back at 100 but pretty close and hes gotten more comfortable hes looked better with those low post moves as the day has moved along he absolutely has that you could tell his conditioning was an issue early in this game as Tristan Maxwell goes into his bag attempted spree baycott will scoop it up Trimble on the break and will wisely back that one away Caleb love I think hitting about 26 percent Beyond a threepoint line too much too far for bigot but a foul as they held him up fouled against the yellow jackets with Carolina on top 60 to 45 Music excuse me critics are raving which one of you did that Prancer Silent Night is your Christmas Chaos with a heart

Syracuse how about Jesse Edwards 20 points for the orange over Georgetown in a victory Florida State finally got a win again Caleb Mills 16 points but Louisville has yet to win and Jesse Edwards a big performance in the Big Time rivalry Syracuse Georgetown we know how far that goes back in North Carolina trying to get its first ACC win of the season and break a fourgame road slide Im sorry four game losing skin here at home they caught at the line shooting a 11 Armando has nine rebounds today his next rebound will give him 10 and itll be for the 61st time in his career at North Carolina that will tie the great Billy Cunningham and his school record at 6110 or more rebound again would you say the great Billy Cunningham I know his play was great but also had a great nickname the kangaroo kid I am a fan of that now back in the day where you know writers used to sit and probably imbibe a little bit trying to think of great nickname for players often came up with great nickname they did a great job on that one Applause Howard gives it up off the Fate its Kelly Terry to drive it on Trimble hits the shot nice play Ontario that one hes been productive in this game as well knocked down a number of Threes but attacking off the basket and this Georgia Tech team is a deeper team than what Josh Pastor is used to having going eight nine guys in the rotation we watched Josh Pastor in his ACC tenure youre only playing six maybe seven guys but hes extended the rotation quite a bit this season love will lift to three off the front of the iron and yellow jackets are not out of this thing seven minutes to go trailing 6147 theyve been able to hang around today and you also have to consider that North Carolina in those losses that were talking about they had a lead down the stretch over Iowa State they had a great opportunity to beat Alabama in regulation you know they were out of the Indiana game and they were out of the Virginia Tech game but this slide started in Portland in two games where they had a chance to win late in the games turnovers bad shots really hurt them down the stretch and right now Huber Davis just trying to figure out a way to get this team to understand its identity both offensively and defensively I think theyve taken a good step here so far today second foul Colemans 70 percent foul shooter he was born and raised in Memphis for a job passer coach for seven years of course Colemans dad a high school coach down in Florida Music 6149 Apple jackets very much within Striking Distance here is sticking to the Zone its been effective thus far forcing North Carolina to shoot jump shots and keeping them out of the painted area thats too strong baycott right back up and theres that 10th rebound but thats the problem when you play zone especially against North Carolina when Armando baycat is on the floor you dont have anyone with the responsibility to account for putting a body on him and more often than not he burns you with offensive rebounds and second chance Point having kind of career hes out of Carolina every other game youre looking at tying the record and breaking the record ties one here heres Terry a big cop with another board also has 19 19 points to go in 11 rebounds and on the feed another foul here against the yellow jackets trying to keep it getting into pay Terry with them too yeah against the zone you see Rodney Howard having to go out and contest the shot which means its only Smalls in the paint and you cant deal with Armando baycott with a small in that painted area he has made a career off of offensive rebounding and scoring Second Chance points time Billy Cunningham record and Nance at the line where he makes 80 percent former Northwestern transfer played very well so far in this game in the season and hes played his role in this game weve done the job defensively rebounding making open shots and playing off of the guards and off of Bangkok long jumper on the way but short by Kelly thats the one I need to get another rebound RJ Davis I need to see a double double out of the point guard slacked Away by Kelly on the fifth about five and a half remaining in a contest of the yellow jackets are going to make a move a crowd here at the Smith Center urging the Tar Heels to go on another long run Kelly off the window for two I Love the Way Miles Kellys playing right now you could tell hes just got confidence he understands his role on this team and he knows that his role is growing to be more aggressive be more of a score the Georgia Tech could be successful love kicking it back out Davis from twopoint land Applause Steve Davis go to that a number of times as teams try to contest him around that threepoint line a simple pump fake one dribble pull up and it has been pure here this afternoon its got a really nice game 20 points came averaging 15 Applause get up Kayla going Skyward I think he heard you well thats how you cure what ails you nothing makes you feel better than getting out in transition getting the crowd on their speed throwing it down taking out all your frustrations on the rim Caleb love feeling better about things right now youre ready to go but

turning defense into offense leaky Brock with the steal Caleb love raising way up for the Fantastic finish and even a little smile from Love well expectations so high for North Carolina coming into the season to see love averaging 19 points a game scuffling for long stretches to shoot the ball well but his second half hes looked a lot more like the very effective and very gifted Caleb love of a year ago it really has and again one of the things that Caleb love is having to get used to is playing without the basketball in his hands you know when he came in this freshman year he and RJ Davis together Caleb was the point guard last year it was kind of balanced but this year RJ has had the ball in his hands more often pushing Caleb off the basketball and making him more of a score and hes been aggressively trying to score and at the same time has to have that balance of when to be a playmaker and when to be a score foul here with 407 to go thatll go on Jordan Mecca uh Georgia Tech 6951

the space for Jayla Wilson guys at gawan hours to make work 93 points a game for Missouri though this should be fun this game coming up after the one youre watching stay locked in Dave Chris thank you very much 70 to 51 North Carolina baycott with another double double North Carolina really doing a nice job taking care of the ball in the second half two only three turnovers they really have done a much better job of that Caleb love had three turnovers in the first half he received the message from Huber Davis when he sat and watched septron will come in and play the point guard position to Perfection three assists zero turnovers for Trimble in the first half alone and thats what you gotta love about your veteran players when they see get your message and they go out and put on the floor economy rebounding all the time going past George Lynch and moving up now on a great Sam Perkins and I believe when the seasons over hopefully Mondos able to stay healthy he will leave North Carolina as the number one alltime leading rebounder at this historic program speaking of History how is it that the greatest player to ever play the game of basketball Michael Jordan is not in the College Basketball Hall of Fame now I know there will be people who say well he was a much better NBA player than he was a college basketball player he won a national championship as a freshman he was a national Player of the Year as a junior with all ACC sophomore and how is he not in the college basketball team and that is accurate hes not in hes not in his basketball and when do we begin that investigation as to why not I am not sure but somebody got to tell me something off the front iron that trick is wrong Mondo and they just realized that Mondos got him even though RJ went for that rebound and got hit Mondos got to let RJ get that one that would have been a double double for RJ Davis did not get it he wanted it they knew they knew going out love on the drive his bacon with another rebound and misfiring close and Tapped Out High another opportunity here for the Tar Heels and total command and as a coach this is that time where you say okay I gotta get him out I want RJ to get that rebound but I gotta get my guys out of here dont want to risk any injuries at this point up 19 222 remaining and the youngster the 610 freshman Jalen Washington who has not played this season out of Gary Indiana highly touted he can really shoot it too he really can about to enter this game with 222 to go you see the smile he knows this is going to be game one for him when he gets a chance to step in what a wonderful moment that is I mean here you are in a North Carolina uniform in front of the fans here at Chapel Hill youre about to enter for the first time theyve read about you theyve talked about you they know about you fan base is so knowledgeable here now they want to see him play they really do Huber Davis told me a year ago he is the best shooting big man in that class and that includes Kyle for Lebowski a number of guys with size definitely shooting and play for my guys Chris Pudge my man Sean Smith in Gary Indiana also means streets of Chicago Nike eybl so you can tell the fan very knowledgeable and happy to see Jay on the floor then a nice hand there for Armando Bay contou they needed to see Bats you know coming back from the shoulder injury 21 points 13 rebounds for Armando and under two minutes to go here so North Carolina with a really fine bounce back effort and thats going to be an offensive foul theyll get Pete Nance for that number two check out North Carolinas upcoming schedule now a lot of big tenant yeah North Carolina does not have a easy schedule whatsoever theyve got the Citadel on Tuesday and then next Saturday Ohio State and after that youve got Michigan and the Jumpman classic in Charlotte North Carolina so when you think about it it does not get easier for the Tar Heels at all and Im sure this fan base happy to see them get back in the winning card knocking back a three Coleman has been pretty quiet today 7359 North Carolina ever notice how obvious product placement is I guess I hadnt really noticed Music oh thats my piece of the chacaroni thats the biggest one we make that donate the dollar from every chacaroni to the Papa Johns Foundation thats huge if the hoop was as big as that pizza maybe youd have made some of your free throws somebody saved me a slice where they come from foreign Georgia Tech about to seven and fourth loss heres a look at the Yellow Jackets upcoming schedule including Clemson just before Christmas time we have to remember Georgia Tech didnt get that early December ACC game so Alabama State coming and then its going to be a ACC schedule from there on out for the rambling wreck Clemson Virginia Miami and at Florida State so no easy sledding in this league but Josh Pastor talked to us about the fact that you know teams in this league get better as the season goes along because theyre playing against so many different styles thats the one thing I think the ACC or the ACC differs it seems as though all 15 ACC programs play a completely different style which is partly what prepares the teams for March because whatever you play against somebody in turn of the action youve seen the style before sure he would like to see everybody play 28 conference games Josh pastner and I are similar as being outside the box thinkers that will never happen good luck getting that one approved good luck with that one imagine that meeting and the stairs when he brings that up and it makes a very valid point because again youre playing quality games at least 28 times a season high for black 120 to go the entire Hill fans very happy with this effort today knocked away comes free to Miles Kelly Terry for Sturdivant and a three got a very good look and Nance with a rebound I really took command of the game just before halftime and even though Georgia Tech was within Striking
