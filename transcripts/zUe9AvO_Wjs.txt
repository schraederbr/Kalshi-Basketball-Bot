central Arkansas starters we talked about Elias KO in the open Aldo BR in fact beny in there as well as Georgia Tech grabs down the rebound on maqua with his first going right into looking at the Georgia Tech starter as George knocks that one down similar starting lineup but OBrien in there is a key injury with quacy Reeves Jr out so thats the change in the lineup with OBrien there in the middle pull up from Deep for central Arkansas two strong another one for anqua George had seven assists to zero turnovers as obryans going to get a heat check and too strong fact B brings it up transfer from Johns Hopkins University and D3 ball there goes last off of Terry and out of bounds pretty fast tempo out of the gate Georgia Tech uh they will look to push Tempo see two dribble Drive

right now two for three from deep that looked good he was just 7even of 33 from Beyond The Arc coming into this one at 21 but certainly looking confident early on in this one the ball movement against Charleston Southern was something that Georgia Tech really improved on on witha in the corner hes guarded by Taylor hes got a massive size Advantage but George takes it how many threes we going to have here early four triples already Georgia Tech with the hot hand really taking what the defense gives the Bears are packing it in in a Zone and begging Georgia Tech to shoot that Georgia Techs been able to knock him down seven total threes already in this one between the two teams Taylor works the Baseline George Goes Down stolen away by Terry OBrien nice stop slows it down and lays it in and again you see the vision of Nate George pushing Tempo finding the open man he has three assists already in this one OBrien a nice job running the floor KO bringing up to take the pick on witha confusion on the defensive end George grabs the rebound but Terry and anqua didnt switch or at least know who is switching George hard off the iron Im would check what tries to go for the boards

nine rebounds and was three for seven from Beyond The Arc while going eight for 13 from the field trapped in the corner unqua Chucks it over the top Fox runs it down oneonone but Terry goes up strong impressive Fox with some bounce right there he went up and Terrys a guy whos got got some bounce himself but a nice finish in traffic Terry actually did a nice job to avoid the contact its a solid contest offense won the battle on that one mff comes in it today averaging just around six points Terry double digit score for OBrien in the corner started out hot Powell with the offensive board tried to go up no call on witha now cant get it to go gets his own board tips it in did a drive by the locker room before the game coach schan walked me into the locker room and showed me the board it a defense and rebounding are the keys and right there thats two offensive rebounds for Georgia Tech they made the Bears pay for it on that one right now the yellow jackets have Central Arkansas doubled up in rebounding 157 a deep ball this one goes for the Bears bent Fox two possession game hanging tight Taylor again a true freshman leading score over 15 points per game and thats what he does he can shoot the ball well from Beyond The Arc going up hard was Terry he draws the foul I wasnt kidding I said he had bounce but woo that was almost a poster right there Lance Terry the senior taking off from outside the paint lets get a look at this one but first Fox inside out three set up by the Freshman Taylor heres the look at Terry wow nice job attacking the seam drawing contact Terrys at the line hes got four points in this one just hit the first substitutions coming in Dongo George enter the lineup all the starters except for OBrien kept mustaf out Terry hits the second has five points now on the day pressure coming from Georgia Tech B brings up the ball bagar in for Turner whos back in the game handoff KO from Deep clanks Off kicked out Dongo grabs it George brings up and slows it down for the yellow jackets kicks to the corner on mucheka nice pass in for Dongo and Turner reaches the hand in KO was doing a nice job denying the post Georgia Tech really had to work to get in there thread the needle Dongo draws the contact in traffic but thats what youll see out of Central Arkansas theyre going to pack it in uh theyre going to make Georgia Tech work to get it into the seams and hopefully they shoot contested threes uh again 2720 sevenpoint deficit Georgia Tech now five of 12 from Beyond The Arc Tango preseason ACC second team hits the first 65 free throw shooter on the Applause year sophomore looking for a big jump for Coach doore out of Sagle its the second 292 npoint lead for Georgia Tech and Dongo now with six points and five rebounds to go with it look for jorgia to continue to be patient and try to work the ball and get post Touches for Dongo he led the way with eight boards last game a foul off ball comes in against Dango and will step aside 29 20 ninepoint lead for the yellow jackets but the big 29 to 20 here in mamish Pavilion in Atlanta looking there at John Gman who was at Alabama Huntsville before coming to Central Arkansas and no shock here he liked to shoot the three there as well yeah you see right now they play five out kind of a Princeton modified where they theyll play through their post players and really look to cut back door free up uh shooters for uh the kickouts and pop backs uh and thats what they do thats what he wants to do here in one game early this season against Randall University attempted 54 threepointers in the game so stylistically he will recruit to that thats what he did at Huntsville and had great success with it five consecutive NCA tournaments at the D2 level three Conference titles had a great pedigree as a head coach KO lays it in elas Ko now with five two for six from the field George who took a spill on the other end passes inside Dongo and a nice assist for Nathan George Dongo with the Finish George put it only where Dongo could get it nice and high led him to his outside hand and Dongo with great hands on the interior catching finish Taylor kicks outside SAS doesnt go on mueka with it mustaf quickly across half court George been running the point really well four assists no turnovers Terry from Deep hes good Terry Lance Terry the senior another Inside Out threepoint attempt Georgia Tech deliver it with the attack and finding the open man stretch the lead to 12 Music now everyone getting a touch that b again former blue J Fade Away Nice Shot timely bucket that was a big one on that possession fagi now eight points leads all bear scores Georgia Tech we talked about the guard play Terry and George combin 17 points right now and they both have uh zero turnovers and a combined six assists so the guard play has been strong and we seean CA Shu comes off throws it to the sideline wants to play D on hes got one Che on just threw it over out the sideline now the official will take it to go that pick and pop KO deep ball doesnt go George grabs it and Coach STM is now looking at the official saying alua does not have his left shoe and now thatll get corrected you cant miss it I me its got to be a size 19 shoe out there I mean official crew we cant catch a SI 20 shoe floating around here well the way he throws this into the F like you said size 19 that may hurt hey man I like the hustle he he knows coach dmire is going to be on him if he doesnt get back on defense we got Shooters coming Kos coming the other way NOA the passion no shoe no problem for anua 12point lead now for Georgia Tech first time theyve extended it the double figures largest lead of the game Dongo nearly loses it grabs it before half court George with nine points leading the way motiff works the Baseline gets over the top nice bounce and in gets Music two his last two games I love the the pace that he plays at you know his ability to utilize his size under control get to the paint and there you see him getting in the back with the left hand finishing traffic came from overtime Elite a fourstar prospect and he came to the yellow jackets Taylor goes into a triple team working against George takes the pull up no good free ball Turner grabs it in the paint cant get it to go on eka defended George trying to lace one over to Terry in the corner got bumps but stays with Georgia Tech only turned the ball over twice right now its going to stay with Georgia Tech f b stepping out of bounds the Bears doing a nice job pushing and Dongo off the block on that possession and then if he does touch it deep theyre going to come with that trap from above on that two3 if youre a post player for Georgia Tech youve got to be conscious of throwing out of the Trap inside Dongo doesnt go got stung usually gets up for that one too much turkey in the tummy maybe a little strong from the corner Ben Music Fox and the Bears make a pay soongo gets a great look just couldnt didnt have enough bounce on it central Arkansa comes back with a quick triple Brian working it around for George George pulls up short f b trying to push the pace e bagaro over the top and the bounce goes in Tim getting ready to come in for central Arkansas and a couple substitutions will as well they bring it back to a single digit deficit but Georgia Tech still in control started off high and theyre both allowing the game to come to them thats a great highquality shot by Terry feet were set shoulders Square held the follow through Lance Terry two of three from Beyond The Arc hes got eight points in this one and Nate George the head of the snake six assists zero turnovers and he has three triples what a half for the sophomore you know Georgia Tech is playing up to their full potential when hes not turning over the ball and hes getting his team teammates involved yeah and thats what he does he makes his teammates better I I think you know a little bit too much pass first early in the year I think hes getting a little selfish hes finding his offense and thats been encouraged by coach stmy who wasnt a bad point guard himself you know so hes getting the coaching he needs and hes giving the team what they need and with Mulla out Mulla was leading the jackets uh in scoring so George has taken on more of a scoring role gaman McCullum averaging just under 13 points a game hes out along with quisi Reeves Terry pulls up from Deep just a little left bagaro with the rebound as Taylor brings it up 315 to go here in the first half Kos going to try from way outside and hits KO from Deep on that possession and then you know again it was the dribble drive and throwback behind the defense and Georgia Techs got to be conscious of ko he has no hesitation that one was from Deep you got to close out with high hands on him the big man is two for four from Deep right now George with it kicks it over for OBrien hes going to try and answer a three of his own right back at you OBrien Big Time shot right there the transfer from Colorado only yellow jacket with NCA tournament experience theres Tim up to top goes by Glory KO gets knocked out and believe the foul is going to be on LC OBrien here Georgia Tech again spreading out feet were set the bear is just a little bit late getting OBrien on that one hes a guy they can knock that down you got to be there when the balls moving in the air as a Defender you got to be moving with it o Brian makes them pay at the Baseline Central Arkansas ball trying to get Taylor open they have to pass it long OBrien goes down inside and a foul will going against anua bagaru will shoot too unfortunate possession for the jackets there Powell and OBrien got tangled up in traffic well see it here ouch right there yes so theres a bright spot right that pow didnt turn his ankle that was dangerous looks like both are going to be okay the Bears chance to go to the line to cut into this one Eve bagaro hasnt had many trips to the line so not a big sample size but it was two of three going into that one now two of four on the season transfer from Sienna played in all six games had one start hes averaging 20 minutes per game eight points in those Applause outings Bears committed to the Zone theyre extending right now one two two look or 32 Georgia Tech has forced them to come out and play those wings going inside Dongo had a wide openen Lane to the basket guess who got the assist I wonder who Nathan George he is slicing and dicing right through the defense right now surgical with his approach we already highlighted theres a foul going against Dongo we highlighted at the beginning it was seven assists no turnovers for George that was the entire last game against Charleston Southern hes got eight with no 15 minutes of play eight assists zero turnovers hes again hes got nine points to go with it up top for KO thought about the shot eat him slings it around GRE bamy hasnt looked for his shot in quite some time KO gets it knocked away on mucheka and Dongo gather it down Anda the true freshman in the starting lineup for Georgia Tech has done well throughout this season got into foul trouble last time now that hasnt been too common of a problem Musta outside George from Deep doesnt get the bounce he wanted fact B pushing the pace for central Arkansas hand off for Taylor he goes from three B pushes again another example of dribble drive and throwing back behind the def defense Georgia Tech its been solid this half if theyre getting hurt its been the drives and kicked back behind the action driving inside kicked out for three Terry Terry gets the bucket the assist for George both teams now with eight triples uh great shooting first half 50 from Beyond The Arc for central Arkansas 47 for the jackets back B goes inside tough bucket into the chest of Dongo hes having a half he has 10 points leads all bears scorers right now four of six from the floor hes got four boards two assists to go with it solid half for fact by four Central Arkansas players with eight or more points Georgia Tech wants the last shot of the half Terry pulls up he is money on a heater right now now Terry stretches the lead on a bomb at the end of the half hes four of six on the floor four triples in the first half for the senior Lance Terry and he can Coast into the locker room feel a little bit better better about where theyre at right now 11 points 49 points in the first half 52 shooting from the floor Central Arkansas staying close theyll regroup got to find a way to contest threes though coming out of the half BS in the first half just two turnovers if they stick to that game plan theyll look uh pretty good here at the end of this one thats another thing you didnt see on that graphic zero turnovers for George hes wheeling and dealing here central Arkansas starting with the ball in the second half Sous backing down on witha loses his dribble goes out of bounds its going to stay with Central Arkansas George has had nine assists four times in his career career high of 11 already pretty close to that one going outside for KO Sous hands off for Taylor inside kateo oneonone with OBrien Fades away and and draws the foul OBrien is going to pick up his second of this one OBrien just nicked him on the elbow KO The Savvy upper classman just drawing the foul he He commands respect because he is a shot maker and coming off a 23point careerhigh effort and a double overtime win against Asheville and hell go to the line get central Arkansas on the board here to start the half Nails the first one out of Sunrise Christian Academy his teammate jvan guy King who is out today also a Sunrise Christian Alum they overlapped for just two years 10point game now looking at Ko who has had a great career and a great start to the 2425 season and hits the second yeah hes been a model of efficiency shooting at about 55 from the floor on the season Georgia Tech now on the offensive end of things Terry for anua Dongo was trying to get the ball in the post hes guarded by Taylor right now with the size Advantage outside an rqua will try his luck from Deep doesnt go Terry with the rebound goes up for the put back and it goes hes got some great strength and bounce he goes up tucked the left shoulder into KO bounced the defense off and went up with the right hook nice touch by Terry Terry a pillar of this program versatile players weve seen him so far this season blocked just an example there does it all George pushes into the paint floater no good Dongo last to touch it and tady play by Terry blocks it with the left hand contesting high and then tapped it back with the right only thing the yellow jackets didnt do was convert on the other end on that play but Terry demonstrating his his defense and his high IQ there tipping to his teammate MCB up for Kato Kato just inside the long two up and over the backboard called to turn over and goes to the yellow jackets coach Schulman down in front of us defensive stance and uh passionate coach coming off five consecutive NCA tournament trips at Alabama Huntsville hes passionate on the sideline Taylor gets in past his man dumps off in bagaro over the top Wayne Taylor get used to hearing that name in the a sun thats a nice looking freshman right there and going up Dongo draws a foul after that shot from George thats two times get to the paint make George on dribble Drive penetration but here you see the Freshman draws the defense throws back behind it giving the assist and 15 ebaru with the Finish thats five points for him Nate George on the other side of it doing his thing attacking Georgia Tech long ball to Dongo touched with bagaro and we were talking about Taylor standing only at 5 11 those smaller undersized players often with a really high IQ when theyre standing on the floor like he is yeah out of the state of Arkansas over 3000 points scored in his high school career um just a gym rat loves to compete and hes got his best ball ahead hes off to a great start to his collegiate career nine points here today amua gets double team George thought about it moves for OBrien off in an offensive board for Georgia Tech 19 on the shot clock George tries again OBrien another offensive board Yellow Jackets cleaning up on the glass and a timeout called very well timed from Georgia Tech and were going to step aside ninepoint lead for Georgia Tech here early in the second half theyre just one of seven from the field um the positive is they have three offensive rebounds for Coach Schulman that was the thing were going to play zone were going to pack it in begy to shoot but we got a box out and rebound and bears have failed to do that early on in this one Georgia Tech will try to capitalize stolen away back beny pushing the pace Taylor nice spin move to get the open three and Nails it how about that lane Taylor little pouette get him a dance some with the Stars looking for someone see the footwork on that wow spins away to get Terry past him shot fake and man that was impressive now to the other side George trying to go over top and looked like a miscommunication a foul on B lets take a look at this fancy footwork right here the piece of the piece of Mind of just shot fake spin towards the bench not turn out of bounds get your feet behind the three and then hit it in indongo eye whos one of the leading shot blockers in the ACC and that was a freshman doing that extremely impressive mive play for Taylor we got a twopossession game its a close one 51 45 six points separate the two Powell he hits for Georgia Tech to win thats what theyre going to have to do theyre going to get high quality shots from Beyond The Arc and the ability to convert Powell on that one knocks it down the transfer from Sacramento State all but one play player for Georgia Tech has gotten points Powell on Kato Fades away doesnt go Terry slows it down for the Yellow Jacket mustaf has four points is two for four on the field or from the field I should say ball sticking a little bit for Georgia Tech right now we got to get it moving motiff tries to drive goes to the middle takes the contact comes down with his own board before hes fouled coach shman had his hands out he didnt thought it was uh equal contact on both sides mustaf plowing his way into the paint Georgia Tech is up nine shman look of confusion Subs coming in Fox who had a great first half he had eight Off the Bench Fox will insert himself in the game so well take a break here here willll be back at the cish Pavilion Kits Court Georgia Tech your analytics guy a lot of analytics guys here on the campus of Georgia Tech the numbers say let Georgia Tech shoot the three contest them but then you have to rebound its got to be a oneandone and the undersized team theyre going to pack in zone all year in the asan and try to make teams beat him from Beyond The Ark foul mff doesnt get the bucket and the foul against Turner his second turnou some great coaches you know in the history of the game you know you think of Zone defenses uh the great John Cheney at Temple Jim beheim at Syracuse um you know committed to their principles packing in the zone and forcing contested threes and rebounding out of it you recruit to that system um thats the most thing most important thing as a coach what do you stand for and Coach Schulman had great success with his defense and offensive philosophy coming from Huntsville motiff a really good free throw shooter was 87 coming into this one gets both 11point lead for Georgia Tech able to stretch it back out again fact B veracious into the corner Ben Fox he already hit one today no good there offensive board for central Arkansas Taylor takes the three hard off the iron grabb down a clinic right now of offensive rebounding for central Arkansas F Beni goes up and around Dango with the board crit Suare affecting the shot howwell goes up and central Arkansas called on the foul mare on that possession saved a bucket he kept his verticality with his arm2 a nice job by Suare but Arkansass coming uh you know coming back on D in transition theyve got to do a better job stopping the ball not allowing early offensive attack Pals at the line looking to convert misses the first one Powell out of Dallas Texas had a long road to Georgia Tech to Sacramento State and then North Carolina AT and had to work his way to a power four program turnover there for Georgia Tech and Central Arkansa takes it from the Baseline back bamy grabs it in the corner numbers for central Arkansas Taylor Terry gets back in inside for Turner bounced around doesnt go Powell with the board Turner took some contacts from Suare but again he did a nice job job keeping his hands vertical so had a foul early in the game and Im sure hes getting some coaching on the sideline assistant coach Carl Hobs associate head coach longtime assistant of Jim Calhoun at Yukon and Coach Hobs was a former assistant at GDB but Terry right there gets to the paint Georgia Tech trying to pull away Terry now with 18 points hes six of nine from the field its going around him FB Terry disrupts it Powell tries to split FB says Ill take that right back steel for a steel and then Terrys called on the foul his first active hands he Terry had five steals Georgia Techs last win against Charleston Southern hes going to play hard he plays active guard multiple positions there you see coach thire working the bench o without two of their key contributors McCullum and quy Reeves today so OBrien and Powell looking to step up in their place Suare also getting some significant minutes Bucket from Central Arkansas is Music KO puts it down makes it 5847 gets one shot shot at the line KO with the back door the Princeton action the flush a little leftover stuffing on the table there KO to the line see there his line for the game 12 points no board for did you see him with a little flex and a look back I kind of ko its okay man you can look at him you just gave him the look over the right shoulder and let him know about it why is KO all the confidence in the world definitely doesnt fear an ACC opponent as you can see 13 points for him today heres George back in nine assists nine points for him motiff out for George George tries his luck doesnt go Turner grabs it down hes been playing a lot of the minutes in the middle for central Arkansas Tim has been on the bench only 11 minutes in for him Taylor checks it back out the three ball good for Kato the man from the land down under getting it going the slam dunk follows it up with a triple we got a sevenpoint game back within 10 motiff goes in draws the foul against Turner picks up his third Jaden a nice job hitting the seam on that I like Georgia Tech coming right back at you again KO feet set throwback behind the defense make him pay KO now eight points in the second half but Jaden again Georgia Tech got the ball out one or two pitches ahead and Jaden saw the seam and the defense have a chance to go to line to Applause convert 59 51 Ben Fox checks in coming on for central Music Arkansas that one goes 6051 ninepoint game closing in towards halfway through the second half Taylor backing down musti over halfway great Handle by him and motiff gets called on the foul coach star wasnt happy with that call by a veteran official Teddy Valentin having a few words not going to win that battle with that man right there in the stripes lot of respect there between those two been around years man final fours NCA championships uh well respected in the game Turner goes up Central Arkansas wanted a foul dont get it George now pulls up in and out KO with the rebound KO a nice job holding Powell off and Powells now small guy big time Rebound in traffic Turner waiting for Coach schumans instructions three star recruit by 247 at offers from North Texas Chattanooga as well as OBriens now called and now were starting to see the fouls ramp up here for Georgia Tech still a npoint lead here for Georgia Tech But Central Arkansas keeps on finding their way inside Elias Kato leading the way for the Music Bears Central Arkansas has found their Duo right now Lane Taylor and Elias kto are a dynamic duo yeah youre going to see the ball in those twos hands uh down the stretch here Kato with 16 points Taylor with 12 theyre combined six of six perfect from the free throw line and six of 11 collectively from Beyond The Arc uh so expect to see a heavy dose of those two down the stretch as they try to get back into this one down nine theyre hanging around Georgia Tech having a tough time shaking them John I just want to point out this is a great basketball game two very good teams going at it right now yeah and what I like about it its been clean you know youre not seen a lot of turnovers uh both teams are competing um Georgia Tech has been cold in the second half they had 13 assists in the first half just one assist on three made baskets now were under 8 minutes into the second half so the Bears getting it done on the defensive side of the ball both teams over 40 from the field and from three as its kicked out for George goes inside Terry into the Lane Falling Away draws the foul and hell go to the line for two its going to be on E Co shman didnt like that call he felt like the driver was going away from the basketball and felt like it was a bailout on that possession but Showmans a guy as Class Act hes you know body language on the sideline but hes getting to the next play cant do much with that and Terry converts Terry leads all scores on the floor now with 19 points hes six of nine from the field and a perfect four for four from the line good waiting for that one fourth one hits and now hes at 20 10 points away from the a thous point mark he needed 30 in this one well hes pretty close at this point hes feeling it too we might see it B inside for Kato whos feeling it himself goes across and motiff just has that left arm inside hits the arm Jaden for a freshman thats what I like about him his size and strength athleticism he guard multiple positions uh we saw him a couple possessions ago sitting down on a guard and keeping the guard in front and there hes matched up given up a couple inches to KO but his length his size his strength um hes ahead of his years you dont really see a freshman you look at that body six personal fouls in the entire first half for Georgia Tech six already in the second here with 11 10 to go in the half losing the ball there for a moment Turner trying to get it away fact B with 7 seconds on the shot clock looking for the shot Turner now inside hes got two seconds goes over the top the tip doesnt go Powell grabs it down nice defensive stop right there by Georgia Tech nice job playing defense without fouling theres a lot of contact in there but Georgia Tech gets out try to convert stretch the lead double figures George for Powell hes got space cant get it Suare with a nice move from The Freshman Terry Spence in the middle nice for 22 points on the day JY welcome to AC level guard play that was an athletic finish by Terry hes got 22 again hes just eight points away from that 1000 Point marker if bagaro fact B had a good first half 10 points four of eight in the game and Suare reaches in gets the foul thats one of those plays Suare active but youve got to do your best to not foul in that situation the offensive player was going east to west away from the basket not a threat to score and to pick up a foul 35 ft from the basket in the bonus situations a tough break for the jackets puts F beny on the line bounces around and in for the one of one in the bonus both teams in the bonus lots of fouls coming in this second half second one from F Bey is good and over 80 free throw shooter on the season George back running the point motiff off the ball here trying to find Terry open give him space guarded by bagru this time and pulls up from Deep motiff Powell and him battle for the ball its loose diving for it whos going to get it Powell does tries to Bounce It Off KO and now a jump Applause ball thats going to bring these guys to the bench Georgia Tech took a timeout no one wanted it on that possession it was bouncing around for a while out there Central Arkansas a tough team to shake theyve got great backboard for central Arkansas 15 players on their roster underclassman only a junior in etim and Kato a senior I think at this Stage Coach Schulman in his coaching career um hes been a journeyman hes been around the game 30 plus years he wants to build it the way he wants to do it thats why he took this job uh he wasnt looking for it it came together very quickly in last years postseason at Huntsville and he had accepted a job visiting campus with his wife and a week later hes hes got the job in a new position and back to D1 Ball but hes going to build it with guys that play fit to his system George with a nice move for a pullup J but hed never been to Conway um Arkansas he and his wife went there fell in love with the campus and um the administration like the facilities just need a little dusting off and you know I think he had something left in the tank from his D1 stint earlier he wanted to get back and give it one more go at it and here he is hes doing it now is at Chattanooga motiff picks that one off like a DB lays it in on the other end Oh north to south downhill thats where he is at his best The Freshman with a head of team look out not too many connections from Georgia Tech and Conway Arkansas but it is the hometown of Georgia Tech golfer Bryce Moulder fourtime AllAmerican when he was here as a yellow jacket as George grabs that down kicks to Suare in the corner way too strong its been in the wait room man I mean time score youve got the lead uh not really what Suare does taken away if bagaro inside Kato trying to tip it Powell cant grab and then he does gets the rebound Georgia Tech with another opportunity to blow this game open right here George nine assists in the first half has not assisted on a bucket yet Powell on the Baseline George Terry thought about it drives spinning just short two hard dribbles left and the spin back to the right uh weve seen that a number of times Taylor from three and theyll take a break Lane Taylor The Freshman from Farmington in the second half see a breakdown of that second half scoring motiff trying to keep it going and Turner gets the foul that is his Music fourth Georgia Tech will be in the bonus coach Schulman always always teaching teaching the game Music J 12point game he knows those fouls right now with 655 are costly clock stopped giving away points at the free throw line mustaf gets the first been good at the free throw line today hits it perfect six for six 14point lead second largest lead of this game is up to 15 with 8 and a half minutes left now 645 on the clock Taylor hell go for the Triple planks out Powell grabs it down Terry bringing it up the floor working with George in the back court they found a rhythm over the past two games mustaf over the top nice bounce drops the bucket mof did a nice job flashing to the ball pow had the awareness to find him mustaf now with 14 so hes stringing together a couple really good games off the bench for the jackets he had 16 in his last outing thats now 14 in this one for the Freshman handoff Taylor keep going back to him and wow favorable rims for Lane Taylor friendly roll Taylor doing his part keep the Bears in Striking Distance Taylor with 18 his fifth triple The Bears Still trailing by 13 Georgia Tech getting it done on the offensive side of the ball The Freshman having his way in Atlanta so far through this one both teams have played well and John Id say both teams have just executed very well you look at the against Charleston Southern while hes doing it again today yeah thats a good sign thats continuity uh thats four guys stepping up and then you throw in OBrien he had a nice first half so Georgia Tech scoring not going to be the challenge for this team if they can take care of the basketball and defend at a high level uh theyre going to be competitive on most nights inside Dongo trying to go underneath Taylor kicks it over gets it back Taylor another three taking so many shots here is theres a foul and KO goes down well see who its on Dongo will pick up his third personal foul talk about shots KO took a took a good shot on that one but hell get a chance to Shake It Off see battling took the right hand to the right side of the jaw on the box out by Dongo KO in this one hes got 16 points hes five of 12 from the field hes got four rebounds coach shman not happy with the contact on that play standing up for his leader leing returning score KO taking another look at it here coach schan like youve said very even keeled but right now is not happy to see our officials Ted Valentine there on the far right then St in the middle and then Tim clery talking to coach schan right now it was tough from the last angle that we saw but think it was a KO can bring that out of you hes a physical guy hes going to attack and when youre going to box out and find contact theres just a loose right hand by nongo happen to hit KO in the in the right cheek Kos a guy thats off the ball you cant see hell come in from the bottom side of the screen and you know Dongo did not have eyes there was no intent but hes looking back blindly and trying to find find the man he knows Kos coming KO a physical player thats going to initiate contact and go for the glass it be interesting to see what the crew decides on this one talking it over here and Music Valentine making sure both benches stay in the huddles getting more looks at it I think and dangos argument is um you know he did not have eyes on on the uh offensive rebounder his eyes were focused on the ball and the rim and so its hard to have intent to hit in the face when youre not looking at the Target when we looked at it Dongo looked back for a brief moment just to see where Kato was and then like you said swung his head forward after review its elevated to an F1 so a flagrant one elevated I think you know you take contact like that the face um protecting the welfare of the players thats um thats a good call could be argument from both sides coach ster kind of shaking his head K to gets the first from the technical and has a free second as well five and a half to play in this one 12point game misses the second keeps it at 12 now he can get back to business theyll be tossed in from the Bas line for central Arkansas getting a look at coach STM there wasnt too happy with the technical upgrade but only one point HS them with Kato there going one of two back Music B by motiff now Terry comes in Taylor kicks back out FB pulls up midrange pulled down Dongo and bagaro is going to get called on the foul picks up his second Applause physical battle there late in the clock and Dongo comes down with it that was a nice possession by Georgia Tech a lot of clock was worked a lot of ball touches and they were able to contain the dribble Drive tough to do on um the back court of the Bears so Dango will go to the line chance to convert Dongo meaning scorer through the beginning of the season for Georgia Tech gets a one and one averaging 14 points seven rebounds on the Year good on the glass see eight rebounds here today Nails the first gets a chance out a second hes a guy that does so many things well he can you know run the floor put pressure on the defense in transition just by his size and hes got a point guard in Nate George that will find him when hes open good law passes theyll play twoman game thats a nice sophomore package for Coach STM inside Taylor guarded by George another sophomore drives the Baseline kicks outside disrupted stays with Central Arkansas e bagaro hes stripped Bowl called dont know which side its on just yet and it looks like against Central Arkansas 23 in Black DJ SES called him foul yeah I missed that one I didnt see the contact I was looking at the ball so that would have happened off the ball Sous extending the right arm that was what the body language from the official calling on the Baseline said again I didnt see the contact Georgia Tech nevertheless will go to the line a chance to convert stretch the lead George gets the first one and we were just talking about Dango who all ACC rookie team him and Nathan George kind of the Staples to build around here for Georgia Tech two young guys showing a lot of potential their freshman years and trying to make that jump in their sophomore season yeah and you can already see it the the leadership I think as sophomore is a little more vocal comfortable in their skin and they will continue to grow kicked outside if bagaro wet from the corner there hanging around 12point game playing mantoman defense they switch everything dribble handoffs ball screens Terry from the corner Lance Terry 25 Music points under four minutes to go f beny answers right right back a battle between those two hes got 13 or 15 excuse me that was his third triple in the game hes three of six from Deep 50 by himself Terry is five of nine motiff drives in and draws a foul on Kato which will be his second and with 336 left in the second a 7866 lead Lance Terry from the corner but answered you want him playing confident basketball and um with McCullum out hes a guy that jackets will go to review here believe its on the foul see we can get a look at this officials screen over here try to find out what theyre looking Music at 12point game here Georgia Tech in the lead with 336 left and they were looking at the foul officials holding up the three maybe just making sure the foul was was addressed to the appropriate player was funny Coach Schulman came over during uh you know the dead ball situation he looked at me and we spent some time together shoot around he said hey you think we can get the first two minutes of this game back uh again they started down 100 to the jackets so mustaf was fouled they had to make out who got fouled we saw Terry was there ready to take shots but instead itll be mustaf who hits the first 13point lead for Georgia Tech mustaf grabs his own rebound seven of eight from the charity stripe that was his first Miss but they pay off hey if youre going to miss one yeah why not go get your offensive rebound freshman getting in there kick to the corner Powell back up mustaf tries his luck off the bank the backboard mustaf Colin banked for the Applause three 8266 Jaden now with 18 with that triple off the glass he had 16 last game 18 this game both coming off the bench Taylor goes from Deep free ball Powell Nate George brings it up hes got a double double 13 points 10 assists in just one turnover and Dongo lays it up and then hes got Applause 13 George D eight I was to say eight rebounds to go with that so hes chasing that double double as well Georgia Tech on a 60 run over the last minute three of their last three shots from the field Kato fade away at the Baseline doesnt get the bounce grabs by Powell who gobbles up the boards hes got eight rebounds in this one does the nittygritty work really well George rattles in and out from Deep V B keeping the pace up here down 18 Kato back up top BB with 15 five of 10 from the field he takes a three looks like George didnt even think he was going to take it by with that rebound thatll push him to nine rebounds 13 points jadeen mustaf had 18 points this one lance Terry was the player of the game though for the jackets with 25 but a very competitive ason opponent the Bears they were number one in field goal percentage defense coming to this one uh they competed hard stuck around most of this game Georgia Tech up 18 this is their largest lead of the game taking a look at the schedule coming up here for Georgia Tech they head to the ACC SEC challenge heading to Oklahoma and then North Carolina stting ACC play and its a tough schedule over the next five yeah for sure um and theyll get Battle tested right out of the gate man I mean those are two tough opponents tough places to play um Sooners Tar Heels very competitive early on in this season Northwestern just got a a good win yesterday so but its time seven home games its heading into December and thats when you got to test yourself foul on Terry three in this game having a career day as a yellow jacket 25 like John had five points from the Thousand Mark hell try and get that done in Oklahoma against the Sooners Taylor hits the first looking at Central Arkansas who goes to Little Rock and plays all the Arkansas schools Little Rock Pine Bluff and then Coach calip Perry and the Razer backs yeah Coach Cal assemble a nice talented roster there thatll be an interesting one but coach shman is uh you know style of play stylistically theyre going to do uh three things on most nights theyre going to compete theyre going to play hard theyre going to shoot a lot of Threes um defensively he has the philosophy no layups no second shots and nothing easy at The Rim pressure coming from Central Arkansas with under a minute to play George with it up top hes had a great day 13 Points 11 assists in 33 minutes gets it back 88 seconds on the shot clock and George wet from Deep his fourth three Georgia Tech now with 87 points on 48 from the field really shot the threepointer well 13 triples on the day over 40 from Beyond The Arc 15 seconds left FC B still wants a bucket Taylor in the corner too strong Dongo and mustaf will grab it and dribble this one out backto back wins for the first time this season for
