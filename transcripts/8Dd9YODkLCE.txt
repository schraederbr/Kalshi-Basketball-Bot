teams two teams that love to shoot the three love to get into ball screen all right and two uptick teams I think its going to be a lot of fun Roger AES Courtney green and Paul zel high level crew are you highle crew Roger AR has thrown that ball up in the national championship game a few times Paul Zs been in the final four Courtney Greens on his way George attack has lost three games in a row in including to Louisville on Saturday afternoon Louisville 182 run to take hold of that one and win by 12 Burton Shrewsberry Booth Davis ji the lineup that beat Virginia Tech on Saturday is Burtons three ball off to the Applause left nice very good action action they worked on during the day to refuse the pick nice followup thats exactly what Georgia Tech has got to be able to do get on the glass from the beginning of the game excellent follow thats by Dongo 69 freshman from Sagal the threetime ACC rookie of the week can really clean the glass top 10 in the ACC in offensive rebounds you saw it there and the jackets strike first at forell now a steel into the front Court Reeves the transfer from Florida lost to handle they left George wide open for three back iron no good rebound snagged out of the sky by K right the away were seeing the game plan in action they want to deny the high post catches Notre Dame was not ready for that the last possession now theyre getting a little bit more freedom to play off the top to get to their twoman game attacking those Navy tops and bottoms with the gold trim white tops white bottoms for not or Applause tank 20 early action George an outstanding point guard jumper had the elbow not going to fall well theres one one thing were going to see tonight AR its going to be pocket passes on the break great Drive Great throw ahead off the break Tay Davis the scoring column and the Irish on the Applause board Notre Dame 8 and 16 on the year snapped a seven game losing streak with the win over Virginia Tech Saturday right here at for strong drive to the basket how about Reeves they want to get him going over the last couple of games absolutely and thats one area where hes got to continue to improve is in his driving and passing but that was a really good job coming off the handoff to get to the lane going to his right hand averaging nearly five points per game over his last five struggling eight of 36 so thats a good sign jackets by two drive down low block called by Roger aers and the Irish will go to the line well this is going to be really important inside of this game today like whos going to establish getting to the foul line and we see this right here its a great roll he goes up strong uh tar gapar is just a little bit late uh jumps off two feet thats whats going to be important theres going to be a lot of roll passes a lot of rolling a lot of pocket passes some lob passes who can force a confrontation and some Conflict at that Rim first and foremost Advantage Notre Dame on that Michael Shrewsberry talked about trying to be aggressive and balancing with the way that they want to run sets pushing in transition he said his team has kept the energy High coach even throughout that losing streak and he said the team really needed the victory over Virginia Tech morale at an alltime high well I thought we walked into a a prelim concert today at the walkthrough the music guys were Lively jumping around they were excited it was an excellent walkthrough both teams had great walkthroughs two different approaches but they were both very very good TI in four early pick and roll nice kick to the corner fumbled there out of bounds deari could not hang on to it the sophomore from New Zealand started his career at UMass and transferred over to Atlanta to play for Damon Stam Meer in his first season former NBA Rookie of the Year theyre just trying to figure things out Coach K it feels like at their best Georgia Tech can beat anybody right Duke in Carolina they could have beat Duke twice I mean they could have definitely beat Duke twice they have an attack they have a plan both of these coaches are young as College head coach es but theyre not young in the game and they really understand what it takes to win what they want their team to do they understand what roles are two outstanding coaches pass deflected turnover heres Davis Burton star freshman one of the best in the country reverse high off the glass didnt quite create that angle the way he wanted to both teams playing fast maybe a little faster than what they want but the turnover and the Miss shots are creating these break opportunities this one ended 7568 in overtime on January 9th at Mish Pavilion Ro Dame outscoring Georgia Tech 92 in that OT period not great spacing on this break theyre trying to get it better but usually this team does a great job of getting to the corner but a great pullup for Marcus Burton his pullup game has improved tremendously since the beginning of the Season he can get to the rim he could always make some pullups but now its way more consistent coach he might have played his best game most complete game against Virginia Tech Saturday 16 points eight assists got his teammates involved a floor General and got six Steals on defense oh the steals are incredible another great pocket pass great thats a place ARA where Miles Kelly has improved he comes off the pick and roll he reads screens he can deliver that pocket pass really impressive action tied early on six all here in South off the BS this one came down to the wider 25 points for Braden shuberry 25 points for Miles Kelly and some big shots in Atlanta it was by Dongo three that tied things and sent it to overtime two teams again coach that they give everything they have on the court 75 at 68 Notre Dame knocking off Tech that night oh theres no question about that Georgia Tech got off to a great start turning him over Georgia Tech in that game had 14 points in the first 16 minutes of that game off turn overs Notre Dame ended the half not turning it over not giving him any points and came back out in the second half and played a much more solid game which had a lot to do with it getting it overtime and a lot to do with them getting the win look at how many close games Georgia Tech has been playing this season just feels like and Coach ster told us earlier at shootaround we just couldnt get over the hump theres a fourminute stretch in every game that just kind of spirals out of control on it well and thats where experience comes in thats where understanding I remember back in 17 Baylor I did some tlor games three games came down to the last possession or the second to last possession few short years later theyre national champions you got to go through those moments I know college basketballs different now but you got to go through those moments and then you got a chance to overcome those if you can stick together with your court little Zone from Tech Burton three back iron rebound stur of it early threes mean long rebounds which give opportunities like this to get out and run for both teams two teams that are not shy jacking It Up From Beyond The Arc well thats thats the taboo word you dont want to hear as a coach jacking it up that means youre taking quick challenge shots you want to take under control efficient Rhythm shots but so far youre right theyre jacking threes well neither team shoots the ball well from Beyond the arc on the year they again theyre not shy taking a Miles Kelly though can get hot in a hurry hit seven of them against Notre Dame in the first matchup and had a big game with a ton of Threes on Saturday against Louisville in the loss he had 36 a career high as Davis to the line coach you talked about aggressiveness Notre Dame so far making an emphasis to try and get to the basket oh absolutely and they have to and and and Ty Davis should be with that body I mean Marcus Freeman should be coming to the game seeing if theres any way to get him out in the summer for workouts to see if he could be a dual sport I mean his his legs his upper body uh tremendous and when hes driving it he drives it right a lot hes going to have to improve going to the left and things of that nature but he can get to the rim he wants to shoot the ball and I think hes going to be a good passer in time as well theres kzn checking into the game Notre Dame 72 on the Year from the charity stripe now Davis knocks him both down see when Tay Davis gets to the line thats better hes only three of 29 from the three this year so you dont want him necessarily looking for a lot of Threes right now but you do want him driving you you want him on that offensive Music Music Applause glass quarter knock down there by ibraim Sako out a guinea the freshman and sakos going to have to play well tonight with Debo Coleman being out with the concussion because Coleman can give them a lift hes got some veter experience hes been through a little bit in this league thats a big three Coleman wont play eaner danana wont play either too much traffic tough choice by Burton too much traffic three three sets of hands in the lane to knock that pass away pull up jumper Reeves won go rebound by Davis in transition a foul called on the floor on Kelly thats a nice drive I tell you what when you can get your big men driving the basketball on the break change of pace crosses it over they fou him before the travel but I love when a guy can come down the lane and put pressure on the rim is the big that had the ball watch the back cut here watch the back cut the step off right back to Burton now nice Applause pass buron inside of the teeth of that defense good ball movement on the attack a foul called on the floor Arya thats tremendous ball movement and both of these teams make the next pass and the next pass and when theyre making those backto back next passes thats when you know your offense is moving and one thing I love about Notre Dame and this is a credit to mik Shrewsberry and the staff they stay ready to shoot their guys are usually down they dont if you stay ready you dont have to get ready so to speak theyre very good at that ready four fouls on Georgia attch coach now this is crucial once you get that fif how quick can you get in the bonus in a game like this faded Roper has a tendency to fade to his left he doesnt get that left foot down all the time saw that today a little bit one of the reasons he missed stay in your shot stay in your shot let your let your finish do the work stick your lane rer out of Detroit Applause Michigan Northwestern transfer on the stick back nice work there by Sako hes given them some good minutes early yeah Sako he he he had a very very serious mindset today for my first time seeing him play very locked into the walk through with everything Damon and the staff were teaching him and hes come out here ready to play tonight on the road what a SLI and a foul call as Matt Zona checked into the game 69 Senor very nice action Notre Dame runs a lot of double high ball screen with a pop and a roll and they get really good spacing on it and both teams are as good as there as anybody in the ACC at throwing the pocket pass on the ball screen action and a pocket pass is basically delivering the ball underneath your knee where the off offensive player that youre throwing it to can pick it up and its not up around his waist heres Saturdays AC Network mens basketball triple header number seven North Carolina hosting Virginia Tech at 2 Eastern and then Miami taking on Boston College and we CA that night with Louisville and pit Carolina doesnt come out with some fire in that game at 200 Eastern time and they need they need to have some temperatures checked and and they have to come out and play better than what theyve been playing for 40 minutes you look to RJ Davis there to be the leader uh but not alone I mean not not alone I mean he cant do it by himself I mean they theyve got enough guys that have played enough basketball to have a collective effort theyve got to pick up their communication and their defense what a slip from George again Sako hes got seven and George sees the floor as good as any guard in this league here regardless of class his Throwbacks off pick and roll are outstanding and that finding that delivery off that corner cut was outstanding Sako a top three prospects in Canada last season 17 games off the bench and he has been a bright spot already see thats where you want to be ready to shoot the ball Ari if youre Julian roer be ready to shoot the ball they found something out of nothing thats a great drive by Imes but thats where Notre Dame wants to shoot that three or make the next pass dont put it on the floor and drive it into traffic times the Freshman from zionville Indiana trims the deficit to three now George right side on the attack there is Carter Murphy the air force Applause transfer HS with the ball IES came off the bench against Virginia Tech really lifted the Irish in the second half had some big moments down the stretch theyve got to get some movement to get the ball into Shrewsberry hands they want to post up they need to get Shrewsberry off some movement to loosen this game up with Burton now Davis strong to the basket break defense by the jackets yeah this is not Notre Dame is not an ISO team they saw a matchup that they wanted they got to get their movement game going again the Irish last in the ACC in conference play in offensive efficiency but second in defense oh three ball Murphy Corner p roet buries it thats what he can do okay is exactly what hes can do he he six its been seven three made threes at Air Force put him in the corner put him in the slot and its got a heck of a chance to go in and I think his teammates know it Z the response lefted short shot it on the way down Zona is a guy thats got to get lift on his jump shot when he shoots it on the way down and shoots it flat footed its short just like it was there George attack with the rock up six here in the first half at purcel down low turning fading jumper missed everything that was tajon Claude he 67 senior on his third school now in Applause Music College open three Davis launches the rank is open here tonight yeah good for him finance major right there when youre when youre making shots off the glass like that switch it over thats an added bonus if youre mikah Shrewsberry but you dont want him falling in love with that one stolen away here come the Irish Roper Shrewsberry he can really shoot it yeah hes not getting any space hes gotten so much better at that side step getting space hell get free theres the one right there pops and knocks it down from Beyond The Ark Brady Shrewsberry has been red hot over his last five games oh last five games hes almost 50 from three hes at 4 9 since January 1 hes at 47 from three as improved as anybody on this Notre Dame roster since November son of Micah Shrewsberry the head coach 13 points per game over his last 10 Sako has been hot to start that time he was way off well I give him credit yeah he he he might have heat checked himself on that one a little bit hes getting his game on the glass and on the cuts Damon stmy had the head shake Im not sure he agreed with that shot selection either I kind of tend to agree with with Damon on that TI at 17 Shrewsberry into the lane floats it up no rebound jackets thats where Davis has got to get on the glass Davis and roer theyre not sending a lot to the offensive glass but you cannot offensive rebound close shots with just one guy around the paint were in dire need of a timeout here arent we ar we got some guys on fumes out there right now some guys grabbing shorts coach start of it not a good shot not a good shot off the D theyre playing through critique we havent even had the 12minute TV timeout yet little 60 Run for the Irish Notre Dame trying to take the Music lead Im working against George now Shrewsberry kick out Davis has one three launches another front iron rebound by Murphy they left him too open on that he should have if he got higher it was an open shot but if he got higher hes got a chance to get that drive Tech takes a timeout they needed a break 1717 coach what do you love here a couple of first year head coaches tonight at purcel and you look out throughout the league Michael Shrewsberry Damon stmy red ay coach year ones what are they all about well Adrien ay has got the institutional knowledge that Mike and Damon didnt have walking into their programs and hes doing an outstanding job that win last night was not a fluke and and improved his team JJ Starling Judah minz theyre all getting better inside there but what Micah Shrewsberry is doing what Damon star are doing like I said theyre not young in the game but theyre younger head coaches Damon had been a head coach before Pacific they are implementing their personality what they want in the program whats important to them every day and you can see it its not shown in the records yet but you can see it as you watch it Damon STM talked about trying to get his guys to play Fast to canot pick and choose one they turn it on and said if your teammates you see them slacking its up to you to be able to hold them accountable because weve beaten the best teams in the country right Carolina Duke Clemson weve knocked him off but then we have some of these losses that are heads scratching well and thats part of it I mean hes got Miles Kelly whos now got to show more leadership Nathan George I think is going to be a fine leader because you can follow his lead and the way that he plays and he delivers the ball how about Burton there nice thatll take us again to another timeout we played a lot of basketball in a row how about Burton to the R Marcus Burton hes fast hes quick hes strong and he can take contact scored 38 points that came from the ball screen alone and Nathan George was a big part of a lot of that 38 points that created rolls baskets kickouts like thats a lot of offense from from the ball screen a rare free throw Miss for Burton who shoots it at 81 against Carolina and du back to Georgia Tech felt like stent George Kelly all getting downhill and playing big oh yeah no question no question thats a big play I like how theyre going to kapari they I think this kid I watched him last year at UMass I think Tara can be an outstanding player when he does what hes capable of doing and doesnt come out and try to prove what hes going to do do what you do the rest of the game will come and right now being able to drive play on that Baseline is important lob didnt have it from here youre still coaching a l it well I saw it coming right but I think still there baby yeah it was there of course I had the cheat sheet I watched them run it today and walk Music through but this is important because the the fouls have been so different watch the action they clear out Carter Murphys supposed to go up Nathan George comes off it but theres good help on the bottom from kesti that took away the Applause Loba George misses the first and we also want to remind you that every Thursday well have a womens back basketball double header for you right here on acc Network and the SPN app this week Isaiah James in number six NC State take on the star freshman Hannah Hidalgo and number 16 Notre Dame at 6 Eastern then Liz kitley and number 12 VT host Duke at Castle Coliseum all Thursday night Prime Time on acc Network he cant beat it now next foul puts Notre Dame in the bonus it is important that they find a way to get in that bonus and separate in this game kazne splashes the triple home great three they do such a great job both teams do of utilizing the corner but again Marcus Pon with an outstanding on time on target pass 110 run for Georgia for Notre damus snapped by Georgia Tech theres that guy again Reeves Corner three and another Corner three with the answer kaasi Reeves gets up on his jump shot a very pure shooter they call him wasy around these parts says Burton oh oh gravity pulled it through hes so good he really is getting to the point where he can score at what they call all three levels The Rim the lane and the three that pullup game has improved so much hes got six points now 394 on the season seventh in a season for a freshman jumper nice that was Dongo beautiful pass and kaasi Reeves delivers a pocket pass in the middle of the floor off two extra passes thats just outstanding basketball that David and his group have worked on and we certainly saw it in the walk through today thats important that they can execute those actions Burton drops it down low flipping it up it was ji ke ji 610 sophomore from Centerville Ohio now watch this action as the ball gets moving as we see this the ball gets passed drives it off great pocket pass again no pressure from Notre Dame theyve got to do a better job of getting their hands active with the ball frankly ARA both teams teams do you you have to train every day part of your pick and roll defense is going to be how active can you be with your hands You got to be in a stance you got to play like an athlete you got to move your feet but youve got to move your hands you cannot Guard air with your hands youve got to kind of trace the ball both teams execute those passes because teams just do not defend that very well Im going to put you on the spot here best defender you coach so far in your career oh thats let me think about that Im not naming that Ive got about 15 guys that think theyre that guy I would go with uh Nick Claxton at the at the big forward position OJ OG an anobi the small forward position vict Victor Oladipo at the guard position and Im throwing in Dwayne Wade and Jerell mcneel because of the way they could read passing lanes and attack people theres my Applause five I love it got me on the spot I did gave you about 2 seconds notice on that one 26 22 Notre Dame on top 5 four now this is where Notre Dame has got they got the advantage because theyre in the bonus and so right now anything at The Rim anything thats close they get that win of putting another foul on Georgia Tech and going to the foul line to try to create two points and to your point Notre Dame second to last in the conference and getting to the line yeah I dont like their spacing right now I dont like their spacing they got to keep it spread out make watch the twoman game nice pass Davis and that preferred right hand rejected get out of there by Dongo said no way sent it back to Indianapolis yeah this is an area where Tay Davis is not quite the guy thats going to make that next pass on that drive he goes up strong but they come off the ball they get the block shot thats where you got to get in view of the passer they want people to be spaced but you got to get in view of that driver in case hes got a chance to kick it out that was the 27th block for Dongo as Zona into the shot clock just had to heave one up yeah Id like to see him just get up on his jump shot I think his percentage goes way up when he gets a little more lift ball reversal cut off at the Baseline and deflected out of bounds yeah thats thats a great read by Notre Dame thats called a baseline drift you drive that thing hard to the basket youre underneath the board youre trying to throw it to the corner Notre Dame sniffed it out R it got a deflection now theyre playing side out of bounds defense what do you draw up here well theres going to be a back pick and stance going to C oh no Rees Reeves refused it came up its a nice play that could have gone either way stur ofan could have come up or Reeves good re just didnt get the make Rees has five buron with six ISO step back block shot by Tara gari in transition gari had it knocked away and itll be Notre Dame basketball how about Burton getting back on the defensive side oh its big time I hate that jump shot because youre trying to go against a guy with about a 75 wingspan great block and this situation everybody spaced but tar gari can move his feet and hes got length Burton is used to making that shot but not against a guy with a 74 75 wingspan its a bad choice thats where you almost if youre going to run the step back now you want to drive him and keep the game going because because too many bad things can happen on a shot like that Notre Dame is in the bonus theyve got to take advantage of that right now because the odds of Georgia Tech getting in the bonus the rest of this half are very slim unless Notre Dame goes on a foul Fest theyre at the bonus get the thing inside get it to the rim set your defense by going to the foul line its an advantage inside of the game right now to get to the foul line for Notre Dame love it and learning sitting right next to you best seat in the house well just you dont get that Advantage all the time you dont get it you got to take advantage of it when its there that theres that difference in the bonus gari known for blocking shots three against Duke in the win three against Carolina that length incredible but its the Irish leading by four Burton wide open rims out offensive rebound Zona kesi has a tendency like ROP run to fade on a shot and Def fade left go straight up step into it and knock it down Davis with those seven points could not wrap it around Dongo heres Kelly still has no points in the game well he will he will you know what I like about Kelly hes letting to come hes not hunting He hell score right theyve got to do a better job of screening for him all right watch he should be open here good Skip by George he sees that floor oh Dongo miscalculated that big time Kelly and George Nathan George also with no points in this game well theyre doing a great J lets credit the defense Kelly may not be scoring but hes got a tough match up every trip down Shrewsberry usually gets that shot off transition hes not getting it right now one of the three biggest things on your Scot report is not letting Shrewsberry get open threes in the break buron skips it to Shrewsberry against Kelly shot clock running out couldnt get it to go another oard for Notre day staying with it sticking it up no good but that is beautiful action ARA that is beautiful if youre if youre mic Shrewsberry you are excited about the aggressiveness right now of Davis if Tay Davis getting to that basket hes not finishing but we always say a foul is a finish and thats just what he got out of this but he is attacking hes playing Fearless basketball thats what you need from your young B Applause Music Davis seven points five rebounds here in this first half knocks that one down I want to remind you the softball season rolls on with Shriner children Clearwater Invitational and ACC network is the home for these five games starting tomorrow morning at 1100 am East Eastern with North Carolina and Kentucky our final match up will be Sunday morning with the heels taking on udub Washington 930 how about it a breakfast and some softball Davis knocks him both down I didnt want to jinx him Coach no good for you good for you 18 straight free throws made for Davis W thats pretty impressive that is really really impressive I did not know that I knew he was 69 free throw sh I love his stroke thats why I think hes going to become a good threepoint shooter he gets his shoulders Square he gets low base and he get got good balance hes going to be a good shooter foul call there Daviss average has raised almost 10 during that free throw stretch thats what you want you dont want him hunting threes cuz thats not his strength right now thats going to come thats why its so important for Notre Dame to build on this year you know in this portal transactional world to build on this year with these guys same thing for Georgia Tech under two here in the first half kick to the corner cor passing up the three with Sako beautiful play count it and one taon Claud that is beautiful that is action we saw worked on in small group workouts today all right its uphill action all right to a handoff to a pocket pass in the middle to a l drop off on the bottom if they spent 10 minutes on that uh thats an understatement they they really really want to play through that pocket pass pass and not only score but get it kicked out or get it driven and again the pocket passes Georgia Tech and Notre D both Thorn are low theyre underneath the knee theyre where the offensive receiver can do something with it and that was a great pass on the drop off that makes you feel good when you worked on that all day and your assistance put these guys through the paces of that back iron on the free throw Roper the Northwestern transfer clears the grass its so important to close the half close the half with open jumpers are getting to open threes are getting to the foul line deep three from truberry well beyond NBA range in the rebound of the jackets look at that pass George is a magician with that ball rolls off the rim a foul called is that on Zone BL whistle I love Nathan George I know his Uncle Mike George very prominent uh NBA agent has had a lot of success first in the Grassroots but then is a a player agent and his nephew is going to have an outstanding long career I wouldnt be doubt hes representing him someday if that kid Nathan George can play the game and wasnt even there available to them this Summer hes had some big moments already early in his career right layup over Armondo Bott winner absolutely how about the shots he hit at Little John in overtime no question but I just love how he look at the shot you got it right on Q right on Q hes got a really nice touch he he has got a chance to be an outstanding point guard timeout taken by Micah Shrewsberry Nathan George buing the three George attack trims the deficit to two he made the right choice hes really really good at getting you off balance thats why every day you got to defend the pullback the step back because the guards and the players that can accelarate pull that thing back and get the defender are off balance you think youre guarding and all of a sudden youre off balance and theres a shot like that thats why young players have constantly got to not only work on their footwork defensively all right off the ball on the ball but how do you defend the step back youve got to get up you got to take the airspace you cant get knocked off balance hes got three assists here in the first half does George the first tech freshman since Iman shupper back in 2008 with over 100 assists in the season yes he was that shot knocking to fall you think about some great players for Georgia Tech freshman guards Burton three ball bang oh bavy beautiful two open you cannot give him that he squares up uh he knocks it down Shrewsberry will be fine theyre trying to get him open a little bit a little bit more movement in the second half for him little bit more coming off the double staggers the baselines some shaking up out of the corners hell be fine largeest lead for either team has been six in this first half right now at five on the attack Zona called for the foul again Claude initiating and getting to the rack but again its off the middle pick and roll its off the pocket pass its getting into the paint its creating help situations and now you get a drive like that cuz theyre really not coming off the shooters that play is designed to make a pass to the opposite side to a kick out drop it off or get a play going to the rim and Claude has got that the advancement of that is guys that can shoot that little two foot jump stop that little floater but you want guys can get to the rim and get to the foul line qu knocking down that first free throw to the pleasure of Damon STM this Notre Dame team in conference play by the way coach first in the league in twoo percentage defense the way they sag off what have you seen from Georgia Tech when theyve been successful being able to get to the line well right now its hitting the pocket pass theyre getting that pocket pass theyre getting that bounce pass into the paint theyre getting good movement not Dames doing a good J job of taking away the threes but theyre getting that action in the paint shot clock off Irish at home leading by three Davis should get the hand off no pass out Shrewsberry at the buzzer throwing it up it rims out the rim didnt like the way it Music tasted yeah you know what miles Kellys got zero but if Im Damon STM Im pumping him up Im telling him youre playing great youre defending youre not hunting the shots will come youre at the top of the of the Scot report and Davis is out there its going to be interesting to see how they play it was a second half on Saturday against the hokes that pushed Notre Dame to a 7466 Victory can they repeat it here on this Wednesday night poor choice on Marcus the play call was right it wasnt open you were going to have Shrewsberry coming off of a screen if you dont throw that lob pass Athan George with the rock now Kelly aggressive early high off the glass first possession right to the start and that it it if if youre micel Shrewsberry youre extremely unhappy right now cuz they guarded him they were aggressive with him on the whole half and he basically scored one on zero right there that was just way too easy for miles to get there but now hes going now you got to deal with the guy thats seing his first ball go through the rim so the jackets strike first in the second half Davis using that shrike block shot Reeves was in there there and now possession arrow will Point Georgia Techs way how about the intensity on that defensive possession for the jackets well that was good but this one wasnt look how open he is he just goes by you cannot close out giving a righthanded player his right hand that way standing straight up that was too easy same action wide open on the back Music pick nice pass ball rotation Reeves poked away stays with the jackets he rips it in there and a flush from kaasi Reeves very good play very active thats where Miles Kelly delivered the ball hes not forcing hes not hunting hes playing the game thats what you want your star to be able to do the shots will come Davis Booth trying to get a jump shot going you wanted to see him be a little bit more aggressive what I want to see Carrie boo do is get to the foul line okay and get to the offensive glass hes 7 to 13 from the foul line in the ACC and hes only had two offensive rebounds in the last six games hes too talented for that at eight points against the hokes on the drive drops through and thats Dongo again these passes are just too easy theyre just too easy theyre getting through there theyre not getting any hand pressure on that ball theres no rotation back to the middle thats why were getting layups off that bounce pass to the middle dangos got nine Georgia Tech leads by three little 60 run to start the half for the visiting jackets defensive intensity is picked up oh he sure has theyre doing a great job of switching out guard wise trying to take Shrewsberry away craftiness of the foul good fake sloppy defense now B Dango is is good in this area hunts it gets on the floor knocks it down Kelly picks it up throws it to Reeves they got the dump and credit dangle for staying with the action free throw knock down there Dongo has got a really bright future he does my guess is right now Ropers coming in for Davis to to put some pressure on Miles Kelly and and go back get back to the game plan of just not letting him see the rim in an easy light Applause theyre not playing that high post pass beautiful skip Pass open three George makes him pay time out taken by Notre D beautiful skip pass from Miles Kelly look at this pass he gets into the paint he looks like hes going to try to get the layup okay but bottom line he finds that Damon stmy jackets a 91 run to start this second half look at Notre Dame its the defensive energy from the jackets and really it dated back to the final few minutes of the first half youre absolutely correct I mean they they never even though they werent making jump shots and scoring as easy as they like they never stopped playing hard defensively and thats such a key thats a sign of maturity Burton with the ball good movement good space really good space this where Notre Dames at his best get in the paint make another pass under 10 on the clock kzn driving couple jackets swarm shot rattles off the rim offensive rebound it was ji yep and hes in there for a reason hes in there for a reason Michael shuberry wants that energy he wants him on the glass he wants him in that roll game hes got really good length thats exactly what you need theyve got to find a way to get that ball to touch the paint more to create the penetration and drive cuz right now so far in this half with the exception thats basically been played outside the threepoint line without the penetration which creates the twoon on great offense is creating twoon ones all over the court its not just about the pass its not just about the open man its are you creating twoonone advantages throughout your Applause possession G leads the team in rebounds had six big ones a lot of them coming in the second half against the Hoke on Saturday now and that right there went to the foul line like hed been there before and thats exactly what you want knocking him down motor dame after attempting 17 free throws against Virginia Tech I like this lineup they got two point guards in the game right now with sturdavant and Nathan George you can get a lot of movement here youve got decision makers on the Applause court little too much that where Nathan George his eyes are up hes looking at the pass thats where you almost got to stop in the lane come off one or two feet and shoot the little pull up shoot the floor he had room to shoot that heres that lob action again they they helped on at the first half good curl start of it pick and roll foul calls good play this game is being played in the middle of that paint its just not a thing of beauty but when youre getting fouled like that its a beautiful thing to the coaches Music tomorrow night at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week thats coverage you can only find in one place right here on acc Network and the ESPN conat congratulations to Kelsey rigs I mean Kelsey rigs is going to be a mother right see her from time to time thats a great show Muffet McGrath theres got to be a statue of her somewhere at some point in time out here if its not already oh it already is my fault she deserves it J she deserves that and Mike Bray deserves to be in that Ring of Honor and I hope that doesnt take very long for him them to put him in the Fighting Irish Ring of Honor no doubt tack up by four theyre letting them play theyre letting them get their hands on each other you know you know referees are rarely going to call a push off thats why you got to stay low have leverage make your Cuts strong initiating the offense was Roper and getting to the rim he was fouls on the other side they work over this game is still coming down to AR like whos going to guard the ball screen the best because right now its still too easy to make that pass into the paint for either team now how you execute out of it is where the game is but whoever can really figure out how to get more hand pressure on those passes create some turnovers and not give those easy looks he going to have a chance to win this game in the last few minutes who has the advantage so far no one no one on that part right now Notre Dame has got the advantage cuz they figured out they going to get to the foul line threepoint game thats good defense from the the Irish generating a turn absolutely absolutely they played the middle they they they they played their compact defense they didnt get spread out they had their hands ready on the other side give it right back as IMS was looking for Music kesi watch the activity now defensively as that ball gets in the paint okay great job of having their hands out on the ball they dont switch the uh the the the cuts off the top Burton plays with his hands up uses his length it does not matter how long you are it matters do you show your length nice pass count it and the foul beautiful beautiful play absolutely and as we saw today they worked on that in five on0 they worked on that against scout team they spent a lot of time getting that pocket pass in the middle of the floor with a corner cutter and and theyve got Notre Dames got to do a better job of recognizing the over heelp is allowing that cutter to get too much of a free reign to catch the ball they cant let that cut happen right now you realize thats a big part of what Georgia Tech wants to do Damon STM talked about playing fast and reacting to what youre seeing on the floor how about Dongo with the pass there well no question about it hes hes getting more skilled all the time and again like we said earlier he can score hes got 37 in two games against Duke but right now being able to make that pass be able to be on the glass and be able to challenge things in that paint whos going to make the paint theirs defensively that thats the trick for these bigs right now both teams Sako who averages just about two points per game has got nine he was ready to play play On Demand guy he was ready to play that makes you just feel great as a coaching staff had to step up in the absence of Debo Coleman still battling that injury he picked up couple weeks ago during practice got to shoot the ball right there if you are you just have to if youre Kevin you got to shoot that ball you got a left shoulder right hand jump hook its going to be a forced pass they were lucky to keep this Shrewsberry at the buzzer clanks it off to the left offensive rebound to Notre Dame both teams are not great blockout teams that was a case where George didnt hit early they were able to keep it alive and give Notre Dame a fresh clock eighth o board for the Irish here at home Burton with the second chance gets the friendly bounce hes in a double figure that is beautiful get rise on his jump shot he went left on that he trust that pullup that is really really really a good sign for him tonight and for his future buron a steel had six of them against Virginia Tech on Saturday yeah theyre reading it hes doing a great job on the week side hes doing a great job with his hands on the ball hes impacting the game with his defense and his kickouts and drives unselfish basketball IMS a three off to the right theres Burton again Burtons just outwork Georgia Tech right now little energy spurt from The Freshman the hometown kid Shrewsberry another chance left it short couple of good looks yeah very much so youre not youre not upset with that he was ready to shoot it got to hold this follow through there it is again oh baby Dongo too in the flush theyre reacting to the ball theyre not reacting to the cutter and because theyre reacting late to the ball the Cutters got a free reign to get to the basket and get behind the Music Applause defense tack by five Burton midrange couldnt connect whistle on the floor itll stay on this side watch Burton in this situation now break it down get into the middle of the floor great between the legs cross gets it into his left hand plants up holds his follow through beautiful but the action right now Georgia Tech knew they had it they found it the ball gets to the middle all right and it gets dropped off to the corner for a man cutting for a layup or a dunk in that case just the way they worked on it and game planned it this time of year its all about stepping up and Sako now with a career high it was just six points coming in hes into double figures yeah hes hes playing well thats what they want right there thats what he can do side step it good three J battling down load hes hard to deal with theres no question you you absolutely when youve got Kebab being on the glass like that hes understood what his role is in this game and how he impacts winning so important another possession five fouls now on Tech two away this is where you got to be very conscious of getting to that Rim so you can get in the bonus early under 10 on the shot clock how about the patience from The Freshman Burton knocks it home very good the defender opened up too early on the catch dropped that foot easy play youre just giving Marcus Burton basically a oneon zero layup there hes got 14 18 straight games now in double figures for the star freshman the lead down to three for the jackets again good weak side defense they executed the skip pass but Burton was there moved on the air time at the pass defended it good defense theres Kev making plays at The Rim what a lift hes given mik Shrewsberry here in the second half gave Kyle filipowski fits twice this season ims blocked shot stays with it shot clock continues to trickle down double team there Davis srap Around lays it in good play IMS never panicked Notre Dame does such a good job of getting in the paint coming to that two foot jump stop it was the first breakdown action that they did to day in their walk through you can tell they do it all the time 11 points for Davis and the Irish are within Applause one there it is again at some point at some point we have to understand if youre Notre Dame that Defenders have got to realize Sako is cutting out of that corner death taxes and were cutting out of the corner tonight they got to recognize its coming thats on the weak side defense Davis feeling pretty good hes got four straight back and forth we go absolutely theyre getting in that paint theyre getting good looks I love the fact that Shrewsberry hes showing no body language on missing those shots thats a veteran move he knows the shot is going to go when you got a guy that can shoot the ball like that every time he takes it he feels like its going in George on the attack reaching foul called Applause yeah thatll take us to a break lot of action people are figuring it out both teams know theres a heck of a lot more basketball to go that every possession Penny Hardway comes to mind that have an NBA AllStar on their coaching staff Georgia Techs got two theyve got not only Damon but bonsy Wells I I said to bons Wells before the game you can probably still come out and get 19 and eight hes 47 I think I insulted him I think he thinks he could be in the 20s he was a heck of a player and so was Damon but Marcus Burton is heading where those guys were at some point in time because he he understands the game size is never going to be a detriment to him because of how tough he is how quick he is and how strong he is Georgia attack has got 24 points in the paint so far in this one that has been a strong reason why this time Kelly firing away front iron no good and the story for Notre Dame 16 seconds chance points on 12 offensive rebounds theyre already over their offensive rebound average and theyre on that glass now again here we go were going to go into the post up theyre going to run some type of action look for Cutters get some movement open three off the cut Shrewsberry not able to connect hes now one of eight from Beyond The Arc here tonight yeah he hes fading just a little bit as long as he stays out of his own head with his shooting hell be fine he was shooting nearly 50 in his last five games from three coming in Kelly tough shot fading away hes so good in that painted area whether hes actually in the paint or just on the outskirts of it hes he can shoot a turnaround he can shoot the pullup hes got the floater thats what he needed he just watch your star to see the ball going through the rim a little bit so he stays as engaged as hes been George attack by three under 10 to play here at purcel Valentines Day hoops from South here on the ACC Network Booth shot clock winding down stolen away foul how about Carter Murphy yeah Carter Murphy was strong they got him going to his left hand Carrie Booth is going to be a very good player I I compare him when I watch him on film I compare him to Noah Clowney that was at Alabama last year whos in the Nets organization now as a first rounder they have similarities Im not saying cars where Nick or where where no is OB reminds me a little bit of what he could do defensively of Nick Claxton but the Noah Clowny one just cant play frustrated let it come and and let the game happen get on that glass like your teammates are George calls his own number not going to get it and the rebound to the Irish down three theres the drag which theyve been waiting to get thats where both teams are at their best good kick out rer going to get another shot at it 13th offensive rebounds comes another isolation to try to draw that foul but hell take the bucket instead Ropers first field goal of the evening I tell you what both these coaches see the game so well with their backgrounds and the NBA of reading the matchups reading the situations they play these two teams play random basketball pretty well and as they get older its going to be even better Mike is recognizing what his matchups are and where he can take advantage of the game and I just say thats excellent coaching the foul going on rer his Music second Murphy bricked it hes way better on the catch and shoot than he is trying to get it off the move in my mind from what I see Davis has found something going to his right hand exactly and that was one of the things that Damon star did not want to let happen today was Tay Davis going to his right hand and hes letting him get to his strengths seventh lead change of this one Irish back on top now theyre playing the corner now they took that away but that opens up more opportunities to throw it high to Miles Kelly six rebound for Roper snagged out of the sky Burton shoulder down getting to the rim patient foul calls hes so strong AR hes so strong he can get to the rim but speaking of getting to the rim Tay Davis getting the ball on that left wing area driving it with his right hand going by Miles Kelly taking that big step going up strong play eventually its whats going to happen is transitions going to open up in this a little bit and and youre going to see the drag ball screens come even more because you got to try to get something early in transition and then if you dont have it then you run your actions to get something at that Rim get something to get you to the foul line well the last eight points Notre Dame has scored have been in the pain as Burton knocks down the free throw he has 15 Michael Shrewsberry looking on Marcus Burton can get in the lane on anybody in college basketball in my mind if you can keep him out of the lane youre a special player he is so fast quick and strong key for the jackets has been bench points 20 of them now they play off the high post good read Applause good job Notre Dame has cleaned up their defense they took away that role because what they wanted to do off that action was get it into the middle becausee they were looking for that Baseline drop off again Notre Dame has snipped it out figured it out and guarding much better of of the Georgia Tech main Music actions Nate Babcock who did a great job with the scouting report this morning he said to the team once the pick and roll happens find your space thats one thing Georgia Tech has done a good job of bingo oh Kelly way downtown we tied off the screens lined up ready to go too easy if youre Micah Shrewsberry but thats what thats what Miles Kelly needed to see Applause happen seven and change to Applause play Burton to the elbow kesn clean look and odre Dame takes the lead great spacing when a guy like Burton can drive the ball he brings all the eyes to him kesn slides out of that corner lifts up into the wing slot area knocks it down that pass isnt there miles theyre picking that off thats Burtons second steal on that pass alone picked off by The Freshman Irish by three Burton triple left it short the start of it who chases it down theres we want to see that drag action Burton did a great job on that initial ball screen of getting over the Applause screen cross for pass Kelly can really shoot it too strong and the rebounds cleaned up by Davis Marcus Burton is doing it all right now defending the ball what you want in transition when you set that quick ball screen you want to force your Defender under thats one thing both teams have had issues with Burtons not letting that happen right now against Georgia Techs ball screen what do you draw up here right now just keep moving the ball playing let Tay Davis get in that paint make a decision ball loose squirting away and picked up by Claude possession arrow on the tie up will be Notre Dames B Kelly hes turned up that defense hes like anybody else you see that ball going in the basket look at the setup sets the screen they curl inside to set the screen Bas it comes off a double wide open three kesy now slides up Gets behind the defense hes ready to shoot it open three one of the more open threes theyve had tonight the Irish just five of 26 from Beyond The Arc and now its crunch time they all count and maybe just a little bit more yeah theyre still playing the game missed the hold in the post Georgia Tech want to deny those High post catches thats hard to do as the game goes along heres Burton Mr Indiana basketball in high school midrange Jay back iron and again activity from J lead to the foul exactly exactly I mean this this is to play this and to have Carrie Booth not be on the floor but to have this kind of size that they have with keba that they have with Tai what they have with rer is really really good Music stuff Tate Davis has been so aggressive tonight and really from the beginning of the game and thats just thats why hes having a really good Applause game thats the third on Dongo check that fourth on donga that could be big jackets get away with it front end of the one and one Applause missed awkward Landing for Miles Kelly a foul called on the Irish and that will put Georgia Tech at the line for the one and one see this action right here watch The Man in the right corner okay thats why its easy to play this action now he gets fouled you know did he did he not hes going to the foul line but bottom line is I think Georgia Tech has got to get to their Twan actions because Notre Dame is sagging off that corner especially especially when its Ibrahim aako like theyre going to theyre theyre going to come into the paint both these teams run really good twoman side actions I think well see more of it as this game goes on to try to free something up again to get to the rim on a roll pass Kelly is eight second half points Im impressed with Miles Kelly though when youre averaging the points hes averaging and hes only really taken maybe one maybe two that you wish you could have back hes letting the game come to him hes playing the game thats why this is a onepoint game four assists as well AB playing very good floor game hes also got four rebounds its a onepoint game kzn drives George inside back to the basket Fade Away jumper not going to go rebound Reeves strong rebounds well defended but thats been the May most useful action Georgia Tech had tonight get one guy driving it on either side get four people spaced Kelly doesnt shoot it pulls up floater rattles home Georgia Tech leads money shot those Runners and floaters are like pure layups for him so good but great job with the shot fake they closed out the right way comes off one foot knocks it home he continues to close in on a th on his career needed 35 coming into the night Burton Miss times his jump leads to a short shot jackets by one Georgia Tech has cleaned up that rebounding theyre getting inside position now where they werent earlier when those shots go up which is giving them the defensive rebounds they need four minutes to play jackets trying to snap a three game losing skid theyve got some of the biggest wins in the ACC this season the Irish looking for a winning streak trying to get to two in a row Kelly shot clock winding down recovers and leaves a short offensive rebound to R run for Georgia Tech here tonight yeah just a shot clock uh jumper fading away that he can make one guy went to rebound the other guy didnt George cant connect rebound Notre Dame thats a big stop for the Irish it really is but George got into that lane theyll come back to Applause that I like Miles Kelly Garden Burton wants that match up now they run the Applause switch these two teams have played Thrillers kzn for the lead he nice play youll take that he got down into that alley what we call the alley area what a lot of coaches called the dunker spot he was there for that short jump shot great pass by Burton ninth lead change of the night here in South B these games come down to a thriller were headed right back to it something about jackets and the Fighting Irish and thrillers coming down to the wire the numbers they speak to themselves they really do both teams are are are playing defense at a level thats making the shots tougher it its its a the game really tonight has started when the shot goes up off the backboard it really has and and thats not what both of these teams are maybe known for but thats exactly whats happening tonight 7568 back in January in Atlanta it went to overtime between these two teams Notre Dame picking up its only true Road victory of the Season trying to get win number two in a row here at home 18 Second Chance points for the Irish as a season High assistant coach Ryan Owens and I were talking before the game and he said that was going to be one of the absolute Keys tonight all right could their bigs control that paint when the shot went Applause up Kelly hes been the hot hand in the second half oh losing it out of bounds was Dongo that was really good action though from Damon STM out of a timeout trying to screen the help Defender like he did with Nathan George creativity is going to be important in a onepoint game get to your fundamentals but get that downhill speed any chance you get with Burton like this great defense by Georgia attack forcing Burton to retreat and now the Irish we on a high pick and roll Burton looking deflected blocked out of bounds itll stay with Notre Dame just seven though on the shot clock good clim out call hes got the timeouts theyll run an action out of this well probably see him try to come out and get a layup if its not there get it back to the inbounder drive it possession by possession Arya well be right back consider this a short clock because you got a chance youre going to get three good passes out of this maybe even four if the ball is moving you want to try to get a layup certainly you want to try to get fouled and and they have that in most of their out of bounds plays here all right but what you want to be able to get is if you dont have that layup if you dont get fouling that cut get it back to Burton and let him create something Burton will be the trigger man kesn on the catch rotates it around receives ball on the deck kesn tied up throws it up out the buzzer and it grazes the iron rebound there by Dongo Im not convinced thats what Micah had drawn up especially with Burton back over there in that corner Applause freshman on freshman George against Burton Kelly hes the jacket Music star has it blocked right back to him and he deflects it out of bounds Irish Ball up one absolutely the the the the activity is good in situations like this youre going to get the switch you got to get a better screen you cannot you cannot miss on that screen they rotate over good hands Notre Dames hands activity has been excellent in the entire second half just the 10th turn turnover by Georgia Tech who has struggled at times protecting the ball this season Davis to ji downhill nearly intercepted out of bounds three and a half on the clock theyll get something in the middle of the floor see who takes it out look over to the V Nate Babcock associate head coach pass to the high post with Burton coming back for the hand off pass to the high post Here Comes Burton up they go to Davis all the way to the Rock Roll man great play great play call the inbounder was wide open 17 for Davis the lead three Applause remain with Tacker watch this action the inbounder takes it off Davis one dribble two Dribble To The Rim bucket that is a huge play inside of this game in a short clock shot clock issue my goodness youre going to have to look at it and adjust yeah only by about 8 seconds maybe hey its Valentines Day right everybody gets distracted it can happen at the scores table both teams can use a blow right here its a great time to get two plays called right now the free timeout situation right here dont necessarily want to go to three plays you want two two actions that you can get see the adjustment so 102 left in this game 21 on the shot clock coach what do you drawing up if youre Georgia Tech you dont need a three but what were you going through in your huddles well right now it its its really a matter of who do you want to create the offense because whoever gets that ball inside of the handoff or inside the pick and roll is probably going to have to make a pass so do you you can definitely go back to your action where you hit the middle pick and roll all right and get the pass to the man cutting into the corner but I think right now what were going to see is Miles Kelly getting somebody free forc him a little bit of help and then either get him in a ball screen or get him in a handoff either way youre not going to go wrong if its in Kelly or Georges hands in this situation but theyre doing such a good job of Defending youre probably not going to get it off the initial entry or the initial Music Applause Music play right so issues on both sides with both teams absolutely got to be got to be a mechanical erir just it happens more time to sit here and enjoy this great game how good are you at math cuz its not my strong suit uh depends on the math I I love the percentages I cant always get to them but Algebra I was never any good at algebra never took geometry Im more of a remedial basic math guy but I like numbers speaking of numbers Notre Dame has held every team this season below its season offensive average Georgia Tech averaging nearly 72 a game the Irish well on their way to accomplishing that goal they have relied on their defense at times this year one of the best in the ACC theyre going to need another stop here tonight at home its still yeah its still coming down to the wire on this he get offly okay got the shot off correctly the game clock is now set correctly Roger ER is coming over to tell us that which we appreciate theyre looking to make sure there was no snap through they know its coming down of the wire here again this crew is is an outstanding crew you got Roger a in the game uh youre excited home or road because you know its going to be a great game same thing with Paul Zack and Courtney green those guys they work well together for guys that arent together a lot they work really well together theyve let this game this game no ones really gained an advantage from where I sit with the physicality at all been very evenly matched what a game it has been alongside coach Tom K Im Mario mudi our entire crew has been in for a good one a minute and two seconds left well you said it you said it correctly you dont need a three right now by any stretch of the imagination you need to get to the basket get an open shot get to the foul line because that shot clock never started they reset it to 10 seconds its Georgia Tech ball here with the again all right so you have to make a late adjustment in the Huddle now with that information what do you say well not really you still have plenty of time you you you dont want to sit here and wait till the end of the shot clock to get your bucket they worked on side out of bounds I think were going to see Miles Kelly in a situation here back pick for the inbounder and then come off that handoff and theyll be spacing on the weak side and hell try to get into a twoman game right here all right lets see how it plays out George a touch with seven now six Kelly with five late in the shot clock his shot was blocked out of bounds now a discussion will be had got a piece its tough shot was it a violation you want to get the ball in that type of situation going downhill as quickly as you can he set the back screen rather than for the inbounder set it in the middle of the Music paint you know W the ball to Notre d y good call good call now again you dont have to foul at all you just got to play good solid defense oh he stepped out bounds solid defense stepped out the sideline itll be Georgia Tech ball big mistake from the Irish and theyre very comfortable thats not the first time Tay Davis has brought it up against pressure against the pressure or late in the clock but he just tried to do too much with the ball tremendous defense tremendous job on the ball forces to step Music out clock resets only to 20 heres we get the back pick George in the jackets down three slips it inside quick little layup thrown in beautiful there was no help because miles Kylie reached up high they were guarding the corner beautiful play by Georgia Tech onepoint game down to the wire what else did you expect this exactly what you want all right hes getting into a 1 14 low set here I would think the ball screen is coming right now s Ro wants to switch with Murphy Burton surveys pulls it back now with five The Freshman into the lane midrange jumper no tipped into the air Murphy running after it Im has it with five Georgia tck got a foul now with two now with one Burton fouled with 12 what an offensive rebound a 5050 ball goes to Notre Dame he breaks it down he gets by just a little bit theres the shot Balls tipped its grabed Carter Murphy right there he had the ball he had a chance to dive on it theres Imes pulling it in Carter Murphy thought he had the read on it Imes was getting back there he was was great recovery by Imes to get that ball 16th offensive rebound for Notre Dame ties a season high at the biggest moment of the game it was the hustle of the Irish that earned them a second chance Point absolutely credit the Irish for what they did inside of this second half credit Marcus Burton not only for his offense but for his defense his deflections his reading they they were on the Attack One Last Shot for Georgia Tech they need a three so probably going to try to get something but at one point to theres not enough time for a pass that the man that catches this ball has got to be able to shoot Applause Music it 22 chance points a season High how about the Irish getting to the o glass and in ACC play theyve been fifth best in the conference in crashing the glass and that thats what won them the game the foul line and be on that glass understanding that the way we want to play the way that we feel best playing thats not there for either of us tonight so weve got to figure out away and Damon star and his staff have done a fantastic job with this too its been exactly what these games have been its been exactly what we expected it would be and again the key to Great coaching and the maturity of a team is to understand what the game is giving you 22 free throw attempts a season high for Notre d name Tay Davis 17 points tonight huge for the Irish well its almost like that three that he got off the backboard gave him another jolt to confidence but he drove the ball he attacked he was ready to shoot the ball look at that shot look at that shot he may not do that if he may shoot 10 more of that like that and not be able to knock it off the board but the kick out the drive that play off the side out of bounds was so big and Tay Davis just had a fantastic game of being the aggressor in this game from the beginning too shy of a career high with those 17 he had 19 against Western Michigan earlier this season Michael Shrewsberry saying DAV is just such a strong player he keeps getting better and we have watched him grow here in his sophomore season out of Indie just another example of really both teams been what Notre Dame has done with the Improvement now we could see a Kelly back screen in this alignment but theres not not going to be any more time outside of the outside of the one pass and the shot be Carter Murphy triggering it in George is the open one right now and theyre going to give it to him George catches hes got to throw it up mid Court heave oh he almost got it and Notre Dame hangs on the Irish knocking off the jackets and they get the season sweep of Georgia Tech just a great game George caught it there was nobody on him he drove into it uh takes that shot but these two programs are on the uptick and I think the ACC knows it two young coaches in the Collegiate game outstanding staffs building their team and in this new transactional portal world if they can keep these young guys together theyre going to be able to build something better and better but both of these teams are going to be theyre going to be forces the rest of the season because they can beat anybody on any given night which theyve proven
