around it with a lot of shooting Head coach Richie McKay calling Cleveland a unicorn One of the most underholded players in the nation So we got the Wolfpack into white uniforms Theyre six and three 50 here at home But they had those losses against Auburn Texas Satan Hall and coach Will Wade his first year said Hey I was hoping that this was going to selforrect And it didnt I got to step in Made some changes in the lineup In their last game it was a win against UNC Asheville and Cuadier Copeland even though they havent been getting the wins Copeland who gets the basket there Hes been the guy on offense with as you talked about Williams kind of slump in the past few games Well guys have stepped up on the offensive end of the floor Thats not the problem that this possession here has been their problem Its been fouled and its been foul troubles there even with Darian Williams Theres no reason to foul right here and this has been the problem The scoring is not the issue with NC State 89 points a game but the defensive end of the floor they have trouble containing the dribble Theyve been challenged Lets see if the leadership steps up for NC State on defensive end Paul McNeel back into the starting lineup after being taken out last game The only game he didnt start this year as Cleveland misses with the left hand Darien Williams picked up his first foul about 35 ft away from the basket Threepointer not there Cleveland storming applause in for the defensive rebound Hes number seven in the nation in that statistical category And Colin Porter is back in the lineup after missing a game with an injury So the guard from Ashlin Kentucky who averages 11 points per game is starting for coach McKay as Liberty turns the ball over Thats what you want to see at the NC State You want to create turnovers And for a team that likes to switch Liberty puts a lot of pressure on your defense because all five guys on the floor double figures scored shoots it well cheering applause Its another foul here This time on the offensive end for NC State So backto back turnovers between the two teams Sloppy opening in 10 seconds as Paul Mciel Jr picks up the personal Youre going to see NC State try to press as much as possible They know theyre going to have trouble defending Liberty in the half court So if you can slow them down on this on the defensive end of the floor and limit the amount of time that you have to defend them in the half court gives you a chance A couple missed layups early for Liberty As you see the pace that both of these teams want to play up and down the floor Williams calling for it Coach Wade said we are going to force feed him the basketball and you see right there the low post move Thats one of the reasons why he was the ACC preseason player of the year Theres no one on the Liberty roster that can guard him oneonone I mean hes going to go inside until you put a bigger defender on him and then hell go outside Thats the versatility in Williams and why hes such a gifted player Now you see the intention of NC State Theres no more free flowing offense Theyre going inside and theyre going to their preseason ACC player of the year Cleveland little touch shot came up short Williams who transferred over from Texas Tech a couple years with that program Lost nearly 30 lbs in between last season and this season Looks really thin athletic looks to be in really good shape Then Allen Luben another low post presence the senior forward out of Orlando Florida We talk about NC State and perimeter shooting Theyre attacking the paint right now They are intentional in attacking the rim They know theres no rim protection for Liberty Win against UNCC Asheville NC State outscored UNCC Asheville in the paint 404 Youre looking at another foul here off the bounce This is the issue with the switching that goes on with NC State I think thats something theyre going to deal with all year long I dont think Ven Alubin or even Williams can defend these guards in the switches Threepointer good by Brett Decker Jr Arguably the best threepoint shooter in the country Hes number one in makes per game and second in percentage No I dont think its much of an argument at this laughter point It isnt As of December the 10th 59 from three on the year And that is a turnover No were going to say staying with Liberty So you know we one thing we saw okay you give up the threepointer Coach Weight said we dont want to do that especially with Decker The other is already three fouls on NC State They record more fouls than almost anybody in the country per game And its going to force them to dig deep in their bench Williams with the left Got his own rebound swarmed by red jerseys and a held ball Liberty will get possession Expect the court They want to extend their pressure and get a little bit of start their offense Maybe between 16 and 18 Thats what youre going to see Not as much trapping Theyll have to sprinkle in the trap just to keep them honest They want to keep everything in front Slow it down They dont want Liby starting their offense as early as in the 20s Coach Way telling us we cant defend for 25 30 seconds We in the half court We need 15 to 18 seconds because 25 ft net you got to guard those shots and those are difficult shots Thats a step back three by Kaden Maney And thats Liberty basketball Theyre difficult shots for other people This is a really good shot making team And when all five guys are capable of stretching the defense and attacking you off the mouse makes it really difficult Yeah Libertys top five in the country in threepoint shooting Mini now one point away from a thousand for his career And heres Guadir Copeland who came over with coach Wade from McNe lost it Williams has it Pushes off his help The turnaround midrange just not there Its good defensive effort Anytime you get Williams to shoot a fade away but tied up at 64 minutes into this game Aini feeling it This Liberty team will fire at will Yeah they was kicking on then out of lubing in the switches and they werent attacking Good hustle play by JJ Harper Could not save it from going out of bounds The NC State basketball when we come back for our from our first time out We talked about the shooting of Liberty and again its not a surprise they start first basket of the game Decker from three as good as anybody in college basketball from behind the threepoint line But he says Hey take this Had a Conference USA title Went to the NCAA tournament Return eight players from last years team and theyre shooting 55 from the floor Picked to win Conference USA Yet again they got three allconerence guys and you said eight players returning I dont know another team in college basketball that has eight players returning And coach Richie Mccay to be able to have some type of retention is just amazing to who he is and type of coach that he is had 20 or more wins in nine of the last 12 years As you see Trey Hollowman for NC State theyre getting in the paint Thats where Coach Wade wants to see their toughness They want to get touches in the paint early and often but he want to see his toughness here on this end of the floor And right now Liberty is just missing shots Its not the defense thats making the miss Thats a wide open opportunity there This is where he wants to see his toughness He sees it on the offensive end but he wants to see it on the offensive glass and also on the defensive end of the floor Offensive rebound Guadier Copeland showing that toughness Lowers the shoulder works his way inside and hell go to the free throw line as Colin Porter hacked him Oh I asked coach Mccay are you going to do anything different Because he has smaller guards and particular music If you know anything about Tony Bennett thats just that Virginia style Were not changing who we are and what we do Theyre not doubling the post yet Theyre going to let their players play oneonone and be physical That pack line defense Coach McKay was the head coach at Liberty Then he left to be the associate head coach at Virginia under Tony Bennett for six years Returns this is now his second stint And you know really talked about not only Tony Bennett learning from him He said I got a masters degree in packline defense But he said Tonyys younger than me but I have not had a more influential mentor in my career Yeah he he said he learned so much He said was hesitant to go back but Big Bennett he knew his dad really well Bennett dad was instrumental in getting him to head to Charlottesville Great recovery Darien Williams got cheering beat on the back door cut recovered Maybe thats some of that athleticism You lose the weight youre a little quicker on the step Yeah its a great recovery here You try to overplay and You were the first one to notice that I told I saw him last year when he was at Texas Tech and I didnt even notice him on the floor today because he looks so different At least from what I remember seeing him a year ago cheering and applause NC State gets the turnover Copeland pushing Heres Hollerman for three cheering NC State is electric when they do that When they can create turnovers and get out and just let their offense be free flowing this is when theyre really dangerous They look like a top 25 team in the country We talked about Libertys threepoint shooting prowess NC State first in the ACC at 40 from threepoint range this year as Holland now has five points cheering The help is going to come baseline Thats a dangerous pass but then right at I was ready I had my hands ready I dont know You were looking for me to see laughter I had my hands in the shooting pocket It was going up if it was going up if I got it Transition here Taking it turnover created but has break points there NC State does that as well as anyone in the country Theyre off to a really good start here Theyve been fortunate enough to that and Liberty has missed some open looks but the aggressiveness and the five on the shot clock Heres Matheni Porter in the corner Hes got to get rid of it This three offensive rebound inside Copeland stripped it Went out of bounds Last touched by Liberty against Josh Smith pulled down the board but it went off of his knee out of bounds Great job by Kobe He got pushed underneath the basket and then quick hands created the turnover there You were either going to catch and shoot that or you going the lap and the guys behind Either one No I was going to shoot it I dont know if I would have made it but it was going up Offensive foul Second offensive foul against NC State Copeland not happy about it his first personal Here we go See we we are surrounded here The NC State fans Theyre close Theyre close So you know you missed the shot You got some supporting cast behind us in case we need some help Beautiful arena the Lenovo Center also the home of the Carolina Hurricanes You can feel the ice rink underneath our feet 6 run for NC State cheering Thats Xander Carter in the corner and Ael pulls down the defensive rebound The freshman from Baltimore got that black eye caught the elbow in practice earlier this week Copeland to the rack THE CIRCUS SHOT FOR Guadier Copeland applause I dont know where NC State would be without Quadier Copeland I mean just the transition to point guard for him has just been seamless We talked about him averaging 21 and six the last five so games and hes just picking up where hes left off and I dont it just just both ends of the floor Really has not been a scorer throughout most of his career Started a couple years at Syracuse whos kind of a defensive specialist and he went to play for coach Ray at McNees He averaged 10 points per game cheering last year But he has been a revelation offensively here this year for the Wolfpack Shooting 60 from the field and 56 behind a threepoint line and no one saw that But hes playing with so much confidence and no one has more confidence in their ability than Cardier Copeland Hes got six points Hes the only player on the floor right now for NC State whos got a bucket as coach Wade goes with some fresh legs Whistle before the turnover One of those fresh legs That is Alan Breed music If you like what you see theyre at least being physical NC State knows that with this style of play theyre going to foul but theyre being physical Theyre showing a level of toughness And you want to know what practice has been like All you have to do is look at Matt Abels eye That tells you hes got a black eye right there guarding the basketball And Liberty needs to get Brett Decker Jr going He had the three early Has not had a field goal attempt since Eight on the shot clock and cheering coach Wade wants a turnover He can challenge it if he wants Hes looking at his Mitch He doesnt want to have to use it Seven on the shot clock Maybe that plays into the decision Cleveland inbound Lob inside Nearly turned over Five to shoot cheering Decker to his left Tripped up Went back to his right And a shot clock violation Another good defensive possession here for NC State You look at Matt Abel there We talked about it That tells you the type of practice and the type of week its been Yeah For NC State Hes a heralded recruit number 24 on the ESPN 100 out of Sagemont Prep averaging nine and three this year Well Waynes been asking for player le program He knows you know to be for this team to reach its potential players have got to step up Heres Breed straight away Offensive rebound up top by Musa Sier Fresh legs paying dividends for the Wolfpack and it leads to a second chance three Terrence Arseno Arsenal not down his second three of the year Again cheering he knows hes in the game to be aggressive on the defensive end of the floor and that time shown he can do more than just guard the basketball 12 nothing run and the threes just not falling for one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the country as Liberty two for seven now from deep Copeland step back looking for more Cleveland rips down the rebound he averages nine of those per game you mentioned 109 and eight nearly a triple double for Cleveland and thats a transition three Colin Porter who missed last game in the win against Copen State due to an injury and that one was way out there thats why theyre never out of a because of the range You got to guard these guys from 30 Right now NC States doing a great job being physical Theyve been challenged and so far theyre answering the challenge but this games a long way from being over Reed spinning lost it bobbled it off of his head somehow regained control and made the bucket applause Its important for these guys get in the paint Theyre attacking the paint Theyve settled so much in the past already 12 points here in the paint Theyve lost that painoint battle during that loser streak as well You can see theyve emphasized that to start this game They emphasize it in the win against UNCC Asheville to the tune of 40 to 14 in the paint as Gates missing the threepointer Arsenal hitting the three He only averages three points per game so hes already at his season average with that one bucket long career at Houston for Arsenal before coming over to NC State and and one Matt Ael the freshman pushed off of his line muscled it up with the left hand You want to get yourself going in the game when you feel like youre struggling and youve been challenged This what you do You put your head down get to the rim and show this 163 run right now for NC State as Abel cannot finish off the threepoint play Right now NC State shooting 60 from the floor getting the majority of their points inside in the paint as they bring in Ryan Jones Jr Liberty does off the bench for some interior help Eric Rothman Randolph Childress here with you at the Lenovo Center There is Jones misses badly in the turnaround cheering energy that NC State has played with here in the opening 10 minutes Theyve been challenged and so far theyve answered that challenge Theyre being unselfish Theyre attacking the paint Arso who only had one threepointer all year has now made two in the last few minutes Theyre making Liberty uncomfortable on the defensive end of the floor Theyve always scored Scoring has not been the issue This end of the floor has been the issue applause and cheering Turnover Luca Sier cut off the drive by Harper Turnover number five We talked about the lack of an edge Lil Wayne said earlier this week we havent had an edge to us even music in our wins You can only go so far with the head coach leading It was all systems breakdown from Maui to Auburn I tried to let it selforrect but sometimes you got to step in Thats my job And we talked about you know how earlier today he told us maybe a little Byrons remorse about scheduling this game considering how good Liberty is and he told us I just thought we would be further along at this point in the season They did And you see here they came out It was intentional It was a jump ball here coming out with trying to force Williams to get the ball inside One they got to force to get him inside The other thing was the experience that he brought in He brought in guys from NCAA tournament experience He thought this team would just naturally just pick it up a lot quicker than they have They be a sense of urgency They communicate better and they have not done so And has it been a struggle Maybe they adjust to the system I think some of it has just been they everything was easy for him earlier Everyone was scoring They were making shots and slowly it tipped away and guys like Williams not involved and theyve been intentional about that on both ends of the floor here tonight Got it blocked Harper here Good finish at the contact by JJ Harper This is a dangerous team Theyre just not going anywhere Theyre going to continue to push pace as well They like the game in the 80s as well Mississippi State has a size advantage nearly at every position Williams straight away Liberty shooting just four for 16 applause from the floor You mentioned bringing in that experience You have Williams a couple years at Texas Tech Trey Harlem three years at Michigan State Claire Copeland Syracuse and MC Terrence Arsenal three years at Houston So those guys pedigreewise would give Will the in inclination hey were going to get off to a hot start Were not going to have to worry about things That just hasnt been the case I mean youre talking about Texas Tech Michigan State Talk about two of the best programs in college basketball Houston and Houston I mean its its he thought they would hit the ground running Felt good about the summer his guys had and started out the year really well on both ends and it just slowly started chipping away and have not had that problem here so far tonight Phoeni now one for four from three Hes a near 40 shooter on the cheering year Hollerman again attacking the lane Trey Hollermans got seven points Its one of those guys Three years at Michigan State hes averaging 11 this year for Coach Wade 16 points in the paint compared to Libertys two Liberty a pretty undersized team They struggle rebounding but they shoot the outside ball well They just not dropping here in the first half depending on the shot clock Thats NC State Theyre flying around now instead of watching they are Look how active everyones theyre running guys off the line cheering applause Porter with one on the shot clock and a great defensive possession by NC State Thats what NC State has not been doing Its the extra multiple possessions on the defensive end of the floor Holman the move off the dribble cheering Feel the vibe shift here too in the Lenovo Center This is the product these fans were expecting to see this year which will wait in his first year Zack Clevelands been scoreless so far Decker in the corner Thats the guy they want shooting the three cheering Defensive rebound by Arsenal applause When youre switching five like this lineup has and they do that when Venaloo is at the five theyll switch everything Theres no need not to fly around Youre switching you got to scramble And theyve been doing a really good job of doing that here tonight Stay in front of the basketball I tell you Holland has been so aggressive that hell go to the free throw line Liberty shooting just three for 12 from threepoint range NC State Research Valvano the longtime coach here at NC State brought the school a national championship His name hangs in the rafters here at the Lenovo Center Be happy with how is Wolfpacker performing here in the first half Theyre on top 28 to1 This game was tied six to six and then RC since then NC State not only have they figured it out offensively obviously but Liberty shooting just four of 19 from the floor I think thats been the most impressive thing They got a few open looks early but since then everything has been difficult and Will told us he said hey even for the UNCC Asheville game we didnt play well but I didnt expect them to play well We had nearly a 2hour practice that morning before the game so I knew their legs would be a little heavy We talked about it earlier the black eye with Matt Ael You can tell the type of week in practice has been but the message has been sent These guys are flying around Yeah it seems like its been received as well Ball movement Porter in the corner Tried to go back to Decker Active hands this time by Arsenal You know the season Liberty averaging 50 55 from the floor Theyre four of 19 Theyre averaging 43 from three Theyre just three of 12 here in this game So obviously the message so far has worked But you know to also Liberty just has missed a lot of open shots as well which hasnt helped the cause Turnover on the Flames and cheering and applause will stay with NC State out of bounds Well the length bothers you when guys are swarming around like this Theyre getting some looks theyve missed those I think theyve rushed some attempts and then you see here a careless turnover Youre on your heels right now and right now looks like the game was just sped up for him Six turnovers now on Liberty and a lot of those shots have been late in the shot clock as well Theyre used to getting opportunities and being able to identify switches NC State team everyone sitting in the defensive stands and guarding the ball cheering Then Allan Luben took the contact plowed right through it and one they know early theyre not going to get double team You seeing whoever gets it inside turns post Thats been out of Lubens game turns faces up drives here turns feels your body and spins Thats kind of how he plays the game And hes an undersized center more of a post driver Number one in the ACC in field goal percentage shooting 67 from the floor Williams in the corner after the offensive rebound Luben coming off a 23point performance in the win against UNCC Asheville 19 of those coming in the second half of that win Porter spots up Three applause for 13 from three now for Liberty Dangerous pass Luben caught it and might have gotten applause bailed out I dont know if he had an opportunity to shoot that was pushed from behind Really impressive possession there by Natal Luben here Staying in front of corner here off the dribble forcing him to take a difficult threepoint shot Runs down And thats what happened when youre switching that way It works the other way When your big has to defend that guard he takes a shot He sprints down He has an advantage Great job catching that shot keep catching the ball keeping it high and drawing a foul Time at Notre Dame Vanderbilt North Carolina and now NC State his fourth school Tune in tomorrow night to catch Ken Anthony son of Carmelo lead Syracuse against St Joes Thats at 9 Eastern right here on ACC Network and also be on the ESPN app Holl Porter picked up his second foul Big big win by your orange needed Tennessee Orange on orange cry laughter Win against the Volunteers that program Syracuse on tough times You know I got enjoyed getting to know our colleague Jim Beahheim Feels weird for a kid from Syracuse who was terrified to go to a Jim Beaheim press conference laughter and now Im chopping it up talking to him in Charlotte in our preseason seminar this year Coach Behind seems very happy in the retirement Very happy and very good behind the mic as well as JJ Parker lays it in their job pressure there Big deficit right now for Liberty You got to continue to just chip away your Liberty running your offense But NC State right now less dribbling more ball moving keep physically overwhelming Liberty Its just every time they attack the paint or drawing contact or drawing the whistles Its an undersized Liberty team And you know you talk about Styles making fights you boxing analogy Well we thought going into it okay two teams that like to push up the four two teams that like to shoot the three Uhuh NC States going Im not shooting the three tonight Were pounding it inside If the threes come great But were going to were going to use our force our brute strength down low Thats the challenge Thats the when you talk about toughness This isnt just a mental thing Its the hey youre not going to settle and shoot jump shots You know were scoring Thats not the problem Youre going to be physical in how we attack you on both ends of the floor And starting with paint touches drawing fouls doing things that teams were doing to them Bill Wade first year here with the Wolf Pack Hes had success everywhere hes been teams have gone to the NCAA tournament seven times in his young applause career Couple times at VCU cheering LSU MC trying to get the Wolf Pack back They went to the Final Four in 2024 Tough year last year just 12 and 19 overall Turnover applause getting cheering swarmed inside Turnover number seven on Liberty WILLIAMS JUST he wants the ball RC cheering I can see him really working to post up show the body give me the ball Yeah Id like to see him turn and just take a more middle spin baseline not try to just totally overpound and shoot a fadeaway Doesnt always need to do that here He had Decker on him and just didnt need to fade away I thought he could have put him in the basket Then he got called for the foul didnt Williams Thats his second personal 20point lead for NC State Largest lead of the game Randolph Childris with you here State snapped a two game losing streak Their last win against USC Asheville Liberty did the same in their win against Coffin State Battle this time on the Wolf Pack So Decker will go to wide Paul McNeel Jr picks up his second and itll be a one and one The Neil there NC State defensively does things that some other teams dont usually do Theyll help strong side in the corner They want you in the guy Most teams are play as though they dont want you to help off the strong side corner McNeel a little late there tried to get off and cut the basketball off Picking up the foul but theyre flying all over the place right now This is cheering theyre were not the only ones that would that knows Liberty is a really good basketball team This is just cheering NC State playing to their applause potential Yeah The reason why they were in the top 25 earlier this year and theyre seeing those hopes of Will Wade the coaching staff and these fans here in Raleigh Copeland comes in for Paul McNeel Jr immediately attacks Decker Goes off the glass cheering Just too big A distinct size advantage there by Cardier Copen and hes playing as as well as anyone Eight points now Under four minutes to go here in the opening half Its been all NC State was tied six to six and then the Wolfpack went on a sprint Another missed layup for Liberty Matheni underneath cheering has had a tough first half One of four from the floor for the grad whos at Theyre not just talking theyre talking touches You can see there Cardier Copen pushes Arsenal to make the switch Good cheering baseline cut JJ Harper makes it a 20point game You saw the turnover number there at the bottom of your screen Seven to three cheering in favor of NC State as well That speaks to those deflections those active hands Copeland this has been a familiar story him backing down Decker He got some help this time by Harper who tries to save it with the diving effort Good hustle play by JJ Harper but it will stay with the Wolfpack And theyre throwing at his free throw line A little pinch post action playing off of that picking their matchup Claire Copeland has a distinct size advantage now Theyre trying to get a bigger defender And Carter on We need to get Claudia Copeland miked up for one of these games We still a Disney program I dont know if thats a childrens program you want to have with Claudia Copelan miked up like ACC after dark payperview payperview to listen to Copeland You want to is a human bullhorn Allan Breed got the bucket Zack Cleveland star for Liberty got the basketball still without a point in this game chance now as theyll go to the free throw line Good thing for Liberty right now They wont face a team like this in Conference USA I mean NC State is played a really good first half here so far on both ends of the floor cheering Zack Cleveland nearly averaging a triple double on the season 10 points nine rebounds eight assists Thats good for third in D1 in the assist category But coach telling us hes a unicorn The one piece of his game that has not come around is the free throw shooting Hes just a 40 free throw shooter He says he makes every free throw in practice and then he cheering gets into the game and its a little bit of the case of the Yes Yeah His free throw shooting is like my putting I get over top of it and it just I make them in practice and then I get on the course and thats theres what we call too many swing fouls Trey Hollowman cheering Count it Hell go to the free throw line Hollerman has been aggressive every single time hes touched the ball Hes got 10 This is what you do when you know theres no shot blocking there Put your head down get in the paint Someone rotates you pass it If not you lay it up And Autumn has been incredible and how efficient hes been all year long You saw how he angled his body too to draw that contact Josh Smith called for the second foul Hollerman three years at Michigan State the former high school player of the year out of Minnesota And talking to Will Wade you know it seemed like not only was he looking for somebody to step up from a tenacity standpoint but also in the guard position specifically because Clavier Copeland thats not necessarily his game Maybe its Trey Hollowman Maybe thats the guy whos going to step up They dont have yet a point guard Yeah And I I think if you were to ask Will Wade now with the struggles that hes gone through the last five cheering games you know when he went out and got your typical point guard they to kind of settle down the leadership qualities that hes looking for in that position Harper slips inside Great job Now Libertys making the adjustments Theyre starting to take advantage of NC States pressure and getting effective with back doors Liberty averages 84 points per game just 17th here in the first half on the road Copeland backing his way in Hes got a mismatch against any guard that Liberty will throw at him This time it was Porter but Copel just couldnt convert Yeah hes just getting in the middle of the floor and crawling for the ball screen using his size to spin around and get to the basket cheering Minute and a half to go Its been all NC State hell hone cheering Every time someone touches this theres help Theyre just flying around This is just really good defense Came up short hadmans hand in his face Three for 14 from long distance Got the switch on the Porter that he wanted Now Able the cheering left hand brush applause cheering THATS what youre able to do when you can shoot the basketball like that Get the drive closeouts Good move Xander Carter hesitation midair for his first bucket Libertys played well the last few possessions and NC State You just cant get a stop A freshman They knew he was going to contribute in his first year A heralded top 25 recruit Hes been a little slow to get started but not here tonight Seven points for the freshman from Baltimore Matt Ael Someone has to pay for that black eye now Hes know I had to had to deal with his physicality in practice I got to take it out on someone Half second difference between the game clock and the shot clock And just getting pushed around by Luben Blocked Vladier Copeland got a paw on it What a great first half for NC State Will Wade is fired up Great half here by NC State I think its the best 20minute playing really well So much confidence music Hes always been a confident player And then Trey Alman as well I mean just so efficient on the offensive end Both of these guys you look at their splits Its been amazing Liberty start with the basketball their star Zack Cleveland zero points in that first half shooting just three of 14 from threepoint range for a team that averages 43 from distance on cheering the year with a steal and thats why just the activity on the defensive end of the floor state is it just overwhelmed Liberty McNeel Jr starts the second half off with a triple his first bucket of the game applause And hes a guy that has struggled as well offensively And great to see him going early part of the season First couple of games we thought okay he was going to be robbing to Williams Batman and was averaging 20 points a game Smith on the baseline fouled underneath and McNeel you know he was I think you know drew some frustration from coach Wade He was not benched but he did start in the UNCC Asheville game That was the first game this year that he didnt get a starting nod Puts it back into the starting lineup here tonight And we saw him out about 3 and 12 hours before the team showed up for shootounds today getting in work shooting by himself just trying to get himself back on track He did what a lot of young players do You let your offense affect your defensive intensity And when he started missing shots the energy on the other end of the floor started to dip and applause his coach has sent the message and just like the rest of his teammates its been received The talents there the shot making abilities there Just a matter of time before he figures it out Kirk Herbstreet apparently is here as well Cardboard cut out in the stands there Got a couple of perks as Cuadier Cookland was called for his second personal foul 28point lead for NC State Jen Allen lubic pick and roll two hand slam Just so effective as a player on the move Ball screens Catching on the move Really good off the bounce Break makes really good decisions there Thats a big boy coming through the lane too I I get out of the way getting out the way But this is where hes been great tonight Hes staying in front of the basketball on the switch Its been great defense by NC State but also just uncharacteristic how many misses from three Liberty has had See the the pick and roll here Yeah he catches on the short roll and Minis like Hey wheres the help Theres nothing I can do there Harper really good defensively for Liberty Nearly knocked that one out Tried to run that same play with Copeland and Luben is sniffed out by the Flames Williams comes up short Hes definitely been more active in the offense but only four points on one of seven shooting Yeah last couple of shots hes just been fading away Even there hes big hes physical hes strong Just push through get to the rim Theres no shot blockers there Theres no reason to fade away And hes out of rhythm a little bit but again hes got time to figure that out Hell get plenty of touches You can see theyre starting to be conservative in how they attack teams and going through him Hell get enough touches to figure that out on the offensive ending field Another missed three by Liberty Three for 16 now That was after Van Allen Luben picked up his second personal foul NC States got two fouls and a half already A rattling three and you know he said Williams No Im not going to fade away Ill just step out Nice cool calm collected threepointer And hes still you know shooting 47 behind the arc and just is an unselfish player He doesnt force anything And cheering and that was what coach Weey was telling us I actually want him to be more forceful Not necessarily forcing shots but forceful in getting his shots getting open Gets the assist there to Paul McNeel Jr in the corner And its a route NC State running Liberty out of the gym as the planes take a timeout Down 36 music Its an 11 to one run for NC State In the opening three minutes of the second half theyve made three straight threepointers They are on top by 36 points here at home This has been a dominant half of basketball in the first half and they started this second half and hadnt missed a beat Now they got the three ball going What do you do with your liberty right now You just got to play and try to clean it up and get yourself ready for your next game This is applause You guys feel clearly overmatched here by NC State This is just a dominant performance And that happens sometimes You catch a team on a night when they play to their potential And right now youre seeing an NC State team thats challenged by their head coach and the athleticism the physicality music the length the activity is just wore Liberty down Theyre ready to take the 2hour half hour bus ride to Lynchburg back home after this game Nine turnovers on Liberty after they kick that one out of bounds Yeah what you going to you want to see from NC State you want to see them just continue to keep their foot on on the pedal Hollerman lips out the three Williams fought for the offensive rebound Luben was there Said Thank you very much Ill take that Second chance points for the Wildcat Alvin Luben up to nine points now Trap defense and held ball applause turnover NC State will get it back Wades loving the activity of his crew Hes fired up This is what he wanted to see Well you know RC NC States got Kansas coming here on Saturday And if Wolfpack fans wanted to feel good about the potential of that game well this is this is the nice appetizer for Wolfpack fans Great transition When Kansas watches this film theyre going to realize this is a totally different team But thats the intensity that Kansas plays with And so theyre going to need this type of effort Good feed Williams cheering paused midair on the fadeaway He heard RC said stop fade away This time he got the dive inside to Vin Allen Luben And I understand why he does it Hes not he doesnt elevate a lot on his jump shot His physicality he likes to use to create space with his shoulders and sometimes its easy just to fade away But and theres no shot blockers If you get past guys you just want them to do that Harper English off the glass Got the assist from Kayen Nefini Harpers got 10 to lead all Liberty scorers Hes the one guy on the court for Liberty that doesnt look to overmatch athletically Hes flying around You can see him using his speed and attacking the basket Hes been effective here Offensive foul goes against NC State 5 minutes into the second half The Wolfpack up 60 to22 music And after the game stick around for the ACC huddle final score postgame show A complete breakdown and reactions from coaches and players Congratulations to the Miami Hurricanes One thing I love about that is just a reminder that games early in the year matters I think sometimes we talked about that with college basketball and just November matter Just early December matters Just a lot of great matchups a lot of great games that weve seen early in the year And theres a chance another mislab for Liberty that this game matters a lot to NC State You know if theyre potentially looking to build their resume for the postseason if Liberty goes on to win Conference USA you point to that You say Hey we blew out Liberty at our at our home And you know who knows with Kansas coming to town on Saturday could spur NC State to live up to maybe the potential that many thought coach Will Wade would be able to produce in year number one Well this was a get right game This was we had to get back to playing the way were capable of playing And this they message was sent players answered it But this Kansas game youre going to find out how good you really are cuz that is a really good basketball team thats out there start freshman potentially number one pick in the NBA draft Well maybe not so much after AJ demands performanced cheering applause Peterson is as good as any guard in the country and cheering theyre going to be tested And now Luben now has 13 points That came after a beautiful twohanded interception by Paul McNeel Jr on the defensive end AJ Harper Liberty now three for 18 from threepoint length 0 for four here in the second half Now I know youre up 40 but I still want to see you continue to play Still a lot of time Theres 13 minutes left in the second half If you never want to feel like youre running up the score but if you can beat him by 60 you beat him by 60 Youre trying to establish your identity and some consistency in how youre playing alleyoop laying for Gary and Williams Look at activity Everybody every time somebody dribbles it theres an extra hand here Just the third threepoint attempt for Brett Deckard Jr Hes only made one of them But for a guy whos averaging 20 points per game and getting most of his points from the threepoint line NC State has ran him off his mark pretty consistently Harper continues to be the defensive stalwork for Liberty despite the score Luben going right back at him Harper standing his ground Hes had a really nice game for Jay Harper Hes battled on both ends of the floor I mean he plays bigger than his size Hes listed at 65 He probably plays as if hes 68 69 Hell defend one through five on the floor And hes had a solid performance on both ends Liberty struggled tonight BUT HE HAS NOT FEED TO LUBEN Stay with NC State on the baseline Wholesale changes coming in for both teams Harper will take a seat on the bench Around the ACC some notable results last weekend Notre Dame beating TCU in overtime Duke sixpoint winners over Michigan State Louisville taking down Indiana and SMU an overtime win against Texas AM These are all quality wins by the ACC and played really well in the ACC SEC challenge and they continue to play well and I think this league I think no one want to argue that Duke and Louisville look like the top two teams after that I think its wide open Virginia has looked great NC State has shown you what theyre capable of Weights had moments Miami looks really good Notre Dame Clemson its a lot to be excited about about ACC basketball as we return here NC State running away of the week for the Dookies Yeah hes not only looking like the rookie of the year hes looking like the player of the year so far here early in the year teams in the net top 50 Duke Louisville North Carolina Virginia Miami Clemson SMU and NC State I think right now maybe the public perception of the conference is a little bit delayed catching up to where the conference is compared to last year I think some people still are you know maybe not paying as much attention and still think oh ACC maybe a couple good teams They didnt really have a good year last year Uh this is this is a deep ACC conference this year They needed to prove it and they did And I didnt mention Carolina early because I think Carolina when Seth Krimble comes back has a chance to be in that conversation with Duke and Louisville and theyre playing really good basketball and cheering they have as skilled and talented of a freshman as there is in college basketball We talked about Tamboo but David Wilson has been equally as impressive here with a couple steals in the game Referees not sure who last touched it Cardier Cop has quick hands He can steal caps off a losing car Thats just hes just active hands and all over the place And hes working on potentially a triple double Eight points seven rebounds seven assists Able messing WITH THE LEFT Sonia Sier I should say Second chance not there Eric Roth and Randolph Childris midway through the second half here at the Robo Center in Raleigh cheering Left hand finished by Ryan Jones Jr transferred over from Virginia Tech Played only five games last year Getting his first bucket here tonight with Liberty Good chance to put guys out there and see how they respond cuz the bench production production is one thing Liberty needs and theyve been looking for They got all their starters averaging double figures but they get ready for Conference USA Jones is a part of that bench thats continuing to evolve and to grow And you need good minutes out of these guys They average just 18 bench points per game That is the bottom tier of division one It puts a lot of pressure on your guys your starters and doesnt allow room for off games which is inevitable to happen And you dont want them all to have out games like this Ronnier Copin gives a kiss to the fans as they were counting down the shot clock but he hit that three Confidence cheering and selfbelief is an amazing thing because anyone in the ACC that watched him in Syracuse did not believe he was capable of doing this We knew he was a good defender We knew he was a versatile defender We knew he could talk But what hes doing offensively and the efficiency in which hes doing so here just walking into a three Hes shooting that with so much confidence and he should when youre shooting over 50 from three 11 points as Copeland heads to the bench at Ael called for his first personal Brett Decker Jr Obviously not the game he wanted tonight but his season as a sophomore you know played 27 games last year averaged to score points per game and now a year later has morphed into the best threepoint shooter in the country averaging 20 points per game and shooting nearly 60 from three Yeah I told Richie McKay good luck keeping him around Yeah I mean thats the unfortunate reality of college basketball these days is you got a guy like that in a program like Liberty applause got Yeah Coach McKay told us you know he said he had a great game earlier on this year and all of a sudden I was getting texts and DMs and messages from agents coaches all over the country Unforced error that thats just the type of night its been But Decker made the right pass and thats what he did better than I thought he was until I watched him on film And you knew he could shoot it You heard about his reputation of a shooter but he puts it on the floor better than creates better than people give him credit for Why I think hes his upside so hot playing for Bob Richie I mean Richie McKay youve got to be a defender and thats just what he requires you to do on the shot clock as Arsenal is tripped up And on the other end of the floor RC that was the 14th turnover on Liberty Liberty is third in the country in terms of fewest turnovers per game averaging just eight and a half turnovers per game this season So this is very uncharacteristic for them It is and and state now I want to look you got all guys in the game now I want to see if these these guys can keep the intensity up continue to pressure defensively Jerry Deng missing the three I think coach Wade wants to see that as well Decker off the mark You know in the opening nine minutes of the game against UNCC Asheville he played 11 players So you know Will Wade obviously we talked about his frustrations with his teams intensity but he doesnt care if youre number one on the call sheet or number 11 or 12 Like he wants to see you perform No And hes challenging guys as well Yeah like turn to Arsenal is a guy hes like Hey I brought you in here to lead my team on the defensive end of the floor And you go back to MC Alan Breed was one of his best players there and he hasnt been able to crack consistent minutes in the rotation here and cheering but hes trusted and Deng here with so much ability and talent himself Dang A little awkward drive Kind of looking like a baby deer going into laughter the lane there Is blocked out of bounds 7129 music NC State on top Under 8 minutes to go NC State you know lose by 40 points Might as well use your challenge while youre here Thanks No rule Yeah Test it out Good explanation there Good refereeing crew we got here tonight Ron Groover lead to cell Tony Henderson That was Ron Groover You heard from worked in final fours in the past Brett Decker hitting the three Smooth looking jump shot there Every time he shoots it it looks good like its going in and hasnt got many to go in tonight But always a good rhythm good feeling when you knock knock them down Nine points now 7132 NC State mentioned NC State They got Kansas coming to town on Saturday for Liberty You know they got a tough road game on a couple games from now on the road against Dayton So theyve got Midway University in between now and then So hopefully a get right game against Midway for Liberty before they have to go on the road against a very tough Dayton team and very good Dayton team And that is not an easy game Anthony Grant has the Flyers playing good basketball and theyve had a tough schedule as well Yeah hes scheduled really well in an 810 that I think is a big league right now that its a multi bit league with the quality of team that the A10 has Coach Richie McKay cheering hes got to be frustrated here but you know he schedules hard too And he can get games realize that that this isnt we joked about it Even Will Wade who has played him at every stop from VCU Hes played him everywhere hes been LSU and now here Travel there cheering by Abel and its good call Will Wade might get a technical despite being on top by nearly 40 points He is not thrilled with the last few calls that have gone against NC State Really going after Tony Henderson Decker in the corner on the skip pass Dang the rebound No youre right I mean and Liberty beat McNees last year The first time Richie McCay defeated Will Wade As you mentioned they played pretty much everywhere that Wade has gone Well Richie knows he got he can get a game Most high majors programs wont play him He knows Will Wade will give him a game I mean Will said if he knew his team was going to struggle the way they were he wouldnt have scheduled this game But hes got to like the outcome Look at that I mean thats crediting Will Wade and and its a credit to Richard McKay for the program that hes built there Its getting harder and harder not only for programs like Liberty to get power conference opponents but you know its also the kind of the the tipping of the scales of the NIL Its getting harder to win these games And its harder to win them and its harder to have retention and get play And hes had really good players I mean he has players that been on that are on NBA rosters and hes keeping him there and he has a faithbased program and and its got to be more than basketball If you want to go to Liberty bigger than basketball and credit to these young men for sticking around and developing and learning from such a great leader applause Yeah no doubt Car fourth year Atheni his third year Cleveland his fourth year So they they know what theyre signing up for They really love the university Its a university thats investing in athletics as well Beautiful facilities and they they care about building a winner Unbelievable facilities for that level of basketball I mean its just unbelievable cheering Musa Sier first bucket applause cheering starters are on the bench celebrating and with these bench guys you want to prove cheering to coach Wade that you deserve more playing time as well Youre playing for minutes right now Great job there Slips out of the ball screen And when youre a guard coming over music thats the type of defense I would give A little drive by swipe Thats the punishment you make for being late Got to get there early And thats what Liberty does to defenses A lot of times when you got shooters on the weak side theyre hugged up not able to help cheering Liberty in the bonus now Josh Smith four years at Stson was a medical red shirt last year Hes been pretty quiet so far in the early season but did kind of break out in Libertys last game against Copen State when he had 16 points and seven rebounds Coming off an ACL hes shaking shaking the rust off Theyre also missing what coach McKay called their Xfactor player Isaiah even the red shirt junior from Germany who was supposed to come back from injury and reagravated and continues to have knee problems which hes had for most of his career and it doesnt sound like hes coming back anytime soon No And thats why its so important for Josh Smith to kind of pick up that slack at 69 He brings the level of physicality that theyre going to need once they get into Conference USA play Hes coming off an ACL injury and it takes time I mean theres a mental hurdle and I think its always difficult I was fortunate enough when I came off an injury that it my year was in June So I had I got out of my brace You you never see a picture of me playing in a brace and that was massive because applause it is a cheering its really difficult no matter what the sport is to come in and play during games because you dont get a chance to control the movements anymore Now you have to defend a move and youre youre interreactionary which is so different than what youre doing your rehab Well how much of it is mental too Oh its it is mental Youre clear The doctors wont clear you until youre physically ready applause and you dont have time to do you know because youre so you rehab you start bracing yourself and understanding when youre cutting and then now when you get out here playing youre just reacting cheering Freshman Matt Abling for 11 points after the free throw in active hands again applause Scotty Ibubet senior made his first start of the season in NC States last game This is his first appearance here tonight Started that game in favor of Paul McNeel Jr Only played two minutes It was more of a message to McNeel Jr than anything else Rub knows when he comes in he knows what he is and he knows how hes supposed to play Hes going to rim run and be physical set screens roll hard He doesnt have a big role on this team but he knows his role and he does music it well And that was Will Wades way of of rewarding him for his effort Matt able to drive and he gets fouled 433 to go on the clock and not able guy You know we talked about obviously being a high recruit the top 25 in the ESPN 100 rankings And you know sometimes programs and coaches just know that this is a guy a body type a skill set whos going to come in and be an instant contributor And he has and and granted its you know through six weeks of this season and hes already had his ups and downs in terms of consistency but he seems like a very poised young man in terms of how he has handled a pretty big role on this team so far this year Hes a freshman thats going to be you come February He hes going to mature not just physically but but mentally and cheering be I think a potential double digit scoreer by the time they get in the ACC play because Will Way lets him go Hes aggressive I mean every time he touches it hes looking to score and he has a skill set in the game to back it up 13 points now for Matt Boys Decker starting to find a rhythm Just going to be too little too late as Decker the second player for Liberty in double figure scoring with 12 Arsenal backing down Decker Foul called One thing you got to learn how to do for Richie McKay you got to guard your yard Dont look for help Stay in front of the basketball Be physical Defend it without fouling music Decards battle here tonight but hes found himself against some bigger defenders here applause Fans behind us chanting We want Snell which is for Jordan Snell wearing number zero Well see if he comes into the game The womens basketball matchup on Sunday afternoon right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app India Navar leads number 12 North Carolinas balanced attack when they host Laura Seagler and number 22 Louisville Its at 4 Eastern Carmichael Arena Whistle on the free throw Well do it again on the lane violation music I think also to add to how impressive this performance is for NC State And again I am shocked and I think theres a lot of people out there thatll turn this game on and and be surprised to see NC State up by 40 Um and I would include the coaches in I dont think either coach expected a 40point difference in this game But applause when youre at this time of the year your student bodys going in finals and student bodies you know going home and every you dont get the normal crowd support that you usually get cheering And sometimes you got to create your own energy create your own support and NC States done that Its definitely been the upside down world for Liberty here in this game Every single statistical category that theyve done well this year has gone poorly in this game From shooting to turnovers to rebounds just nothing working for Liberty 7938 NC State on top The check cleared music and they executed it from the jump music It was tied six6 in the first couple minutes and ever since then NC State has taken off like a music rocket ship and theyre on top 7938 Safe to say they got their lick back I mean they had taken some shots losing three of their last five games and really struggling on the defensive end of the floor And I mean dominant performance here And and theyre going to need it because next up the Kansas JayHawks And aint no easy feat No not at all Andrew Carter on the turnover cheering NC State theyve got eight players with six or more points Theyve turned Liberty over 16 times maybe 17 times in this game when Liberty was averaging just over eight turnovers a game coming into this one Fans got their wish during the timeout as Jordan Snell checked into the game as well as Colt Langon red shirt freshman whos got the ball now Lefty little fade away thought he had a shot early and he turned it down and just getting into the game and youll see the guys on the bench telling them next time let it go shot for there it is you see Im telling let it go man he is entertaining to watch both on and off the court a cheerleader over there on the bench such a positive ides way says he never stopped talking and you dont mind it because most of its positive Hes always encouraging guys and motivating his teammates See hes the life of the party He enjoys playing the game and hes one of those guys you wont talk about it but his size and his skill set and what hes doing offensively now and there a cheering bright future and a chance to earn a lot of money playing this game I mean the next level is always looking for three and D cheering guys Yeah youre talking about a young man who can is a switchable defender a willing defender a communicator shooting over 50 from three lane long 66 220 out of those long arms mismatch on the outside You can see why you know Syracuse recruited him and we talked about a little bit earlier kind of a defensive minded recruit but that a lot has to do with the body type and just kind of lends itself to that and really blossoming on the offensive end the last couple years Sometimes you just got to find the right fit and this fit for him was put him at point guard If hes playing point guard no one ever thought that part of his game Now hes playing the position as well as anybody in his size I mean hes talking about a hes a really big point guard Hes not your prototypical traditional point guard and thats six but hes really heady high IQ and a selfish player 11 points seven rebounds seven assists Claudier Copelands line tonight What it does for NC State is it takes the pressure off Whether its JORDAN SNELL the fans were chanting for him He comes in and drains the three And whos happier than Guadir Cop student body got their wish They had been calling for him to get in the game And cheering he comes in at no hesitation and lines one up from behind the threepoint line And now diving on the floor Cant go under the screen on me You know shoot Look at the bench Its one thing I was concerned about that you know worried about the net and winning games by a certain number that we wouldnt see a lot of walks in games You know its still great that programs and coaches still do that regardless of the score Xander Yates the THREE recently engaged His fiance Lexi Crosscourt pass now to London Air mailed that one right into the arms of Jerry Deng Ibu blocked from behind cheering Under a minute to go under too A lot of this student section thats stuck around this entire game baseline cut to Sorenson freshman from Virginia number three So NC State will take some momentum into their game against Kansas on Saturday Should be a fun game Great matchup Jerry Dang Dang Jerry applause Thats what he does at his size cheering 69 transfer from Florida State cheering Final 10 seconds cheering NC States most complete performance of the season a 40point win at home against the projected top team in Conference USA You come in struggling and you challenge a team They answered that challenge here tonight defensively
