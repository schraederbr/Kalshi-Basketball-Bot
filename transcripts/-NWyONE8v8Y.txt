Home White Tonight James Scott Eon Reed with Roger SS on the whistle tonight with Bill cumington Jr and Clarence Armstrong and the deacons and heres the Louisville Transfer the other guard in the game if you will and Tyler Johnson and Tyler Johnson with eight points eight assists five rebounds against Duke last time out its really become the lead guard for the Demon Deacons even though he doesnt score big he makes plays Salis underneath had it raped out of there by Edwards and heres the Phil with the turnover and a lead for Applause Hatley Pat Kelce likes to run they havent run as much because of the two guys being out but thats what he likes to do if he can get it out off of especially when he gets the basketball in the hands of Tucky heurn whos the best in the league and assisting finding his teammates Captain Reed the jump hook in retire as a guy Cory that I think should be doing more weed I think hes got some tremendous inside game and move he just doesnt ever seem to put it together coach and the reason is hes always in Bou trouble I walked across the court pregame and told him stay out of foul trouble tonight stay on the floor so we can see what you can actually do yeah you cant score from the bench second chance for the cards as Edwards kept it alive against Trayvon Spillers Baseline here goes Hadley double team there with hilberth and Spillers back to Edwards former Sun Bel player of the year had it BL blocked by Spillers and here goes Cam hildr hes a little bit of a utility knife for Steve Forbes isnt he he absolutely is does it all has been much more of an aggressive Factor on the offensive end of the Flor this year didnt have his best game against Duke last time out but looking forward to a big road contest here tonight Edwards Works off a screen heres Scott at the top his offensive game is really evolved here for Louisville you want to talk about High P Kel said hes his favorite player that hes coached in 20 plus years theres Scott off the heurn LA for the D he sees the whole Court he knows what hes doing hes very efficient he can score but he can also really pass and Coach talk about the fact that its almost as though Chucky H run was unlocked you see him come up with the steal and getting his team out in transition Hadley to the basket rebounded by Reed wake trying to create an advantage going back the other way Salis will pull up three over his buddy is good you can imagine those two guys have done that in the gym just the two of them before going oneone kind of like Jimmy and Buddy back in the day right coach fourth grade these guys were playing against each other holy man they know each other y heres rain Smith Hadley and quickly back to he against Applause Johnson tend to shoot and heres the dangerous Smith where has this got been on fire double team H with them knock it away Smith keeps it three to shoot shoot it heres Hadley a three and Reed the rebound you can see how important this game is early for both these teams diving on the floor getting after the effort has been here Chucky heurn taking the basketball away from his childhood friend to kick ahead however spillers coming in denying the opportunity at The Rim which turns into the old 101 matchup between the two friends Hunter Sol is winning on the second possession and both these guys are both these teams physical teams theyre going after each other theres nothing easy out there tonight PE on the back door Scott and Applause one thats a really creative pass to see that thing get that ball in that position had to be a perfect pass and it was but we watched the cards work on this and round earlier so much to where coach Kelsey told Scott go sit down let Frank come in and catch the alive I dont want you jumping right now we want to save it until game time just a 45 free throw shooter though is Scott hes got four The Ville back in front on two field goals from James Scott and theres the fourth turnover by W Morris and we havent played four minutes yet but a former Deacon assistant now in his opening season at Louisvilles got to like his defense so far Pat kelse well not only but you know again hes been a little sick a little under the weather the flus been bothering him and you know when you dont practice or youre not full strength yeah it it can go two ways sometimes you can overcome and have a big game and sometimes you just make some youre talking about HTH of course right coach WD Pat Kelsey an absolute Home Run for the Louisville at Department to be able to bring in here the exact personality they needed in todays climate to be successful here which has been a tradition Rich program heres Edwards out front shot clock winding down theres a three it spends out Salis the rebound and Johnson the other way for the deacons Salis working out front now into traffic and a travels going to be called so thatll get us to a timeout just better than four minute is in him right now and that happens especially the first seven eight minutes of the game hes hes theyre glue itll take a while but hes the kind of guy he might go 8 minutes and get two shots there and make them both thats what he can do all right youve had a few guys in your career who could really gun it do you have to almost coach yourself as the guy at the bench to say okay it may take a while tonight we just have to be steady with it right just got to keep looking for theyre going to try the zone now this is interesting Again Louisville worked against this hard today and did a lot of I thought really good things this is one of them and it misfired but it was wide open the back door lob as you can see the cars prepared and again thats always one way to beat the 131 is when you got a guy that can climb the elevator on the back side give him an opportunity because that back man always has to be aware hild in the lane left it short cards out of there with it heres Smith on Q Edwards tried to peek or no Kai Roose coming game wearing number nine for the cards theres Javon Hadley with Terrence Edwards rign Smith on the floor so Scott has come off for Coach Kelce after the under 16 timeout and heres heern and thats working against Juke Harris inside and Roose is going to draw the foul young man from Washington averaging about 14 minutes a game for the cards Kai Roose now you got to clarify that when you say Washington you got to add the District of Columbia on the end you got to say DC theres a St to Washington but canar R coming from the DMV AKA DC attacking the basket showing off his athleticism W wheres Cory from I forgot I for I am from Virginia up two down state of Virginia Little Giant ath just like the state of Kentucky Kai Ruth misses the front of the two anytime Jim its metropolitan DC Virginia Nova it doesnt matter all the same yeah and Ive got to ask a question did you tell us earlier that my favorite beheim is from Kentucky probably Ive tried to bre kind of get that out of my wife my its hard but I think most of its gone on the drive is hild the fall away he just doesnt look right he just doesnt look like hes been practicing playing the flu is a bad thing to have it just makes you get legs tired and it just he just doesnt look the same and it doesnt help you take tough shots especially when youre not in Rhythm that was a tough shot for cam H Spillers trying to help off the switch leaves Hadley alone oh boy Harris almost got a piece of it now five to shoot Edwards a step back three too strong Salis off the back side W for has to be fortunate right now with the turnovers to only be down one early that defense is absolutely standing up to the test right now Steve Forbes has to be in a good spot right you consider the way they turned the basketball over but still being Striking Distance here is Harris freshman from Salsbury that got partially blocked I think heres heurn a lead for Hadley skipping to the corner Roose the lose a three from there Kai Rose 10 three of the year its heurn pushing it ahead again too what Chucky heper terrific and looking ahead here Cory he absolutely has been all season long d Distributing the basketball finding his teammates he gets the hockey assist as Kai knocks down the corner three Music Applause well Steve Forbes now in his fifth season in Winston Salem you see the 86 wins two and two against Louisville hes got 216 in 10 Seasons at the division one level hes done a terrific job theyre three and one on the road in the ACC they won six of seven and 8 of 10 but as we said at the top they need a quad one Marquee win to kind of jump start them into February and unfortunately for the way the ACC is right now there arent a tremendous amount of opportunities so a very important game for the Demon Deacons on the road Hadley blocked by Salis what a rejection but how about Hunter Sal not only the block Tak away the three but Chucky hler continues to have 2015 Vision on the floor better than 2020 right now dro the down four for Hadley the lead is six and Salis from Deep hes been there for him when theyve needed buckets this year hes been there and thats really the thing that he hasnt done well this year coach he hadnt shot the three extremely well but I think its something about playing against Chucky hebburn thats brought out his threepoint prow stole it couldnt hang on to it but Salis at both ends Cory denying the opportunity at The Rim the big time block Applause but Tucky heern finding his teammates continues to drop dimes as he finds Hadley under the basket heurn already four assists on the five Louisville baskets thats just another turnover too for Wake yep so rain Smith will put it in play abubacar tror Kadir into the lineup senior from the Ivory Coast and transfer from Long Beach State he wears 25 in the far right corner for the Ville screen for heper and a Applause three 373 of the year for heis an unbelievable execution by Pat Kelsey Squad to get he the exact look they wanted he and Salis got tangled up and its going to cost heon his first itll be the first on Louisville and that last play is Ryan Smith theyre just dogging him but hes looking for somebody open when you play one guy that tough with help all the time somebodys going to be open hes smart hes just waiting hes getting that guy the ball hell get his shots but he knows theyre not there right now Hilder to put it in play Parker Frederickson whos really struggled shooting this year its checked into the lineup now for wus with Harris hrth and Reed and theres a kick by Kadir trayor trayor and it will stay with Wake Forest with 20 to shoot and of course you got Chucky Hein and Hunter Salis there pocket to pocket not only buddies from Omaha but having terrific Seasons all ACC Seasons this year yeah you see in three of those six categories right there these two guys leading the lead oh trayor how about the rejection of the drive there well Trey Ori missed 10 games earlier this year with a fracture in his arm but it couldnt have been the right arm because I tell you what that one looks extremely healthy as he denies that opportunity sending it out of bounds and clearly no problem with the legs heres Salas a three out front again nine for Salas nine of the 11 hes keeping them in the game all by himself and he wants the rock Cory and hes only shooting 33 from three in ACC play 295 on the year WD and that was a tough one thats when you know youre feeling good first two are open that from one guys in that game my oakill team played against Hunter Alis I know all about that group they destroyed us in Nebraska Cory took a road loss come on Jim I wasnt there on the bench yeah thats it I knew be there KN my record was different when I was there coach blocked heres Salis and wake trailing three and Hunter Salis off to a terrific start in traffic and had it stripped out of there by Scott Spillers cleans up Frederickson a three boy its been a hard Road for Frederickson now 12 of 63 from behind the line and one of his last nine and ker trayor on the board another transition basket they they dont run all the time but theyre looking but its not difficult to play with a guy like sucky hler you know you run the floor hes going to find you yes he is five assists already for Applause Music he comes in averaging 6 and a half eight in conference play Spillers a three in a back rim Applause miss heer kick to the corner for Terrence Edwards a step back three over HRI Okay so contrary to popular belief I was a high assist guy and thats very contrary to facts fact just just just quick resume I broke the record oill and I broke the Freshman record at University of Virginia those are still still stand however when youre a high assist guy you dont want to see a guy take a step back like Edwards did on last possession when you throw it to him just shoot the first one if youre a high assist guy rolled off off the back room for hildr heres trayor and its going to be three on three Edwards skip back for heper Chucky working against Reed here hes got the mismatch got to get to the basket and he does and dumps it back now Smith from the front that is a great shoot he goes almost 12 minutes so a little over 12 gets one shot and makes it thats hard to do lead is eight for the cards Salis tries to answer here goes Smith again back for heern and a foul off the ball I believe on hildr but when youre confident like R Smith you know youre shooting this basketball as soon as it touches your hands and we watched him in practice earlier today and its almost as though when he shoots the basketball ball no one even looks to see if its going in because they all know its going in and Wes can we have a fact check on Corys statistics 44 assist coach as a freshman its still a Virginia record 44 no one I mean thats cuz they only scored 40 a game theres a three out out of the corner by Edwards but thats thats the shot you want Edward to take and comparison to trying to go off the dribble were going to we just going to ignore the sh that Im getting from the Hall of Famer on my right Tyler Johnson trying to get wake back on the board theyre down 11 the numbers been doubled T to shoot heres Frederickson bounce pass stolen Hadley into the front Court backing down Frederickson and lost it now heres Edwards a three time out its an 11 nothing and theyre playing smart theyre making shots and what did Pat Kelsey tell us earlier today I dont care what you doing the offensive end the floor as long as you play hard defensively thats his main concern Johnson of back rim Miss tapped around heres Hadley in the Ville on the run again tror through traffic and a foul will be called on Spillers theyre just getting up the court coach this is my first time seeing Louisville live this year and with Coach Kelsey told us that theyve slowed it down a little bit if this is slower oh my goodness he did say that but they had not slowed it tonight and its nice to see the Lou Louisville fans back in it here you know obviously they had a couple down years and to see them come back here this is a really good basketball City I always like to come here uh the crown are great theyre knowledgeable you know theyre not booing the old the old coach you know they theyre cheering for their team but its a really good place to play we got a great referee and crew you do on an off night Tuesday night youre going to get a good crew because there are as many games so the better officials are going to be working and we got a final four type crew in here tonight absolutely Roger airs the best of the best in the business Clarence Armstrong Bill Covington great group here this evening 261 theres a l for Fon Reed and back door cut Spillers in one great recognition by Fon Reed seeing the double team and more importantly Spillers cutting to the basket A much needed bucket for the Demon Deacons someone outside of Hunter sales getting into the scoring col that was a much needed basket and one thing you know Cory in the first half when youre on a really good home court the defense is up up up theyre going to wear down a little bit youre not going to get that same defense the whole game so you just got to try to stay in it now just get within 10 which very you can easily do first first points by the way for Spillers who had just nine in Saturdays lost to Duke heres a Ste Tyler Johnson will take it down he lost it on the way up and that couldnt have happened to anyone worse that Tyler Johns who left this program to find his way to W force and of course the crowd here on their feet to see one of their former players miss you on the F see that he was going to be good but the way that he has been unlocked in Pat Kels system yep I didnt know he was going to be this good he is a first team all age to see performer right now sure is in the zone again its not a bad idea 15 to shoot for Edwards and heres Kai Roose back on the floor Edwards thought about it with eight to shoot and Spillers now five to shoot and Edwards is winding down hell just launch and hit nine for Edwards on three threes awful offense a three and Spillers is hurt and down at half Court y Trayvon Spillers and I think this may be on the back end of the Edwards three well we saw a couple of guys go to the ground be entering the SE watch the feet of Spillers as he goes out to contest the shot turns that left ankle and thats a dangerous play I mean honestly you didnt protect the shooter on that one yeah its really be shooting a free throw in that situation Mark armor the weake trainer very quickly to Trayvon Spillers heres Fon Reed inside the catching score Roose goes down second field goal for Reed well this was going to be a full contact game tonight now oh yeah it absolutely is in WD I watched the Demon Deacons early this year at Greensboro Coliseum get down big like this against Michigan to only come back and win that game so dont count Steve for in his group out of this one Edwards we through traffic now hes got 11 in the first half not supposed to drive through the Zone like that heres Music Salis still a 15point Louisville lead quickly left side three ball from the left is Off the Mark and thats Gavin Cosby who came in to replace Spillers a moment ago heres a lead for Hadley Heen tees a three and Reed pulls it away without Spillers a smaller lineup on the floor for Steve for theyre going to have to take advantage of their ability to drive the basketball and great opportunities for each other absolutely right PA third foul on Louisville first on Terrence Edwards Jr when the fans boo you know its a good Applause call so wake will have it on the Baseline with salz by the way trayon went back toward the Wake locker room a moment ago with Mark armor their trainer here goes Cosby Baseline out front HRI trying to weave back through and scores on the scoop he got through finally first points for cam hildr Louisville wasting no time pressuring the deakes again with the basketball out of the corner Hadley Scott kept it alive thats the last thing you can afford playing against a team like Louisville is to give them multiple opportunities and the rebound for Fon Reed theyre cheating so much to rain Smith that theyre leaving whoever else is there open it worked right that last couple times look at Salis fight through tra and now heer and that is a block on HRI thatll be his first and the sixth foul on Way Forest difficult spot to try to take a charge Chucky heer trying to go around a Defender so Edwards is out trayor has come back in well Pat Kelce said today Chucky he plays 38 minutes and I believe in yeah well I mean again its hard to take him off the floor missed three by Hadley heres Cosby the Alabama transfer into the front Court especially with no cor and Johnson he would be the backup for Chucky heurn and really was the sixth man for this Louisville Squad with him out injured Cosby missing front rim on a three got make shots when you go on the road they cannot make shots they stop wait four times and they havent made a shot to close it Applause from Steve Forbes cant be happy with any phase of this first nearly 16 minutes well Im sure hes watched Chucky heurn pick teams apart with his passing but its completely different to see it on film than to watch it live and the passes that hes making there arent extremely difficult passes but you love the way that his teammates get in the right spots and make themselves available to him to give him those passing Applause Lanes as heer gets a break now you see Edwards going to the point guard position we talked about part of the reason why he play so many minutes Smith a rare threepoint miss here lately kept alive though on a deflection and fired into the corner for Edwards through a double team and scores on a leer 13 for Terrence edin lead is 17 now for the Cardinals and that got deflected up in the air and heres Scott Hadley and Edwards tried to needle it through traffic did and there is Smith hes not missing Applause he gets Rhythm shot he making 20point lead for Louisville Reed scores WD this place is starting to sound like a place that used to be my favorite venue y in the ACC to call games I can remember coming here when Louisville first stepped into the ACC and talking about how much I love coming here calling games because the educated crowd the fans and the energy in the building and its starting to feel just like that right now Pat cson doing a tremendous job with rebuilding this program in year one yep and that has allowed them to be able to build this 18point lead Chucky heer doesnt make many mistakes yep inside trayor how about that its the exact play they worked on shoot around today and they stopped it a little different when you play it for real but lets talk about wake fors defense this is a team that held Duke to its low lowest field goal percentage 36 of the season they theyve been Stout defensively all year long but when you look at what the cards are doing right now 516 from the field Reed went Baseline hard miss the dunk draws the foul its too many transition baskets their half court defense has been okay but their transition defenses where theyre giving up buckets trayor the foul so free throws coming for Fon Reed who own the year is 70 these are the first free throws of the night for the deacons and Reed had that bounce up dont forget we got an ACC Network triple Heather on Saturday we start at noon at chest Hill presented by food line Florida State BC at 2 and then at 400 Virginia Tech Virginia at jpj and then well finish it off with Stanfords visit to SMU right here on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app Reed got the back end WD where are you on that Trio of game I am at Virginia Tech Virginia oh the com well Clash yes sir I know all about it yeah Ill be in my living room watching too old to do too many games Smith a triple back rim Miss slapped out nice play by Scott Smith fires again oh he missed two in a row yeah and Salis the rebound inside two minutes to go out of the corner Johnson tried to dump it to Reed and did not turn it over got deflected through hell save it Cosby will fire that spins out Fon Reed inside cant finish they bang around theres hord left side Hadley and it gets knocked out of bounds I think Scott is going to be ticketed for over the back sophomore from fville North Carolina his first with many teams you would think that theyre getting threepoint happy because theyve made some however thats not the case for the cars they average 311 threepoint field goal attempts per game number one nationally so when you consider forgive me six ntion number one the ACC but when you consider theyre looking to let it fly from three in transition already 19 attempts here in the first half and unlike Pat Kelsey told us earlier no way theyre going to slow down and the other thing is they get to the free throw line as much as anybody in the league and theyre shooting on all those strings heres hild now with pepper feed Solace down the lane and the rebound pulled away by The Freshman roof yeah Hunter Sal earned that one so Bill cumington Jr has just put a technical foul on the Deacon star hunter Salis I think they missed it there I think he got a little bit on the elbow when he was going up and take a look maybe but even though they did miss it you see the contact from behind as a fourth year as a senior especially in this situation you have to understand theres no way you can put yourself in that predicament and give the cards easy points I understand his emotions got the best of them hes playing for you right there what do you do how do you handle that as a coach you know I talked to players a lot and I said look you can not get a tech Im going to take the technical Ill get up on that play I dont want you taking the tech I dont want you getting on the official cuz the some officials you know theyll theyll recognize that and they wont like it and if theyre mad at me its okay but they I dont want them to get mad at my players so I just really tried to keep players from taking techical we didnt take a lot working on a minute to play in this first tap heres ruths left side Hadley Smith hman L and they couldnt connect on the Hatley Live Again by the way Trayvon Spillers has come back in the ball game we saw him hobble off earlier good to see him back on the floor for Coach Forbes and the deacons they absolutely need him on the court he has been their best interior presence as well as one of their better Defenders theyve had all season long leader in rebounds and block shots heres the ab State transfer Trayvon spitt hard first half for Wake Forest deacons are right around 31 from the floor meanwhile Louisvilles at 47 with 7even threes and heres Salis back to work double team forced and thats going to get called reach my BR Frankie had him for two years hes a great kid yeah I told Pat Kelsey earlier today thanks for taking hes never been coached he was in Georgia for two years come on thats true he did he did play for my so he did get a little coaching there got Mike White coached him up now foul on Louisville heres their sixth so no free throws hriff working inside trying to Up and Under against heurn and rebounded off the fourth shot reminiscent of the way Pat Kelsey described hild earlier today stay down on all the pump fakes tremendous defense by CH peer standing his ground not allowing cam to bait him into a foul elsewhere in the ACC now hes a motivated high high octane coach heer at the horn sure you bet you hes having a great year whos better in the league hes having a first team all ACC earlier and he talked about no ones talking about Louisvilles defense and thats the reason why W for us is struggling is because of what the cards are doing defensively and again when you look at the way that theyve attacked this game you see why and of course P Kelsey taking advantage of the week off has got these guys playing with tremendous energy here tonight Tyler Johnson cam hildr Trayvon Spillers Hunter Salis with the ball and Fon Reed thats the floor for Steve Forbes and w Forest original stars are out there for Louisville as well Spillers went to work Edwards rejected it Spillers saves it eight to shoot for Salis and a front rim Miss on a three and a stick back for Trayvon spitt just a allout hustle play and they need a few of those right now this start second half you cant wait you got to go right now its a long road back remember Cory you talked about that Michigan deficit in Greensboro theres Hadley off a pass from heon and it rolls out and thats the only guy they really havent been able to get going offensively Hadley struggling from the field throughout this game two of nine for him outside of that everyone else has gotten in the Rhythm Johnson thought about it hard drive to the Baseline offensive fou Tyler Johnson Battle of point guards isnt a battle tonight but its the difference between having a senior with tremendous experience in comparison to a sophomore who really was just inserted into the starting lineup Tyler Johnson still trying to find his way for Steve fors while Chucky heern has true command of this team for the C Chucky heer made his 100th by the way and 24th career start tonight theres a stopage of play accident Hadley inadvertently across the bridge of the nose you see hris just coming out swiping at the basketball but getting a bit of Hadleys face in the process cam H is a nice guy though WD cuz when he went down with the basket Im trying to get the basketball we down 22 at this point yeah give me that I can get his fast break going 12 to shoot Hadley okay heres heon to work again GRE Smith had a couple threes in the opening frame he with three to shoot two to shoot one to shoot and at the horn it would have been good bounds away off the rim Applause Salis on the drive and going to get a reach I think on Louisville and its on H itll be two on Omahas Chucky hman number one on Louisville in this second half of play so Tyler Johnsons going to go to the Baseline to put it in play trying to get it to Salis does again its Edwards hard drive into traffic Salis cant buy one slapped around by Scott wake recovers Johnson a three nope and heres Hadley and Louis and you can only imagine Tyler Johnson wanting for this to go his way so well it hasnt been that case for him this evening maybe a little rust on that three after the offensive rebound its its tough to come back when youve been you know you want to play so bad here three by Edwards Edward I dont know that weve talked enough about him 16 points now for Edwards of course the Sun Belt Player of the Year season ago at James Madison and has not missed a beat here coming to Louisville as much as you want to talk about Louisvilles offense its their defense that just is there for him every play Johnson a hard shot in traffic Scott clears the rebound Music remember now Scott is just a sophomore too Cory here is Hadley little Runner with one hand and a tap follow wont go Salis finally comes away with it Im really impressed with just James Scott all the way from rim to rim here youre not as impressed as Pat Kelsey is look at this but watch this this is a lob he sees hes not going to get it he deflects it to Edwards who then knocks down the three but Pat Kelce talked about his i q he told us after this game tonight tomorrow morning he and his staff will have text messages from James Scott talking about the next matchup what he has to do to get better next time out and hes in the gym so much that they lock the door and make him go home and you never hear of that that means hes in the gym 68 hours no wait a minute you may never hear that buddy bahim was in the gym like that hes got one in his house he didnt have good coaching so he had to be in the hes got in his house let me step in here Fon Reeds just been whistled for a technical foul by Bill comington Jr so Reed has his second personal second team foul but you cant R Smith hits the free throw you cant do that youre talking about two seniors you cant do that in a scenario when your team is already down such a huge margin you cant continue to give away points yeah oh so Fon Reed whatever he had in paring awarding the ball to Bill cumington earned him a technical foul and a point for the bill and heres Salis in traffic knocking down the jump shot 11 for Hunter Salis whos got 10 games of 20 or more but look at Chucky heurn pushing the tempo on the other end look at that the young man from tmania has delivered tonight hes got nine now on 33 and a foul on Edwards who thought he had a pick third on Louisville dont say anything because after calling two Ts on Wake theyre not going to listen to anything from somebody from Louisville Im getting nervous for you over here I know it cuz you will get one over here it be the first time ever a coach got a technical foul broadcasting a game Id like one he nice heres Sal a Miss Reed and a whistle and foul on Louisville and Clarence Armstrong with a word of caution for Fon Reed after the foul on hatler this is a really good officiating crew tremendous experience final fours theyre going to keep control of the game yep and the ball will go to the Applause Baseline and Hunter Salis will put in play and now we get a foul off the ball I believe Hatley thatll be second on jabon Hatley and the fifth quickly on Louisville here in the second half who only had six in the first 20 minutes in fact tells be wondering is this a flop theres contact there but thats what you know Reed needs to play like that getting there yes turn around and dunk it on somebody thats good Kay Roose on the floor with Hatley now heres Smith off the screen and Bill Covingtons going to call the foul I think on Jaden Harris and theyre going to go look at this theyre going to look at this heres a dunk by Reed into traffic willll step aside theyre going to go to the monitor here on the play at the other end when we get har go to the right side of your screen here youre going to see Harris kind of hooked Edwards on the screen and after review this crew left it as a common foul on Harris so itll be his third and the third on the demon deons hes kind of in the head area with the hook so I dont know I think they I dont think they were under 100 certain on the call well Roger SS came over and asked you what you thought yeah and you didnt say any of that you didnt say anything said none of that I said he hooked him on his head you said on TV but you didnt say that when yes I did I I know that you absolutely have said more than you need to good wake up Smith out of the corner and hes back to work this guy can shoot he can shoot and hes Applause smart 29 is the difference with 15 and 1 half to play but its all about the field goal shooting its all about the turnovers the energy the effort points the Louisville Cardinals have won every aspect of the game does that re know that theyre behind 27 points I I dont know but pointing to the crowd not doing anything for you coach not for me yeah and thats going to be an offensive foul on Edwards Terrence Edwards has his third thats six now on the cards here in half two but thats an easy call watch the right arm as you expect end it its going to be an offensive foul not a lot of contact but to extend that arm looking for to make contact all you have to do is go down as a Defender and when you look at the two technicals that Wake Forest got he did almost the same thing he looked at the ref and said something so that would have been a good place for another technical 5 minutes into the second half a double team on Reed and here is Salis with nine to shoot off the read screen hard dve and on Anam eBay thats some frustration and that is the second technical foul Hunter Salis is now ejected from the game technical foul on Hunter sales but this is why you cant get the first one coach yeah the first one when you respond to not getting a call the emotion after the dunk frustration coming out and any celebration in the area of an opposing player is going to be taunting I dont agree with that he went one hand thats I mean come on if he had turned around and run back and done it it wouldnt have been a technical foul but when youre looking at the opposing player I I know the rule I know the rule its taunting regardless y yeah when you look at an opposing player any type of Celebration toward an opposing player is going to be taunting its going to be a technical foul by the letter of the law thats the right call and the game has been running hot but thats why you cant get the first technical foul I agree heer heres Hadley on the drive and cant score but draws the foul on Reed theyre going to call a lot of fouls for the next 14 minutes its on Wake Forest keep under control three on Fon Reed and I hate that Hunter Salis had to be ejected from the game but we talked about in the first half when he did not get the call the exaggerated response as Cameron hild now having to be walked off the court so Hill is coming out of the game Tyler Johnson andris going to go straight to the locker room as well straight to the lock we knew he wasnt feeling well coming into this game yep and now youre playing without two best players Cameron hilden Hunter Silas your two best players both guys have a 30point game under their belt this season one of two ACC teams that has two players with 30point gains the other one happens to be wearing the dirty Bowl uniforms right now the gray the cards have two guys have gone over 30 this season as well well and Louisville has played the defensive kind of game tonight Jim youre going to win big again y theyve been good theyve been all over them another third over and W Forest that is 12 turnovers tonight for the deacons just four for the cards 6 minutes into this second half its a 29point lead for Louisville Scott had it batted Away by Reed recovers tend to shoot trayor out of the corner heper and Hadley for Smith and a front round Miss will bring a whistle and a foul called and its going to be on Juke Harris haris thats his thats his fourth with 1340 to play and six now on Wake Forest so no Salis no hildr at the moment Duke Harris with four fouls jke Harris led the demon Deens are scoring against the Blue Devils on Saturday where does wake fors get their offense from to try to mount this comeback Mi week inside heres heurn lowered the boom reed every bit The Challenge and blocked it away and the deons got to find somebody if they want to even think about crawling back into it who hit shots Cosby knocks down a three Cosby his 25th of the year is his first bucket of the night and Dav M Cosby who really hasnt been in the rotation as of late going to get more of an opportunity now an opportunity to find a rhythm make some shots well he didnt play against Duke in only one minute against Carolina last week Cory 6034 heurn against Johnson Chucky into traffic willll draw the Tyler foul itll be his second and a couple of free throws coming for the senior transfer from Wisconsin Chucky Applause heer this is a this is an opportunity for all the other guys theyre not going to be able to come back and win this game but they need to show that they can pick up some slack make some plays and show what they can do without their two guys first shot for heer no good dont forget weekdays in four right here on acc Network in the ESPN app ACC PM with Mark Packer chronicling the events of the ACC with guon Moore hes got nine in the game now as he hit the back end the two shot try heer actually going to get a rest plays about 38 minutes a game now Pat Kelce can rarely afford to take him off the court but with a 27point lead feels like he can give him a little bit of a blow right now yep in traffic R Smith and Tyler Johnson on the hell ball thatll stay with the deacons theres just too much of this now theyre just we got to calm these guys down theres a good Hustle play they tied it up and lets keep Applause playing well we had a lot of activity going in the first 7 and 12 minutes of this second half theres still a long ways to go you dont want to keep this yeah Applause escalating well until your point we got a veteran crew its been to a lot of big stages in the game and theyve tried to keep the volume down as much as possible theyre trying to so Johnson will put it in play on the Baseline here and the inbound for Cosby a step back and a long three thats finally hauled in by Edwards but if youre Cosby you got to take the right steel and Johnson will measure for the dunk well at least he kep held on to it that time yeah well he went the safer two foot route this time first basket for Tyler Johnson who started his college career here at Louisville a year ago for the Cardinals theres trayor tried to hit Scott with the scoop and threw it through the hands and thats a rare turnover for Louisville in the half court when Chucky H burs out of the game they are a little different team they do not get into the plays they dont get their shots and they make a turnover hes not in the game they really dont have a point guard these guys are not point guards he is so valuable for this team heres Cosby he would play 40 minutes if he were playing for you R coach 100 100 hed never come off the floor never no no if he had four fouls hed be hiding in his Zone someplace and be saying dont foul Edwards for Hadley I wondered if beim was having a little bit of a flashback tonight though Cory because Chucky he and Rain Smith out there handling the rock mhm man he had some combos with the orange who can put all that together and then some thats the only way you coach for a long time you know is have good players and especially good guards how about Pat Kelsey coming over saying we got Jim bam in the gym today coach Kelsey was excited to see you he wasnt born when I started coaching you know what the heck Steve forb was in fourth grade when we won the national Applause champan a bubacar trayor feed Scott for the dun Applause nice St Forbes is over there thinking Cory how can I get out of here well let me ask you this for you 47 years Im sure you had games like this of both ways yeah if youre Steve Forbes right now what is it that youre looking to get from your team you know you you just try to finish the best you can its its not going to be pretty but you got to do the best you can finish and theres a ball that got inadvertently kicked thats going to get us to a timeout Louisville on the way to their ninth Conference win here potentially and theyve gotten it from everybody mostly dunks from James Scott and the wins that theyve gotten when theyve had to travel east across country they could absolutely being the mix Maxine R know truly the competition as well as Chucky heurn from what Ive seen tonight yeah flag as the ACC player of the year I going tell you now the midseason all ACC team is a really interesting piece of project well theres one guy on the team thats for sure and everybody else is pretty good flagging right now absolutely on team yes and I I got to say Chucky heer Chucky he be3 the way hes playing the the point guard position a School record 16 assists against SMU and again when you think about the tradition of this place Payton SAA on the bench you talking about the point guards who have played for the cards the first to ever have 16 dimes yeah 17 to shoot on a reset of an offensive rebound by the cards and they know who to give the ball to Louis when they get it they get it to Chuck H heres Hatley out of a double team flips it for Kai Ruth and Tyler Johnson finally battles the rebound from had Parker fredericksons going to have to get some important minutes here boy wake would like him to start shooting the ball a little better turnover by freericks sophomore out of Oklahoma has really struggled and there is Payton CA point guard extraordinaire won a national championship here I dont care if the banners up or not he won a national championship I watched the game won a national championship along with my guy Luke Hancock yep and who better to be able to Mentor guys like Chucky heurn here for the cars Edwards at three front rim Miss knocked out of bounds its going to stay with the cards with 845 Applause today you see the difference in the ball game we showed you the graphic a moment ago it has been a long time since Louisvilles won ACC games by this margin in consecutive Affairs you see Chucky he 16 of them at SMU last week eight tonight by the way with that effort at SMU he took the lead in the ACC assist from Nate George of George Tech and he doesnt look like hes going to give it back no not the way that theyre playing right now and the confidence that his teammates are shooting the basketball with knowing hes going to get them the ball Harris fouled down the lane by Ruth The Freshman from DC thats the seventh by the way on the cards with 824 to go and the First on Kai Ruth so Juke Carris who scored 2000 points and twice was the 5A state champ at ThunderRidge High School in North Carolina will go to the line hes had three double figure games in the last seven four have come against uh the ACC you mentioned the 14 points against Duke the other day promising young player for Steve Forbes part of the future for the Demon Deacons and I would not be surprised if we see him in the starting lineup relatively soon after this performance tonight there may be a shake up from Steve Forbes moving forward you see the average compared to his effort the other day against the number two blue dou 26point Advantage for the cards who are trying to get to 16 and5 and 9 and one in the Applause ACC theres Roose a catch in the Applause corner and the shot too strong here is Johnson back the other way lob and a dump on the back end from Juke Harris too little and a reach in foul on Tyler Johnson in the midcourt area so Wake Forest still playing hard despite the differential Tyler Johnson to Juke Harris Louisville still up big here second Applause half were in the real joke were in this building I would not be I understand all right so we started tonight showing you that these are two of the top four Jim my question is certainly you feel good about Louisville theyve already played Duke theyve already played Clemson uh theyve already played Carolina theyve already played SMU right you know theyre theyre good Clemsons good its the next four teams are going to be battling it out to see if we can get another one or two ACC teams in Pittsburgh got the best on conference and thats going to help them if they can stay in that hunt by the way Tar Heels and Panthers tonight at the Pak over on ESPN coming up about 900 or so big game yeah car Carolina always has the two games with Duke you know if you can win those or win at least one of them it it changes your but as you look at the net this is the concerning part for the Demon Deacons right now even with a 72 which will end up being a 73 record in ACC play its going to come down to who did you beat in action honestly felt like coming in after the nonconference its going to take about 15 wins for many teams that didnt have great nonc conferences to get it at large bid into the tournament but you still have to beat some of the high Lev teams theres a turnover by heer Rare giveaway and Frederickson back the other way for the deakes under seven we go I want to add something to that thought in just a moment Cory here johnon well I I would say this so the four teams that get the double buy and we talked about it heres Tylers long three and Spillers will give wake a second chance and Frederickson obliges with a triple so if Im one of the four double buys how secure am I in Charlotte not at all because if youre W for us and youre one of those double buys but you dont have a win against mble you dont have a win against North Carolina you dont have a win well they do they did beat Carolina Carolina but if you dont have a win against Duke Im not sure you can be very comfortable at all youre going to have to win a couple games in Charlotte to make yourself feel better because those will be high qu CH what a scoop by he well the other thing with that is is the overall net is going to hurt everybody in the league the early start that everybody had that is going to reflect at the end of the year yeah but I think Corys point about 15 wins in the league is really well made here because I think there needs to be a note about where you are when the regular season finishes in terms of conference Play heres a little circus shot from heern this guys done everything tonight he absolutely has and not only has he done everything tonight hes done everything this season for the cards now if Im Pat Kel and they continue winning at this rate now this will be nine straight wins for them they continue winning at this rate Im comfortable as the second third seed in Charlotte because of what theyve done but its not just about what theyve done in conference play you got to think about they beat Indiana they went to the you know championship game in Bahamas lost to Oklahoma team but theyve got they had a pretty good nonconference schedule took a tough loss to Old Miss after the injuries but with a higher net ranking they can have more of a comfort level but they still going to need about 15 ACC wins yeah third on Scott by the way thatll put Reed on the line to shoot some free throws I I think the league discussion is really going to interesting by the way Wake Forest not only do they have pit this weekend in Winston Salem then they go to the West Coast then they come back and play Florida State then they go to Dallas for the only meeting of the year with SMU and like this one tonight Jim that feels like thats going to be a big game for both schools was therere one of the two or three teams that got that all three long trips SMU both California and they went to Florida Miami and Syracuse and Syracuse they theyve had a whenever you have an unbalanced schedule youre going to have some of those things happen 22point lead for the cards back after Music this and we came in talking about how important of a game this was for Wake force in particular an opportunity for them to get a quad one win on the road and theyre coming in winning their last three on the road in ACC play and absolutely blitzed at the beginning of this game by the Louisville Cardinals who have been firing on all cylinders all evening long and these games dont help you when you get blown out I mean its its one thing to lose in a t you know 68 point game and a tough place to play but when you get blown out its just not a good look for you David uh Jaden Harris Juke Harris fouls out of the ball game with five points at the 507 Mark and of course Hunter Salis was ejected with a second technical foul just under 15 to go in the second half cam hriff leaving to go to the locker room we havent seen him come back to the bench y but Ive got an even more pressing question about something missing today whats up where Pat his glasses well hes not wearing them and it was interesting they gave us a pair of glasses that they handed out to the fans that are replicas of Kelseys uhhuh and Pats not wearing his and I dont know as Edwards hits both free throws however Kobe Rogers and alifa Khalifa Ali Khalifa on the Louisville bench are wearing the promotional glasses here okay tonight and we need our glasses to see so were not wearing you say we are you speaking Im talking about two of us older guys Frei dont make fun of us older guys another three yeah May and I dont take the personal the comments personal about glasses but but you cant because you already know where Im going with you break my glasses mid break my glasses in mid game yes that did happen thank you for remembering uh rain Smith the ball in tend to shoot heres Scott by the way Kelseys glasses are in the neighborhood Ive been told can Ruths bad Miss of a three and heres frericks its a 21point game as we worked to four minutes to play and Wai for us just wants to try to play some good basketball down the stretch and get it to 14 15o game which they can well and one of the things we mentioned coach they got an important Showdown with the Panthers on Saturday so you dont want this negative in your mind going into that you want to try to find something positive down the stretch to be able to carry over into practice for the remainder of the week 100 ruths backing in on Spillers Kai got caught in the air and thats going to be the travel timeout here by the way look look right there there they are the glasses are on property tonight at the Louisville bench Applause not here not this time of the game he was just giving him a little sign on the top that is Louie by the way the Cardinal there the glasses by the wayal glasses so I mean theyre not only in the crowd theyre on the bench with Rogers and Khalifa and yet Pats Gone without the glasses tonight at the bench and his team is up by 21 frericks catch and shoot three and Reed the rebound Fon Reed by the Ways got his first double double of the Year tonight for the deacons there goes Tyler Johnson took the he foul and Chucky like he kind of jumped into me Im getting the foul third on heern yeah things have gone chck way tonight so Im not sure hes really going to spend much time complaining about that one he may actually get the opportunity to rest at the end of this game which is not something that he sees often they tried to take him out for a little bit but it wasnt pretty well and lets give the demon deons a little credit at one point it was close to 30 now a 19point game so you got to give them a little credit for continuing to fight throughout this one and find something positive to end the game without their two best players so if they could get it to 14 or 15 they they did what they could do rain Smith oh my that was long that would have been four points knocked out of bounds last Touch by the cards Louisville by the way has only one of their last eight from the floor and I believe thats something that gives P Kelsey an opportunity to go back after this game and talk to his team about hey guys great start but weve got to play better at the end coaches are always looking for something as a learning opportunity inside and heres he front Court Hadley and now Chucky with two and a half to goes going to walk the clock down pat Kelce gets an offensive set smart and Edwards with three to shoot step back on Reed Applause and the rebound Cosby had it lost it over the end line itll stay with the cards and here comes trayor and Kai Ruth into the ball game rain Smith and Javon Hadley take a seat the dangerous thing for me looking at Louisville Jim is you know heurn is going to stir the drink right but the guys that come with him very night to night I mean rain Smith crazy against SMU Javon Hadleys had big games James Scotts going to be a problem well Ed Edwards has been good I think hes hes going to score some points but if somebody can do a good job on Chucky heer thats when theyll have problem scoring cuz hes doing hes getting them into everything and hes a really good Defender yeah I I think the thing Im coming away with tonight is theyre a lot better defensively than I thought yeah and and I I believe theyve absolutely shown that and the numbers throughout this game will be a little bit misleading as W forus makes a 16point game but it has been about 25 the entire second half theres not going to be a timeout here this is only to Churchill abass into the ball game sophomore transfer from depal whos from the Ido state of neria he played two minutes the other day against Duke hes going to be in here for the final 97 seconds and Wake Forest has to be happy the way they play played the last 10 12 minutes without their two best players theyve kind of hung in there their defense has been pretty good and they made a couple offensive plays you dont want to get out of here with a 30point loss and theyre theyre not going to Andy coach we know about the 10point margin when it comes to how they judge games if W Forest is able to get this into that 10point range this loss will not look as bad on paper as it actually was pepper will try and add to the range he cannot and that ball got rolled around deacons finally collect heres Cosby leading Churchill AAS can not hang on to it he ends up in the end zone took out somebodys concession knocked over a cheerleader that was a chance to get it down to yeah could have been 14 with the easy two on that possession Applause amazing well coach Kelsey you know he doesnt want to take Chucky headb bur out no no he doesnt feel safe I mean think about it what was the largest lead WD in this game was 28 Applause Music 29 three ball spins out final 45 seconds now Applause another and heres Reed Tyler Johnson Cosby a three got it Davin Cosby knocks down his second three of the half they make their layup the last time its an 11point game they almost got it to Applause 10 and and with the largest lead being 29 for the cards in this second half to get it down to a 13point Music game it will absolutely look a lot closer than it was played here tonight well Louisville is going to add to the win streak fellas this is 10 straight and 11 of their last 12 and theyre going to go to 9 and one in the ACC and the cards are going to be 16 and5 overall coach Lake Forest got a lot to do to catch back up the CS are in a really good position right now theyre theyre good you can watch them play and theyre tournament team wakes got to prove it yet but I think Louisvilles proven the way they played these last 10 12 games 72 59 the finals sit tight were getting ready to send you to South B Indiana for Georgia teken Notre Dame but Cory Im nothing but impressed with what p
