so I have their back Ive got six seniors who are going to finish with me and thats been our Focus for the next six weeks whenever youre done having time at the beach and in Florida you can always come and help my guys Doug and Corey out I know Im ready Jordan cornette and I right perfect thats a perfect dude thanks so much guys I dont know did we say anything about Jordan cornette being able to join us well I didnt say anything about it but you know Im always welcoming my God JC especially when were here in South Bend absolutely weve got to get him in talking about blocked shots we are underway Louisville and Notre Dame so glad youre with us and we again would like to thank coach gray Class Act when theyre winning Class Act when theyre struggling absolutely and one of the best personalities that you will ever find for us is television personality should be able to deal with from the coaching standpoint and you gotta love Mike Ray and wishing the best for the remainder of this season and for whatevers next this is Marcus Hammond at the point the grad transfer from Niagara University who has taken over the starting point guard role now that hes fully healthy Cormac Ryan back to Hammond inside they go to lasheski Irish have not had a problem this year scoring what has been their overriding problem during League Play Corey the problem is they do not get to the free throw line you see on the first possession everything is on the perimeter dang good with misfiring order three but they dont get to the freethrow line thats been an issue for them the entire season meanwhile the biggest issues for Louisville turnovers with turnovers has absolutely been the issue for the cars but the guy with the basketball on his hands L Ellis will have to be a plate maker his turnovers are actually down as of late although there is turnover number one the bounce pass intended for Sydney Curry but does Ellis get that turnover or does that go to Sydney Curry I think its going to go to L Irish on the board first no surprise its a three ball from Nate lasheski Im going to be bothered if that turnover goes to Ellis no he put that right into Cindy Currys hand Sydneys got to be able to pick that one up and make a play hes on Ellis so youve got a problem you got your first problem of the day well and Notre Dame has a problem but Jalen Willis continues to play the way that he has 16 points for him against BC 50 from the field also from the threepoint line so hes playing a much better game when you consider what hes doing on the offensive end of the floor now back at the starting lineup and he had a good closeout there on the threepoint attempt by Cormac Ryan Withers comes into this building with good feelings he had his career high 20 points a year ago here at the Joyce Center Sydney Curry misses Sydneys been coming along as well Curry has been giving them more last 11 games 96 and a half rebounds but still nowhere near what they were hoping for and what they need from him but this is a game where Sydney Curry cant really exert himself especially in the interior try to get Nate luceski into foul trouble because he has the advantage from his shrimp standpoint in the bank Notre Dame playing without Van Allen Lubin because of a ankle injury Brandon hunting Hatfield not playing for Louisville inside Al Ellis with his first two of the afternoon thats one of the areas where L Elders can be effective in this game especially if guys arent going to catch your passes and get your turnovers you just shoot the basketball goal score had 15 points in the first half against BC last time out lacheski is fouled by Jalen Withers on the entry pass for first year head coach Kenny Payne always has the smile on his face in spite of the fact that this is on his Pace Cory to be the losing his season in the proud tradition of Louisville basketball but one thing for certain Kenny Payne does not stop working he continues to show up every day and encourage his team to try to get that elusive first win in the ACC play so far well what is his message I mean theyve been listening the players have been listening to Kennys internet now for well were going on three months in the season and they havent gotten the wins they were hoping for do you have to change the message do you have to alter it or is it the same message the KP just says this is what were going to do and weve got to figure it out well I dont think its the same message I think the message is constantly altering and thats one of the things that happens with each and every one of these coaches we talk about Mike right now going to walk away from Notre Dame after his 23rd season and both these coaches are giving their their players the same message that winning is fragile Ive heard that from both coaches today and again its something that they have to understand that it takes the Small Things pay attention to the details that allows you to be able to win at this level of college basketball foreign Goodwin picked up the reach in foul Louisville on the Baseline with 20 to shoot Withers weve talked about this over the years Cory when you have a good game in a building you remember that and feel it when you come back you absolutely do had a conversation with Jaylen Withers at the hotel earlier today ask him what do you need to do to be successful he simply said I just need to stay aggressive and hes been that early in this game game good win hes a man who can score at all three levels his first two come in the midrange Dougie fresh if you ask me Dan Goodwin does not shoot enough as JJ trainer steps up and knocks down the bucket inside the Zone a great guy to have in the middle of his own but Dan Goodman has not taken over 13 field goal attempts in any game at ACC played this fall from the corner Trey Works has his first three Music 109 Notre Dame and you know its something Mike Bray has talked over the years over their five years together with Dane Goodwin he says would you please take a bad shot but hes a coachs kid hes wired to take good shots and sometimes like you say that leads to not shooting enough it absolutely does and when youre a shoot as well as that good one does you would think he would have cut more shots especially for the coach is trying to tell you to find those shots as Jalen Withers lines up another one unable to knock it down well Danes father Damon Goodwin was a seventh round draft pick of the Phoenix Suns out of Dayton back in 1986 long time successful division three coach in the Columbus Ohio area and so Dane is the quintessential coachs kid JJ Starling gets into the end Applause Notre Dame has made more threepoint field goals than any and well say power five schools that doesnt include of course the Big East but any power five School in the country since November the 30th averaging close to 10 three points welcome back to Notre Dame we have a good one on our hands but Notre Dame has the edge 139 Over Louisville at the big ger we heard from my brain about what his mindset has been as he brings his last season here to a close but to bring in a little balance we thought it only right to hear from those that hes coached mentor and continued to develop starting with our very own J billis he went to Twitter Twitter to congratulate his former colleague during their tenure at Duke and described him as a friend and a leader and former player Pat connaughton also said this is Enough Said photo capturing an ACC title with the net around their neck and our guy Jordan cornette with a simple message thank you to sum it all up hes a team player a player coach and someone that continues to invest in the people hes around guys 34 and we Echo those sentiments for sure Angel you know the two Elite eight teams 2015 and 2016 that Mike Ray had Corey those are two of the more enjoyable teams Ive ever had the chance to cover or watch they played such beautiful basketball and thats the offensive line that is Mike Brad they absolutely are one of the better offensive Minds that you will ever see in college basketball and most importantly he coaches confidence as you see Nate maseski knocking down his second twopoint field goal of the game Mike Fraze had to recruit a different type of player to Notre Dame you cant just get anyone into school here and think about that but he also has the coach of guys in their confidence at times simply because many of the players that hes brought in arent necessarily the guys who would have been the toughest guys when they get here but they build that toughness throughout their tenure with the fighting arm whyd you look at me when you said not necessarily that time just like my man Pat Condon said its selfexplanatory connaughton one of three former Irish currently in the NBA doesnt get the ball instead it goes around the perimeter at a 4A into the lane for Trey words Notre Dame already four of eight from distance but Wertz able to get to the rim and when you think about Trey works one of the better assistant turnover guys in the ACC top 20 for him but had five turnovers versus DC there last time out so Trey Works being more aggressive trying to score in this one and not looking to pass off Cory thats 11 unanswered points now for Notre Dame and this is the point of every game for Louisville these players look at each other and have to keep their spirits up first shot attempt for Mike James is Off the Mark and how will they respond will they punch back or does their body language tell you something different I like that by JJ Sterling attacking the basket getting to the rivet right now Kenny Payne where turnovers are off in the issue thats not the case today its been about the defense and right now theyve got to find a way to slow down the fighting arms Music 209 Notre Dame and who says the Fighting Irish is only a threepoint shooting team well the Fighting Irish are making a concerted effort to get the basketball to the rim Trey wurtz driving it and then off of the extra pass from Dane Goodwin JJ Starling attacking the basket once again and this is something that has to be consistent for the fighting Iris finding the way to attack the paint and get to the freethrow line tough Runner by Jalen Withers ah the offensive rebound now Withers cleans it up now forgive me is that Emmanuel Okafor in the game right now for Louisville and with 34 and Manuel yes a Cora Florida making his Collegiate debut okay six foot nine inch freshman whos just come to the states he is from Nigeria hoping to give this roster a spark Dom Campbell into the ball game with the injury to Ben Allen Lubin and he puts his name in the scoreboard Accord just enrolling and joining the program January 19th so less than two weeks misses on the dunk attempt but gets his own offensive rebound and the putback is good for okorafor whos hurry making an impact for the cars well his energy apparently in practice is already elevated everything at Louisville and that if you read all the quotes from Emmanuel when he did get here in January 19th shes about how hard he works and apparently that has come to pass as Hammond buries the three and if youre Louisville you need something like that you need somebody to pick you up and practicing in a game and immediately Emmanuel akoraphor has done that you absolutely do and the thing is Kenny Payne able to get him into the game even with Notre Dame switching back and forth between their mantoman and Zone Elvis chasing after the basketball Applause Music Fighting Irish off to a quick start here in South Bend up by a dozen overload on acc Network Joe Gerard continues to Trend in the right direction Corey I almost feel like at the pace hes been going orchest found on his drive to the bucket jg3 could contend for a scoring time I could definitely see that I think hes been playing great basketball as of late I think Syracuse is playing great basketball as of late so I could see that happening but that would also mean that youre going to find have to find a way to slow down to Cleveland Smith that North Carolina state whos leading the ACC and scoring and no questions Im not sure if thats going to be the case no question about it that was the second foul on Emmanuel okorafor The Freshman making his Collegiate debut that came in just a couple of minutes of action so hell go to the bench and again the young man who has just joined the team in recent days is being coached up immediately hes gone through an awful lot I mean hes come from the other side of the world just the adjustment your body has to make when you move that far absolutely and of course representing NBA Africa to getting an opportunity to come in and join Kenny Paynes program already getting those off to a two point two rebound start already in Angel gray might have a little more on this huh yeah absolutely coach Payne was talking about how versatile and strong he is a great rebounder obviously and thats why they wanted him a part of the program but he just didnt want to throw him out in the fire he said I want to make sure he is right hes immersed within what we do in our schemes and how we rebound but to go back to what he said to us before the game dug he said he is a vocal leader already he has the respect of our team already so when its time to come down to generating that type of energy they were down 12 points when he came in he was that type of player that came in and gave him a bucket and Asian one thing youre for certain that you know this for after playing basketball for so long when you see someone play hard that often is an example that other teammates will follow especially when you need some type of jolt into your program Im sure thats something a call for has added to Kenny Paynes group absolutely Corey coach Payne was telling us earlier today he said theres one instance where he just won the team over at the end of each practice is they have to do some type of training as far as like shooting free throws and its for conditioning usually youre going back and forth you have to make two and then you can go home he called out a core4 he said if you make two we go home he did that the team jumped on him and you can see the camaraderie right there saying Im here Im in it to win it and the guys respected that right off the bat Applause first half Notre Dame has used a 130 run for this 13point lead Mike James misses on the turnaround James has been on the come last six games for the cards averaging nearly 15 points per game and nearly 50 percent from three Cardinals just need more consistency and more options on that end like that matchup between James and Starling though the number three and number four leading freshman scores in ACC basketball two guys coming in with a lot of expectations of course James redshirted a year ago see lines went up from the top of the key and all he needed was me to start talking about him Doug one down all right yeah you were talking about him on the last ones why I missed the redshirt freshman from Orlando has his first three back to a 10point game midway through in his first half here in South Bend out to lashesky the fifth year misses the runner so Doug a very small thing but Nate lasheski has already knocked down two threes as Ellis misses Off the Mark Nate nashewski at six foot ten six foot eleven could have shot the basketball over top of JJ trainer at six seven coming out the chesky puts it on the floor does not get a good look in comparison just being aggressive already confident enough to knock down another three doesnt shoot it those are the type of plays that theyve got to take advantage of here he is underneath misses the layup nice setup by Hammond olashesky shoots it at 41 percent he has been an excellent shooter throughout his career fight for the ball Goodwin takes it away for the Fighting Irish and heres JJ Starling as you said he is the third leading freshman scorer in the ACC behind Kyle filipowski and Judah Mintz Starling came in with a lot of Acclaim on McDonalds AllAmerican he has put together a solid first year here in South Bend think of what youve seen out of the six foot four inch freshman from Baldwinsville New York I like what Ive seen and I would love to see more had a conversation with JJ Starling regarding the fact that he was really the only guy alongside for Matt Ryan who can get to the free throw line on this Notre Dame team and with that being such a struggle for the Fighting Irish throughout this season to be more aggressive attacking the basket and I think its something that hes been able to do as of late but has to continue to be more aggressive trying to get to the rim and they see the scoring numbers for the Freshman JJs at 31 percent from distance so far this year a top 20 recruit in the ESPN 100 last year here is Cormac Ryan hes the only Notre Dame starter to have not scored yet this afternoon Goodwin penetrates blocked Withers again Ellis little hesitation into the lane tough shot off the window around and out a third attempt and a foul is Roosevelt wheeler tried to put it in the 10th and final SEC Big 12 challenge rolls on this afternoon number two Alabama and Oklahoma followed by 17 Frank Baylor hosting Arkansas but were featuring the final two games over on ESPN and the app Texas Tennessee and then ninth ranked Kansas and Kentucky capping off the night at Rupp Arena another battle between the Blue Bloods well I like the Barnes Bowl Im looking forward to seeing Texas and Tennessee as much as anything I am a fan of Rick Barnes and would love to see this matchup most likely Ill be on the plane but hopefully they have it to happen so I can watch the game on the plane right well if you understand technology as well as I do Corey youd be able to watch it first The Fat Boys break up and get all this they did Laughter but we said Goodwin can score it all three levels theres a taste of it it just always want more Im looking at the number 14 I want to see Dan Goodman get at least 14 field goal attempts has only done that one time this season and that was in a early win and he scored 20 points in that game and I would like to see him be more aggressive 14 or more shots throughout this year Applause clock down to six and thats another turnover against Louisville on the offensive foul their sixth TO of this hat when we come back cormack Ryan with a fast break with my man Corey Alexander lets see I mean guys you really have to love it and honestly if you want to know the truth the true science of a leader their leadership traits they never waver whether things are good or even if theyre going through adversity and thats exactly how my gray described Cormac Ryan he said to a 992 hes loud and a person that everyone looks to but more importantly I think he really wants Corey on his team too I think he really pumped them up in that moment yeah clearly after my initial shock I was ready to run through a wall with my guy Cormac Ryan but I was quite a little off guard I wasnt ready I was not ready I dont know if we can show his face again but I love Corys eyes Ive never seen him I liked what Im saying also from Dan Goodwin coming out continuing to be aggressive and attacking the paint not settling for threepointers but getting in that painted area knocking down the midrange jumper you know Cormac Ryan is a threetime captain for the Fighting Irish and he has yet to score so far today but leading in other ways and setting up his teammates hes got four assists to lead everybody thats an offensive foul on the drive by James and another turnover racked up by the Cardinals theyre setting and youre not going to mention who actually stepped in and took the charm I was leaving something for you so setting up your part is that thats basically like a layup like alley for me okay gotcha well let me talk let me talk about something different cool Mac Ryan related can you imagine coming out of high school and being offered and accepted to go to Stanford no and then I know you cant no but then also coming and getting your masters degree at Notre Dame you talk about an education Legend undergrad Stanford graduating from Notre Dame and then also getting your Masters at Notre Dame that thats high level oh hes a young man who grew up in New York City moved from Soho to Chestnut Hill Massachusetts when he was a 10th grader so he left the Collegiate School went to Milton prep and thats where his education continued and as you said he accepted the offer to go to Stanford and he recently joined the 1000 Point Club not here at Notre Dame that combines his time with the Cardinal and here at Notre Dame hes old enough that he had to sit out of transfer year when he came here remember that thats for the way back thats going old school right there sitting out tell Ellis extended run so far today for Dom Campbell The Freshman from Scarborough Maine gets another rebound Goodwin is fouled on the region by trainer we have a top 20 Womens Basketball matchup for you tomorrow afternoon on ESPN Olivia miles and number seven Notre Dame are in Raleigh to take on diamond Johnson in number 20 NC State coverage from Reynolds Coliseum begins at three Eastern on ESPN and the app and I dont know about you Corey but Im of an age that Reynolds Coliseum still gets me fired up anytime I think about it hear the name see a game from there I am of the age that Ive played at Reynolds Coliseum my entire career against the wolf pack at NC State playing at Reynolds and one of the my favorite places to play on the road love that gym because got buckets in there what do you mean why else would I love I thought youre going to say sight lines the crowd its all about you scoring buckets I mean I am who I am mine quoted by the great Popeye the Sailor Man Albert Ellis III misses on the jumper five and a half minutes to go in the half Notre Dame up 13 that was a 130 run used earlier in the half to take this lead oh Starling pulls up and puts it in thats big boy basketball right there JJ Starling lowering the boom on L Ellis on that play could have been offensive foul but I like it that we talk old school thats a little more old school basketball right there back to when these two teams were battling in the Big East he might have learned that from my old ball boy JJs follow me JJ starlings first varsity coach at Baldwinsville was my ball boy at Jordan outrage varsity and youre saying that you your ball boy showed him how to lower the boom with the left shoulder perhaps okay who showed your ball boy this his father who was my varsity coach oh okay good the great Bill Solomon I like it Music why are you looking away Dane Goodwin shoot the basketball and see that goes into Dan Goodman caught the basketball with no one guarding him oh beautiful fine Applause Dane caught the basketball no one even in his vicinity and was looking to pass the basketball for five years you mentioned Mike Rays been trying to get him to be hes an awesome I mean offensive score but yet does always look for his opportunities theres just one of the more tricks one more of the tricks hes got in his bag Applause he was 13 allconference a year ago averaged 13 and a half points per game his numbers are down a bit this year two time captain Sydney Curry bowls his way through luccheski who grabs the miss Applause Music goes right by Curry and gets the layout JJ Stalin running back with a smile on his face recognizing that he is feeling himself right now as the Fighting Irish get up to a 17point lead Music trainer into current has it knocked away but a foul is called against cormack Ryan got him on the hand Applause out in four and Notre Dame and the fact that all of those blown leads were on the road playing here of course Purcell Pavilion at the Joyce Center on the campus of the beautiful Notre Dame Fighting Irish like gray and his team a little more comfortable in this setting Fighting Irish on the year 9 and 12 overall trying to stamp a fourgame losing streak theyre currently on a 102 run in this ball game as the Cardinals have gone cold Louisvilles only made one of its last nine shots from the floor Music L Ellis will inbound underneath for the cards Devin Reed has come into the game number zero in red from Jackson Mississippi and Terry High School no all right he went to Oak Hill too thank you Mike James with two you think Oak Hill has to go first on every list no I didnt say first from every list just first on the list of players who graduated from there oh theres another one of the uh rules that Ive got to learn they always say Kenny Payne go to the Zone this isnt something weve seen a lot from him of course a diehard mantoman coach but trying to find ways to get his team to slow down this Notre Dame Fighting Iris offense and the Zone works on the first possession isnt that dangerous though against the team like Notre Dame it is dangerous so its one of the things Im sure that they worked on and practicing identifying all the shooters that Notre Dame has on the outside but mantoman hasnt worked thus far so Kenny Payne doing something trying to make an adjustment Curry draws the foul against the double team we will have the Australian Open mens championship later tonight or early tomorrow depending on where youre watching 3 30 am Eastern 12 30 am Pacific on ESPN and ESPN plus Novak Djokovic going for his 10th Australian Open title and also looking to tie Rafa Nadals record on the mens side with 22 titles you tennis fan I Ive Im the case no tennis fan but I do know that Djokovic is great at the Aussie open and I know that Nadal is great on Clay wow so I am I am aware of that and so you know I do follow quite a bit I used to you know hit the little tennis ball around and back in my day before you know my jaw arthritis in the hip my Mobility I mean you hit it over the net and within the white line I used to do that with the baseball hit that over the fence see you got there you go Im saying my difference in sports not as much as your son my son Corey quite the baseball player at Old Dominion now playing Minor League Baseball threepoint shooter as are the Notre Dame Fighting Irish knocking down another three another name has found the range here and shooting the three hasnt been a problem for the nine point through 92 threepoint field goals per game leads to ACC under two minutes to go first half its been all Notre Dame Applause trainer trying to back down Ryan who stands his ground can test the shot Sydney Curry nicely done going up and over lisheski for two more and thats an area where Sydney Curry can be successful throughout this game on the offensive glass difficult for Nate nashewski to be able to keep him off the boards when the shot goes up against the Rattlers he had 19 rebounds Sydney Curry 19 boards against Florida what JJ Starlight starlings feeling it this afternoon he absolutely is and a lot of it has to do with the fact that hes attacking the basket weve seen him knock down a threepointer but hes done the majority of his work going to the rim Applause clean look a little bit strong though for JJ trainer a 33 shooter from distance quick release and Ill tell you what JJ Sterling is more than feeling it his career high is 23 against Bowling Green in November and hes well on his way to matching or beating that hes really feeling good about things right now and seeing the basketball go through early has been successful for JJ Stalin well this is Notre Dames highest scoring first half of the year they put 43 on the Penguins of Youngstown State back in November Applause Hammond off the front rim soaring his sarling JJ misses on the putback though Applause Notre Dame switching up their zones defensively a little more of a 131 look right now with Hammond at the top and theres the steal by Stalin get up young fella foreign Applause Starling a near perfect first half of basketball he heads to the locker room with 16 points on seven of eight shooting in the punctuation mark at the end of the half with the steel and slam and maybe a coming out party for the Freshman hes had a good year but off to a great start here today lets go to Angel with Kenny Payne in the next one youre in the second half we want to see the windmill okay they see the numbers for JJ Starling near perfect seven of eight and Well on his way to matching what he did against the Falcons of Bowling Green earlier this season Music and lets go back to Angel gray guys I asked coach Bray about the highest scoring half of the Season he said honestly Angel its because of the defense he said we tried the matchup Zone they tried it against NC State he was pleased with it so he said hes going to continue to throw that out in the second half as far as offense he said we are doing a great job no turnovers 11 assists we have to continue to play together if were on a string good things happen that is a flat out amazing to play an entire first half eleven is to zero turnovers youre talking about in program as Jalen Withers who knocks down the three since 2000 2001 when Mike gray took over the fewest turnovers throughout that span 23 years the fewest turnovers in college basketball during those 23 Seasons well Notre Dame this year is ninth in the country and fewest turnovers per game but that number is 93 youd never think they would go an entire half without a single turnover tell you what JJ Starling has picked up where he left on 18 points for the Freshman from Baldwinsville New York and thats the difference in the game the points off turnovers 11 points for a Notre Dame off those turnovers and of course the answer is going to be zero but Louisville because Notre Dame has not turned the basketball over the 11th assist continue to share the basketball one of the areas where Mike gray has coached so well for the past 23 Seasons Mike James answers with a midrange jumper I found it interesting on the first possession of the second half Cory that Notre Dame seemed to get the ball to Cormac Ryan for that Baseline three he didnt score in the first half do you think that was done on purpose it was not the point the purpose was to get the basketball in the hands of Dan Goodwin to keep him aggressive but Goodwin made the right find to Cormac Ryan the Baseline Baseline drift over the corner who knocked down his three Believe It or Not quarterback Ryan averages two threepoint field goals a game which leads Notre Dame the only player for the Fighting Irish in the top 15 in ACC play hard to believe it is especially when you dont think of him to be the guy thats the shooter you think luceski you think they aint good when Cormac Ryan does this makes plays for his team finding Nate lasheski in transition and luceski coming up with the opportunity for the hand one Music well here it is lachesky on the run for Matt Ryan as you said looking for his teammates his fifth assist and then the end one opportunity Notre Dame does not have one player in the top 20 in scoring in the ACC an assisted turnover Trey works top 15 Cormac Ryan top 15 to threepoint shooting but this is not a team that does it individually its a collective proof they share the basketball they play well together everything offensively for Notre Dame is always looking up defensively is where the struggles have been well they have four averaging double figures there you see Trey wurtz just below the 10 point per game threshold and with the core six or seven players every year for Mike Bray playing heavy minutes you would expect somebody named to score more than 12 13 14 points per game but this is again another balanced attack for the iron but theyve had those guys you talk about you know you go back to Bonzi Colson who was the ACC Player of the Year Ken that you go back to of course Jared Grant Pat conson theyve had those guys who have been big time scorers of course I mean we can go further back of course the apparent Goldie whos one of the alltime leading scorers in Big East history back in the day his number 44 is hanging just across from where we sit my man Maddie C Matt Carroll who put up big numbers playing for Mike gray your former NBA and CBA teammate oh not CBA Justin NBA DLeague DLeague oh thats right I am old enough to have played in the CDA unfortunately I did not Ryan with the takeaway end to end and hell have a chance for three Applause hes out of the same AAU program as Irish Legend Pat connaughton the Middlesex Magic Music right there going in Music an end break Road number one in the game of basketball stop the ball Kenny Payne needs to talk to his team about it because they didnt pay attention to the first rule of the game what a coaching matchup Corey it absolutely is a great coaching matchup between two Hall of Famers you see three NCAA titles between the two of them running through two of the best basketball programs in the country and explains me to a trivia question I have for our colleague Angel gray angel now can you please tell me what ACC head coach does Bill self belong to his coaching tree wait a minute Mike Ray that would be no the answer would be your alma mater Leonard Hamilton Bill self at Oklahoma State way way back in the day so there you go in a friend like no no you are over one I have another one for you later oh well can I get in on this can I ask some trivia to you too no okay you see how it goes Angel it is a oneway street with CA Music if Hammond had got that one it would that would have simply been the luck of the iris everything going in favor of the Irish thus far in this matchup as well this makes a nice finish to the basket averaging nearly 18 per game yes third leading scorer in the ACC and that was pretty Music scored 15 points in the first half against BC last time out but only two points in the second half and said whyd you only shoot 12 times he said I got in foul trouble but he was going to keep it going only had three turnovers in that game well you and I saw him go for 30 against Western Kentucky had 10 assists in that game he can really light it up he absolutely can and again this is the first year the L Ellis has played the point guard position primarily he has been the ball primary ball handler all season long for the cards and right now learning on the fly but the teams struggling 2023 McDonalds AllAmerican class announced this week and Milt Wagner is the grandfather of one DJ Wagner And also the father of the one AKA wani Wagner so completing the first grandfather father son Trio to ever be named McDonalds allamericans and Dougie fresh if you see my man Milt on the left hand side of that pitcher with the part down the middle of his I went to Milt as soon as he came to Louisville and said I used to wear the part down the middle of my hair just because you did it way back when you were winning a national championship in 1986 for the car and I assume he loved that he loved hearing that man he absolutely I mean and again Milton was happy to see me I was happy to see him of course followed him throughout his career had opportunity to meet him and talk to him a number of times since and uh big fan of Milt Wagner back in the day Brian with another three ball from that corner I got a trivia question for you oh you know there is an awful lot of Talent on that Louisville staff absolutely name the three first round picks the three first round picks on the Louisville staff would be Kenny Payne Danny Manning and Nola Smith thats easy I was thinking you might slip up and put Mr Wagner in there he was a second round picker I would have thought he might have been a first round okay so let me ask you this okay I was going to hit Angel gray with this one but Angel struggled on the last one so Im going to give her another one on the Memphis staff who has won not only a NCAA Championship but also an NBA championship I got him Miss LL has attacked the basket finishes once again with the left hand and my man Dougie fresh is over here stumped stumped indeed who is it it would be one Milt Wagner the 1988 Los Angeles Lakers NBA champion two years after NCAA Championship in 1986 you got me I am on the fire here today just like the Notre Dame Fighting Irish is quarterback Ryan who didnt score in the first half is now up to 11 points out four of six shooting here in the second half it was a 130 run early for Notre Dame and Louisville has been down double figures ever since Mike James trying to keep that hot streak going he has been making nearly 50 of his threes asked coach before the game is he back to 100 healthy because he had the Achilles tear last year and then he had a significant hamstring injury that slowed him to start this year and he said hes probably not quite a hundred percent but hes feeling much more comfortable and confident in the leg as much as anything else and especially after an Achilles injury oftentimes you see the same with ACL injuries it takes about a full year of playing basketball as Trey reverse is going to want that one back but it takes about a full year of playing basketball to get back to normal and so Mike James weve seen the progression of Mike James throughout this season not 100 yet but hes starting to make significant strides now he was a medical red shirt last year with that torn left Achilles which happened in October of 2021 so it has been now what 15 months since the injury occurred but then his rehab was slowed down as I said by the second injury the hamstring gonna be an offensive foul on the drive by Trey works a couple of tough possessions for the graduate student from Charlotte Santa Clara transfer and that is the first Notre Dame turnover Cory that is really remarkable it really is amazing the fact that Notre Dame has played almost 27 minutes of game action to commit their first turnover Louisville with nine turnovers hasnt been outrageous in this game but when you consider the fact that Notre Dame has been able to take advantage of those turnovers and turn them into points partly the reason why theyve been able to build this 23point lead yeah now 16 and a half turnovers a game is way too many obviously for Louisville but of those the live ball turnovers are the ones that have really killed him this year Ellis with a nice look Withers know ball comes to Goodwin Ellis reaches in and hes called for the foul thats just frustration right there Ellis is frustrated on that play made the right play made the right breed Mountain Jalen Withers in the corner but unable to knock down the three ball and has a quick conversation with Roger Ayers letting him know Im good you know nothing there just a little frustration and could continue to play hard foreign against the pressure gets it into the front court and gets the return pass Starling leads all scorers standing freshman who played his last couple of years a high school ball at La Lumiere went to the rim hard that time but couldnt finish Music its by Ryan comeback Ryan has to be the best defender especially perimeter Fender four this Notre Dame team this is not a very good defensive team weve seen their struggles throughout ACC play specifically but Cormac Ryan has won the guys who normally steps up and takes that challenge of going out and guarding the other teams best defender which the best offensive player which he has here today against al Ellis another attack comes up empty for starling Applause Corner three is good for Kamari lands The Freshman from Indianapolis knocking down his second threepoint field goal hes gotten more significant minutes here in the second half for the cards cutting it to 20 Louisville not done yet still trying to find a way to hang around here in South Bend Johnson from okay Oak Hill is visiting his former team but now Im glad and of course hopefully Angel gray is open to us after we see the matchups and that was a hint on the screen for the SEC Big 12 challenge today my next trivia question to you all is Music Kenny Payne of course we know is is coaching at his uncle Mark and he is was a NBA draft pick what NBA draft pick was the latest pick that is coaching at their current alma mater in college basketball well we need to put that last graphic up for me to see what eight teams hes no no no you already saw it like I was memorizing it I was thinking about Keith Johnson look at it then I was not memorizing all 18 no more hits for you angel I found a friend I mean you need some type of parameter you can phone a friend there it is oh Jamie Dixon Jamie Dixon was the 150th pick by the Washington Bullets in the NBA draft way back with a hit seven and eight rounds of NBA draft action yeah weve got to get some sort of graphic for Corey Alexanders trivia well the answer I mean the the graphic would just say three Corey zero Angel and Dougie fresh hero what are you talking about whoa whoa I just hopped on board here you gotta give me some wiggle room well first off you did not get the correct answer I got Jamie Dixon as soon as I saw the graphic yeah it was coming out I told you look at the graphic during the during the time out we should mention again that Emmanuel okorafor is playing his first college basketball game for Louisville back off the bench for the cards and at the free throw line Amazing Story to see this young man getting action and playing within the game within two weeks of joining the program and more importantly I love his energy I love the way that hes been infectious with this energy enough to wear Kenny Payne has decided to put him in really that first substitute off the bench in the first half and Corey its a 100 run for Louisville they have made four threepointers already here in the second out heres Goodwin all day Percy Miller into the game as well as my guy Fabio that is Mr basily from Orlando 64 freshman out of Oak Ridge played for my guy Steve Reese at Oak Ridge also Each one teach one AAU program talked with Fabio on the elevators last night introduce yourself to me I said you know Ive been calling your games like for your full freshman season right he says oh okay but he comes back and thats me up today so we good now did you mention that he had his career high when you were on the game of the Western Kentucky game yeah I did not mention that because you usually do that you take the credit whenever anybody has a big game and youre on the call only because you dont give me the credit Withers Applause well you may have noticed that the two coaching staffs are not as casual today as weve become accustomed to coming out of the pandemic that this is suits and sneakers for coaches versus cancer and so both sides have gone suits for the day and I for one think its great I would love to see more of it getting back to coaches dressing up for ball games oh absolutely not it looks so much better keep the pullovers keep the pullovers you know maybe slacks maybe sweats and sneakers thats the way the game is supposed to be coached these are go back to Bobby Knight wore sweater okay youre talking about one of the greatest basketball coaches of all time people wear sweaters they didnt dress up with a suit and tie Dean Smith did yeah also in fact almost all of them did Terry Holland suit and tie Bob Huggins no suit and tie over 900 wins now what we can go back and forth either way these guys I love the look today the guys are sharp and doing their part to support coaches versus cancer Im still trying to I got to talk to David seitzer I got some type of agreement with the ball so I cant come over here no professional Corey professional Music do you watch professional basketball I do did you see what the coaches wearing professional basketball I do and Tony looking good over there so therefore it is professional to wear a pullover and slacks did I tell you that Im going to the Garden on Tuesday I have never seen LeBron in person and so my buddy and I decided you know what who knows how much longer hes going to go probably another couple years at least yeah but uh gonna go down and see the Lakers play the mix on Tuesday Mike James doing his LeBron impression getting out on the break the finish and right now Louisville cutting into this lead we mentioned Its Not Over Kenny Payne going into the full court pressure cutting the lead now down to 16 and theyve sped up the Irish who turned the basketball over here in the second half something they did not do in the first half at all 12 unanswered points and then the double team in the corner forces the timeout from Dane Goodwin to keep possession of the basketball the iron Irish will have it when we come back once 29 today for Notre Dame but Louisvilles on a run and do you think those past games are creeping into the back of the head of Mike Bray right now you know Im sure theyre not with Mike Bray but they could be within his team and when you think about games that youve had double figure leads and given up those leads only to lose those games right now were seeing Notre Dame play a little bit tighter and again theyve only got one win in ACC play and thats been on this floor so theyre confident here but right now Louisville picking up the pressure changing the dynamic foreign came out of the halftime break with going to Dane Goodman on the post this time unable to make the fine to come back Ryan and missing the shot Louisville getting another stop here and a big time score would take him a long way Alice James and basili around the perimeter for Louisville and youve got Four Freshmen on the floor alongside L Ellis as a coral four gets his opportunity in the post unable to do anything with Nate liszewski there nice job by James to come to him hes got to put it up and in the Cardinals keep coming and right now Notre Dame needs a basket in the worst way theyve got to find a way to stop the bleeding so JJ Starling attacks and there is a foul on okorafor third on the Freshman playing his first Collegiate bowl game Mike James getting into the paint going to the midrange able to finish over the top of Nate lasheski but the lead down to 14 a manageable lead 809 remaining right now as JJ starlings trying to shake it off a little bit grabbing at that left knee after attacking the basket Starling played his AAU ball for the Albany City rocks see what hes trying to walk off here as he went down hard you look at the left knee as he comes down a little hyper extension right there glad to see him up and working through that 140 Louisville run JJ going to come off limp off a little bit a little noticeable limp we had to keep an eye on that as the game goes along well he is now just one off of his career high set against Bowling Green back in November with the 22 points as he takes a seat eight minutes remaining in regulation here in South Bend Notre Dame back to the Zone defensively as Louisville will start to find his way as okorafor is able to get another bucket I am impressed with this young man and what hes been able to do in his first game action its one thing to start out the season being a Freshman but Midway through the season ACC play nothing but net for the grad student out of Jupiter Florida big bucket for the Irish it really was especially when you consider breaking the pressure and then getting a good look now a turnover for the cards on the other end of the floor Notre Dame still holding on to a 17point lead see he has now these teams Virginia Duke Miami Clemson NC State North Carolina as eight or higher pit among the last four in and there are a couple other teams at least still in the mix as far as your concerned Corey and for those out there listening yes he was counting on his fingers it is seven teams instead of right now Joe that already has in the mix also with Wake Forest and Virginia Tech being considered and I am personally leading the charge on the Syracuse Orange to be considered now for an opportunities that had a great ACC stretch thus far an opportunity to get a big win at Virginia Tech today and Monday at home versus Virginia Applause pushing back on Louisville and that is what Ive been looking for Dougie fresh that is the 14th field goal attempt for Dane Goodwin in this game I asked for at least 14 he gave me what I wanted and normally thats going to result in a win for the Fighting Irish and thats more than anybody else is running mate JJ Starling has taken 13 Starling remains on the bench after landing awkwardly a couple of minutes ago Fabio basili for three I like the energy that Fabio basili has given Kenny Payne coming in off the bench and its a young man who was he was coached hard in high school at Oak Ridge as well as AAU by my guy Steve Reese and he understands how to get on the floor and compete as a freshman hes still learning his way around but one thing that Kenny is when he steps on the court hes going to give you everything hes got you know the other Oak Ridge guy in the Louisville run that would be one Mike James yes I do know the other Mike I figured you did I mean come on I know youre not going to keep giving me trivia questions after what Ive done for you today Jamie Dixon with very little help Music you notice my silence its true though very little help Ill acknowledge a little held ball and itll go the other way according to the possession arrow side eye producer Matt Barkley for putting that graphic back on the screen I told you look at the graphic during the timeout Im busy doing other things I cant know your dies you ate two hot dogs and half a pretzel what else are you busy doing the whole pretzels oh okay gotcha all right Laughter JJ stalling checking back into the game good to see him back out there after a little scare with his knee and having the task of guarding Ellis Ellis attacking the paint the nice finish for L Ellis hes been great getting to the rim throughout this game and the senior from Durham now with eight points about 10 points under his season average if the cards are going to continue a push they could use more offense from him starling and the Irish get it across Goodwin turns down the potential threepoint shot theres a 13point game though I mean Louisville continues to cut into this lead Notre Dame cant be passive when they break the pressure they still got to stay aggressive this is the closest the game has been this half Goodwin lost the dribble gets it back stays with it thats Louisville basketball it doesnt get much easier for Dane Goodwin as he did all the work necessary to get to the rim just missing a layup pretty much you see the threepoint field goal shooting Louisville has been much better here in the second half Music way comes back in the Irish with four players in double figures so far today Music yeah its been a quiet afternoon really for Marcus Hammond who over the last four games for the Irish score he was averaging 14 per game hes got six on a pair of threepointer has been that and once again a turnover by the cards an inopportune time and the lead just all of a sudden went to 14 I believe a threepointer was made a two at some point recently there was 58 on the score for the bars at least here in the building yeah that is correct Applause Music Applause lachaski working the Baseline draws the contact and the foul goes against Kamari lands okay Music whose father Jay backed up Brad Sellers and Scott Roth back in the 80s at Wisconsin at the line his older sister Abby decided to also be a badger but he decided Notre Dame and in his fifth year twotime captain Reed back in out of Oak Hill Academy there you go it was great talking to Mike gray you know pregame especially about the seniors when you talk about of course Nate lisheski Dane Goodman Trey Works Cormac Ryan the guys whos been here with him for a significant time and really about this being his last year and it was no surprise to those players that this was going to be it for Mike Ray he actually thought about it after having success last year winning two NCAA tournament games he thought about it on the plane ride home but maybe this would be it for him decide to come back of course as those guys use their fifth year covered year option to come back but said that hey lets guys lets go out and win some games to see if we could just ride off into the sunset together will be a new regime for the Fighting Irish next year and Ive got a couple suggestions you always do yeah Mike Bray will be involved in the decision making with their athletic director and athletic department Payne the coachs son into the game gets his first rebound Ellis again so close on that shot and in no hurry is Marcus Hammond four great years last three under Greg Paul is at Niagara decided to transfer up to Notre Dame this year Applause two times All Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference for the purple Eagles keeps the dribble and as always there are multiple options around the perimeter to choose from JJ Starling back in the mix a core four up for the task there but gaining another 20 seconds a new possession for the fighting Iris who continue to milk the clock shoot for Matt Ryan from near the logo around and out and out under three minutes on the clock Ellis on the dish Hammond clears the Miss from basilic Applause Music Notre Dame LED at the half 4624 the lead would balloon to 29 the Cardinals have shipped away actually it was a 30point lead excuse me well Matt Ryan just explaining to his team were in no rush everybodys face out allowed Marcus Hammond to go to work and Hammond does just that knocking down the midrange stretching the lead back out to 17 is up to just about a season average now with the eight points Applause Music facility finds the freshman and I really like what I see out of a coral pool I like what I see out of a silly so we like this freshman combination between the two of them and again there are pieces for Kenny Payne to build on into the Future these guys just have to grow up within this Louisville Cardinal uniform this year has been a struggle but I have no doubt that he will get this program moving in the right direction Music foreign Applause for the six foot ten inch grad student Dougie fresh there are people in this building that have been waiting five years to see just that yep Applause basily feeling it himself Fabio basili giving Kenny playing great minutes off the bench getting extended time here weve got a media timeout that we havent even been able to take at the under under four time out right now so you might have to throw something out on the floor to stop the uh the clockers you want me to go Jay kid on him no oh okay Ill do it I mean like thats my guy a napkin or something Starling with the step through oh you got to make that JJ you got a career high on the line foreign Applause Applause stories coming my friend thats exactly what we got to have his Angel refuting one of your trivia questions we will have that but more importantly Angel is going to get a special guest for us once this thing winds down theyre the two head coaches credit to them both into the final score of the Irish pick up their second Conference win of the season and are now no longer on a losing streak an impressive win for the Irish so youre saying no to Coreys stories is what youre saying not just me the entire truck saying no okay I dont control all of that but we do have time for Angel to refute one of your trivia questions okay well thats fair enough well were going to have an opportunity to speak to our god Mike
