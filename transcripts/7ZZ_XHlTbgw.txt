defend Hes an alldimensional player Spillers ready to jump center He wins the tip over Matt Mayok And the 119th season of Wake Forest mens basketball is underway Youll see a lot of mantoman out of American Wake Forest will be patient but theyre also going to look for the quick good jump shot Nate Calise the transfer from Washington State Hes going to be the point guard trying to run the show This is Mai Mason A lot of people think hell be the leading scoreer And theres some evidence to support that belief Transferred from Washington averaged today under 10 points a ball game a veteran player a great body not afraid to put the ball on the floor and go to the hole Now Americans very different team that than the one that won the Patriot League for coach Dwayne Simpkins the former McDonalds AllAmerican to Damatha and Maryland star under Gary Williams Lot of freshman on this team but heres Jones the returner and hes off the mark Rebound Cal Nice Here comes the Deaks Sophomore season Juke Harris will get himself to the free throw line for the first time tonight And not a good start for Jones They need him for so many things A wild jump shot Good defense that time by Juke Harris And then in transition Harris goes down and draws the contact on Jones And well go to the free throw line Juke Harris had a solid freshman season double figures five times in his 31 games in the starting lineup tonight He only started one game a year ago And now he was a great free throw shooter in high school Stan about 80 but he struggled at the line last year and he misses his first shot here tonight 60 a season ago But uh hes got the potential to have an outstanding year He could be a three and D type player Could score a lot of ways and you saw him come out and contest that first jump shot Does he have the tools to be an all ACC guy I think so Have to shoot the ball a lot better and be more consistent but yes he has the opportunity Jones juggles the catch Sloppy possession for American This is Wyatt Nadus Julenbe son of a former Clemson standout about a couple decades ago Omaha Belaloo inside comes up short Now Belaloo is getting the start tonight A little surprising to not see Marcus Mary in the lineup He is on the bench He went through shoot around but hes obviously not in the starting five Omaha did not start any games at Iowa State or last year It is limited time for Wake as Calmese comes up with the steal HARRIS USING HIS SIZE COUNT IT THATS what Im talking about about being able to finish a play and be explosive But you lob the defense by Wake Forest Trapped there Theyve sped American up on all three possessions Quinn Simpson said We cant afford to get in a run game but if the opportunity comes weve got to take it but weve got to be smart with the basketball Jones almost had it poked away again Corner three Eterbe miss fires Mason rebounds Heres Cal Me Omaha Belaloo in rhythm Last touch by Wake Forest Watching him in practice a couple of times this year Omaha Blue scored in transition Hell take that shot But theres your trap right there Great job getting the passing lane And this is what you like about Cal Me his ability to push the base get the ball down the floor and a strong finish that time by Drew Caris There might be a narrative throughout this season that Wake Forest doesnt have a lot of size and its a little bit of a lazy narrative because theyre not tall but as a team they are very long and theyre going to come up with steals and Nate Calmese has his first two of the season Great start defensively for Wake Forest Youre exactly right there Theyre not the biggest team in the ACC but what they have theyve got lint they play hard and theres a good decision there almost got it but I love his aggressiveness that time And Spillers Spillers picks up the foul Feels appropriate that its a Washington State guy putting the Deaks up 7 nothing doesnt it Yeah Hey weve had a nice year with the Cougars Pressure on the basketball there Kiss got in the passing lane gets the steal and gets to score Kiss knows a little something about Washington Washington State that stuff you know had an he was a good defender last year in Washington State Another steal for Cal Me and then he goes down and a loose ball scooped up by Carson McDonald who just checked into the game and its a reach and foul on Belaloo and here comes Marcus Marion who red shirted a year ago Hes now a thirdyear sophomore from Denmark and Steve Forbes told me earlier today he took full advantage of his red shirt season Hes a connector You need guys like that Im really curious to see how Marian looks this year compared to a couple seasons ago He wont force it Hes going to play his game which is going to be defend rebound make the midrange jump shot be very active See him in the post right now Jones passed up the three Nice dish McDonald up and under and he lays it in Almost got the second foul on Spiller Good job of adjusting and scoring there First points for American and with a shot clock at about 26 Wake misses at the other end And from his backside Mayok saves possession for the Eagles Jones its a block cheering And theyre going to count the basket I think Yep Roger Ays Joe Switzer JW Lucas our three officials Get back to see was does he go Yep leans in there a little bit but you saw he wasnt completely set and gets the extension and gets the basket If youre Wake Forest you want to have that pace frenetic pace but you cant be careless Almost got away with a bad foul a moment ago you know and because youre not very big to running up and down the court you got to be able to secure rebounds See Sebastian Akens into the game Miles Cvin as well Akens the sophomore from Concord transfer from Denver where he was the freshman of the year in the Summit League And Akens begins his Wake Forest tenure inospiciously with a turnover So normally a good ball handler had about 90 assists this past year at Denver as you said Summit League freshman of the year Can score a lot of ways you know score off the drive a good spot shooter and they will really ask him to be energetic on the defensive end You see him putting pressure on the ball now Miles Colton might be the most athletic guy on this Wake Forest roster The son of the twotime Super Bowl champion Three ball would not fall but Jones doing work on the glass and hes got a chance for another threepoint play Heck of a response from the Eagles They were behind 7 nothing And after the timeout Greg Jones Jr will try to put American on top Opening night at the Joel Seven up great accomplishments there And theres another guy thats done a lot of things at other places Dwayne Simpkins Many people may remember him as the allAmerican as a big time player at University of Maryland but also was an assistant coach at North Carolina Greensboro not too many years ago And in talking to him he said that his family loved the experience of being in this state So congratulations to coach Forbes and welcome to North Carolina Coach Simkins Nice guy So the last foul went against Marcus Marian And Jones gives the Eagles their first lead Hes got six points on a pair of threepoint plays Wake Forest with Harris Akens Culvin Blue and Marian Coven misses his first shot Madden Collins grabs the rebound for the Eagles Little bit of a pressure a little trap that time after the timeout by American Rushed a shot by Wake Forest America now under control Theres your trap again nearly forcing another turnover but thats an obvious foul call against Kulvin who takes out the Eagle from the backside One thing that you would have to be very concerned about if youre Wake Forest right now in this first five minutes almost theyre getting tempo but some careless fouls To your point thats five fouls in four and a half minutes against Wake Only one foul has gone against American and American was the best team I know its a year ago in the different players but just something to think about Number one in the conference a year ago in free throw percentage So got some guys that can make some plays and this is the speed offensively I think they like to have and Wake knows that So they want to speed them up McDonald freshman from Colorado gives it back to Nasus Tough shot rebounded by Harris Here come the Deaks Hunter Salis Cam Hilddrth Eton Reed no longer Deacons And its up to guys like Sebastian Aikens to start making things happen This guy scored in double figures 21 times last year for Denver Nice job that time recognizing the trap and dribbling out of it and then attacking the glass strong Now of those 21 times he had four of those games He had 20 or better Had a huge game against North Dakota State early in the season in the in their league So he can score the basketball but right now I think I I want to see him make good ball decisions If the shot comes take it But make sure youre distributing the basketball to the right players Mai Mason back in The foul was on Nadis is first 5 minutes in were tied at eight Wake Forest begins the season with two games at home this week both against the Eagles The Morehead State Eagles will be here on Friday night And then a trip to Michigan to take on the Wolverines Thats a week from tomorrow Collins on the drive rejected by Marion Mason for Akens and hell pull it back out and reset Good decision that time Cvin to the corner Marian met by a double Then one defender retreats and Marian attacks and the tippin will fall And thats the second bucket for Mason Nice job there putting it to the glass and Mason whos an active rebounder goes up and finishes strong uses the glass but gets it Theyre quick One thing you like about this team too that theyre very quick leapers 65 66 67 They get off the floor As Steve Forbes mentioned that he said what they lack in size they make up for Theyre going to be more athletic than their counterparts in the front court He feels more often than not Clock winding down and American barely realizes it Mayoks prayer not answered AKENS LOOKING HIGH MY GOODNESS screaming MILES CULVIN WELCOME TO THE MOMENT laughter cheering GRAVITY MIGHT NOT APPLY TO that guy Oh my goodness Welcome to the moment Welcome to the ACC Welcome to best Here we go 3 2 1 WE HAVE LIFTOFF AH Akens put it up there and Miles Kulvin did the rest I said he was athletic Oh no question about it When we talked about all their wings being very athletic but a nice pass that time by Akens and Kulvin knew exactly what to do with that Thatll wake you up Its like a play of the season laughter 6 and 12 minutes into the season You might not see a better dunk than that all year Oh Cal Me nearly another steal but the loose ball finds Collins who gets a friendly bounce on the three Sprouse who who has range Nice bounce that time but again trying to settle this crowd down after that fantastic dunk we saw Mason Hes an excellent threepoint shooter And the rebound tracked by Culvin going to work on Mayok Nice job applause And theyre not kidding when youre talking about athleticism You lob dunk long range jumper kiss off the glass Showing a lot of versatility in those wings and continuing to come at you I love the pace defensively Chris Egan kicks it out Jeff Sprouse has been bothered by ankle issues but hes good shooter when hes out there Heres Coven with a steal Culvin will get himself to the line Thank goodness we get a whistle cuz I want to take another look at that slam I mean this guy electric Miles Kovven obviously comes from an athletic family but but is a veteran player was on those Purdue teams that played in the national championship two years ago was on the NCAA teams a very physical guy that can score and youve seen already his ability to make plays in the paint and also in the long range So you know and heres the thing you like about him playing in the Big 10 He knows how to be physical Yeah he can take that hit Hes a sturdy 65 No question about it One for two at the line Rebound from McDonald and American Americans got to find a tempo that suits it Wake Forest is coming out with so much pressure Theyre taking them out of everything they want to do Nice back cut Mayok good position Cant finish Second chance wouldnt go either And itll be American ball with 14 to shoot When we come back 1154 to go Weve already got a top 10 moment Miles Culvin a wearing Deacon jerseys McDonald over Spillers Tough two Nice young player Good size there Just took his time in the post and elevated up and makes that shot Who do you expect to be the primary scorers for this Wake Forest team I I I think its going to be eventually youre going to get something out of out of Mason I think hes going to have to give you some points I think Cali scores off transition Juke Harris is going to definitely have to step up and be that big time scoreer And of course we cant do anything without spillers What about Kovven Well Kov too Hes got seven I dont I dont think you will be this team is going to be one player dependent or ball dependent I think youre going to get a lot of guys involved similar to what we saw to earlier Spillers with his defense The steel ahead Mason hit Count it And one just like that Very unselfish play Didnt try to make the spectacular Took it down to the width Watch this It starts on the defensive end getting the passing lane under control Gives it up and then powers inside Takes the contact and scores the basket Excellent unselfish basketball and a good finish by Mai Mason Five turnovers for American All five have been steals for Wake Forest And now eight points off those turnovers for the Daks And one of the things that coach Simpkins and I were talking about the other day was about transition baskets protecting the ball not giving Wake Forest easy offense Theyve done exactly that Theyve given Wake Forest a lot of great looks Strong take by Chris Egan the freshman out of Charlotte Catholic Another one of those nice young powerful players an American has Their big guys arent maybe the fastest guys in the world but theyre very strong Theyre very smart especially from the shoulders up They make good plays Good inside position once again Kiss it off the glass Palon Sebastian his second Hes one of the nine freshman on this American team that caught fire late beat Navy by 22 in the Patriot League championship game Schools first title in 11 years They just all got their rings this past week Yeah Beat my good friend Eddie Dellis Spillers explodes to the basket And if Egan didnt prevent him from detonating that would have been another highlight I think as the season goes that youre going to see on most nights three maybe four guys averaging anywhere from 10 to about 14 points and you think thats a good thing right I do I do because rather than just one guy who averages 2022 because that mean if if that guy thats a 2025 didnt get in his 2025 what did you Well there were there were occasionally Hunter Salah had those nights Thats right But there was another there were very few times did you have two 20point players but you can get a lot of points this way This team can I think with their aggressive defense and the fact like I said that theyve got depth Theyve got a little more depth and theyre going to use that more than theyve seen in the past I think Spillers goes one for two his first point Boy look how active they are defensively right now Evan down in defensive stance Everybodys moving Can they close out the possession with a stop Jones fakes it Takes the three Rebound Spillers His second board Yes Calm pushing the pace Juke Harris for three And Jones grabs another rebound for American Nasadus puts his head down gets to the rack cant finish Pinball ball finds Jones finds himself open And the Eagles just one of eight from deep Deacons 0 for four from beyond the ark Spillers to the basket Kept moving Look out Everybody just kept moving He make the ball fake off the cut and here we go Like kind of fake the cut Kept it strong Kept it low and watch this Watch it Boom There was no doubt in his mind what he was doing with that play Thats just good And everybody was moving Moving out the basketball Post wasnt clogged Spillers has got to like that And thats a great read Also I just I love more than anything right now You know you would love to dunk Yeah the activity of this Wake Forest basketball team Everybodys engaged Everybodys down defensive stance He reached Yeah Calmise went up in the air which was a mistake Right And then prevented Spruce Sprouts from going by him by grabbing him on the arm And thats seven team fouls in less than 11 minutes So one and one here for Sprouse You dont want him to foul and like you said you want to keep your feet but because you have a little depth and youre beginning to work on extra depth on this team he can get down and play hard like that More times than not hes going to force a turnover speed them up as as American has dealt with all game long Jeff Sprouse from Pembroke Pines Florida made six threes in the first four tournament game last year Still was not enough American lost to Mount St Marys in the first four in Dayton Sixpoint game Shot clock at 10 Mai Mason gives it up Belaloo fires Rebound tip to Collins Beloo made five of those last season in sparing time Nasadis cuts the deficit in half with a three When you talk about this guy Nasis they say tough looks for a physical game not afraid to play the point at some point in time but definitely would take the long range jumper That was a good look Calm me hasnt looked for a shot too much so far Lost it on the way to the rim Numbers for the Eagles Nasa same spot and this game is tied They talked about some of the big shots he made down the stretch in the Patri League tournament Youve seen backto back shots by Wyatt Nas and 814 Ill tweet it in the present It goes back to what he told me about Nadis took big shots They made big plays when they had to especially as he got down to tournament time and winning that This is a team whos not going to go away You know theyve yet wet to make a three Theyve had some exciting plays but they havent made a three And theyve handled American the last couple possessions The pressure that Wakes put on them Only five turnovers Not a good foul there Goes against Collins You know I think that this American team will be better as the season goes on Very similar to what happened last year And they had a stretch where they played North Carolina with a couple of guys out Carolina you know Wally mopped them about 35 40 points and then they lost a seven or eight point ball game over at High Point We saw what High Point did last year but they got better and better down the stretch and and made the plays they had to make High Point gave Miles Kovvens Purdue Boiler Makers a run for their money in the first round of the tournament Right Thats what Im saying Duke makes a pair Double team in the corner and deflected out of bounds by Marian Yeah Americans got to recognize that Wake Forest is trying to trap him in the corner and take away that first pass which is going to probably be a cutter So theyre going to have to be strong with the basketball maybe look for the skip pass or try to kick it back out and reverse it the other way Make Wake Forest have to be a a a moving team Cant let them clamp down Big hedge of the screen There you go See heres Collins kept his foot over Harris Rebound deflected and it bounces to Juke Quickly ahead for Aikens Sebastian Aikens Theyre going to wave it off Crowd wants them to count it Coach Forbes wants them to count it What do you think I think it happened on the floor Its going to be two shots No basket Foul ties to number seven See theres the foul I should have been Yeah there was a little bit of a foul but they cons more push off than getting fouled They called it on the Its his second We talked about this a lot last year Stan The bottom line God you expect me to remember that with the Deacons last year If they made more threes they would have been dancing Yeah And and it started on opening night last year against Copper It is And it was so funny because we had a chance to watch the womens game and they were missing shots and we said Well itll get better Itll get better It did Wake Forest shot poorly all year long Last in the ACC in threepoint baskets made last year Third worst in the country 353rd out of 355 28 from the three line Yeah And yet so the point I wanted to make theres you know in the opener last year Wake was 13 of 19 from two and nine of 37 from three Uhhuh Forbess team tonight 0 for five from three 9 for 12 from two Funny thing about that game I guess it was Coppen State right Cate 37 attempts They took 25 or more threepoint opportunities only seven times last year So you know like you said 196 threepoint attempts a season ago and everything else was downhill But I think that the style of play this year is going to open up the opportunity for them to make more threes Look at that 56 They make a few threes Good news for American And that was a dead ball turnover compared to the previous five giveaways that had been live ball steals And those are okay for them Gets back on defense Spillers again detonates at the rim And Turbay made a good decision because he reached and then pulled his hand away at the last moment He knew he was beat I like that little set right there by Wake Forest Get the ball up high post and let them go hard to the basket Its becoming a dunk contest for Trayvon Spillers if he keeps catching it at the top of the key Oneonone cant connect Rebound for Aikens Culvin recovers in the corner Pulls it back out Akins pulls up Rebound McDonald Under six to play in the first half in a sixpoint game American hanging in this thing Theyve made three threes compared to Wakess none And thats a hip check on Marcus Marion His second personal foul Theres the latest Spiller slam Similar to the last play except for that time he does it with two hands It looked like an instant replay of the previous play Yeah And because he has the ability to make that midrange jump shot free throw line area youve got to come up and contest it Hes quick enough and handles well enough he can go right by you and you can see finish with authority Harris was too tight on Collins and picks up his second personal Its the eighth team foul of the half One and one here for American And although you have depth and you have a lot of guys that can do similar things you just dont want to pick up the cheap foul Marian picks his foul up with 11 seconds left on the shot clock This foul was earlier but still just that reaching Just be disciplined Move your feet Move your hands Keep your eyes on the basketball Be smart with what youre doing Things will work out for you Dont reach cheering So Madden Collins whos the godson of the great Don Staley Yep His parents played at Temple His mother played for Don Staley at Temple and his mom Ari is now the director of operations for the Gamecocks Hey one more point on the threepoint shooting We brought up last year did not mention that in two exhibition games Wake shot better than 50 from three 31 for 60 in two games against ECU and ETSU over the past couple weeks Beat ECU by about 30 I think Tennessee by about 20 So yeah Is this the time No sir Miles Coven comes up empty Looked good out of his hand though Weve seen a lot of those tonight See him slowed the pace down 101 Is he going to double or not Double comes from Blue Excellent ball movement Jones was the open man and he cant make Wake Forest pay for the slow rotation This balls really popping around Spillers to Belaloo FOR ANOTHER TWOHAND STUFF WELL we talked about it earlier the fact that they moved the basketball and coach Forbes talked about how much they enjoy passing the ball being unselfish and getting the easy shot Watch this pass Dribble one time finding inside an extra pass and the finish by Omaha Omaha Blue making his first start tonight since he was a senior at Walke High School in Iowa McDonalds AllAmerican coming out of Walke High Hes trimmed down a little bit over the summer Really put in some work A lot quicker Settled with a few injuries last season Never really kind of found a rhythm Cal Me with another theft Threeon one Look out cheering You already know laughter cheering Wake Forest pressure leading to fast break opportunities Mason to Spillers again Well you dont need to shoot a lot of threes when youre getting dunks Ill take two in excitement Hes four for four Hes got four dunks and more pressure on the basketball 25 30 feet away Out of bounds off Wake Forest Take a deep breath everybody Trayvon Spillers two You got to rest when you fly that high music music Good defense getting the passing lanes being unselfish and making passes music Calme steals and scores in the passing lane Watch Phillis take it down TAKE IT DOWN THROW IT DOWN BAM GET the foul threepoint play Being able to play defense music then making something special happen on the other end is a very good thing And if youre Wake Forest you got to love whats happened Theyve got eight fast break points off steel and scored Theyre gonna get some more too This is a great job defensively turning offense into defense back to offense Clock winding down Saduss prayer doesnt catch anything Oh the put back almost goes in Flipped over the head by Sebastian Omaha Belaloo looking to add to the Wake Forest lead which currently stands at 11 Good decision that time by Omaha Could have been easy to jack one up Mai Mason too strong Deacons stay silent from deep but itll be Wake Paul Coach Forbes talked about it Weve talked about it a lot but eight assists so far for Wake Forest on 13 made field goals And again Evan like you said still no threepoint baskets made But again youre getting dunks and steals Ill take that Calm triggers the inbounds Mason tries again Yes sir off the inbounds under Kai Mason had 53 threes a season ago as a Washington Husky at a 40 cliff Theres another steal for Cal Me MASON SPILLERS screaming steal score dunk I just talked about it a second ago He didnt believe me 12 straight points for Wake Forest Feels like Cal Me has 25 steals He actually only has three Thats the goalend on Coven Does your tra does your trap Get it up there and push it up there And again Spillers having a great a wonderful percentage Im telling you Steve Forbes frustrated with that execution Roger meanwhile having a conversation with us here at courtside Its great to see Roger again He is as good as it gets in college basketball officiating And we get him for game one Im sure hes done like 40 exhibition games the last 20 days but he usually does something like 100 games in 110 days Hes got your schedule Yeah right Were were 132 days away from Selection Sunday and I bet Roger works all but 10 of those days I mean he goes crazy Let me tell you what if we could get that done for basketball I Id take that Im sure you would Id take that I mean come on What am I going to do in the summer Play a lot of golf at nice courses Well if you do a lot of games you cant play a lot more A 12point game after Jones makes a pair Hes got eight And theres a steal for Sprouse Numbers for American Oh and a steal for Spillers Another bad pass Uhoh Uhoh Spillers Well it wasnt a dunk but it finds Beloo Kick out Yes sir Folks Im telling you what this is unselfish basketball players ready to step up and make plays You got to enjoy this You got to love what youre seeing out of Wake Forest right now Theres a trap again to answer Jones comes up short Mason all of a sudden has 13 Spillers has 11 Wakes lead is 15 Culvin got the dunk party started And Cal Me has had some nice passes and Belaloo denies him an assist there Would have been his fifth dime if Belaloo had converted Nice back door Oh Pete Carrill would be proud Yes he would Nice post back door Bam Score 25 Watch this Call number 10 Dribble away Second guy stands and bam There you go Sebastian back on the floor Matt Mayok now a junior all Patriot League rookie team two years ago screaming cheering Final minute of the first half Cal me Nice dribble Comes up short Rebound Mayok ahead Sprouse beloo back to pick him up Kate Sebastian Thought he had a land of the bucket Instead find Jones whos turned away by Belaloo Sprouse straight away Deep three Good defensive effort stopping the basketball in transition Nice block by Beloo But you kick back and you got a guy like Sprouse who was a leading threepoint shooter returning for this team Knocked down a nice three a needed three for the Eagles of America Game clock and shot clock just about in sync Wake shooting 53 overall in this first half And that percentage will rise as Belaloo lays it in threequarters court for Jones over the backboard And thats how the first Im Im ready for basketball now You wait for October 15 people have already had exhibitions and stuff So its a different day but the game is still fun to watch play or call Now Wake Forest did a great job in speeding up Speaking of speeding up Greg Jones speeding American up and we didnt hear much out of Jones that time He decided to take it right to the hole And and for American to get back in this game we mentioned the 10 turnovers Theyve got to value the basketball And if and if Wakes going to trap him theyve got to attack that trap What did you think of Cal Me in the first half I thought he did a great job of being a floor general Not looking to score but looking to get others involved Spillers denied the dunk and the bucket Thats nice space in there to let your post go oneonone Just not able to finish that time Tough rebound inside for it American the Patriot League champions a season ago Nine new freshman true freshman Recognize clock Its not what Dwayne Simkins drew up The only good news is its not a shot clock violation Its a jump ball which means the Deakons get it this time but the next jump ball goes to the Eagles Thats the very small silver lining to that play Well yeah got the arrow back Youre just being nice about it It was a turnover Okay thats a turnover And against Wake Forest the way theyre playing tonight you can ill afford to have empty possessions Spillers hands off Cal Me to the corner Harris rise and fire for three cheering And that was the beginning of the play weve seen a couple times with Spiller keeping it at the high post and taking it to the hole had time to keep it Look for the weak side shooter Hes ready to knock it down Nasis answers I like him I really like him Hes giving you plenty to like tonight Third three for Wyatt Nasadis sophomore from Traverse City Mason I like him too Hes got 16 now Deacons have hit their last four threes after starting 0 for seven You talked about Mason being a scorer Had 14 games last year in double figures in a big game against him Corner husters in Nebraska but 23 So he cant score and hes showing it tonight Mason the steal and he will have the easy deuce in transition 18 now for Mai Mason in his Wake Forest debut his 99th career college basketball game Hes new but hes no freshman 10 to shoot for American Matt Mayok working on Omaha Belaloo knocks it in Its going to be a good one Hes going to be a good one All of a sudden its a shootout Back and forth we go Each team has eight points in the first three minutes here in the second half Harris cant connect that time Rebound deflected to Sprouse Nasadus with a head of steam going glass Boy very impressed with Nasas ability to score from the outside and then take it in powerful and score He was a football player in high school and had some offers but uh he can be a dangerous player And then they can be a little more aggressive defensively Theres contact Watch this Watch this You get the defensive flat pushing ahead and just didnt have the dunk in and then lay up and then here we go What do you notice about this Both teams are running and theyre running hard and theyre trying to finish plays If you coast in this basketball game tonight youre going to be left Youre going to be on the bench You got to get back on defense You got to try to finish a play Calmese dribble Hand off for Mason 10 to shoot Spiller screen Calm me inside Back out Great look Didnt go in but thats the elite shot selection that Steve Forbes was talking about Off the fine ball movement Still the possession ends with a turnover And Nasus had that shot to cut it to seven Americans still hanging around Yeah theyre not going away And theyre slowing this thing down Theyve done a better job handling pressure Nice look McDonald cant finish And Belaloo with a tough rebound through the contact Didnt expect the defender to be there and hang around that long Threw him off stride Marians going to check in next whistle Were also going to get a timeout next whistle Calm tips his rebound to the corner Mason in and out Harris on the glass Back up and free throws will come after the timeout Back and forth we go Wake started the second half hot now has missed their last four shots And its music a 10point game music Those are the simple facts on the left side of your screen Only the Houston Cougars the Duke Blue Devils and the St Marys Gales have won more home games since the start of the 2122 season than the Demon Deacons of Wake Forest Theyre 61 and 10 at the Joel since the start of that campaign 29 ACC home wins in that span Third most in the league in the last four seasons Out of the timeout its Duke Harris at the line You saw that graphic a second ago None of those places laughter None of those places are easy places to play They take my word Two of them I know real well And Houston no Whats the best college basketball atmosphere you personally have ever experienced My goodness Well Sebastian for three Cant go wrong in a draw when theyre hopping Okay A tiedye day Youre just pandering to the local Well of course Im not going to tell a lot but you know you go to Durham thats that you know thats always special You know Allan Fieldhouse when when theyre when theyre excited theyre going to go you know rock chalk J Thats thats always special Uh I tell you somewhere that was nice but I was so cold it didnt matter I was going to Bloomington Go to Assembly Hall Well Assembly Hall now something another But thats you know and then you can and you can never ever go wrong And Im going to tell you what Im going be very honest with you I go there a lot and it never gets old to me going to the Greensboro Coliseum Okay Eterbe for three Hes been looking for a shot Hes had some good looks and not able to get one Spillers to Harris down the alley cheering and one What a great find But we said we just finished talking about it You got to run Watch this Takes it down flips and Juke is running right to the basket Catch concentrate score yell And everybodys happy This is such a nice play Th this is beautiful basketball to me Unselfish Youre in the paint I would have shot probably in the paint He gives it up and you get a possible threepoint play and this is just good for the team Its good for the environment Youre talking about a tough place to play It makes it even harder to play in Wake Forest It plays like that 15 assists on 21 field goals now for Wake Forest and three assists for Trayvon Spillers who averaged less than one a game a year ago Chance for another steal Swarming on the baseline but its Eterby with a nice euro Thats a nice move Looking like his dad Aken slices to the rim Tip wont go And whos the foul on Is this going to be a shooting foul I think it is I think they got it So Aikens has been battling Hes got three free throws Hes missed his first couple field goal attempts He does have three rebounds two assists in just six minutes off the bench Were talking about balance in the first half and and I agree with you that there could be you know three four guys that average between 10 14 points but there are a bunch of guys on this team who have gone off for 25 30 plus in a game in their careers Yes they have And you like that So what that tells me if you do it here too is that youre willing to give up yourself for the team and if you work hard on your offensive sets and theyve done it If you play good defense theyre going to be enough shots for you And there going to be some nights when youre going to be the person that gets all the good looks and there going to be some nights when its not going to fall for you but you keep playing I I just love I love how this team is connected right now Akens called for the reach foul charged to zero second personal Well Kamse and Mason are both seniors in their final year of eligibility Akens just a sophomore You never know but he could be here for a bit Oh nice back door again And thats a foul on Belaloo And I think they called that last foul a moment ago that we thought was on Akens I think they called that on blue also Youre right Now shes picked up a second and third in a very short amount of time Wonder if they could go back cuz I thought I really thought the foul was on Aens So Nasis at the line You know Kiss and Mason Its interesting Theyre both from Gilbert Arizona They both played a season at the University of Washington but they werent at UDub together Palse was at Wazu last year when Mason was at Washington after playing a couple of years at Rice And they didnt know each other that well They they came on a recruiting visit as transfers at the same time and they committed the same night at dinner with Coach Forbes together Good vibe So you would think theyre a package deal cuz they both are from Gilbert Arizona but different paths to get to this point where theyre together here in Winston Salem Culvin on the attack Oh pretty move but could not finish American trying to put some good possessions together and get this down to 68 points or so Jones defended pretty well by Harris cheering until the whistle bails out Jones Its on the reacher Marcus Marion Okay take a look at the body Gets the gets the basketball So theres the reach and see that left head I guess thats his right leg The right leg See the right leg there Just a little bit Didnt mean to If he have missed the basketball he wouldnt have found it Number two on Marcus Marion Nadis Tipped his own miss Back up and in Wyatt Madus just continues to go inside and look for physical play Nice little midrange You missed it quality shot and Wake a little too quick turns it over Nasis careerhigh 15 points He averaged just three points per game a season ago Now now if youre Wake Forest youre having a lot of success pressuring the basketball Right now Americans seem to kind of find a little bit of an answer Dont get careless Just just you know dont keep worrying about the excitement play Just keep playing hard Good things will happen for you And if youre American right now this is your chance Cut this lead Get it under 10 cheering Theyve just been too loose with a dribble too many times Akens looking high Steve Forbes did not like the choice and he sends Cal Me to the scorers table And when we come back the Deakons will have a new point guard 10point game 1157 to play music Mai Mason leading the way with 18 J Carris with 12 Those two have half of Wake Forest 60 You also got Spillers in double figures with 11 Most of those on slam dunks 10point game 1157 to play here on opening night It is really great to be back inside the Joel Coliseum It is It really is Those three guys combined from 15 to 23 shooting the basketball Thats that unselfishness Thats the the team that we were talking about Everybody just playing basketball playing hard Its fun to play I appreciate you doing the math on that I appreciate it and was right Calm me knocked it away again He may or may not get credited with the steal but he has wre havoc defensively in a variety of ways that the stats dont always measure And hes had some good passes too Spillers scores Cal Me with his eighth assist of the night Continue to move the basketball move people and excellent body control by Spillers for the easy basket They did give him the steal by the way Hes got five steals eight assists Corner three Cade Sebastian missed it short As active as Trayvon Spillers is its hard to believe that was just his fourth board Culvin stays with it And then Mason keeps it alive Spillers again Great position and that could have been the ninth assist but instead the foul on Sprouse has his second personal team There have been a couple possessions just sitting back watching and thinking It looks like theyve got six guys on the floor laughter I mean theyre trapping every place Theyre getting in the passing lane Theyre getting in the help passing lane too I mean its just like theyve really been active Culvin cant connect from the corner Loose ball picked up by American for Nasadus That was halfway down too Spillers puts his head down once again and will get his third and fourth free throw attempts of the night And theres theres got to be a point and that time is is dwindling for Dwayne Simpkins is hes got to get his team to control the tempo You can do that defensively by getting stops You can do that offensively obviously by scoring But hes got to be able to string together two or three possessions where its successful for for American That means scoring the basketball scoring the basketball getting a stop or something Otherwise theyre going to run out of time And the fatigue factor also has to come in Question for you Their leading returning scorer Greg Jones 33 threepoint shooter a year ago 0 for five from three tonight Are you thinking All right its not my night I get got to get to the basket Or are you trying to get break the seal from three Im trying to get a basket Yes And sometimes maybe getting that layup but they theyve defended him well Hes had a couple of shots that rimmed out and one or two that were really ugly So again thats what Im talking about They they sped him up a little bit Nadis doing work to Deacon defense I like him I like him Hes got 17 Mason with a head of steam Spillers missed the dunk This could be your chance for getting cut into this lead if youre American Lets say the season high last year was 10 against Lyola Collins fell down and Spillers reached in Its his third personal foul Its charged to 25 Thats his third If he didnt reach in I dont know what Collins would have done And see thats what Im saying Just everything is your way Youve got the offensive player at a disadvantage right now Just Just stay down Play D Dont reach You You need those fouls Wet spot Mayok fell down and Rogers going to blow the whistle Thats a veteran official right there recognizing the situation and stopping the game to get the court dry and make the park safe and hes chatting up the fans in the first row I mean you get a first row ticket you get a great view of the game and you get to talk with Americas favorite referee pretty much all game long He could have a talk show Jones still over from deep Culvins pass almost stolen but Spillers stays with it Mai Mason says Why not And its Coven who comes up for the rebound Oh great hustle And he knocks down the three Great hustle rewarded cheering Stayed on the play Long rebound Battles for it Defense slats up for just a second He says It only takes me a second You dont understand First three for Miles after missing his first three attempts from deep Collins fouled by Cal Nice I think Nope Theyre giving it to Spillers And thats Trayvons fourth And he is headed to the bench Thats his point number five I I can hear Steve Forbes post game talking about we need to guard without fouling I mean thats going to be one of laughter the first things he says Hes going to talk about he liked the energy he liked the effort he liked the passing liked the defensive aggressiveness getting hands in there for steals Juke Harris and he liked the relentless pursuit of offensive rebounds Wake has 13 of them so far tonight take it back That was number 12 Still the point stands These types of plays on the other hand not in Forbess wheelhouse And that transition defense left something to be desired Dont be careless right now Almost 8 minutes remaining to play Play smart Protect the basketball You dont have to have the home runs every second every possession Six points for Carson McDonald in his debut Nate Cal Me knocks down his first three of the year Not seen him take a lot of jumpers and knock those in But again Cal Me a very formidable shooter Knocked down 41 on his career last season A good answer back Yeah tough turnaround by Jeff Sprouse Sprouse is going to have a nice season too You look at this American team more and more impressed with them Remember what they said theyll be better theyll be better in December than they are now Its a great look Wakes had a lot of good looks that just have not fallen Forbes looking up to the wilderness right now wondering why that didnt go in But theres defensive hustle from Mai Mason 15 steals for the Demon Deacon defense tonight Now you run your secondary and you get a basket Mason no look Harris for two Im impressed I am very impressed with this welloiled machine right now offensively Kept the ball moving It didnt stand around Nobody trying to go oneonone He got an extra pass a good shot He got found a better shot And two shots coming here for Carson McDonald But first well get ourselves a timeout Foul is on Coven Deacons lead is 16 music Weve talked about it all night long Its worth repeating Going from defense to offense taking the ball down and getting a high percentage shot Wake Forest has outscored America 282 on points off turnovers And one of the reasons theyre getting the ball in great spots pushing the ball down the floor everybody just laying out right now great hands not messing around just pushing it down the floor and then being attack mode Attack attack attack If you do that great things happen The Dicks looking really good on the defensive end which makes the offense even easier American with 16 turnovers 15 of which have been Wake Forest steals And hey remember when we said that the foul should have gone to Nate Cal Me instead of Trayvon Spillers Yes They changed it and gave it to Cal Me which means Spillers has three fouls and not four and he returns You mean they listen to us Wonderful Just a second on Cal Me They should ask us our opinion more often Im telling you everybodys in midseason form then The officials are listening to us We were We were right All right 14point game less than seven to play Folks who have followed Wake Forest basketball in recent years know that winning is important but style points this time of year arent just style points They matter in the metrics and the efficiencies that go into the quad nonsense that permeates all of college hoops in the months ahead Offensive foul on Mason So thats just to say if youre awake youre 20 and a half point favorites coming into this game You still have a lot of work to do not just to get the win but to do what the metrics are expecting you to do I dont know about the the dolllet numbers stuff which I you know I Im Yeah Well it it does It dont matter to me because I just want to try to get a call a good game and hope whoever wins wins Collins for three But but I will tell you this Wake Forest needs to just settle in and be efficient Make free throws No turnovers Dont give up any loose plays like that Coven Oh big ambitions Thats what Im talking about You dont need the home run I like the idea but understand time and score Follow wont go for Sebastian Two great looks for American cheering Harris looking high Oh and another dunk through the hands of a Demon Deac And it was Mason that missed it this time Trust me when I tell you what I tell you Look out Collins missed the three That would have cut it to eight You know we weve got a couple highlights plays We got something we can look at Just be efficient Score Okay I love the attack that the call had I I mean Im not mad at it but Im mad at it because he did it when he did it and it didnt work Does that make sense Step back three Calm me knocks down another huge basket Good timeout by Steve Forbes Why do you like that timeout Get his team back under control All the things we finished talking about Mad about a call Keep the intensity right there Youre up 14 music from Washington State Although this is his fourth school He was at laughter Lamar Yep And then Washington and then Wazoo And now to the East Coast for the first time Not bad opening night for Nate 88 and five Cant say he hadnt seen the country right Thats why we played at 800 you know 700 Central 5 Pacific Hes ready for it Hes ready to rock and roll Oh almost got that McDonald takes advantage Going to call an offensive foul and wave it off Very good Nice job by Mesa Not afraid to take the hits Hes a former Big 10 guy Overplay the passing lane Doesnt get it Stays there Hoses position Thats an easy call above the restricted circle Yeah its nice job Theyre going to challenge that because Im not sure if all feet are there or are they not couching Lets see This is a new thing in college basketball this year They can have a coachs challenge Yeah Have to have a timeout Yep Now this is interesting cuz if if youre standing up and your heels are above the line but not on it you are clear of the restricted area And so this is get a chance to finally see the challenge rule in place Must have a timeout to challenge a call One per game If youre successful you get a second Took a timeout to challenge the previous player Im excited to see if his heels were indeed out of the restricted area Okay his heel Yeah he see how hes standing up on his tippy toes That was to make sure his heels werent on the line And I think he was successful I mean like cuz his toes are well outside His heels are close His heel is on the line but its above it Its not touching it And theres a All right here we go Well we cant see it We cant see it from this angle Tilt down Silly cameraman following the guy slashing to the basket not focusing on the feet On the feet Im just kidding Our camera crew is the best Id be surprised if this gets over But you know when I look at that that angle I wasnt sure if she was establish a defensive position a guarding position He might have been blocked successful How about that Forget what I said Im 0 for one and I think Im done speculating for the rest of the season Yeah Or at least the rest of the night I just I on further review I mean you know he hes not going to play with his tip toes I dont know Its over with They theyve established theyve thought they keep missed the free throw but still a huge challenge Takes a foul away from McDonald Gives him the bucket 10 points for McDonald in his Eagles debut Back to a 12point game Nice use of that challenge by coach Simkins Good movement there off the high screen Clean catch and fire but Coven now one for five from deep Now if youre Wake Forest you cant let up on the defensive end You can use some clock I dont care about highlight dunks anymore I dont care about all the little stuff If youre American youve got to find ways THERE YOU GO THATS YOUR DEFENSE cheering Blocked from behind by Coven It looked like he was beat off the dribble but he was just setting it all up That my friend is what an athlete looks like Watch this You beat off the bounce He says Ill meet you at the rim laughter Now Stan Van Gundy said something the other day that Id like to echo I would love to be able to jump that high just one time and see what it feels like Just to be able to hit backboard like that Well you know be a trampoline Never stop dreaming You never know The problem is then you have to land laughter Thats for certain cheering So Mason at the line closing in on 20 points in his first game as a Deak Hes also got nine rebounds and three assists to go with it But you saw right there an example of of one of the problems Wake could have against bigger basketball teams Is not the true rim protector but he did a great job of being an athlete and coming from the backside and getting the block So just something you think about Yeah we havent mentioned Wake Forest tallest player Nice back cut 12point game Again the junior transfer from Val Perezo Cooper Schwagger whos recovering from what Steve Forb said was a nasty ankle sprain He was moving around and shoot around doing noncont work today Deacons are hopeful to get him back from Michigan but they are uncertain about his status for the near future Hes going to be an important player for them I I think so Similar background to Jake Laravia who came from the Missouri Valley and obviously has done pretty well for himself And you know you talk about you watch that blop I called him He had 396 blocks on his career at Valpo So theres that guy that can be that rim protector And you can you imagine if you got a true rim protector how much more pressure you can put on the basketball if youre Wake Forest Spillers has made that move a bunch tonight Nice Finishes softly with a right hand this time 320 to play Plenty of Demon Deakons with pretty nice stat lines right now Four deaks in double figures led by Mai Masons 20 Hes also got nine boards And then you got Nate Calm Eight points nine assists five steals Only eight Deacons have played but seven of the eight have scored And Trey Spillers now has 18 Ties his uh 18 ties his career high at Wake Forest So a lot of nice things happening Back cut I I I love the fact that theyre able to get the back cuts Wake Forest was doing a great job of taking that taking the trap away and and they were able to get the cut and and finally Americas been able to take advantage Not that time though but American There you go Now hes got 20 Yeah there you go Thats a great job of beating the pressure One on the side one in the middle one over the top Finish the play America wont see pressure this tight I doubt the rest of the season You know maybe George Washington will give it to him you know in a couple days in that game but um hadnt seen GW but they theyve done a nice job in handling pressure and at times Wake Forest just kind of overwhelmed them athletically But uh I I think if youre an American Eagle fan cheering over there been arena youre going to like this basketball team Theyre going to get better cuz Jones has not had a big scoring night tonight for three Hes 11 points seven rebounds six assists So yeah done other things but look hes hes three for five from two and 0 for six from three Couple of those shots go in its a different story And the Sadus has really been to me the the offensive bright spot for this team scoring a lot of tough baskets Thats a good decision Thats what thats why that timeout I thought was so important Settle them down Lets just be efficient Run the clock Get some baskets Make your free throws Test your passes Mason with five to shoot Over Sebastian American down 15 with 204 to go Miles Culvin smiled after Roger Ays had a little message for him I mean Roger is the epitome of being in control of the game as an official and not taking yourself too seriously and enjoying your job Life is short Better enjoy it Mason just uh got the double double Cal me now has got 10 points He needs an assist for a double double Thats where youre going to love Cal Me His ability to explode pass a defender and elevate and finish his score These two guys from Washington and Washington State might have been uh two more good portal finds for the whisperer That is Steve Forbes cheering Cal mes third personal Steve laughter Forbes disagrees two shots He disagreed calmly for a moment They got thinking about it but not uh not completely cheering You know the one thing too about the guys that have come in theyre veteran players They had success you know an allconerence some place a freshman of the years type thing They were able to score So you bring in some experience along with a good bit of ability and it makes for a good mix and these are some guys that can shoot are willing to shoot Harris tough shot There you go Gets the bounce Harris going to be a tremendous open court player His ability to slash to the basket Final minute of play in the contest Nasadus now up to 19 points and Dwayne Simkins takes a timeout 15point game 587 to play Wake Forest on their way to an opening night victory music Wake Forest basketball looking to finish off this opening night win and improved to 6 and0 in season openers under Steve Forbes Stan before we leave the air Id like you to tell me who you think was Wakes player of the game tonight And its not an easy choice Its not a obvious choice I mean thats why I said who um sighs Masons probably the favorite 20 and 10 but Cal Miss defense leading to the offense Spillers was energy Spillers gave me some energy plays And Im going to tell you what Im going to do I Im Its early this season I aint gonna make any enemies Look out Juke Harris Here we go Im gonna keep my friends alive All of them were player of the game No no no no no no Thats my vote Ill give it to you Ill give I I Welcome Welcome to the conference Welcome to Wake Forest Mason And keep playing if youre American There you go Final score is going to be 8874 Calmise almost had other ideas but pretty uh
