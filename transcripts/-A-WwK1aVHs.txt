right before tip off on a Tuesday night for the wall in Uday And we are underway And Miami starts with the basketball Hurricanes 20 and five on the season nine and three in ACC play Big reason why Malik Renu denied by Lwal on the inside Battle for the board Ripped away by Trey Donaldson Donaldson scooped to the hoop to open the scoring You dont expect Trey Donaldson to go to the offensive glass Finds himself in the paint and look what he finds Weve got a whistle just as Virginia Tech crosses half court Roger has again blown play dead and gone over to the scorers table I dont know if this is what so a timing issue First possession as you saw Virginia Tech is choosing to play really great news straight up manto man You got to feel good if youre the Hokes I think they match up with this Miami team really well They have the bodies One thing that Mike Young told us is we feel like we can guard them Can we get the stop on the rebound once we cause a miss And on that first possession its an offensive rebound by the 63 Donaldson that converts two points Shot clock will be reset at 28 seconds Virginia Tech will have a complete fresh 10 seconds to get the ball across If you cannot rebound the basketball you cannot beat Miami Just plain and simple And its easier said than done against this front court and even very physical guards that have caused teams problems throughout this season Heres Ben Hammond Kick to the corner Hammond had it stolen away Reathers and now Neil Abdales 10 seconds to shoot Abdales finds Hanssbury Two seconds on the timer Bedford doesnt see the shot clock and thats a shot clock violation Outstanding defensive possession by the Hurricanes I like the matchups You bring in Dante Allen put him on Ben Hammond take Trey Donson and move him off the ball so he can chase Bford around Try to keep him fresher later in the game And we welcome those who just watched Florida States come from behind win to beat Boston College 8072 Randolph Childris Jay Alter with you in Coral Gables is our Tuesday night ACC double header continues Miami with the basketball at a two nothing lead Offensive foul called on the illegal screen there but youd be hardressed to find a team hotter than the Canes right now beating Carolina last week then going on the road and winning at NC State So their resume is secure at 20 and five and 9 and three Now fighting to get that double buy in the ACC tournament Yeah were going to find out how well they handle success Weve seen them handle adversity Theyve responded since that Cal loss here at home Now theyre feeling good Can they continue to play well with all the pats on the back Henderson the physical freshman Good ball movement Wide open Dante Allen will usually make you pay Theres another offensive rebound that leads to two points All four for the Hurricanes to start have come off the offensive glass Thats the key Virginia Tech has had two really good defensive possessions but they cant finish them because they cant rebound the basketball And the Hokes out of sorts offensively A turnover there Mike Young not happy And he knows how desperate they are for a road win tonight after that shock loss at home to Florida State Although we just watched the NLES come back and beat Boston College theyre playing as good as anybody in the last month Theyre the only team as hot as these Miami Hurricanes Thats the Seminals playing outstanding basketball here late the season Virginia Tech right now squarely on the bubble Joe Lonardi our bracketologist has them on the outside looking in So a quad one road win would go a long way for the Hokes resume Theyve yet to find their footing on the offensive end Hanssbury trying to change that Misfires Sometimes you wonder if all the noise and all the talk about the NCAA tournament is the Hokes feeling the pressure Team has played really solid basketball throughout the year and well get into three devastating losses that they had But that half second half against Florida State was under a Mike Young team like three losses at the buzzer all in ACC play Thats how they had been losing games To be blown out at home in that second half was so uncharacteristic ALLEN COUNT IT PLUS THE FOUL The steal and the score through contact Dante Allen just outstanding defense Theyre on the basketball Quick hands Dante Allens outstanding in this defensive intensity all game long Gets out in transition ahead of steam takes the contact and one We got our answer to how the Miami Hurricanes had success Theyve come out strong here in the first half Can I hope you settle down and get back to playing good basketball That last half against Florida State was a team you just didnt recognize him Well its carried over to the first three minutes in South Florida Low Virginia Tech needed it and Toby Lau delivers Its not a strength of Toby Lau knocking down threes only his eighth three of the year coming in 21 But its wide open shot Theyre going to give him that He Hanssbury is going to get as many threes as they want And the Wow was probably the biggest bright spot at that disappointing loss to Florida State Wide open the floater Great touch for Henderson Expected to see the Hokes more connected more pulled in in their gaps Miami doesnt theyre not a great shooting team You can be in your gaps and close out late Right now theyre spread out attached to guys leaving the paint open Hanssbury master of the midrange This is that one Bedford strong offensive rebound and he cleans up the spill for two Effort plays which you got to make Keep yourself in it till you start finding a way to get in rhythm and playing good ball This is the match up I think will be critical for this game as well Neo ADA size Usually Shelton Hennison overpowers guys but AD has the length Reathers Allen in the corner hits it Oh Dante Allen is redot to start this one Right Fast guard for him Six quick points already at his season average with the son of Malik Allen whos right down the road as a Heat assistant coach Dallas finds Lau this time he takes it in through contact no good draws the foul going up the court Miami one of the hottest teams in all of college basketball theyve started well in the opening five minutes up 125 Not music got our answer to that question Well during this threegame winning streak they have been pounding their opponents in the paint Outscoring them 14690 Although Renu steps out Thats certainly a shot hes capable of making Off the mark that time Now what Virginia Tech lineup does I think it forces Miami to play big Alunus to get a lot of minutes here Christian Gerdak feeds it outside finds Hansberry drives the lane lays it up and in for two And you see with Malik Preu having that one foul already he didnt want to challenge the shot from the Hokes Im going to continue to attack him with that one foul he got early Dante Allen has had the hot hand that time His foot on the line for a turnover Felic Reu likes to attack you off the bounce Even in the post he likes to dribble and spin Theyre coming when he puts it down Theyre expecting guards to dig and help They want to take the ball out of his hands and force someone else to beat him Dante Allens off to a fast start Hes going to have to continue to be aggressive Theyre going to make him be a factor in his game Kick ball took a deflection will stay Virginia Tech basketball You know we just mentioned Miamiys resume but how about the hook 179 Even though they had that shock home loss on Saturday to Florida State massive win a week ago at Clemson If you can get one today the road wins particularly in quad one like Clemson and Miami would be really bolster your resume and could be separators come selection Sunday I I couldnt agree more Jay as Gerak gives you the baseline jump hook there turning over that left shoulder I I think its one of the weirdest situations in college basketball for to see for a team thats on a bubble to lose three games the way they did the Stanford game the Wake Forest game the SNU game and to find yourself in a bubble you know I you almost find yourself cheering for the Hopes just to you rather just lose and not be on it than just to be on a bubble with losses like that Its just unfortunate But hey everythings still in front of them right now They got to find a way to get this one HAMMOND WITH A HEAD OF STEAM COAST TO coast plus the foul Oh the explosion from Ben Hammond A chance to tie it with the and one He has a gear Look at the speed here He gets it in transition to full court You dont get back You dont corral him He lives in the paint Crafty finisher Much better scorer Hes the Hokes leading scoreer in ACC play with finishes like that And after a slow start offensively on the road Virginia Tech on a 6 nothing run over the last minute and 13 seconds cheering Hammond knocks down the and one Miamis now fallen into a scoring drought and thats allowed the Hokes to go seven unanswered to tie this game If they can rebound the ball and limit Miami to one shot theyve got to feel good about their chances Weve seen them get punished early Theyre going to live with Miami If Miamis knocking down threes theyll tip their hat to him The out of the Ernest Tudday throws it down Thatll be a shot in an arm for a Miami offense is looking for one Gach was in the right position He just cant jump high enough to bother that shot If Im Miami Im going to continue to put him in ball screens And Huds had plenty of rim rockers over the course of this season A lob threat always Jay did shoot off the bench Knocks down the three and fires the Hokes in front If he can get going just adds another dimension to this Hokei group that can be a little inconsistent from behind a threepoint arc Heres True Washington He was the hero in the win against NC State Rejected on his way to the rim and then commits a frustration foul Yeah the rim blocked his shot on that one Elevating it on one side But when you got an athlete out there like Toby Low youre worried about his athleticism and shot blocking presence Try to use the rim for protection The rim ends up blocking your shot Virginia Tech has made their last four shots and now nose in front for the first time tonight Shu same spot same result Backto back threes for Jaden Shu We saw them work on this play in shoot around today Come out and execute it to perfection trying to get Jaden shoot going Donaldson so crafty right to the rim for the immediate answer Youve got to me show on those ball screens You got to do whatever you need to to keep him out of the paint So much of the offense is generated by his scoring and creativity off the bounce Stolen away Donaldson doing it on both ends Miami loves to go defense to offense quickly that time Good transition defense to make Miami battle in the half court Donaldson everything but the finish Tapped out of bounds and itll stay Miami basketball Kanes down two Look at him to throw beach balls music around the crowd here at Coral Gables Over under one and a half that finds their way onto the court over the next 20 minutes of play Ones already over there laughter Fun on a Tuesday night in the ACC Yeah Who came up with this Yeah laughter This will be the last time this happens Jab the beach ball Yeah we going to make the announcement here telling everybody get him off the court Could have seen that coming I guarantee after that warning you will never see beach balls given out of the game again laughter So the next one would be a technical foul Everybody hold on to your beach ball Yeah Yeah And Miami remains on possession Shot clock ticks under 10 though Not much time for Shelton Henderson down the lane Lel had a block with his hand but called for the foul with the body Hes just levitating in the air and waiting on Sheldon Ellison to come into him He does a great job of getting from behind I thought he did a really good job there going vertical and just blocking his shot Fortunate for him Its just his first Henderson makes the first Well the freshman a player they just cant take him off the court Hes been so valuable to Miami particularly in ACC play Nearly 60 from the floor 14 and a half points per game He does so many things for him He he can initiate offense Hes a secondary post option for him when Riku is out of the game when you know they go to him a lot I think its good an offensive rebounder from the wing spot that we have in this league and and a really underrated outstanding defender Hansbury going right at Henderson going to spin his way free Kicks it out Those are two large human beings right there in the post Tried to squeeze it to Kurdak and said its a turnover Nobody takes turnovers into points as much as Miami Drew Washington will have an opportunity to shoot two here But Jay thats what were talking about about Shelton Henderson that time Hes guarding Hansbury in the post That need help Forces a turnover and theyre out running Oh Drew Washington at the foul line was the hero in Raleigh to cap what was an incredible eight nothing run in the final minute to steal that win on the road And it came down to Washington with three free throws down two and he made all three to secure that win Even more impressive when you consider he missed the previous three games with personal reasons and comes right back into the fold and becomes the hero He changes things for this group You had to be a little bit concerned without him in the lineup Youre talking about a really good twoway player Another offensive rebound here A really good twoway guard Also a secondary ball handling when needed Now particularly now with True Don Trey Donaldson out of the lineup Bedford lost the handle Henderson has it Threeon two And Henderson lays it up and in Coast to coast for Shelton Henderson That is the identity of this team all season long Miami they will create turnovers and turn them into points The Hopes youre better off taking bad shots than getting turnovers You cannot allow Miami out in transition They have punished teams all season long Speaking of punishing Hanssbury in the post but well defended Henderson again not backing down And once again Miami takes a turnover and cashes in on the other end Lets see Now we talked about Shelton Henderson now slides to the four Another good job defending Hansbury to post Miami on an eight nothing run Fourpoint lead for the Canes Theyve done it with defense that time A little too aggressive I mean look at Sheldon Henderson here in the post takes away the spin A lot of contact stays in bounds Dante Allens been really good here Just attacking you in transition Whats incredible about Miamis threegame winning streak including those wins against Carolina and on the road to NC State theyve only shot 24 from three and just 54 from the foul line And yet the way theyre able to create turnovers and punish you in the paint overcompensates Yes they dominate you with two for those deficiencies They dominate you with two They get out in transition and get to the rim and the offensive rebounding It just shows you their formula that you dont have to be a great threepoint shooting team Hansbury tried to bring in the rebound onehanded dispossessed Miami eight nothing run over the last three minutes looking for more lost the handle up ahead Abdales trying to squeeze it to Bedford reathers I think hes the guy Abdales Neil Abdales he needs to get going here pass good no look pass but a great finish on the inside Antonio Dorne off a great feed from ADA I think hes so much better as a secondary ball handler started off at the point guard position earlier has some struggles and I think as he offg guard Last couple of games hed been without turnovers Showing you hes starting to turn a corner Malovitz misfires from three Bedford wide open transition triple Nothing but the bottom of the net and that puts Virginia Tech back in front The Hokes will run when the opportunity presents itself Youve got to sprint back and match up They look for a ton of threes in transition Got to corral the ball Donaldson NOBODY PICKED HIM UP AND TREY Donaldson will make you pay Great job there getting the dribble hand off and turned the corner and hit the gas and no one was there 18 of Miamis 24 points have come in the paint Hanssbury the immediate answer I think hes so much better catching the basketball on a move like that instead of just giving it to him in the post trying to back you down Hes better facing you on a move I think thats where he and Malik Reo are similar Back and forth we go on a Tuesday night in the ACC Five lead changes in this first half Two teams that feel like they need this win to bolster their tournament resumes Young looking to do the same thing Lonardi has the hooks on the outside looking in Next four out behind Cal whose first four out Well a road win against a redhot 20 and5 Miami team will certainly help the Hokes resume Okay theyre off to a fast start here and theyre theyve given themselves a chance Dug themselves in a hole early Theyve come out swinging now Got themselves back in this game You got to feel good if youre Mike Young right now Good defensive stand out of the timeout Miamis a lot more effective going inside just one of six for three 18 points in the paint Hogs have knocked down four threes here in the first half A Dallas another great feed Dorne all alone and hes had two easy buckets Here Dallas there with the vision coming off the ball screen at 69 just waiting and looking and is that tag guy Youve got to get in front of the basketball HENDERSON A ONEHANDED HAMMER Shelton Henderson I dont blame you if youre a Virginia Tech Hokei defender I wouldnt want to get in front of him either 66 240 Rock the rim onehanded Running through the A gap Hanssbury a three Buries it The immediate answer Ammani Hanssbury Hookies with five threes here in the first half Theyve given up layups and giving up threes See if Jay Lucas try to throw some zone in and throw the Hokes off guard right now Theyre starting to have their way Virginia Techs knocked down their last five shots and Miamis gone cold Hoke starting to swing momentum A Dallas thought about the three drove in jump ball possession arrow stays with Virginia Tech here just turns the corner no one gets in front of him and I dont blame him once he elevates he knows what hes going to do when on the other end theyre just really Neil Aales comes off hes just picking them apart giving up the layup the possession before that time he founds Pansbury for the wide open three Virginia Tech is shooting 66 12 of 18 from the floor Getting quality looks and knocking them down on the road Easier said than done Bedford pull up pop No good Long rebound finds Henderson Dante Allen leads all scorers from Miami with eight Do into the game off the bench tried to squeeze it to Uday and its a turnover right now Miamis not matched up Doat had to commit the foul Total mismatch against Christian Gerdak Dovak giving up 45 lbs in that matchup on the block Yeah another turnover on Miami When you turn it over like that you just got to scramble back and grab a body do a complete mismatch there Try to get around in front end commitment foul A lot of pace to the offense right now for Virginia Tech Gerak its too easy Freshman left all alone and Jay Lucas calls a timeout Like hey we did not we dont need to worry about the resume thing Lets just take care of business basketball right now Everythings working and executing at a high level If they can just take care of the basketball they got seven turnovers here so far Hope he maybe can get out of Coral Gables with the win Donaldson who will usually deliver when Miami needs him most When they go through a scoring drought usually its number three that will drag them out of it Got a good look but just couldnt finish it on the inside Jay I think in moments like this he has to involve himself in the game and hes so unselfish but its really hard just to hit that button to start scoring He does it as well as anyone but I think he needs to get more aggressive offensively That rims in and one opportunity coming for Malik Renu Boy Miami needed that and Reneu delivers Hes just determined here Get you on that block He loves to get to that left hand The plan was for Bedford to dig and get the ball out of his hand They knew not to be denied So tomorrow night Wednesday night double header right here on ACC Network Clemson and Winston Salem taking on Wake Forest And then its ranked Virginia in Atlanta against Georgia Tech The games are coming fast and furious now in February Everybody jockeying for positioning in the ACC tournament Absolutely Its a moving time Every game either helps you or hurts you You got teams battling for different things For Miami its that double buy in the ACC tournament Want to be in that top four For Virginia Tech you want as many wins as you can to climb those ACC standings to get into the NCAA tournament Then you got the teams at the bottom just trying to make the ACC tournament because the bottom three will miss out Last five games the AC season will be a lot to be determined Oki started slow Two of their first six but theyre 11 of 14 since They have caught fire on the road Two seconds to shoot Jaden Shute does just that Offensive rebound Low sends it right back Shoot got two good looks Couldnt connect on either one of them He knocked down his first two shots Definitely want to keep beating him Renu steps out for three Missed it Good look by Renu Shooting 36 from three Theyre going to give him that shot Low going right at Renew Lost the handle Virginia Tech reathers Shot clock ticks down to 10 Three minutes remaining in this first half Offbalance floater doesnt drop for Antonio Dorn Dorne you want running right to the rim Not shooting floaters going to the basket there Had he rolled a little harder I think he gets a layup Allen lines up a three Missed it And now the message is sent home Multiple hogies got grabbing that rebound And Miami just one for nine from three in this first half They havent been a good threepoint shooting team all season They do compensate for that with their points in the paint and their foul shooting Hammond fires a deep three Rims out No good Both of these teams starting to settle for threes right now Well I expect Miami to go back into their zone and and just force Virginia Tech I dont think either team is great I think the biggest difference in the game is James Shooter is probably the best shooter on the floor right now Everyone else Id protect the paint and then close out late Easier said than done Donaldson curling off the screen Floater doesnt fall Grabs his own offensive rebound Blocked from behind Donaldson denied Virginia Tech has numbers Hammond transition three No good Great look Just couldnt bear it And now Henderson trying to go coast to coast Out of control Off the mark Got numbers again If they push it dont settle for three Great pass and a rim rocker on the inside Antonio Dorne Hokes had numbers and they used them just keeping fresh bodies on the floor Other hookies I think one key factor to look out for is the bench scoring will be a big part of this game Miami as I said before starting five is as good as any in college basketball but not a lot of production from the bench 16 bench points for Virginia Tech to Miamis one and the Hokes of F had a really strong start Mound teams are starting to settle in defensively right now Miami is giving a little token pressure I think theyre going to fall back into this zone again I thought Miami was car mean uh Virginia Tech was carving up Miamis mantoman defense So see how the hooks attack this zone A Dallas fires from three off the mark M Miami only has one made basket in the last 5 and 12 minutes of game time But Virginia Tech has failed to separate because theyve gone into a slump offensively Both teams in a scoring drought right now Miami is ticking near four minutes Donaldson right down the lane Nobody picked him up and Trey Donaldson makes it a onepossession game Its a great job there by Ernest Hudday just running to the rim sealing Gerak underneath the basket allowing Trey Donaldson an easy layup Hokes holding for the final shot of this first half 5 seconds left in it Hanssbury Hand off for Shu Didnt get it off in time Halftime comes at the perfect time for the Hokes Its defense for both of these teams Virginia Tech missed eight of their last 10 Miami missed seven of their last nine So both teams had an opportunity to swing momentum Virginia Tech could have separated by more Miami could have taken the lead and both missed an opportunity And that is a credit to the defensive adjustments you were talking about Yeah I I thought both teams did a really good job And you see from there Miami tries to come out and run an isolation getting Henderson his right hand with new ADA uses his 69 length Of course bad shot and a rebound Shot clock ticks down to five Heres Hammond Hanssbury has to fire it at the end of the shot clock Missed it Its a good look Good possession there Good half court forward execution Youre okay with going in shooting slump taking shots like that Theyre not forcing shots Renu spins into a double team Fights through it Sends it back up top to Donaldson Renu only five points in that first half aggressive here to start the second and draws the foul Thats a bad defensive possession there by La Wild going for the shot fake Ray knew was a capable shooter I dont you know theres no reason to go for hes doing you a favor when hes out there Youre often coached taught be the second guy to jump Dont go for shot fakes for a guy whos not a great threepoint shooter One more One more We just talked about only one free throw in the first half and now put him on the line Hocus got him trying to find a way to get to the free throw line Oh Renu has been Mr Consistent all season long since transferring in from Indiana They will need him in this second half after only five in the first half But that has happened to him a couple of times this season And he always gets to double figures or more though Hes just a gift to score He knows what he is and he knows how to score They do a great job of putting him in positions to score He dictates your ball screen coverage Hes really good in the post Abdales going against U Lost the handle Balls to Donaldson Trey Donaldson one on two Got L in the air again and cashes in to put Miami back in front Ray Donaldson got two for one on that side Better in the air and then Lau came on to help and he got him in the air as well Four nothing run to start this second half for Miami That falls off the rim No good for Low Miamis just so physical with their first five Dialed in defensively to start this second half Pull up Pop Donaldson hits it He has to get going I think he waits some time let the game come to him but hes got to be more aggressive looking to score more so he doesnt put so much pressure on himself to have to answer the bell in the last 5 minutes Hanssbury wide open and it rims in a friendly roll on the road to tie it at 37 Sometimes its better to be lucky than good Allen too much on it Balls out Renu and Miami can reset Hurricanes have eight second chance points tonight Looking for a couple more here Renu spins through a double team Goes up strong Muscles it home Malik Renu The Wilds made a couple of errors here and Malik Renus made him pay for it You got to stay on that left hand Make him turn over that right that left shoulder Cant let him get back to that left hand Low trying to tone for the defensive miscues with a three that he left short Stole it away Bedford has Hammond up ahead and Hammond didnt have the height advantage Went right into Renew whos got nine in on him Puts it off the window and in to tie it at 39 Yeah hes really good at getting in the rim finishing among the Giants What a game Back and forth we go Donaldson in traffic Got it Trey Donaldson He is feeling it right now Thats what you want to see from him Stay aggressive Continue to attack the rim Hammond to three off a beautiful crosscourt feed from AD Dallas Ben Hammond a huge three and Virginia Tech back in front by one Lets just fast forward this Jay We can go down to under a minute I think this game will be a onep possession game Thats how close and competitive I think itll be Certainly has that feel Just watch these two teams The effort theyre exerting Hansbury misses the layup in transition Matters so much to both of these teams Henderson The explosion counted for two Shelton Henderson Hammond Were going coast to coast Both of these teams all out How fun is this We got a track meet going on right now Two teams refusing to lose But with the pace this is where the depth of Virginia Tech can take advantage of this game Donaldson you could tell he was tired Hands on hips walking off the court lost the handle as Virginia Whats incredible Randolph Childris It might not be the best story with a school involving Miami That might belong to Miami University in Oxford Ohio winning again tonight 260 The only undefeated team left in the nation The other thing is this league has been so great The coach has been so good That doesnt mean Jay Lucas will even win ACC coach of the year That race is so close He certainly put himself in contention He might he might get our votes but that doesnt mean hes going to get the award Yeah So many I think thats the hardest decision thatll be made for the voters this year is who wins the ACC coach of the year Take Shy and what hes done for granted there and Brian ODM in Virginia and Jay Lucas just I think even Mark Matson deserves some votes for what hes done at Cal Shot clock down to two Also doesnt recognize it 3 seconds away from a shot clock violation The best you can do is heave it at the hoop and hope for a tip in Its a really good defensive lineup in right now for Miami Hanssbury didnt get it off in time Shot clock violation A lot of length on the floor right now for the Hurricanes So they have a lot of ability to switch You go to Jay Lucas and their plus 13 wins from last season most in division one How has he done it Randolph Well I think hes just identified the coach and how he wanted to play I think whats more impressive than just the the players that hes got is just how hes doing it Theyre not falling in love with the threepoint line Hes got a bigger group with a lot of positional size really tough physical defensive group thats dominating teams from the twopoint line and really one of the average threepoint shooting teams in in the ACC Up ahead of Dallas hammers it home twohanded slam It is Virginia Tech thats taking a page out of Miamis playbook and upping the tempo and making them pay in transition And thats the downside of it Jay When you play that way and you dominate from two that way you cant turn the basketball over You got to get back cuz the Hokes right now are knocking down threes They have seven threes already and its great equalizer when youre so efficient from two You look at the stat sheet one thing glaring Randolph Virginia Tech 16 assists to Miamis five Now its only a threepoint game but Virginia Tech in much better rhythm right now Yeah just forcing turnovers there A Dallas gets out and gets the easy money again No Trey Donaldson not in the lineup Youre trying to get him in Its be interesting to see how long just that quick he comes right back in the game And yeah you look down and hes right back in Yeah you cant leave him down long just a different team Hes just Malik Ray knew their best player but their most important player is Trey Donaldson Certainly in close games down the stretch it has been Donaldson who has been the catalyst for Miami Hanssbury in the post Righty hook Well defended by Henderson You would never believe he is a freshman Shelted Henderson Grown man out there defensively Hes been as good as defenders Ive seen in the ACC all year long Id agree with that I mean just versatile defense every position on the floor And Virginia Tech answers with an incredible defensive stop of their own The chess match between these two incredible coaches We were just talking about first year head coach Jay Lucas for Miami Mike Young for Virginia Tech The adjustments they have made throughout this game Both teams so dialed in to the game plan defensively They have And the one thing that the Hokes have at their advantage is Mike Youngs doing a great job Hes throwing bodies in there now Hes playing a long game He knows this game is going to come down to the end He want to have five fresh bodies on the floor in the last 5 minutes Earlier this year you would think Miami cant go fast enough Theyll play at anybodys tempo but it seems like Virginia Tech has been the more conditioned team tonight Contact no call Henderson rolls right through it all the way to the rim Misses the layup Battle for the board one by TR Washington and a foul called Now what Miami does to combat the depth issues is they go zone and right now weve seen in this game closing the first half and that last possession the Hokes are struggling right now against that matchup I mean that two3 zone and theyre going to have to get a playmaker in the free throw line Theyre flashing their front line and big guys in the center Dornes not looking at the basket Donaldson lines up the three Got it He just he does it so much and so often for the Miami group when they need it when theyre struggling he is their guy Just the second made three tonight Donaldson 17 points The immediate answer Jaylen Bedford And right now offensively theyre right in front of their bench The assistant coaches were telling Doran to screen Donaldson in the middle of that zone so he could not rotate over and pick up the ball Bedford got the easy layup So Miami and Virginia Tech Not much to separate these two teams Its got all the making Can they close it out A game that has seen four lead changes this half Three ties Largest lead by either team since halftime is just three It has stayed a one possession game back and forth Close competitive throughout Shot clock ticks down to five Washington into attack MODE LOBS IT UP ONEHANDED Ernest on a rack attack What can you say Jay I think they have that play there all game long and its on the guards for Virginia Tech to tag on that weak side Dawn and Gerak just dont have the athleticism to alter Us shot at the rim Badford the floater Not nearly as many style points but it counts the laughter same Doesnt look as good doesnt were going to want a another couple of looks at that alleyoop when we get a break of the action Went back to the same action again that time Got a better show from Ben Hammond And lets see if they go right back to U Sets the screen here Kick to the corner Donaldson a three Missed it Uday rips down the rebound Nine offensive rebounds for Miami Theyve turned it into 10 second chance points WHAT A CROSSOVER WASHINGTON FLIES TO the rim Count it plus the foul Thats what happens when you give up the lob as a big You dont want to show anymore because youre worried about the defender getting behind you your leg back and then you dont stop the basketball You give up this lob here Next possession down youre doing youre thinking I got to get back and take care of lob Give up an and one opportunity here And you got to come out of the game shooter in As you can hear Mike Young barking out instructions to his group right in front of us and tell by the voice he knows how important this game is for his group trying to make those adjustments after Miami found a breakdown on backto back sets there Washington cant complete the and one so it stays tied at 50 Hes going with Lal at the Hayesbury at the five Give him a little bit more athleticism Bedford step back three Burries it Jaylen Bedford the biggest shot of the night for the transfer from Oral Roberts Eighth made three for the Hokes to only two for Miami The Canes continue to pound it inside to no avail that time Bedford feeling it right now Turnaround fade away Cant connect Hansbury has the rebound and cleans up the spill Thats clinical what you want to do He sets the screen first on the dribble handoff Before turns the corner he gets the switch and was not to be denied on the offensive glass Thats what you want to see from your big man Donaldson lost the handle waiting for the officials whistle They say itll stay Miami basketball I mean Washington snatches him out of his shoes and the step back three Kingsbury there just not to be denied on the offensive glass And Virginia Tech wants a coachs challenge here The officials did hesitate but they so Mike Young successful with his coachs challenge Hokes fivepoint lead 919 remaining in a game that could be the difference come selection Sunday and making the field at 68 and dancing in March thats staying home I think its a mustwin game for the Hokes Give themselves a chance Still a lot of work to be done even if theyre able to hold on these last nine minutes because the Miami Heat I mean Hurricanes are not going anywhere This has been a battle throughout Five points is actually the largest lead for either team in the second half Hammond misfires Heres Dante Allen Hes cooled off after a strong start Done a really good job of keeping him out of the rim And as I say that he gets a ride on the layup Easy run right down the lane Nobody picked up the freshman His first basket of this second half Back to a onep possession game Got an advantage inside Hansbury Hes wide open now Dallas didnt see him Now Dallas is trying to spin free Feeds it inside to Lau whos fouled for Virginia Tech Randolph Jaylen Bedford has three of their last four You think theyd look at number zero who hasnt touched it on the last two possessions Theyve just done a great job sharing the basketball They got 16 assists on 23 made field goals They just got to continue to move their bodies and move the ball Theyve gotten great opportunities when they shared the basketball Theyve got themselves in trouble when theyve gone too much oneonone Good ball movement here Finds Hansbury Hammond on a mismatch Finds Bedford Corner three off the mark Offensive rebound Hanssbury again Ammani Hanssbury He has been a beast on the boards He is punishing that switch Dante Allen has his hand full Hes unable to block him out and corral the basketball and Hanssburys made him pay for it Pull up pop off the mark Donaldson Henderson flies in to corral the rebound A foul brings us to a stop in the action Now 10 offensive rebounds for Miami K music So Miami with the basketball trailing by five Got to feel good if youre Miami because you got Trey Donaldson and hes having himself a game here But he needs help Donaldson draws contact again putting his body on the line When he puts his mind to it he can create get in the paint whenever he wants and he usually allows the game to come to him I think sometimes hes too unselfish but tonight the Hulk defense is not going to allow Malik Reu to beat them and its going to force him to be more active Thats the fourth foul against Toby Lau You mentioned Donaldson Hes been the leading scoreer for Miami with 17 points More of a balanced scoring for Virginia Tech Hammond and Hanssbury leading the way but a group effort for the Hokes on the road where for Miami it really just has been Donaldson particularly in this second half Well thats why you got to be concerned if youre the Miami Hurricanes because they they are doubling Renu is going to draw a crowd So theyre going to force others to beat them right now Ernest and do he needs guys on lob He scores in a dunker spot and lobs and so its a lot of pressure on these guards and right now Hendersons got to find a way to get going And I think Dante Allens done his his fair share right now A lot on the shoulders of Trey Donson A Renu out of this game right now And he is not at a basket in 10 minutes And yet Miami without their most consistent player has been battling on One possession game Just a threepoint lead for the Hokes Virginia Tech with the basketball Hansbury in attack mode That rims in Ammani Hanssbury starting to take over Those two offensive rebound putbacks got him some confidence now He had that look in his eye when he caught the pass on perimeter faking that DHO Ansbury with nine second half points leading the way for Virginia Tech Donaldson trying to do it himself buries it Trey Donaldson on a step back three makes it a twopoint game Hes an eraser Hes just an ultimate closer Not every team has one but the Miami Hurricanes they have a guy that is winning those moments and he shine brightly more times than not cheering Bedford trying to quiet this crowd Feeds Hansberry Scorching hot Missed it there Offensive rebound cheering Gerak keeps it alive Shot clock did not reset Gives us a stop in the action with 617 remaining Virginia Tech with the basketball at a twopoint lead music I think itll be 17 seconds left I think he rebounded at 620 Thats exactly what itll be We have just been told by the way Malik Renu is questionable to return Came out of this game with nine points sometime in this second half And weve just been told the official word from the Miami Athletic Department is he is questionable Thats a big blow Lets hope its nothing serious I didnt see anything I didnt see what play caused the incident but next man up mentality right now Well you read that stat that I just did a minute ago that he hasnt scored in 10 minutes and then you to play smaller But lets see now if Gak or Dorne can have an impact on this game with their size and physicality Heres Neo A Dallas launches into the attack cheering Feeds Gearak backing down Uday Shot clock at one Terak doesnt realize it and thats a shot clock violation What a defensive stand by Miami Those are usually things that goes Mike Youngs way Attos that time Hurricanes up to the task Great defensive possession there Heres Henderson Got the switch Donaldson missed it that time Falls to Allen Another offensive rebound You got to be concerned about the rebounding because now with the smaller lineup theyre spreading you out Now remember Shelton Henderson is at the four making 13 offensive rebounds tonight for Miami Donaldson trying to punish the Hokes He wants the ball in his hands and for good reasons in attack mode right to the rim for two Donaldson ties it at 59 Kernak doesnt want to rotate over because hes afraid of giving up the lob to Ernest Uday Trey Dawson just turns the corner and gets the layup after two offensive rebounds 19 second chance points Five minutes to play cheering HANSSBERRY DRIBBLES BY EVERYBODY HE HAD A LAYUP and he lost the handle He did His eyes got big there He saw the rim and was ready to make a poster Just slips out of his hand That would have been the easiest finish of the night for either one of these teams Yeah Again he faked the dribble handoff before he got the layup and tried it again He was looking up His eyes got big and he lost the handle Everything going for Donaldson in crunch time Has it again WHAT A MOVE TREY Donaldson backto back baskets and he fires Miami in front I think you got to go if youre Mike Young You got to go with Low with four fouls and Hanssbury at your four and five Theyre going to pick on Dak with this small lineup Bedford missed it Miami leading for the first time since it was 4342 at the 1531 mark Trying to close it out at home Four minutes to play Twominute lead Donaldson keeps calling his own number That rims out everything but the finish Virginia Tech has numbers Gerach ties it and Mike Young takes a timeout after the freshman has tied this game at 61 New who hasnt played in 12 minutes or do you stick with the hot hand in Donaldson He needs a couple of possessions He set out an extended amount of time game time let alone actually he needs to get in the game break a sweat get going again and really doesnt have a lot of time Donaldson has taken five of Miamis last six shots Hes made three of them Allen for three Missed it Got numbers if you push it A speeds up the court Bedford slows it down And now heres Jaden Shute Ben Hammond been quiet for his standards Goes into the trees here Kicks it out Badford trying to shake free Good ball movement Finds Low Toby Low puts the Hokes on top I think this is a really good lineup for the Hokes now with Hsbury and Lau at the four and five Thats a heck of a move there by Bethford not to turn that over takes it behind his back and then passes it to his teammate in traffic Now this has been highlevel hoops AND HOW ABOUT THE HUSTLE THREEON Low hammers it home Virginia Tech a fourpoint lead Backto back baskets for Toby LW Timeout Jay Lucas Virginia Tech on Tuesday night against Clemson now looking for another road win tonight to bolster the Hokes NCAA tournament resume A fourpoint lead 2 minutes and 20 seconds remaining Trying to hold on to a critical quad one victory Trey Donaldson of the Hurricanes have other ideas though Donaldson pull up pop Got it Jay hes just the ultimate closer You and I have done a bunch of Miami games and as I told you I think hes as good a closer as there is in college basketball and he has put this team on his back in the second half Can they get stopped now Donaldson a new careerhigh 28 points Will it be enough Twopoint game Minute 45 to play A lob lau gathers very patient going against Renew that rims out no good Offensive rebound lau second effort and a foul call You couldnt even hear the whistle Thats how loud it is in Coral Gables down the stretch of this game Did you see how high he threw the lop first little while ago up and get it just to gather himself and great effort Very important Virginia Tech has only taken one free throw all night that belonged to Ben Hammond Lel whos been on the bench with four fouls misses the first And when you are out of rhythm thrust into this pressure situation it is so difficult to execute 74 free throw shooter Got the second Its a threepoint lead for Virginia Tech You have to expect the ball is going to be in the hands of number three Trey Donaldson 28 points a careerhigh tonight Fires a three drills it TREY DONALDSON DELIVERS ties it at 66 Hammond through contact and a foul called cheering With a minute and 1 seconds remaining you can feel the emotion pouring out of these players Weve seen it since tip off Both teams desperate for this win I mean Trey Donaldson comes off here and again hes the hottest player on the floor Down three Not anymore Toby Las got to come up We have ourselves a tie game here A lot of emotion Now Miami has fouls to give Even after that foul committed theyve only committed four So they can get physical here in the final minute Hanssbury trying to spin his way free Lau gathers looking for THE KICK OUT HENDERSON SOMEHOW FROM HIS BACK TO WASHINGTON NO GOOD WASHINGTON MISSED THE LAYUP Bedford a three No good Battle for the board Miami has it And the Hurricanes could slow things down Jay Lucas takes a timeout 7 seconds Miami Youre not worried about the shots Theyre going to get the last shot either way You just need to worry about executing him Donaldson who has scored the last 12 points for Miami a careerhigh 31 has the ball in his hands 20 seconds to go Watch the clear out giving him his right hand Donaldson goes right into Lau Thats his fifth Toby Lel has fouled out of this game And Trey Donaldson will now go to the line to shoot one and one to put Miami in front with 12 and a half seconds to play Yeah they tried to run it clear out giving Trey Donson his right hand Wild did the right thing He stepped up and just the veteran presence of Trey Donison tried to run the go screen and so out of this game with five fouls Virginia Tech does have two timeouts here as Donaldson steps to the line for a one and one You have to make the first to earn the second Jay Lucas has gotten a masterclass performance from his senior veteran guard Donaldson a careerhigh 31 points Mike Young with the timeout Hes trying to freeze him Give him something to think about You like that decision I think its worth it Now you have to So even has to make the first to earn the second Tied at 66 The weight of this game on Donaldsons shoulders Got it And his careerhigh ticks up to 32 And more importantly Miami has the lead Dont assume to make You got to box out here Rattles out NO GOOD BATTLE FOR THE BOARD Virginia Tech has it 8 seconds left Hammond splits two And Miami with that foul to give Smartly commits the foul at half court That is a great foul his speed in open court Would have been an open layup there Great wherewithal and understanding game situation to commit the foul here Heads up play by Drew Washington Absolutely That would have been an uncontested layup Could it be a game saving play And Miami still has one foul to give So they can commit another one in the final 6 seconds Heres Hammond And that foul comes in So now theres no safety net The next foul would send Virginia Tech to the free throw line So Miami will have to defend the final 38 seconds without fouling Yeah Mike Youngs going to call a timeout here 3 seconds left You got to interrupt something Remaining Randolph says Mike Young will likely give it to Hammond Jay Lucas decided to use his final timeout wanted to get a look at how both teams finally out of timeouts Here we go Neo Abdal the inbound guard on one space They get it to Hammond Ben Hammond lost the footing BALLS OFF THE RIM NO GOOD AND MIAMI hangs on
