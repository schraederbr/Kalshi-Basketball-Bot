position ready to score the basketball buto dials up another three and he buries it m St Marys by Applause six underneath Matthew Cleveland too strong and a whistle on the floor the foul not Miami it was Cordelia the senior who came down with a rebound and who was fouled now the keys of the game this afternoon here in Miami oh Mount St Mars for them Jack theyve got to find a way to limit the turnovers theyre averaging over 15 turnovers a game and for Miami when the bench is in theyve been really really good accounting for more than 30 of their scoring this season yeah I mean we got to keep that up I mean M Mar hasnt turned the ball over it look like we need to limit our turnovers right now University Miami do on that side KES with a bucket in just one nearly four minutes in now ly kid backs him down low in the paint spins around right hand hook shot no good but it rolled off the fingertips of R Jr and Miami will retain gain possession of the basketball you know one thing I see with the University of Miami basketball team the other side bench is just full of energy when you look down at University of Miamis bench everybodys just kind of down there acting very cool not standing up not giving your team energy and I think thats why this basketball team sometimes starts out kind of slow the energy isnt flowing throughout the team you need the bench to feed you energy especially when youre into some losing streaks youre looking for an answer Miami having a hard time inbounding the basketball and uku just threw it away and it rolled off the fingertips of AJ State McCrae another turnover by Miami look at that mount look at that Mount St Marys bench down those guys are loud theyre hype and you SC if you look down at the Miami bench but just kind of quiet and cool man we got to we got to really Step Up led by yeah Donnie Lyn in his first season has the boys playing well early over four minutes in theres a whistle its an offensive foul and were going to head to break foul Javon Irvin the junior out of Tacoma Washington early it is Mount St Marys by six e e e e Mount St Marys has a sixpoint lead over Miami over four minutes in here on this Saturday afternoon the canes are led by Jim larena in his 14th season he is one win shy of 275 here in Miami and he has six wins shy of 8 100 in his career and for Mount St Marys they are under the direction of first year head coach Donnie Lind who was a 2010 graduate of lyola its assisted by Keith Chesley Dave Maturo and Jeremy Freeman and a stopage in play it is Miami basketball coming out of the

afternoon trailing by four Applause was nearly thrown away Co out making sure they put the score a little fast every point you can get three on the shot clock firing away and missing was orlandis keys so here come the KES throwing it up with the right hand and getting it to go is AJ State McCrae great take great Pace thats what you want to see from this hurricane basketball team you dont want to wait till the half court offense to get a B you got to get the rebound and push the basketball you have four or five bar handlers out there that can get the ball and go they got to get the ball up Court no good three Miami Defenders were there nobody could come down with the rebound so an offensive rebound for Mount St Murrays another opportunity until it was swiped Away by Brandon Johnson Divine needs to take that ball and push trying to get a bucket for himself if he gets cut off then you dish it out hes being very passive right now quick trigger by state McCrae is three missed the mark count within two nearly 6 minutes in and ukuku is going to be assessed the foul fou with Xavier lip the graduate student out of Washington Music DC aabo and Wilson check back in for the Mountaineers and Jalil Betha fivestar true freshman checks in for the first time today for Miami again they are still without Nigel pack Nigel is much needed for this team leadership scoring ability just hes been here before hes played at the highest level you want to have a guy like that on the floor with you at all times and orlandis keys was hounded there in the paint good defense Bea kicks it out for Brandon Johnson Fades away for three and that was way too strong I love that play by J gets the ball he gets in the paint and gets his teammate a shot you need early offense when youre struggling offensive you got to get early offense you need guys that arent afraid to get in the paint and make a play three on the way looks good but its two to strong Matthew Cleveland with a rebound Miami with numbers in transition and Cleveland has it sent into the second row hes going to end up at the free throw line FS on orlandis Keys heres another Music look little too much contact so Matthew Cleveland headed to the free throw line he is a 72 free throw shooter this season and he connects on the Applause first one thing we seen with this University Mi basketball team they get to a late start I havent seen a game where theyre getting out to a quick start they got to pick up the energy and get a faster start theres a takeway clev would thought about spotting up for three that

afternoon and a 75 free throw shooter this season if he makes this shot and he missed it and has the rebound statement is locked tied at 64 three minutes left to go what a game and the Hurricanes probably thinking to themselves it never should have been now Blackman was pester p and he was pushed before the shot never heard somebody say pester Define the word pester basketball bug him a little

26 Pacho we heard from peo in a minute tough pass for the lead yes Irvin rolls it in last by two last time I said Irving I miss Irving Johnson cuz that play was magic the hurricane this game its going to be tragic oh he had it s of the way what a block you know Universe remind me being at home you want to see the crowd get into this basketball game the crowd is very very silent right now ohy what a block by aabo up top Pacho steps into one hands it off look at the ball movement canes are all over the place three on the shot clock down low taken away look could you L to be aggressive on this move up and into with the left hand you cant teach that cannot teach that 1 minute and 30 seconds your freshman goes down tying the game hes got 13 thatll tie a career high 66 all Pacho for three no good ly kid with a rebound a minute left to go here in Miami Applause Music and Miami will settle things down they miss Mount St marus can hold on to the ball for the final possession with a chance to win it well they give it to Bea they give it to the kid freshman Cleveland bombs away no good 35 seconds left to play aggressive up no good off offensive rebound by lipam and its Miami basketball with 29 seconds left to play and head coach Donnie Lyn wants the officials to go over to the scores table to take a look to make sure that it is indeed Miami basketball they sing in that run it back thats a new trend everybody run it back run it back little twirl I couldnt see it what do you think huh well have to get another look I I did not see it clear go lets see all right now off of Mount St Marys yeah that rolled off the right shoulder of Cordelia it would appear and it watch the right shoulder G it rolled right off the right shoulder of Cordelia and it will be Miami basketball a chance to win in 29 seconds left to play he was in the right place at the wrong time so as a coach here tied at 66 youve got the ball shot clock is off you hold it for the last possession correct of course you hold for last shot and you want to get the ball going downhill you what do you want to see him do here I want to get the ball going downhill to the basket forcing the ref to call a foul if Im coach L right now Im throwing it inside forcing him to double Im throwing it inside early not looking to score just throwing it inside to see if they come the double to get the skip out to the pass skip out pass and then we make a play so Im throwing in the paint around 13 seconds 11 seconds hopefully they bring the double if they dont we score if they do bring the double we swing the ball out get an open shot well the last thing you want to do is miss it too early and give the Mountaineers a heavy Underdog in this game a chance to win it at the buzzer definitely a heavy Underdog for Miami worst case scenario should they miss it at the buzzer they could always be welcome to an extra 5 minutes here today I say you throw the ball in the paint around 9 seconds 9 10 11 seconds if the double doesnt come you know you got a 75 80 chance that Lincolns going to make that shot the double does come swing that ball out look for a shot now you got about 7 seconds left on the shot clock 7 Seconds lock on the left on the clock for a good shot at the basket I got to tell you jack Im a little surprised its taken him this long to look at it yeah and it is inde the Miami basketball with 29 seconds left to play they wanted to make sure the clock is right everything is correct so the Mountaineers will have to defend one more time and can the canes fight off a huge second half rally by Mount St Marys out of the Metro athletic Athletic Conference they only have one program Victory against the member of the Atlantic Coast Conference looking for two here today crowd is standing up so you want to see they should have been up Mount St Marys lone win 1995 against number 21 Georgia Tech defensive pressure heres Bea Miami trying to hold it for the final shot Mount St Marys does indeed foul it would send Miami to the line for a one and one 15 to go Blackman with the basketball High screen from kid Blackman fires away no good defensive rebound for the win no good oh Im not going to lie thats and weve

understatement cockback off guide hand is on the front of the ball but long as it goes in you cannot say anything Miami come back like Jordan wearing the 4 five its not to play games with you just to aim at you hes aiming to make this free throw I hope I set that line right for the JayZ fans out there he misses the second so the lead is three for the Mountaineers who are looking for their second

believe I believe its nothing but a thought youve been thinking for a long period of time thats what Miami needs right now Bel Mount St Mary shooting 42 from three this afternoon Miami 5 of 23 shooting 22 Mount Mount St Mary is switches to the zone right now a different look the Mountaineers have overcome 18 turnovers its a great play call by the coach kid down low too strong Applause Cordelia with the rebound Mountaineers by three Irvin uses a high screen still dribbling still dribbling another high screen outo to PCO and thats turned over heres Matthew Cleveland he nearly turns it over falls on the Applause deck now Cleveland going to Applause work Brandon Johnson gives it right back to him on the Baseline hes been really good all day Baseline turn yeah a little spinning jump shot up and no good wow Miami melting down here in overtime trailing by three with a minute left to play and Mount St Marys will take the timeout Applause Music no a foul was called a blocking foul was called and thatll send Mount St Marys to the free throw line Donny Lynn was begging for a timeout he was calling for a timeout but the foul happened before he asked for time got bailed out thats what happens when its close and Javon Irvin is the one going to the free throw line for the Mountaineers does he have the magic takes a deep breath three dribbles his first good Cash Money Millionaire shout out to Baby Birdman Lil Wayne cash money so the lead is four for the Mountaineers with 51 seconds left to play Miami snapped a seven game losing streak last Sunday Irving with the big free throws hes Runing number 23 not 32 but hes Swift hes ready are you Timeout on the flooor Mount St Marys leading by five what a comeback this afternoon and the canes are mired in a drought lasting over two minutes and uh it comes at a bad time and now they are really up against it with 51 seconds left to play they need a bucket bad you know I just talked about the Cash Money Millionaires Lil Wayne had a mixtape called the drought one of the best mixtapes of all time can Miami come out and withhold the drought they need an early basket a quick basket get a steal get another basket get another steal and get another basket does it sound tough sure does When You Believe Its Not nothings tough when you believe well I think the problem for Miami is theyve lost a lot of that belief this season the way things are going I will concur to that is that the right word for that concur concur Miami four and seven overall no wins and a loss in conference play that came against Clemson as for the Mountaineers of Mount St Marys looking for a little Christmas miracle of their own anything Happ G anything can happen during Christmas 17 and a half Point underdogs theyve got a fivepoint lead with 51 seconds left to play this is turned into uh a season that Jim L is hoping that he can soon forget if they cant turn it around expectations were high here in Coral Gables in 2024 and moving into 2025 if Miami gets a basket early right here the pressure is on on same marage to make a play they theyre a team thats very turnover prone this possession is very key for the University of Miami to get a basket an early basket and if theyre looking for a three they have been Dreadful from the threepoint line this afternoon shooting just 22 five of 23 on the flip side Mount St Marys thats where theyve made their hay eight of 19 look at the pressure Mountaineers are not going to give in Blackman brings it across trying to create a little room in separation and he got the layup to go with 40 seconds left and Jim Lara will take the timeout thats a big shot now you now and now you switch the pressure to Mount St Mars theyre up three in their mind theyre saying oh were up three at Miami we cant turn this ball over right now we may be in the game as soon as you come into the game and say something you cant do you might do it cuz youre manifesting that we cant turn the ball over just timeout yeah theyll certainly need it now they they dont have to foul with 40 seconds left if they could work a possession the Mountaineers conceivably if they want to hoist one up with about a second left Miami would probably be left with 7even to8 seconds if they were to come down with a rebound to tie it and again they have not been good from three today they got to get a steal on this inbound player when the ball is inbound they got to get the Trap be aggressive and Miami with nine fouls their next foul will send the Mountaineers the line for two freebies double b double bonus DB Jim Lara over at the scores table had something to say to the clock operator I think youre doing a great job I dont know and now head coach Donnie Lind is telling the scorers table I think youre doing a phenomenal job well if Jim Lura is upset with the clock operator you can imagine how upset hes going to be with his team if they fall this afternoon that folks is where the problem lies for these Miami Hurricanes ooh and he turn it over heres Betha you dont need a three Johnson to to Cleveland with 28 left to play back to Matthew Cleveland now a timeout by Miami I told you the pressure was on I guarantee you every player on Mount St Marys team says were up three cannot turn this ball over and my and what they do they manifest an eternally kanes will take their final time out this is a full timeout heres another look at the steel and he should have caught that basketball yes he should have thats an easy catch hits him through his hands hits his shoulder so now what do you do if youre Miami with 24 seconds left to play Jack do you look the ti you have to you go for early three and try to get offensive rebound the play call needs to be at play for a threepoint shot if they dont get it got your bigs in there to get offens rebound you try to get another three you cannot go for two right now not enough time on the clock 24 seconds they score two they get fouled come down M range makes two free throws youre at the same position you got to run a play right now for a threepoint basket an early threepoint basket well the question would be for Miami who do you look at Jalil bethus two of four from three jayen Blackmans made a pair but hes two of eight if if Im if Im coach L Im going to run a Brandon Johnson set the ball screen and hin kids set the FL screen for Brandon Johnson for three so basically what that means is Jaylen Blackman has the basketball Brandon Johnson comes up from the right elbow come set a screen for jayen from the left elbow link kid comes set a flare screen for Brandon Johnson to shoot the three if they switch you throw to aboutall a link kid for a easy layup you get two early and then you foul first option is jayen if youre open up the screen shoot it second option to Brandon Johnson with the flare screen from link Kid third option if they switch he throw to link kid for easily up early and try to get another turnover lets see what Jim LGA draws up coming out of the timeout after the turnover will the 20th turnover by the Mountaineers proved to be costly this afternoon we shall see they inbound it to Blackman 24 left to play Johnson Bea pulls the trigger for the tie no good and an offensive rebound but its a turnover by Miami Brandon Johnson ran out of bounce with it and now Donnie Lynn wants a timeout boy the ks had the offensive rebound but they were looking for but neither Lyn kit or Brandon Johnson could keep it in bounce and Bea had a good look its good look great moment for the Freshman here that was way off the mark too you take that shot Big Shot got to shake that shot youre open you let it fly so now 13 seconds left to play Miami would obviously look for a quick turnover but uh if Mount St Marys does get the ball in bounds successfully theyre going to have to foul and the Mountaineers will have two free looks at it its the 30 second timeout shot clock is offia Got The Look he was looking for too in Miami today five of 24 from threepoint territory uh the difference in the game huge difference and Miami also getting out rebounded Mountaineers get it in and a foul and thats going to send Javon irin to the line where hes two of two this afternoon and a 74 free throw shooter this season Mount St Marys looking for their second ever programmed Victory against a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference and theyre up by three with 12 seconds left to play Applause Music Applause first is good Blackman and kid check back in for Miami UGA chuku and Joe Bay will take a seat and Miami obviously will need a quick three to keep this thing within Striking Distance regardless if a make or a miss here and he missed lead is four 10 seconds left to go heres Bea quick into the paint got fouled hell go to the free throw line with 6 seconds left to play that would have been great if that was to any one great take I love the leadership that that Jal is taking right now hes not scared of the moment and thats what happens when you get five star players theyre not scared of the moment they expect to be in these moments and they expect themselves to perform now with six seconds if you make the first you miss the second try to tip it out for three The Way Mount Mary is playing on the inbound play I think you make both try to get a steal Music and Bea buries the first and Lin kid will take a seat so that would uh well no theres going to be a timeout now and thats probably what theyre going to discuss yeah if Im a coach I think you make this Im not supremely confident on Mount St Marys taking care of the ball they turn the ball over a lot the stats say that I think you make that free throw you forced him to turn the ball over on the inbounds and you can see coach L if you can read his lips he said a turnover right away or a foul right away so obviously he wants betho to make this shot make it a twopoint game once again although theres pressure on M to win this basketball game Jill makes his free throw now say Mary just thinking were two points away from getting this win we just cant turn the ball over and if they dont they win if they do we go toble oot even if they looking ahead if they get a couple of free throws and say its a threepoint game with 5 and a half seconds left to play youre in a position where you can simply just foul and basically draw out the clock and not even give miam you look at three 100 all right so lets see what happens here thats a pretty small group on the floor from Miami so in the event of a miss here either Johnson or Joe Bay would be in charge of trying to tip this out shot is up its a good twopoint game 69 left to play the Mountaineers have one timeout left to St the CR Checks In but Thea takes a seat I dont think you guard the inbounder on this play I think you good I think Divine doesnt guard the inbound uses quickness to get deflection Watch the watch watch Mount Sam Mar is going L right here whip takes it out they get it in to adabo theres a tie up and its Mountaineers basketball with 58 left to Music Applause go Mountaineers still have a timeout that is a good thing for M St Mar but also a bad thing because they got the ball in but he looked kind of nervous out there giving that ball into the basket right there and lipsum is again going to take it out of bounds Music lipsum looking still looking gets it in and an immediate foul on Pacho hell go to the free throw line he hasnt been there yet today czecho has been a very Dynamic threepoint shooter he has not been very good from the free throw line this season just four of seven he barely gets there a 57 free throw shooter this season its a big shot for PCO hes got the Steph Curry on hes got to live up to the name no mercy sh my guy Jason Boo this thing is basically over he makes the first makes the first Music one checho from the DMV shout out my guy Quinn cook right now from the DMV Gotta Give My Guy a shout out the greatest point guards from the ACC history you hear to here first shout out my guy Quin cook and Don ly just told his team if we make here or a Miss were going to foul but he makes it a fourpoint game they inbounded with three down to two Blackman for three doesnt matter the Mountaineers upset the hurricanes in Miami this afternoon what a win for Mount St Marys and Donnie Lynn in his first season second ever victory
