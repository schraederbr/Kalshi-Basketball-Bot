healthy and able to play but Malcolm he provides a big boost to this wolf pack team hes the leading scorer in the ACC but first and foremost that young mans health uh really good to see him out on the court healthy back in the lineup for NC State the numbers uh you can see him 18 points per game I think the big number though close to five assists wolf pack in white Notre Dame in blue underway this is a Notre Dame team that needs a win desperately theyve lost three in a row and they live and die by the three JJ Starling on the move and he opens the scoring for the Irish on the road and this is going to be a great backcourt matchup JJ Starling one of the Bright Young freshman ndacc uh but defending the threepoint line that was going to be key for Notre Dame coming into this one take a look at the wolf pack starting five a team that is also looking to bounce back which is something theyve been really good this season off a loss NC State 40 on the year with a chance to make it 50 tonight after the loss to Carolina on Saturday yeah Jay lets see how NC State uh chooses to run their offense I think this is going to be the key right here defending DJ Burns or Sal off the mark from three hes been a sharpshooter this year offensive rebound keeps it alive and then given away by jarkel Joyner theres Mike Bray what a week its been for Mike spray announcing on Friday that he will step aside at the end of the season the winningest coach in program history his 23rd and final year with the Irish really enjoyed our conversation with him at shoot around today always uh Ive never seen him in a bad mood maybe this turnover right here might do that but certainly always enjoyable and uh quite simply put when you think of Notre Dame basketball really over the last 20 years you think of Mike Ray he has really done so many good things and again always enjoyable to speak with him no doubt about it and if you had any reservation on how turquavion Smith is feeling after that heart foul Saturday getting stretchered up to steal it and take it right to the hole hes showing no timidness you know you never know how a player is going to come back after a big hit like that and early indication is that hes not gun shy at all and when I spoke with uh coach Keats this afternoon right before the game they had a little shoot around session and then this morning I asked him does he remind him of everybody and he said look back in the day he was an assistant at Louisville he said Terry Rozier he reminds him a little bit that type of mentality always in attack mode and youre right that mentality looks like it has not changed in this one Irish starting five for Mike Gray Applause they have yet to win a game outside of South Bend Marcus Hammond pull up pop and he hits it Smith draws a double 10 seconds to shoot great feed DJ Burns a dime to jarkel Joyner thats what Kevin Keats talked about he thinks Burns underrated passer thats a beautiful pass out of the double team Notre Dames gonna go double him every time and hes going to have to be very good passing out of doubles and Jay this is uh pinpoint passing right here double Goodwin and lesevski and thats a guy uh big thats making a pinpoint pass for a layup looks like a defensive tackle playing like a quarterback well again that was a concern coming into this game Notre Dame how they were going to defend DJ Burns theyre gonna have to double but theyre going to have to be really good on the back end with their rotations that time late Burns made him three and he drills it thatll be a big concern for the wolf pack because all five can make it from three for another day and thats how you counter it uh lachevski giving up size but now Burns is going to have to go out and defend him on the threepoint line Marcel cant answer luccheski grabs the rebound told you Notre Dame lives and dies by that three its sitting at one and eight and ACC play theyre just gonna Chuck them all night long eski misses that one after connecting on the previous possession Music kept Alive by the wolf pack open three more cell this fires and SC State getting good looks early just not finishing and thats three really quality looks uh by Marcel that one almost looked like it was in and popped out but again you dont mind those threes theyre off of excellent ball movement you cant ask for a better look if youre Kevin Keats Jay you can see the strategy early with Notre Dame theyre going to give up threepoint shooting theyre going to go double uh Burns theyre going to try to keep the ball out of the paint and live with NC State shooting threes this game to me is all about Tempo Notre Dame wants to slow things down NC State they want a running gun and Mike gray said that he said look part of us keeping them out of transition obviously we cant turn the ball over versus their pressure thats going to be key for Notre Dame to limit the fast break opportunity for NC State offensive foul called before the Starling three so wave off the basket Applause calls for the charge and this is the area you knew Casey Marcel he was going to defend started his first two years at Virginia and now at NC State really playing excellent for Kevin Keats on both ends man cant get the Finish second effort DJ Burns Jr there to clean up the spill one of the better offensive rebounders in the ACC averaging close to two offensive uh rebounds a game bounced out of bounds NC State ball Applause zewski trying to exploit that match up with Burns has already taken three threes hes coming off a careerhigh seven threes in the loss to Boston College over the weekend and thats I think the area theyre going to have to continue to do put Burns in pick and roll situations with lucesky and see if he can get some rollouts and hit some threes now Burns in attack mode comes up empty Music this is a mismatch Starling cant exploit it Applause Notre Dame theyve got a clear game plan whoever is going against DJ Burns is likely going to take the shot Applause Music Applause heres Cormac Ryan for three and he buries it speaking with the coaching staff of Notre Dame thats the guy they think they need to get cormack Ryan going hes hit a little speed bump in the road with his scoring and shooting thats a good sign him knocking down a three early Notre Dame Mike Bray they live and die by the three its so far on the road doing well a strong start 106 lead well talk more Bray on the other side is quick with the joke over his 23 incredible years at Notre Dame that was from his Friday press conference when he announced he would step away to the next chapter and uh you know obviously the 23 years of Notre Dame were really strong and he cherishes them the alltime winning is coach of the Irish but just because hes stepping away from Notre Dame you heard it there Malcolm hes far from done he is and I was speaking with him this morning at shoot around as we take a look at him and beautiful jump stop Jumper in the lane you know Mike Braes the most positive guy he got a little emotional when I asked him about his staff the impact that its had on his staff and thats the first time Ive actually seen him really uh I wont call it sad but he got a little emotional talking about his staff it plus the foul Ebenezer Tawana with a chance for a threepoint play that right there though is going to also probably put him in a bad mood hes like listen uh we know NC State is going to try to pound the ball down low in the paint in particular when they have that smaller lineup in there with lesevski playing the five thats great recognition by NC State not settling for a jumper go to your advantage get the big fella some touches Applause yeah back to Bray with our conversation with him earlier he is focused on finishing this season strongly and also helping Notre Dame with the hiring of his successor and the transition and then it will be time to eye up whats next whats the next chapter of Mike Bray after 23 amazing chapters written in South Bend and hell go to the line for three hes not shying away from contact after that hard foul on Saturday in Chapel Hill and he is just so difficult to defend the leading scorer in the ACC when he comes off of ball screens and the big is not there showing or hedging he just is going to raise up into his jumper and hes got great elevation on his pullup jumpers Saturdays have been wild in the ACC and weve got another Dandy of a day NC State against Wake Forest getting things started on acc Network at one followed by Duke and Georgia Tech and then your night cap Florida State and Clemson and Syracuse and Virginia Tech all on acc Network Saturday and Jay back to my comment on uh Smith I think the biggest area of growth for hemp shot selection and then the assist number look you know when he gets it going hes one of the best guards in college basketball thats scoring I think the big thing coach Keats and staff are working with him on and he got feedback can I be a facilitator can I be a guy that sets my teammates up close to five assists on the season and I think the shot selection again theyre continuing uh talking with him about that make the game easier for your teammates and he knocks it down that ends up being a fivepoint possession for NC State to give them the lead between the free throws of the three and here comes the pressure Notre Dame much needed bucket with NC State starting to grab the momentum here to the first half and I like to change by it uh Mike Bray going to this Zone uh see if you can slow this NC State team down and force them in to some perimeter jumpers again hes got thats excellent Patience by NC State first The Zone get the ball to the high post little high low action again great passing by The Bigs of NC State Applause the wolf pack have made four straight shots Starling step back cant connect Applause heres jarkel Joyner hes a perfect three for three leads NC State with seven Music thank you Smith in attack mode it rims out but hell get two at the line when we come back Court Duo to quavion Smith and jarkel Joyner doing their thing they call each other the younger brother and older brother theyre delivering right now for the wolf pack Music Malcolm Huckabee Jay altered back with you hawk this game all about Tempo NC State and Kevin keeps they want to run get out and transition and I think you look at the numbers Force turnovers thats going to be key in this game can Notre Dame handle uh the pressure that NC State is going to put on them in this game I think another key area can they keep NC State out of the paint I think theyre going to have to force NC State into some contested jumpers easier said than done with this guy on the line his ability to put pressure on you getting into the paint one so far only four fast break points for the wolf pack Smith connects on both hes got six Applause wolf pack trying to speed the Irish up going full court pressure Applause I think Notre Dame can do is try to post luccheski when NC State switches a smaller guard on him almost dive him to the post hey great interior defense five seconds left on the shot clock for Notre Dame ball underneath their own hoop Applause he is for NC State this situation five seconds and obviously do not want to file a shooter in this situation Starling stripped we told the NC State wants to roll in gun and they do count it plus the foul in transition for Ernest Ross Jay its exactly what we talked about creating offense with their defense Mike Bray said we cannot turn the ball over beautiful transition offense off the turnover Little Euro take the hit and finish Big Time body control and that is three fouls on Nate lisheski so hell likely have to sit for the remainder of this half wolf pack on a 142 run over the last two and a half minutes to blow this game open Music five seconds to shoot Hammond lost the handle itll stay with the Irish Applause and Notre Dame last few possessions either turnover or getting deep in the shot clock all set up because uh NC State is pressuring them and then theyre getting the ball with probably 15 seconds uh 12 seconds to try to get into their offense they got to do get a job getting into their offense early Notre Dame Works misfires the Irish is scoring drought of two minutes and 15 seconds its allowed NC State to go on a bigger and jarkel Joyner adds a three hes already up to 10 points timeout Mike Bray it is all wolf pack on a 172 run Cannon 18 points per game he has been so steady for them and I think the big thing up you look at his backcourt mate turquavion Smith those two guys uh two of the best pullup games and the ACC if youre not right there on them theyre just going to raise up over you as you saw in that last possession really difficult to match up with those two once they get it going inside to Van Allen Luke and the Freshman who stops the bleeding NC State started this game two of 11 ice cold since then theyve made six in a row through contact no good Applause up ahead Goodwin thats swatting great Hustle by Ernest Ross to get back and reject that three thats great transition defense and they knew coming in look you cannot give open looks to this team that was right at the top of keys to the game for Kevin Keats when we asked him he said look transition D and in particular defending the threepoint line in transition d Thats great job hustling back breaking up a wide open look for Dane Goodwin Applause Ryan gets free and makes NC State pay thats how Notre Dame could get back in this game theyre going to keep shooting that three and thats really a breakdown Casey Morrissette wanted a few times youll see a breakdown you have to hold up with the shooters above Notre Dame you cannot help too much off of them they will make you pay they average close to 10 threes made per game even with luccheski out of this game with three fouls Notre Dames gonna keep shooting the that three inside Goodwin mishandled it slapped away stays with Notre Dame and this right here again if youre Casey Marcel you dont want to over help off a Goodwin a little bit of help and then youre late on to recover on Notre Dame theyre a team that likes to do that dribble Drive kick out they space you out excellent job of spacing offensively that time though by Notre Dame theres been plenty of problems this season for Notre Dame shooting the three is not one of them shot clock down to two Starling doesnt see it I dont think he got rid of it even if it if he made it dont think it would have counted Music and Lubin has given uh Mike Bray and Notre Dame nice minutes as olajevskys on the bench with three fouls and hes made some nice plays offensively down low and theyve dumped it to him but defensively man or out of the Zone hes created a nice defensive presence for Notre Dame a welcome sight for Mike Bray and staff freshman out of Orlando celebrated his birthday yesterday theres more south drives Baseline met by Ryan Music State comes up empty and after the timeout I like to change up again by Mike Ray and Notre Dame going Zone you might give up some uh opportunities but I think that has slowed down this North Carolina State attack offensively Applause good win into traffic triple teams trying to rip his way out of it and thats a travel Dan Goodwin felt like there was some contact oh thats three guys around him and I came up with the turnover and Dane Goodwin felt like he was grabbed Mike krato talked about that anytime you go into the paint against NC State you have to be strong with the ball because theyre looking to create turnovers anytime you drive the wolf pack really streaky they started this game two of 11 then made six in a row now theyve missed five straight no points in the last 2 30 its allowed Notre Dame to get back into this game just a fourpoint game Coast to Coast for Marcus Hammond its a 70 Irish run and Mike Bray was pleased with his play as of late he said look he is really starting to do some really good things for us thats a great drive and finish by Hammond Birds misses the shot called for the foul going for the rebound and Notre Dame right back in it Marcus Hammond off of The Rebound in transition beautiful a lefthanded finish Notre Dame are right back wins in this one finding Irish Irish thing run Malcolm Huckabee the zoned I think the Zone has really negated any dribble drives up by NC State and then theyve taken care of the ball well thats the key thing early on NC State was getting out in transition they have six points off the turnovers this last threeminute stretch Notre Dames has handled their pressure and then theyve been able to get out and transition themselves The key thing is they havent turned it over against this NC State pressure NC State got the lead to 11 then Nate luceski picks up his third foulier thinking this could get ugly for Notre Dame in the first half and they have responded dang Goodwin makes it a onepoint game and its all set up uh Hammond again beautiful dribble Baseline and they kick it to the corner textbook uh thats basically something you Trail every day in practice the defense was late rotating over by NC State and thats just beautiful offense Again by Notre Dame NC State its missed six straight Burns trying to end it and it rims in for the fan favorite DJ Burns Jr they love him here thats old school sky hook that time with the left and theyre going to need more of that thats how you have to attack this Notre Dame Zone let Burns get to that foul line area and then let them operate from there tallest player on the floor for Notre Dame six foot eight Applause fifties was it a travel or a foul the officials talk it over and decide foul on Greg Gantt and I think it was the right call right here youll see at the end it looks like he grabbed them yeah thats a little it wasnt that much but you got his arm on him they got to make that call fans dont like it though but its again anytime you put your hands on it it was not much but just enough for the refs to call it cormack Ryan nothing but the bottom of the net ties it at 27 I mean thats a quick release my goodness off the pin down uh that was probably one of the quickest releases weve seen rejected at The Rim great defense by Van Allen Lubin hes giving Notre Dame Big Time minutes with luccheski out with three fouls yeah Notre Dame trailed by 11 since then a 132 Irish run Goodwin looking for more Off the Mark and thats a great closeout by Casey Marcel on Dane Goodwin its Attack Mode one at the end one oh he looks pretty good after the fall and its easy to see why uh this guy is going to be playing for a paycheck but back to the Cormac Ryan catch and shoot off a penndown of footwork really uh perfect uh when he comes off that time and hes got it going early and hes a guy again Mike brainstaff said he is the one guy we have to get going on the road hes shooting it pretty well our womens college basketball quadruple header on Sunday starts with Louisville and Syracuse at noon and then number 16 Duke taking on Florida State at two does not stop there you got North Carolina and Clemson at four at Virginia Tech and Virginia at six eight straight hours nothing but hoops this Sunday on acc Network Notre Dame yet to attempt a free throw NC State 8 of 10 in the last two have given the wolf pack back the lead Music words hes been quiet in this first half ties it at 29 beautiful move five words snake the screen that time and then a little Up and Under and these guards really have settled in for Notre Dame theyre really doing a nice job against this NC State practice Applause Music foreign Music these two teams trading punches 31 a piece high scoring first half and Im impressed with the Freshman Lubin for uh Notre Dame I think thats really been the missing piece for them of that inside presence a guy that you can dump it off down low to in the post a Lubin defensively has been solid for Notre Dame but then when theyve given him the ball down low isolated on the Block he has delivered Cormac Ryan in trouble passes out of it Music Notre Dame really milking the shot clock in his first half off the foot it works burns on the floor and here comes NC State back the other way if wants it gets it deep three much on it Starling splits the double team lays it off the window and in one of the best freshman guards not just in the ACC but in college JJ Starling showing off the upper body strength along with the burst thats a great finish through contact for the freshman Notre Dame gets the lead back after the Irish trailed by 11 earlier this half first lead since it was 1211 theyve made their last three shots and what Notre Dames doing theyre putting uh DJ Burns and ball screens uh trying to wear him out just continual ball screens make him either hedge or theyre going to have these type opportunities Marcus Hammond count it plus the foul a Notre Dame team that was down 11 now leads by four Mike Brays team fighting on the road Im a screen addicted to a talked about the impact that coach Wooten has had on his coaching career a really a great story you know as Mike Brays time at Notre Dame comes to an end after the conclusion of this season after 23 years hes been reflecting a lot about his coaching style and thinking about Coach Ruben a lot even brought his name up and shoot around today saying yeah the one thing that coach Wooten always told me is if you would have your son or daughter play for you youre a good coach and he said Ray speaking about himself Ive been fortunate to have 72 Sons at Notre Dame over my tenure yeah really outstanding job and both these guys two are the best uh best people and of the business coach Bray coach Keats I have a fifth and a seventh grader and I would send both of them to play for both of these guys not only are they good coaches but I think more importantly theyre firstclass human beings and I think thats key as a parent when you send your kid off to pay for a coach at a university in many ways thats the ultimate compliment it absolutely is and again I told both these guys they definitely are two of the best in the business at what they do and try to do for the young men that play for them when theyre done playing basketball and anybody who thinks that Mike Brays team is in any way quit on him looking at that one and eight ACC record take this first half as an example they were down 11 on the road itd be easy to throw in the towel and just say get us back to South Bend they have battled back and now they have a fivepoint lead a 16point swing in his first half and I like to change up again now theyre giving a little threequarter court pressure back to the Zone get NC State deep into the shot clock and right now NC State struggling shooting the ball from the threepoint line two of ten from the three I like this strategy and change up by coach Bray theyre forcing NC State into contested jumpers foreign five seconds to shoot Ryan backing down the Freshman Thomas projected DJ Burns the wolf pack love to run in transition oh maybe a little too quick there itll be Notre Dames ball foul on Ebenezer Joanna but I like that strategy by NC State although theyre going to put Notre Dame in one and one I dont like to foul afterwards but I like them getting out in transition or off of the block I think they need more of that before this Notre Dame Zone can get set up lets see if you can get out off of Misses or turnovers and get in transition Applause Applause every Thursday 10 Eastern Time right here on acc Network its nothing but net right after our womens basketball double header Thursday night the nothing but net crew will break down everything you need to know in ACC womens Hoops largest lead of the night for Notre Dame trailed by 11 earlier this half now lead by seven theyve scored 40 Music and I like this now theyre going to put a guard uh at the foul line to attack this Zone and see if you can get some jumpers just like that before they were putting the big up there I like that change up uh by coach Kevin Keats uh put Joyner at the free throw line and now force of The Bigs for Notre Dame to come up and play a guard Joyner has 12 to lead the wolf pack in his first half hes had the hot hand starling dispossessed Joyner again in attack mode its a one possession game Im not sure he was looking at the basket on that one my goodness take the hit and then throw it up over your shoulder Applause now called on the Freshman LJ Thomas Notre Dame back to the line for one and one and this right here great ball movement and Joyner again at the free throw line I like this move by Kevin Keats to counter The Zone this one right here Im not sure he was looking at them potty control off the charts and touch really impressive you know joyners bid so good scoring the ball assisting but the leadership hes brought to this team Kevin Keats told us earlier we desperately needed that he came in and immediately took on a leadership role called him an extension of the coaching staff on the floor and I think the other impact he talked about of the mentorship uh hes really taken Smith under his wing and have been the guy that showed that of Veteran leadership right here though theyre in a fight against this Notre Dame team Kevin Keats with a use it or lose it time out decides to take it well take it with him well pack final possession of this first half the other workers comp insurance company they were going to recloud the first half a big three here to give NC State the lead in the second half speaking with Kevin Keats he is such a tight connection not just with turquavion but with his parents Terence and Shannon said its a perfect example of the type of relationship a college coach should have with a player and family yeah job well done Mom and Dad I really enjoyed speaking with that young man this morning after shoot around Humble came back really worked on his game and his body during the off season and Kevin Keats and staff really so happy that he is in their program but he is make going to be making a lot of money when he leaves NC State at the next level really a phenomenal talent for NC State Smith obviously stretchered off Saturday night in Chapel Hill his mom meets up with him for the first time at the hospital first thing he says to her whats the score and we asked him about that and Kevin Keith said look thats just the type of kid he is team first he really obviously everybody talks about his scoring but he really wants to win and Kevin Keats and staff really love his Competitive Edge and certainly that sums him up right there worried more about whether or not his team won the game after that really scary fall and he has impacted this game in so many ways defensively five assists so when I looked up and saw oh of seven in the first half you almost think really because no one would accuse him of having a bad first half despite not getting the shooting going well I said it right on the tip I think the improvement with him the assist hes one of the top assist guys in the ACC look you know he can score hes a guy that can score in bunches I think the big thing that coach Keats and staff have challenged him on being more of a facilitator a guy that can make your teammates get easier looks and he has done that this year big reason why theyve had the success that theyve had and thats the kind of stuff that will translate to the next level absolutely fourth pack on a seven nothing scoring run thats an air ball from Van Allen Lubin Applause inside the DJ Burns spins and puts it in his favorite DJ Burns Jr he has eight and NC state has grabbed control of this game once again and thats a better move by the veteran DJ Burns a little spinoff that time Lubin a little aggressive on his left shoulder he just spun right off of him and he is a big that has a great footwork and he has shown off some passing ability as well too when Notre Dame has doubled that time they leave him one on one side nine nothing NC State Rod theyve made their last three shots lishetsky back into the game and hes cold after not playing for 16 minutes miss the last 11 minutes of the first half didnt play in the first five on this one step back oh thats pretty jarkel Joyner on both he and turquoivion Smith Im gonna say it again their elevation game off of pullups with some of the best in college uh thats a filthy crossover pullup Joyner has 20 as Ross has called for the foul take another look and this right here just filthy Right iso put on the brakes and then raise up off the little step back thats just tough to guard not bad D but thats a guy thats got it going and then on the other yeah thats a foul again he got him not on the second one and thats his fourth foul on the initial you can tell he got his hand and it definitely impacted his shot womens college basketball quadruple header right here on acc Network Sunday it starts with Louisville and Syracuse ahead of Duke and Florida State and then your nightcap is the 15th ranked Tar Heels taken on Clemson Virginia Tech against Virginia in the Commonwealth Clash all Sunday on acc Network so Notre Dame needs to replicate what they did in the first half hawk NC State grabs control got the lead led by as many as 11 Notre Dame flipped it ended up with a threepoint halftime lead how do they get it back this right here I like to change up go back to Zone it looks like its a matchup zone that really I think was a turning point in that first half of a forced NC State into that right there contested threes I like the move by Mike Bray go back to Zone that really was a key change of momentum in the first half good ball movement leads to a three and it rims out from luccheski that was a good look and Mike gray knew it really kicked his feet on that one thats a beautiful look hey another getting stops on the defensive end now can they cash in on the offensive side Mike Bray believes hes seen it earlier in this house or this game in the first half and thats not a good look by NC State again thats one of the things with turquoi Van Smith hes got to understand a time and possession you got a seven point lead really no need to take a quick contest of three Notre Dame shot 58 in the first half right now shooting 25 percent into second half Applause Starling on the floor he says count it and they do no no no no basket Notre Dames bench thought for a second that was going to be an NBA count it and that was Kevin Keats right there Kevin keeps like oh no he got him on the floor lets see yeah whistle blue right there and then uh this is not the NBA where you get that continuation Kevin Keats was uh and the refs air out at half court or Mack Ryan wide open he is red hot Cormac Ryan drains his fourth three of the night Im going to say it again if youre a young player and want to watch footwork coming off pen Downs or little cross screens watch Cormac Ryan his setup and then how he gets into his shot some of the quickest release releases that you will see really its a thing of beauty to see him come off of those screens comes Notre Dame two on one Ryan miscommunication yeah went diving for it and thats a costly turnover Mike gray knows thats a missed opportunity two on one in Notre Dame right now 11 turnovers NC State only two thats key again we talked with Mike gray about this top of the list first thing he said listen we have to handle their pressure we cannot turn it over uh you cannot have uh that many in this game against NC State and that is so altruistic of a Mike Bray Notre Dame team they usually win that turnover margin Music you can stay with NC State leading by four Mike Brays team looking to mount a comeback on the road foreign position November 71 the loan loss to Kansas December you start conference play a slow start at just one and three but they have turned it on in January two top 20 wins against Duke and Miami those are really strong resume wins and right now ESPNs Bracketology Joe linardi has the wolf pack as a seven seed as turquion Smith right on cue buries the three yeah I think that right there uh theyre sharing the ball the balance that they have offensively a yes to Cleveland Smith hes a star hes a guy thats going to play at the next level but the other guys have been huge for them and their production and then defensively theyre much more connected and theyre getting a lot of offense with their defense one thing when you look at the NC State resume thats glaring as they are really good at home 101 at PNC Arena thats something that needs to continue as they look to bolster their resume in the final six weeks of this season oh yeah Notre Dame not going away luccheski looking for back to back buckets what hes found Jay thats all set up JJ Starling a nice stop at that time in the secondary break dribble Drive beats his guy draws a Defender the nice little bounce pass through lucesky Applause Saturdays lock in on acc hoops right here on acc Network NC State gets the started against Wake Forest Duke then takes on Georgia Tech at three eastern time and then your night cap is Clemson Florida State Syracuse Virginia Tech and when you talk Bracketology like we just were with NC State how about the Hokies with a big time resume win on big Monday last night against Duke I mean look in the ACC right now a wide open I mean a lot of times we say that but you really dont mean it theres really two or three times you look at uh really one through ten in the ACC flip a coin on any given night I think anybody can get beat and really look at that win by Virginia Tech and you said that is huge charge Cal Joyner Banks it in hes got 22 to lead all scorers tonight foreign Music Applause wave off the bucket they say the foul was on the floor before pass put it in defensive effort effort and pressure yeah again he was lobbying for that one but same on the other end theyre not going to allow the continuation nonetheless though uh again good ball pressure forcing another Notre Dame turnover 13 Notre Dame turnovers NC State sixpoint lead 10 seconds to shoot just about 10 minutes left in regulation Joyner that was a heat check hes had the hot hand with 22 Ryan pustrum behind by morsel Marcels first foul thats a silly one to give away you like the effort but certainly you do not want to have Casey Marcel filing in that situation 9 55 to go you think about time and clock possession certainly not a good bomb Music Starling turnaround jumper and it falls JJ starling he has some individual efforts that make you go wow lets go to reverse pivot that time and this great body control and strength Marcel attacks rims out but hell get two at the line thats a good move by Casey Marcel again could have easily settled for a jumper that time decided to use a little head fake and it dribble drive now at the free throw line Casey Marcel what a great story hard work improving your game it comes in as a transfer from Virginia Kevin Kings told us today that he is so hard working that just about every morning hell meet up with Joel Justice for an early morning shoot working on his game and it reflects in his numbers and we saw him really about 20 30 minutes after shoot around this morning still in the gym we were finishing up speaking with the coaching staff and he was still in there working on his uh form of course though we uh Jinxed the guy caught the free throw line and misses the free throw but the improved numbers really a testament to his hard work Goodwin off the screen hits it from three and just like that its a twopoint game Notre Dame not going away the Irish have made four straight shots despite a one in eight ACC record this team is battling on the road giving everything beautiful touch Ebenezer Tawana with an immediate answer and thats great touch and a great read again by tahquavion Smith again not settling for a jumper hits your big rolling to the basket Applause Ryan trying to get free five seconds on the shot clock lasheski ripped away by dewana Smith oh youre too much on it to one of the offensive rebound no call up ahead Starling beautiful move JJ Starling timeout Mike pray after the fresh bit cuts it to a twopoint game now I Notre Dame has battled back from being down big in the first half they Trail by 11 in the second half of the trail by as many as nine Malcolm Huckabee Mike Braves got his team right back in it on the road only trailing by two yeah and I think the change up of defenses hes done a nice job here threequarter court pressure and then theyve been dropping back into their Zone I think that has been a game changer in this one the one area they need to cut down on his turnovers right now NC State 18 points off the turnovers in this game join or step back ribs out no good Notre Dame has made five straight shots as they have mounted another comeback in the second half Cormac Ryans had the hot hand perfect from three four for four Music Starlin Off the Mark with a chance to tie it at 63 cant connect seven minutes rain remaining in regulation great ball movement Smith comes up empty Casey Marcel flies in to clean up the spill foreign no good offensive rebound then Allen Lubin look at this strategy by Notre Dame put DJ Burns and ball screens and then roll Lubin that is the strategy right there uh DJ Burns really not good at covering ball screens continue to put him in picking rules let your guards either try to drive and get Buckets for themselves for a nap last play dump it off up to the rolling Big Burn spins pass Louvin off the window and in for DJ Burns is schooling the young fella thats twice now hes spun Baseline lubins got to play him straight up not allowing him to spin off thats just a better move again by DJ Burns triple team on Hammond lubins open but he lost the handle kick out startling at three hes short Hammond another opportunity swatted NC State dialed in on defenses possession trying to protect a fourpoint lead Applause foul called on the floor jarkel Joyner he cant believe it wolf pack leading by four Gatorade fit transition offense again another turnover you cannot do it Mike breaks off about it as keys to the game we must handle NC States pressure that has been really the difference in this game right now really hard to overcome off on the road as you take a look at the numbers zero of points off for turnovers for Notre Dame 18 for NC State this is against a Mike Bray team that has made a living off winning the turnover battle and today NC State dominating Marcus Hammond makes both he has 11 and its a twopoint game despite the lopsided points off turnovers Notre Dame is right in it on the road if you could really look at the turnovers numbers you would think there would be down at least 20 uh theyre right within it though only down two Burns he is cooking inside up to 12 on the night and six of them come have come from that exact move and early on Notre Dame was doubling uh that time with lucesky in the game Notre Dame they have to come and dig or double you cannot leave him oneonone with DJ Burns foreign Music s dropping for Cormac Ryan for five from three hes got 19 to lead the Irish and hes smiling with her quavion Smith hes like yeah that one is definitely a Shooters role and now Notre Dame decides to double chesky for a block thats his fourth foul this right here you call a Shooters roll look at that that hit I mean Im not even sure thats back iron and he gave a little smile uh to Smith on the way back as he couldnt believe that one uh bounced in but its been that type of night a four quarterback Ryan 19 points and he has really been perfect from the threepoint line five of five right back to Burns poked Away by Goodwin Burns regathers kick out three more cell its good well when we asked Kevin Keats about DJ Burns he said his passing is underrated thats a beautiful pass out of the double team Brian trying to will Notre Dame for an answer to Lubin spins contested Off the Mark Smith falls down and is fouled gets up no problem itll be at the foul line would we come back with his wolf pack leading by four PNC Arena trying to close this one out improve to 111 at home Music he gets him again I think the biggest thing for him when they have not doubled hes been patient but then Kevin Keith talks about his passing ability they doubled hes made them pay with the pass a really good Court vision and passing out of the double team by DJ Burns Way Beyond Smith at the foul line where he has been terrific nine of ten on the night Burns you see the three assists to go along with 12 and four how does NC State close out this game leading by six I like the move by Kevin Keiths little offense the defense uh the get burns out of the game uh Notre Dame theyve been putting him in ball screens hell get him out hell give him a breather uh get in a better defender in this case I think for Notre Dame right now youre gonna have to go quick you dont need threes but you have to get into your offense quick thank you foul off the ball Breon passed tangled up with luccheski thats his first and it sends Nate luccheski to the line for one and one now Burns comes right back into the game Kevin Keats going offense to defense Applause battles at home everybody knows weve got some amazing fans in the ACC and we want to see it from your perspective snap a pick take a video tag it with the hashtag all the devotion posted to social media you might just see it show up on acc Network no good on the second attempt fivepoint lead for the wolf pack 340 left in regulation great pass again everything but the Finish Burns again put it right on the money to Breon pass and the key is a lot of times Biggs they hold the ball too long out of the double team hes making quick decisions and then his passing is pinpoint I think its been excellent in this game and on display exactly what Kevin Keith talked to us about uh this afternoon and shoot around good Applause foreign comes right back out Music Applause Houston State picks up full his key thing is you do not want to foul put Notre Dame on the free throw line theyre going to have to be better in that area and then defending the threepoint line Applause good win great move exactly what Notre Dame needed Dane Goodwin delivers and hes done that a couple of times in this game nice little reverse pivot underrated dank wooden how strong he is to help take guys that you would think are bigger than him down low in the post get him on his hip and then spin off of him to the rim he missed him under three minutes to play in Raleigh Notre Dame trailing by five trying to make it a one possession game Hammond keeps it alive for Matt Ryan made five threes passed it off Joyner all the way to the rim and he missed the dunk Applause good win a three that make NC State pay on the other end thats a break for NC State thats a wide open look of Fort Dane Goodwin off the Miss jump dunk Joyner really has done so much in this game but thats a missed opportunity for NC State very fortunate not to give up the three on the back end 22 points for Joyner that would have been the easiest two of the night back rims the dunk and misses that jumper Notre Dame the door has been left open in the final two minutes on the road trying to cut it to a one possession game Starling draws the foul Mike Bray is heated he felt like the cop foul could have been called earlier on JJ styling its been really I think theyve been consistent though with the whistle closing out games really has been the story for Notre Dame theyve had these stretches turnovers has been the Achilles Hill and this game so you said it Malcolm you look at that one and eight ACC record a lot of those games Notre Dame was in one possession games with two minutes to go in this exact spot and they failed to close them out Applause one possession game again oh the decision now they have to make if theyre in man uh when uh NC State goes to DJ Burns which I would do in this lineup with lesevsky at the five youre double the rotation has to be really good on the back end heres Burns backing down lashesky goes to the Lefty hook missed it battled for the rebound Starling has it all right Applause Ryan for the tie off the mark battle for the rebound Applause Notre Dame wants a travel NC State wants a timeout Kevin Keet saying I call the timeout and the timeout is given and Mike gray wants explanation and as to whether or not the timeout was called when he had possession hes smiling now lets see again a heads up played by Hammond to try to get the strip lets see did he get the time yeah he had possession there so NC State ball two timeouts remaining for the wolf back two timeouts for Notre Dame and here is the uh issue for Notre Dame that last time they stayed home good individuals defensive effort by lachevsky to force burns into a tough turnaround jump hook I almost think you have to stay home because if you go double Burns has been really good passing out of the double team Music who gets the shot if youre Kevin Keats maybe Court Casey Moore South hes had the hot hand in the second half 11 points but all of them have been scored in the second half Im going Joyner or Smith uh if Im NC State put him either in a pick and roll or go back to this guy right here Burns Burns trying to muscle his way in on lucchesky through contact DJ Burns delivers thats a grown man move right there no double and then he makes him pay lashesky answer on the other end Notre Dame offensive rebound keeps the Irish alive Hammond hes fouled and a chance to cut it to three from the line this right here this is the decision uh they stay home no double great patience uh by Burns and then thats been moved really has been key in this game soft touch and hands through the big fella defending with four fouls as well rattles in and out PNC Arena on their feet playing a factor down the stretch the loudest its been all night as Hammond misses them both and Hammond commits the foul and theyve just announced everybody at PNC Arena gets free biscuits because Hammond missed two foul shots does that include announcers weve got to ask about that well Ill tell you right now if you look at uh Notre Dame and still plenty of time for them to come back and this one but missed opportunities uh the turnovers obviously number one that have really hurt them uh in this game but but they had some quality looks right there the shepsky open look theyve had some other threes just you need to knock those down on the road and thats been problematic in many ways its the story of the season so close cant close at a team that is so much better than a likely one in nine record in the ACC ENT I know the old added you are what your record says you are but Notre Dames proved it time and time again including tonight on the road in Raleigh and they were in this game for 39 minutes again still time 31 seconds left youre down seven obviously time you gotta go quick youd like to get a three in this situation but not necessarily uh you need it but defensively thats where the problem is youre gonna have to hope now NC State misses some free throws uh in this situation depending on the lineup obviously youre going to go what the numbers tell you and whoever the weaker free throw shooter is out on the court well the wolf pack have been dominant at the foul line 18 of 21 on the night Notre Dame has missed four straight no field goals in the last three minutes draws the foul home fans dont like it Starling heads to the line for two and lets see if Marcel has an argument he felt like he just went straight up Applause the tough one again hes coming into him Marcel saying look you have to go straight up hes coming into me Burns back into the game for NC State he has carried the wolf pack down the stretch Starling hits them both Notre Dame one timeout remaining wolf pack have two love to get a steal with the full court pressure here if youre Mike bright or Sal patiently gets it into Smith who is 10 of 11 from the foul line tonight on the season just a 70 percent foul shooter he has brought it tonight the whole team has 18 of 21 for Kevin Keats and Squad and although Smith has had not has not had but one of those explosive nights in terms of offensively hes shown flashes but Ive been impressed with his decision making but making plays for his teammates hes set his teammates up for some easy opportunities uh in this game and in the freethrow shooting you talked about it that has been huge and this tight tightly contested game oh you missed the second stays a two possession game 20 seconds left in regulation Starling hard for the whole through contact makes it a fourpoint game Mike Bray uses his final timeout Kevin Keats wanted a charge there Music and Mike gray calling the Reps over he wants a huddle Im not sure what hes in midcourt on the logo talking with Lamar Simpson and Randy Steins and Im not sure what the discussion Music that Gregs laughing but it always ends with a laugh with my friend thats the good thing even today were talking about heavy stuff the decision to step down at the end of the season after 23 years that hes sliding in at least a half dozen jokes as were talking to him and the only time again I I want to go back to our conversation he got emotional about the impact that this will have on his staff and the kids that sign with him to come on board to Notre Dame but youre right that sums him up look hes going to be the same no matter what of the situation is on the court and Kevin keeps shared a story with us about him when hes an assistant at Louisville just sums up his meters that look its a tight game and hes over on the other sideline smiling again that loose but there aint no mistake about it he is a competitor and wants his team to try to pull off the unthinkable in this last 157 seconds Notre Dame out of timeouts NC state has two the inbounder is Casey morsel and no safety right now Notre Dames got to be careful that NC State doesnt throw over the top Smith trying to get free Marcel in trouble takes the time out good pressure by Notre Dame forces the wolf pack into a timeout luckily Kevin Keats had two at his disposal now one and Notre Dame fortunate if they just threw the ball along but sir gravyon Smith was wide open theres nobody back playing safety uh for Notre Dame so thats something of the watch uh if youre Kevin Keats thats there right there they were set up in a formation where they could have had a long pass and either gotten a layup or let him try to run us some more clock but if youre Notre Dame again you got to be careful make sure you dont get beat long and give up a uncontested layup foreign 15 seconds ago the next Notre Dame foul would put the wolf pack in the double bonus so shooting two Music Music but the adjustment is that Kevin Keach makes its a darkell Joyner fouled by Goodwood at midcourt Joyner an 82 percent foul shooter on the season coming up next Georgia Tech and Clemson the Tigers the story of the ACC can they stay atop the conference tonight against the yellow jackets theres a lot of guys in the discussion for Coach of the Year in the ACC but Brad Brownell certainly at the top of the list but what hes done with that Clemson team DJ Hall one of the better bigs in the country Joyner now has 26 Notre Dame down to their last gasp yeah CO2 no timeouts for the Irish one for NC State double team comes in in a foul you cannot say enough the fight the effort that Notre Dame showed on the road down 11 early Mike Brays team battled for the entire 40 minutes but again it kind of sums up the season so close just cant close yeah again its not you know we talked with him at shoot around about this yeah its theyre not getting blown out of games uh its just these stretches where they either Miss some opportunities with some open looks and this game right here it was the turnovers a credit though Kevin Keats and his Squad as well too look Notre Dame gave them everything that they can handle and this guy at the line is really good for them and then uh Burns I think his passing and his stretch in that last really three to four minutes it was huge for NC State the wolf pack take it by three against Notre Dame 8582 jarkel Joyner one shot of his season High 28 points for Malcolm Huckabee Jay alter Archer
