to be Garden Smith Smith is one of the most explosive offensive players that youll ever see hes not afraid to shoot the ball from anywhere if he gets going look out North Carolina State relies on him Tar Heels are 136 the wolf packs 154 Bert Smith on the whistle today with Jeff Clark and Tommy Morrissey Burns and Nance get us started the Tar Heels are wearing some retro Unis from the 1960s and RJ Davis Metro Jersey got it thank you here is Bacons first touch he gets big DJ burns with a right hand two nothing Carolina Fall Away jump hook how good is that the Wolfpack goes with Smith and Joyner theyre graded together as a tandem Marcel Gantt and the big fella Burns whos also fun to watch and misses the short Baseline jumper Davis runs down the loose ball Carolina vacated the lane to try and get in transition down low heres pay cut again backer gets Burns and DJ Barnes stripped him out of there spot up Smith front rim Miss and the first of the bake out rebounds and thats not a bad shot by NC State they want to get out and go anytime they can Mr quavion Smith can be deadly in transition from Beyond the arm leaky black tees up a three and a rebound for morsel you know leaky black hes better shooting the three West but I dont know that you want him firing away that early on the shotgun five of his last 18 after the Miss there the Ole Miss transfer is jarkel Joyner DJ Burns is the Big South Player of the Year a season ago at Winthrop and look at he and bacon and Armando stripped it from him and have something to say about it those two fellas are sitting on go here early love has been struggling mightily trying to find his shot spent a lot of time in this building yesterday and early today time to find range Davis a background Miss and off the foot of Caleb law thatll go to the Wolfpack well this we talked about the matchup whos going to guard bacon whos baycod going to guard well these guys are guarding each other and Bay cut just strips it away one of the things early for North Carolina West I dont know that Hubert Davis wants them to be so threepoint shot conscious on the drive Smith threw it up under the basket well get the ball inside let big cop touch it before you start firing up those three two minutes old the fake out jump up the only basket and burns reaches in knocks it away across the foul DJ Burns first number one on NC State and of course their head coach is 50 year old Kevin Keats a native of Lynchburg play college basketball at Ferrell he knows all too well the history of NC State North Carolina hes won a game December of 2020 thats the last time NC State won at PNC Arena during the pandemic defense Carolina if the Tar Heels have won the last three since then and eight of the last nine in this longstanding series thats almost 110 years old Music Applause its toward Nance and charcoal Joyner will be ticketed here itll be his first and the second on the pack Gantt switched out yep and Nance did a great job rolling to the basket and Joyner was just trying to hang on for dear life until some help came for Davis returns it to Armando step back against Burns and the rebound for turquoitian Smith look at this guy blur to the basket NC State on the board thats easy to say boy you need to stop him in transition but thats hard to do yeah theres love more self finds him defensively for the pack so heres Nance mismatched inside of him more cell Nance too strong rebound Bay cop armandoah the foul is on Junior Greg Gantt his first Wes Armando Bangkok is just a Relentless offensive rebounder Burns goes to try to help out Maybe not maybe you let Pete maybe you let Pete Nance shoot that jump shot and because he goes to help nobodys there to block out baykot North Carolina overall is a team theyre not the kind of offensive rebounding team that theyve been in past years but bacon is just Relentless in there Armando Bangkok five NC State two actually turkway Beyond Smith too big cup gets about 10 percent of North Carolinas Miss Johnson has offensive rebound well the stars have shown up here early right its actually the guys weve talked about heres leaky black matched up against Smith that ought to be a fun matchup uses a Gant screen so you can lay off game gants not going to hurt you with a jump shot will spin into traffic here and turn it over to RJ Davis Carolina three on three trying to get an advantage heres Nance black tees up another three short Nance tried to keep it alive and pulled out of there heres Joyner and then black punched it away and will draw the foul first on the grad student from Concord North Carolina and there is plenty of Old North State flavor on the floor today for both schools as you might expect its not that leaky black cant make a three and ACC play hes now six out of 25 so he can make them but Im just not sure Im a fan of the early shot clock threes by leaky black Ebenezer dewana was on the floor for a heartbeat with Gantt and he has come off the floor and we get our first look at Ernest Ross the 69 sophomore from Alachua Florida wearing 24 for the Wolfpack Kevin Keats can dynamically change a lineup up or down in terms of its size down with just a couple of guys Burns and Baker CJ with the left hand and Nance pulls it away thats a great matchup Kearns just cant get around it low spots up from Deep back rim miss the struggles for Caleb love continue now eight of his last 33 from three Ross tees up a three oh Ernest Rosss third three of the year makes him 12 of his last 14 from the floor and the game is tied at five and all those threes are in ACC play West and theyre all in the last couple of games where he has been so good for NC State Applause Davis trying to beat morsel to the hoop heres black again with 10 to shoot against Smith Nance fires away plus thats a really good job by North Carolina you get the ball inside that time to Nance rather than baykoff but it forces the defense to collapse and you get an open threepoint shot so the teams have exchanged threes Ross berries won it six nine and 611 Pete Nance fires away from behind the line they caught another rebound hes got four here early Music love off a screen of bacon background Miss again pulled down Joyner when hes looking to push sure is Ross was stepping out of bounds turned over by the wolf pack third on the NC State North Carolina with an early threepoint lead but we got guys standing behind the line Ernest Ross a three and a moment ago Pete Nance for the Tar Heels who lead by three all presented by subway theyve been playing almost 110 years Dan all I can tell you is in February of 1913 NC State won 2618 at the Raleigh Auditorium but Kevin Keats has seen time and again the series as a child growing up in Lynchburg hes talked about that Hubert Davis did Northern Virginia and of course Dean Smith and Norm Sloan Everett case Frank McGuire and we could go on and on and on about a series thats better than a centriole well and its its a tremendous rivalry West when I first started doing this a guy told me that a true NC State fan never roots for North Carolina under any circumstances he elaborated he said if the fate of the world depended on North Carolina beating the Soviet Union NC State fans would root for the Russia well its had its moments its had its players its had its coaches and today were fortunate to be Courtside for meeting 243 heres paycock Carolinas living on the line here early I dont mind that one so much Smith lost it on the drive out of bounds turned over by the wolf pack and thats their fourth yeah thats seven out of the 12 field goal attempts for North Carolina that has been a threepoint shot but at least that one was inside first and that time to quavion Smith stopped himself losing the ball thats now four turnovers for North Carolina State I saw Kevin Keats put that press on even off the turnover now you want to pressure these North Carolina guards to make it difficult for them to throw it inside to Bangkok love has come out of course DeMarco down on the floor you saw the three a moment ago for the sophomore six to shoot RJ Davis scoop and foul we could get on NC State Jeff Clark out from underneath on Casey morsell West one of the things I think that Armando Bangkok can do is if he catches the ball on the outside as North Carolina clears a little room for him I think he can drive by DJ Burns and we saw sequence a moment ago where I thought that was kind of what the objective heres RJ Davis at the Line This is the best free throw shooter in the ACC at 88 percent 65 of 74 on the year and the first one good for his first call wrestling youre the best free throw shooting in the ACC its a couple of the point you to get to the line so thats really a good job by Davis to take the ball into a position where he could get fouled Carolina shooting almost 74 percent against the league and the second one good first points for RJ Davis whos averaging better than 17 in his last five games including a blistering 1628 from three coming into the ball game today foreign Applause Smith launches no I dont know okay not now no I think theyre just fine right zero wants the ball and the pack to within two off to quavion Smiths second field goal he wants the ball Im giving it to absolutely trying to help Davis with the screen and that got Stripped Away turned over by Carolina and heres Smith trying to get the wolf pack in transition but thats what you dont want to do if youre North Carolina oh my Heavens indeed rimmed out nasty rebound Applause Kevin Keats even kind of thought that might be a little beyond the range of sophomore and heres a steal and this is Joyner against Dunn and it will go in one theyre adding a foul on it I believe Tommy Morrissey and the foul is going to be called on Don Joyner gets credit for the steal in the basket North Carolina bench a little upset that there was no foul called on the steal but joiners are really good defensive player he does that he picks that one cleanly and if youre done West you know not very often youre going to block one of these shots just let that one go Joyner 80 at the line and he puts the wolf back in front a threepoint trip Applause first lead of the ball game for NC State and you see Seth trimbles coming to the lineup The Freshman from Wisconsin whos averaging 15 minutes a game and Ebenezer dewana back on the floor for Kevin Keats and burns will get a break Trimble I think is in the game to guard to cuevion Smith Trimble noted for his defensive ability North Carolina coaching staff to Mike would be a little more aggressive offensively entry pass knocked away heres another Carolina turnover thats two in a row Smith the runner and gets the roll so you just cant turn oh these guys are going to make you pay for them five in a row by the Wilcox to take a threepoint lead tremble now against the sophomore Smith Applause Smith Kevin Keats thought that might have been a little ticky tacky from Jeff Clark its the first on the sophomore from Greenville North Carolina and five now on the pack Wes Smith came out there and put both of his hands on Davis and by rule thats supposed to be a foul Caleb love comes back were going to get our first look at nandra style and heres Carolina now starting to dig into the bench a little bit and they dont have puff Johnson today hes out with a sore right knee so they have used a lot of different lineup combinations recently West and the injuries have been the primary packages and ebenezuelan are going to be called for the foul to get us to a timeout to quavion Smith jarkel Joyner the power company of the pack has pushed NC State to a threepoint lead here in Chapel Hill all in for all time come for it all well it might be our biggest college basketball Saturday of the year next Saturday on acc Network but Dan the one here today might be one of the bigger games the league has at least in the month of January when it relates to the big picture with no no question Wes and of course this is Joe linardi where hes got the ACC team slotted and this is a very important game for both of these teams into the ball game as hell Jay Thomas he wears number four for the pack stayed on an eightnothing run to get to the threepoint lead here is Thomas freshman from Plant City Florida whos played 10 or more minutes in each of the last four for Coach Keats Applause Joyner against Styles thats just oneonone shoots Styles finally slipped and an air ball by Joyner gathered Applause a little bit Carolinas got almost four minutes without a field goal just the free throws by RJ Davis thats it for Styles Steakhouse tap following no good dawada couldnt handle it it will stay with Carolina you know Armando Armando baycott made a nice pass on the interior I think maybe he should have shot the ball but he makes a nice pass and then again hes so disruptive on the offensive end hes not going to get credit for that offensive rebound but hes the reason North Carolina got it does so to love tend to shoot Caleb loves looking for his first points heres Tribble and he lost his footing against Smith turned over by Carolina theyre fourth here is Smith again to the basket threw it up on the window and Ross follows it Ernest Ross has got a three and now a tap follow in traffic and the Wolfpack lead his spot West they run no plays for Ross but he is so active getting up and down the court he finds opportunities love working against Marcel got to get the ball inside to Bangkok Armando with a high screen out of the corner Trimble now heres bake out with Tawana defending back over the right shoulder rimmed off hes off balance yep good job by DeJuan at the post absolutely Marcel three from the front boom Casey Marcel largest lead of the day for the pack on the 48th triple of the Year by Casey Marcel Kevin Keats his team has won four straight but theyre two and two on the road in the ACC and those two Road wins are wins that get you better and he knows them and theyve been layered building this it seems like Dan well they have really ratcheted up the defensive intensity West they started the game I think a little tentatively on the defensive end but no longer styles of three spins off Bay caught the rebound on him to stick back and maybe thats the best offense just shoot it and let Armand our bacon go get it 132 run by NC State holding to a sixpoint lead Applause theres the runner Smith cant find it they caught another rebound hes got eight that was a little long for a floater love done offline with the three backroom missing Ross Colette that was a great job by dewana he didnt even try to get that rebound all he was worried about was blocking Bay caught off the board and he managed it all right Smith and a foul on Ross oh no its on Trimble its going to be on set treble here Dan out in the midcourt area itll be his first and three on the Tar Heels quick reminder to you quadruple header of basketball next Saturday on acc Network one oclock Eastern time the pack and the deacons at the Joel in WinstonSalem and then at three oclock Duke is in Atlanta presented by Food Lion to see Georgia Tech youll also get to see Florida State and Clemson in Tallahassee presented by Subway and then Bonner and Ill be with you from Blacksburg for the orange and the Hokies to cap off a quadruple header of basketball on acc Network Burns spins that time scores lefthand move DJ Burns first basket but Nance just not strong enough to hold him out of there Bangkok could eight point game Tar Heels only the fake hot field goal through a bit of a drought and now a foul on LJ Thomas against RJ Davis West what I think you see Happening Here is the referees are trying to control some tremendous physicality out on the perimeter these guys are fighting through screens the guards are pushing at one another files have really piled up for North Carolina State yep Tar Heels are in the 101 heres Davis whose only points have come at the line the first of the one and one is good for RJ Davis he doubled his stats a season ago and Hubert Daviss first year and what he did for 21 but for me Dan this is the guy when healthy thats the outside to Bakers inside no question over his last few games hes finally healthy he had some problems with shooting hand early but hes over those now but four games of 20 or more including 27 against Wake Forest Carolina may need to find a 20point guy on the inside no Joyner dominating the ball again on this possession and turned over here is black thank you live ball turnovers were a concern for Kevin Keats heres Smith on the drive Nance towed the Baseline to control the rebound Hubert Davis telling his guys to Gold kick out for leaky black who clutched on one in about 25 feet and thought the better of it Davis spot up on burns thank you triple gives Davis seven and look out theyre going to go to the deck 10second violation yep Bert Smiths going to call the 10 seconds and its going to go to Carolina after breaking the action the defense Dan Sparks this and leaky black defense to offense this is what he can do really well wolf pack leads back to Chapel Hill in a moment but the game you know hes going to walk a mile in those shoes Dan bare minimum and this is why his team is playing really good but as you said at the Top This is a quad one opportunity for NC State well West and in the way they figure things these days with the NCAA tournament selection committee and the net you know you need to get as many quad one wins as you can the wolf pack thats what theyre looking at just trying to pick up one of those those you know the 27 in the net well thats nice but how many quad ones wins do you have theyve got three this would be four love all the way through almost turned it over look out Davis finally comes up with it launches with the shot clock going down and he fights at home oh my goodness 10 for Davis and Carolina on a 10nothing run to take the lead Russell one of the reasons theyre on this run to travion Smith has really been forcing things and now I think Smith picks up a foul yeah and hell become the first NC State player with two on the eighth against the Wolfpack West this threepointer is amazing we saw one of these earlier today over in Durham Tariq Whitehead hit something very similar to this the shot clocks running down youre at half court you launch three now Whitehead I dont think banked it in okay sir quavion Smith the first NC State player with two RJ Davis has been the Maestro of the comeback for Carolina and the free throw on the front end of the one and one is good I thought as I said Wes I thought that Smith really started to force things right and the Wolf Pack turned it over a couple of times and you take bad shots and turn it over particularly when youre on the road you let the other guys get rolling and the Tar Heels are rolling and Davis hits them both hes got 12 the hard way two threes six of six line shooting and that three wasnt exact one of those threes wasnt exactly an easy shot so its even harder than you your statement indicates yeah the wolf pack needs to get the ball inside to Burns hes trying to help Thomas with the screen now DJ with fake cop defending Thomas needs to get out of the way so Burns can have some move to operate left hand jump hook and one for DJ Burns and Armando baycotts going to draw his first thats four on Carolina and this is what DJ Burns will do to you Wes weve seen so many times he doesnt necessarily establish position in the low post he gets the ball out away from the post a little bit then worms his way in there with the dribble and hes just hard to guard hes got a nice touch in there he can pass the ball very well so youre reluctant to double tick hes got five wolf pack to within one under six to go in this first half Caleb love still scoreless working against morsel Ill bake out with Burns there back to the right hand and Miss badly Gantt clears for State its just hard to create the kind of room you want against burns out of the corner Marcel is tough from there left it short and he had all day to shoot that one West normally thats an easy one from Roselle typically very reliable on the corner three is Casey Marcel no no Davis trying to set up the bay cut screen heres love over the top of Thomas and it rattled out for Caleb long point lead for Carolina the wolf pack star turkway Beyond Smith on the bench with his second foul and a big stretch for North Carolina State without Smith heres Thomas weaving through the way and were going to get a foul on Marcel thatll be his second ninth on Kevin Keats his team with 452 to play 11 coming up for Carolina dont forget ACC womens basketball Duke and North Carolina going to be a big part of what were doing on Sunday January 29th Louisville and Syracuse get our coverage started at noon the number 13 Duke at Florida State at two oclock presented by Food Lion and then of course the rest of the afternoon youll get North Carolina visiting Clemson at four and then the Commonwealth Cup on the line in womens basketball boy Kenny Brooks and Virginia Tech having a terrific year as is Virginia its at six oclock its a quadruple header of womens basketball on acc Network always available on the ESPN app Jay Davis is been the man here for Carolina hes got 14 of Carolinas 26 here in the first half and eight of them have come from the free throw line yep Joyner hes the Joyner is just pounding the ball too much the ball has to move Davis has been very good defensively against him as well heres Marcel against leaky black now burns with seven to shoot see that just totally clear out for him and the lefthand moved good for DJ Burns seven for the big fella from Rock Hill Applause Music NC State to within one Applause Joiner gambling who gets RJ Davis heres paycock Davis on the top layup door hes never got 14 of Carolinas last 16 points does RJ Davis stand boy hes really been something West joyners and thats under heavy defensive pressure joyners been all over it under four to go Tar Heels by three Burns back at it and baycott gonna get his second so Armando Baker draws his second thats five on Carolina RJ Davis is stirring the Tar Heels here in the first half at Chapel Hill Music Im a screen addicted tween and if Im not posting to the remainder of this half to koyon Smith went to the bench at the 619 mark on his second foul now Armando baycott has picked up his second for Hubert Daviss team at the 349 mark and for Carolina its been RJ Daviss show Dan where RJ Davis has made a couple of Threes only has one twopoint basket hes got eight free throws hes been very active hes also been really good so far on the defensive end Cuts cut nine rebounds here in this first half needed 17 coming into today heres Burns underneath he will feed Ross and lost it on the way up and basket interference basket interference on the Wolfpack yep yeah the ball was in the cylinder and Ross I didnt mean to the ball just slipped out of his hands and he grabbed the rim at that time they came to double team against DJ Burns and burns is a very good passer that should have been a basket for the North Carolina State Wolfpack this is the ACC rebounding Ledger and you see fakot Lynn Chapels been passed so is Dale Davis Tyler hansgrove whos next on the list there are some names on that one yes there are and Jalen Washington The Freshman whos been playing some strong minutes for Coach Davis of late could not finish so its still a threepoint Carolina lead coming up on three minutes to play Joyner with more cell and we also see Breon pass the sophomore from Reidsville North Carolina into the lineup for State for the first time the best offense is going to get it to Burns and here it is with Washington trying to tag on the big man burns backs him all the way down in school nine for DJ Burns Applause black tried to you know he went down and double teamed late but Burns he can just operate in there A Gifted big man playing basketball an incredible touchdown every time you see him live youre just amazed at how good a shooter he is and understanding where he is on the floor theres a wolf pack foul on Ross thatll be his first and 10 now on state understands where he is on the floor understands where everybody else is on the floor uses his pivot flip throw hes got great feed hes got great hands hes got great touch and hes hes the guy who has kept North Carolina state in this game leaky black at the line to shoot two hes got the stealing dunk for his only point and the first one good Kevin Keats has been forced to kind of putting DJ burns out there for more minutes I remember a couple weeks ago we were in Raleigh for the Duke game there was some concern but Burns has responded since the doosan mahorsich injury Dan and he has become a productive piece of what this season is going to be for the pack well he has and Kevin Keats told us he wanted to play about 2025 minutes a game but recently hes played well over 30 minutes a game hes been the offense here recently for the Wolfpack got some help from love out of the double team quickly from Marcels three got it Casey forcells got six Chris Ball Movement by the wolf pack rewarded and it burns is not going to get an assist for that West but it was his pass out of the double team that created that opportunity great ball Movement by North Carolina state after the ball came out from down low tied at 30 Davis tries to fight through and then turns it over love Pats his chest to say that ones on me but it is on love because Davis anticipated that love was going to go to the corner where there was an opening and love didnt see the opening and he went the wrong way Smith stays on the bench for state baycott for Carolina stays there the drive by Joyner last Touch by Burns and it will belong to Carolina dont forget dont forget weve got amazing fans across the ACC and this winter we need your help ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective snap a pick take the video tag it with the hashtag all the devotion posted on your social you might see it on accn 95 seconds to go first half and an unforced Carolina Air there 30 all the score in Hubert Daviss team just a frustrating middle error its a very bad bounce pass you cant throw a bounce pass at somebodys ankles right now the last time they got the ball the wolf pack drove the ball to the basket without Burns touching it I dont you think Burns has to touch the ball absolutely here is Joyner out front Ross thought about the three to the basket and missed the layup thats the rebound heres Davis ahead for black oh Washington was wide open and the pass from Davis got deflected over the inline itll stay with Carolina that is great Hustle by Ross youre right Washington was wide open because Ross got tangled up with the photographers but he got down the cross really quickly a lot to like about Jalen Washington the 610 freshman from Gary Indiana heres love Caleb Still scoreless In This first half to Washington now back for love and a deep three oh more that will warm the hearts of Carolina fans Dan Wilson now I think was one of his worst looks of the afternoon he wasnt facing the basket he wasnt on balance but he knocks it down threepoint lead for Carolina Burns skips for Joyner tried to attack heres Marcel from in front of the Tar Heel pitch to tie the game and again when the ball goes inside to Burns the North Carolina defense has to react and Casey Marcel has been the beneficiary tied at 33 five second differentials we wind down the first half and Hubert Davis will take the use it or lose it time out locked up at 33 late in the half at Chapel Hill hi Im Jeff from nutscom when my grandfather started this business in 19 back with Dan Bonner West Durham Smith Center in Chapel Hill locked up at 33 we thought we might have a good one first 20 minutes it hadnt been pretty all the time but its been competitive its been fiery and weve seen some terrific basketball I think Wes its exactly the kind of game you would expect in a rivalry game where there is an awful lot at stake for each one of these teams Carolina will have the ball you see the differential shot clock to game clock as we wind down the opening 20 minutes for Bert Smith trying to get Kevin Keats off the corner yeah so they can throw the ball in bounds I think Kevin Keats have been trying to stand out there in defense Kevin does not have a seat to sit in thats the thing that you notice about NC States bench 15 to shoot for love who just hit the big three a moment ago and then Marcel answered for the pass now 10 to shoot Music Applause heres the five three to shoot love Gonna Take It on the drop he tried to punch it on burns slapped up Nance tried to get a hand on it and then a foul going to be called Tommy Morrissey the whistle and its on Jalen Washington or no Casey Marcel wow DJ Burns does not have a great vertical West but he is six feet nine and 275 pounds its hard for a guard to get it over him and Ross has tried to come from behind its Ernest Ross with the foul Dan I said Marcel so heres Jalen Washington to shoot his 20 so shoot the 16th free throw of the year and he is 10 now of 16 at the line well if youre North Carolina State what you got to make sure here is that you block out so you dont give the cheap one Kevin Gates if for no other reason to say that right step aside in Chapel Hill tied at 33 theres always a phrase Applause and theres Jalen Washington hit the back end of the twoshot try a foul was called in the backcourt on Carolina do you have an invention idea but dont know what RJ Davis his first so now with 23 left heres the inbounds to Joyner from beyond the midcourt line and that will get us to the halftime Carolina 34 NC State 33 RJ Davis is 16 leads scorers stand by heres Kelsey Riggs and the nothing but that Music Music both sat out the last few minutes of the first half with two personal fouls lets see if North Carolina State goes right to DJ Burns to see if they can pick up the Third on Bay cut Earl garcelle Joyner against RJ Davis and here is burns with bacon playing just off the big man burns A Little Fall Away left of the lane and the rebound hit the deck before Davis cleared it Carolina trying to go to Bangkok Armando and Barnes gonna commit the foul thats his second starts the half for the Wolfhound thats thats sort of giving birth some of his own medicine Akon has the ball away from the basket and takes a couple of dribbles and if youre if youre gonna allow baycot to do that its going to make it very difficult for burns to play him oneonone here goes baycott right back at him with the left hand down for Armando closing in on his 61st career doubledouble and Carolinas alltime rebound record hes got nine points and nine rebounds Joyner hell launch off the game pass but remiss blocked the rebound for the tar he during a really struggling day hes one for five and generally hes a barometer from North Carolina state if he plays well they play well heres fake out again reversing in traffic on Barnes and draws the Third on DJ Burns second on NC State both have gone to the big column from Rock Hill now big cotton does a nice job just going right to the basket against Burns and you know it burns they have been able to handle Burns defensively have the Tar Heels and so one way to handle a guy is getting to sit over on the bench attack him on the other end anytime we can talk about the kangaroo kid they caught free throw gives him 10 points hes closing in on that record hes tied with Billy Cunningham right now and folks if you love college basketball go dig up the numbers from the early 60s on Billy Cunningham terrific play in the NBA closed his career playing in the ABA with the Carolina cougars but as a college player band he revolutionized the game a little bit 11 for paycock Carolina lead has jumped to five four in a row by the Tar Heels Smith on the drive scores easily over Nance for quavion Smiths got nine I thought both Smith and Joyner pressed a little bit in the first half I think it would help North Carolina state if those guys just slowed down a Beat now Burns has to be really careful here does not have anybody waiting at the table RJ Davis for leaky black tend to shoot for Carolina black ball away bounces off Burns collects for state thats pretty good defense by Smith Music play Beyond have to drop Nance and then almost threw it away love couldnt Patrol it before he reached the Wolfpack bench Wesson another thing Burns has to be careful about is setting an elite an illegal screen you know hes got those three fouls hes been very active setting screens out at the top for the wolf pack guards got to make sure he gets himself set can you see more cell got banged on the right shoulder went to the other end of the floor to kind of shake it off but hes back here in the four court for NC State and it doesnt look particularly shaking Applause square off of the fouls Dan and were talking about Smith just slowing down just a bit and thats thats what you see right there he drives the ball to the basket in the first half he wasnt completing the drive he was pulling up for those little floaters so baycotts third with just better than two minutes gone Burns is out dewana has checked in for Coach Keats meanwhile turquavion Smith whos got five straight games of 20 or more eight total on the season completes the threepoint trip hes got a dozen there and heres North Carolina State coming with the pressure tied at 38 now Caleb love hit a three late in the first half thats his only marker of the day off the screen another triple away spins off black class the glass got the rebound draws the Wolfpack foul on the stiff down and its on to cravion Smith itll be his third so now all of a sudden the wolf packs one two coach has got three each and Carolinas inside big has got three that is a hard matchup for turquavion Smith hes matched up against leaky black and yes he can stay in front of him out on the perimeter but when that ball goes up on the board Smith has to get in position to block out leafy black he didnt that time picked up his third foul on a reach just Carolinas second Miss at the free throw line in 16 tries on the front end of the twoshot chance for black the second one good hes now got five at the ball game three a four line shooting and now with three personal fouls does that make Smith a little more tentative offensively you dont want to pick up that fourth foul getting a charge right and with burns on the pitch it suddenly feels like a very perimeter driven game now for NC State at the offensive side and theres Joyner a spot up two thats cleanly through hes got five transfer from Ole Miss out of happy build Mississippi the West certainly North Carolina state has the ability to play very effectively out on the point where Joyner has struggled today but if he can get it going thatll be a big help to the Wolfpack State in front by one heres love on the drive and Casey Marcel reached in and draws the foul and thats before love hit the attack robotic shot itll be the third on Marcel well love is another guy Wes who doesnt need to settle for those threepoint shots hes got the equipment to get to the basket and the ability to finish wolf pack now has bought themselves a little bit of foul trouble here early in the second half Bake Off The Catch and score Applause that is significant foul trouble with almost 17 minutes left in this game lots of Threes on there Ben Smith Burns and Marcel all with three Joyner trying to drive the tempo and hes got four in a row for the wolf High State back in front on the junction lets see if North Carolina keeps applying the pressure the Wolfpack trying to exert some defensive pressure but North Carolina is attacking methods have created all these foul Park trouble baycott against Corona scores Armando sort of got fouled hes got eight and a half 15 in the game the wall is more athletic than Burns but he doesnt have the bolt burnt size and so its very hard for him to become big up close to the pass teams are going back and forth Jordan has got NC States last four Dan trying to drive Nance right to the Lane threw it up off the arm they got the rebound the foul on dewana thatll be his second five already on NC State in just better than four minutes from the foul category Tar Heels by one and the ball when we come back next on behind me back to Smith Center in Chapel Hill where the crowd is just being told that Armando baycott has become Carolinas alltime leader in double doubles now with his 61st surpassing Billy Cunningham the list of the top foul is pretty solid Bonner I dont know about it its a great list and you talked about Billy Cunningham sort of being a guy who helped change the game his athleticism was just something that you know wasnt that common in the early 60s kangaroo kid what a great dignity there is love Carolina the ball and the onepoint lead Davis quick check to bake out here he is at the post with gawanna defending rolling changing direction and Ebenezer commits the foul itll be his third he becomes the fourth NC State player with three with 1530 to go Dan I tell you at this rate the Tar Heels are going to be limited at the freethrow line here in the second half well Wes like you say thats their sixth foul already and theres 15 minutes and 30 seconds left in the half so here is Armando for the front end of a twoshot try and thats pointingly through dont forget tonight at 7 Eastern after we wrap in Chapel Hill Kelsey Riggs shes got all the national champs there Joel Berry Luke Hancock Carlos Boozer Recaps the day of his highlights and Analysis and the ACC coverage you can only find in one place and its nothing but net on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN app well West just as North Carolina struggled to guard DJ Burns in oneonone situations now North Carolina State cant Guard Bay caught and so Burns comes back in the game baycott and Davis have 33 of Carolinas 45 here is burns with the three drives bake out to the Baseline and kisses it off the glass hes actually a little better with that little hook shot that he is with that 15foot jumper he can make the 15foot jumper but hes much better going to the basket than falling away 4544 Tar Heels by one Caleb love or cell defending him love will take him all the way on the drive and score there thats one of the things youve been thinking about Carolinas ability to drive the ball Ryan particularly with North Carolina state in touch foul trouble when you get a lane and that was an excellent Lane created by a Bangkok Street get the ball to the goal thats defending Barnes turns with the left hand and bacon pulls down the rebound thats 11 Armando needs 17 today to become the Tar Heels alltime leader in that category here Barnes has to be careful skip pass Nance launches bounds away for the Marcel rebound Joyner trying to find a scene three rounds heres Barnes at 17 feet Miss badly paycock got a free one standing flat footed hes better portion here is Davis all the way through and it rolls here first points of the second half for RJ Davis timeout Kevin Keats Carolina about five 4944 in front of a sellout house at Smith Center we continue on acc Network its bow time Dan sometimes we talk about twoman game thats what Carolines getting today twoman game well Davis has been really efficient with four out of five from the line hes been fouled five times and hes eight out of eight from the freethrow line and Bangkok Bangkok he started off strong early and then he got in foul trouble and now hes right back where he was heres to travion Smith and leaky black trying to find a fight around to DJ Burns making black got a hand on the shot and blocked it blocking the shot might have been easier than going the city block to clear Burns here is Davis on the draft throws it up I thought he was going to get another Soca shot to go in and instead has drawn the foul on Joyner which is his second and the seventh on the wolf pack with 1324 to go Dan but leaky black with another terrific defensive play when he fights around the screen and then just keeps following and the guy who helps make that play is Nance who switched on the screen got to cuevion Smith to slow down to allow black the chance to catch up but West the only thing thats a little concerning here is RJ Davis RJ Davis seems to be fiddling with that index finger on his shooting hand and thats the one that he heard early in the season Applause largest lead for Carolina Davis now three and a half 19 in the game and this guys been on a tear for Coach Davis really since midDecember pushed the point total almost three full points if you saw the increase in percentage from the threepoint line well hes got 20 today and West 10 of those 20 coming from the freethrow line so he has been extremely aggressive in the attack almost seven minutes gone the second half his defense his team needs a basket face feels like one of those turning points Russ Ross of three two strong rebound Davis had a shot at it tried to make the save did demands yes now Ross made one of those threes earlier but in that kind of a critical situation I dont know that thats the shot you want if youre the Wolfpack heres Nance bounce pass attacks Barnes draws the foul and thats four and DJ Burns with 12 45 if you go in the ball game now west to Clement Smith almost picked up the foul coming around trying to get the Steal Kevin keeps looking down his bench shes trying to figure out what he should do hes going to put the water back in the game this is where the injuries to doosan mahorsich and Jack Clark really impact NC State free throw by black is good dont forget Saturdays are big for college basketball on acc Network and next week our biggest Saturday of the year one oclock Eastern NC State and Way Forest from WinstonSalem and Duke and Georgia Tech from Atlanta at three oclock presented by Food Lion and then the rest of the quadruple header Tallahassee at five for Clemson and Florida State offered to you by Subway and then Dan and Ill be at the castle in Blacksburg for the orange and the Hokies four big ACC games next Saturday on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN you just get the impression right here this is almost a must score possession for North Carolina State here is to travion Smith Joyner launches from in front and love had the rebound they may have to go to the deck and lets see how Tommy Morrissey scores this last Touch by love itll stay with the Wolfpack so Wes thatll count as only the second offensive rebound of the game for North Carolina State goodness Music and we said North Carolina isnt the offensive rebounding Juggernaut as a team although bacon is that they have been in the past but they are tremendous defensive rebounds and this is going to be on RJ Davis itll be his second it is the second on Carolina now Carolina has a staff thatll floor you even with a nine point lead here but its more of an offensive geared stat NC States one that blows you as that number you just mentioned Dan about the offensive rebound and there is a jet Park whistle on leaky clock which would be his second and third quarter on the target Hubert Daviss team has but four assists in the game 14 late baskets well he has been a dribble drive game well or pass it inside and then Armando Big Talk work here is Smith to the basket hard drive block the rebound thats tough shot who was almost eight minutes gone Luke he black to the basket and Ross ended on the window State trying to get something in transition Smith launches spins out on the three thats the rebound black tries to get in the front Court does for Davis look at this three the windows are wide open at both ends Marcel will score and a foul on leaky block off the Casey Morrison basket so NC State and Carolina swap missed baskets and Marcel gets an end one when we come back in Chapel Hill the Tar Heels are wearing uniforms from the 1960 era but they honored the 30year and that cant be anniversary of the 93 National Championship team that beat Michigan in the Superdome to win the title and honored jerseys of Eric Montross and George Lynch and Donald Williams George look up man were trying to show you on television there he is and theres big grits oh Double O out of Indianapolis if you remember correctly Montross is dad was a former Michigan basketball player and they beat the Wolverines for the national title Bonner well now thats thats a good little factoid Wes 5347 a dozen for Casey Marcel on the and one as we went to break in NC State to within six both these teams five and three in the ACC all the net stuff is on the line here in the first of two meetings this year between the Wolfpack and Tar Heels love on the drive baytalk follows and thats one of the reasons why its such a great idea for love to drive to the basket he draws all the inside players to try to block the shot and then nobodys there to block out our monco Bangkok if theres one guy in the country you need to block out its Bay cop and shorner bangs on the jumper hes got nine in the ball game now six here in the second half and the Wolf Pack back to within six again the Carolina State needs to force a couple of turnovers to try to generate a little bit of a run the states got a truck full of foul Problems by the way heres baycot Kawana holding post throw it back to him Advanced on the trap in the dunk with the left hand for beaten just five from Nance lead eight for the Tar Heels Joyner tries to answer rimmed off Bake Off The Rebound three away from the record on his 14th love fights into traffic gets it to blacks on that he scores I didnt see a very big window to complete the pass down I didnt see any window at all Im sitting here thinking where is he throwing that ball Smith on the drive fouled by Blink and turquavion took a nasty fall under the basket to our right and Kevin Keats is out NC State trainer Ron Cooper quickly to quavion Smith the foul on black was his fourth the fifth on Carolina but the concern now for the wolf pack heres their star sophomore turquavion Smith it looked like he landed really hard on his tailbone and you see Bert Smith and Jeff Clark at the table man that leaky black went to block the shot and it comes down right across his face and Wes keep in mind that you know you tell her about basketball play and that kind of stuff the officials here theyre looking to see if the contact there was excessive and or unnecessary so even though he was making a play on the ball if the officials decide that was excessive contact then that goes from being a common foul to a flagrant file right foreign heres another look so hes trying to block the shot clearly and does he swing through and as he follows through he catches him right on the side of the head and and while theyre looking at this trekavion Smith is still down right Ron Cooper is out and Kevin Keats is out and I think theyre tending to turquavion Smith and its hard to tell exactly what theyre diagnosing here with him because of the view we have and so forth and Doug Halverson who is the North Carolina basketball trainer is down to help Ron Cooper his colleague at NC State here and Western they may be asking for the medical personnel the EMTs to come in sure and its beyond our Viewpoint here is to to what the injury is for taquavion we certainly dont want to speculate here on on the condition here what theyre looking for but obviously shaken up on the play and so West we really cant see what yeah I mean hes behind the basket stanchion there we really cannot see what theyre doing the only thing we can see is as he lays on his back there hes moving his feet yep the legs and uh so forth and uh well theres talented young man was making a a what I would call a typical turquavion Smith basketball without any question yep and plenty of concern from his teammates as you would expect now now I have this were seeing teams additional emergency Personnel coming down and now a backboard if you will is being brought out but as Dan told you we have seen his feet move so we will step aside here is to quavion Smith is being tended to underneath the basket here in Chapel Hill North Carolina with a 10point lead at 5949 well step aside at Smithson back after this heres the thing about the good times in life we dont always realize were in them B5 to go in the ball game North Carolina leading 5949 sir quavion Smith was injured on a drive to the basket and Dan weve walked through this play a little bit but for those of you who just dialed in here another look well Smith drives to the basket and he is a defenseless player right there at that point and leaky black comes through and swings his arm and gets him on the side of the face and he goes down and what the officials after looking at that we were talking about whether the contact was excessive and or unnecessary that would be a flagrant one file but after looking at it and looking at the result the officials have decided that that is a flagrant to foul and by definition a flagrant two foul is excessive severe and or extreme and you see their dangerous contact right and certainly if you know the officials consider you see there the severity of the contact hard contact to the Head injury potential when the player is vulnerable and he was a vulnerable player and clearly you have an injury situation and so the officials after looking at have determined that this will be a flagrant to foul on leaky black and of course the big concern for everybody right now is the health of turquavion Smith but the penalty for a flagrant to foul is ejection from the game so leaky black uh will be ejected from the game as a result of the flagrant two foul right and they have uh continued to tend to turquavion Smith below the basket here and both benches have uh kind of been informed of what the resolve will be Wesson certainly there was no intention by leaky black there to cause an injury hes trying to block the shot and the contact was excessive so Smith went down and leaky black wasnt trying to hurt anybody this is very unfortunate but leaky black wasnt trying to do that so Smith is uh now on a stretcher that it was brought out while we were away during a commercial break and uh they have taken all the precautionary measures here the athletic training and Sports Medicine folks both North Carolina and NC State have combined here and uh the EMT folks in the building have uh responded accordingly and uh here in just a moment turquavion Smith will be taken from the floor as Dan told you we did see his feet move but now they have uh strapped everything in for this uh ride out of the building on the stretch en Smith settled for him and our best wishes absolutely unless you you didnt send an improvement yet but they had everything strapped again thats it right and Kevin Keats and Hubert Davis around their respective clubs and now for Coach Keats part of the challenge here Dan is a fallen teammate in the emotion that that brings and yet you got to go back on the floor and youre down 10 with under 10 to play Wes I I really dont know how you handle a situation like that so so NC State will have the ball and therell be no warmup period here for the delay so well go right to play two on leaky black as Dan told you a moment ago for leaky black Craig Campbell with sports information director from North Carolina State just stopped by and said that leaky black has an elbow injury on Smith excuse me has an elbow injury and a neck injury okay and that thats the extent thats exactly what we were told we dont have any more information other than that all right and leaky black of course has you know he has left the bench because hes been ejected with the flagrant file so here is jarkel Joyner an 80 free throw shooter so the penalty of course is two shots at North Carolina state will get the ball right so theres the first of the two free throws thats an interestingly enough to get back to basketball that is only the fifth freethrow attempt of the game now the sixth for North Carolina State theyve made all six but North Carolina has made 21 free throws yep and Joyner as LJ Thomas Casey Marcel Ebenezer dewana and Ernest Ross in the game lefthand move in the basket for EB first bucket of the day for Diwana 611 Junior from Ghana and now Carolina lead is trimmed to six Nance theyve got to ask him for the ball Caleb love tend to shoot drives through traffic blocked and a whistle called and I believe Ernest Ross has picked up his third on the wolf pack and a couple of free throws for Caleb love coming up again Caleb love doing a nice job instead of hoisting the shot is the shot clock runs down he drives the ball to the basket and when you do that you force the inside guys to come and help and that will free up baycot for those offensive rebounds instead he draws the foul now the 22nd made free throw for North Carolina theyve outscored North Carolina state 226 from the free throw Caleb love now with half dozen in the ball game and second of the rattle down lead is seventh so where does the offense come from now BJ burns on the bench with those four personal fouls Smith out of the ball game or cell spots for two rebound for Nance and Dan how long can Kevin Keith wait with DJ Burns and the four fouls at this point well see heres Davis Applause oh Wes you know if you put Burns back in the game then North Carolina is just going to attack him heres RJ Davis eight to shoot got caught in the air but dumps in the corner for Don and Armando PayPal the rebound second chance for the Tar Heels love thought about the punch on the drive against Marcel backs it out there he goes tries to beat Marcel high flyer no good fake cop collects draws the foul yes hes going to be close to that record doesnt he chasing it hard two on Gantt 10 now on the wolf pack so two shots nonetheless for Armando bacon who has now pulled down his 16th rebound to tie Tyler Hansbrough with 1219 all time and the first of the two free throws good for the senior from Richmond whos now got 20 points and 16 rebounds hes well on his way theyre still eight and a half minutes left in this game hes well on his way to a 2020 game he sure is second free throw good tar hell lead back to nine so it was just not much offense out there on the courts of North Carolina State Joyner step back at D2 and Nance had a shot at it heres love on the run out across for RJ Davis Baseline floater Off the Mark Gantt pulls it away Wolfpack trying to get in transition and Marcel will drop it Thomas got the rebound put it back up and RJ Davis comes away with it and Caleb would love is down hes down underneath on the Baseline unless I did not see what happened and at the under eight were going to get a timeout anyway but Applause Tommy Morrissey and Bert Smith get timeouts called well step aside in Chapel Hill Applause 53 with 7 40 to play and while we were away Dan they went to review the Casey Marcel Drive as Casey Marcel drives to the basket West you can clearly see in the replay that he Wards off with that right arm and that he hits Caleb love right in the face with that right arm and as the officials went over to review Wes and what they decided was it was a flagrant one personal foul is what we were talking about before excessive and or unnecessary and thats what the officials decided it was an excessive play by Casey morsell now once once if they didnt make a call there was no foul called on that place so they didnt make a call right and so when you go over to review a play where there was no call made you cant come back and say its a common five there was no common foul called so you have to its either a flagrant foul or its nothing in this case its a flagrant foul the penalty is two shots and the ball but since North Carolina already had the ball theyre going to pick it up here and get it in Bounds at half court yep and by the way that was Applause also 10 fouls on NC State and of course theres no basket for North Carolina State shot by Dunn got knocked away scooped up heres Thomas 11point lead for Carolina is the largest of the day thats 6453 Joyner couldnt get through against DeMarco Dunn 65 sophomore in now with love and Davis so Carolina playing with a very three yard flavor after the black rejection and the rebound record belongs to Armando PayPal heres Davis Nance heres pay cut on the catch and now love going Baseline on Marcel and Gantz will pull down the rebound Applause listen again if youre North Carolina state where are you going to get offense Jordan looking for the water screen with the out route more so 10 to shoot great job by Mance to get over there five minutes heres love Taylor tries to take Gan on the drive and will draw the foul from Greg Gannon to be his third with 609 to go free throws coming for Caleb love on the third against Gan but Armando takeout has become North Carolinas alltime leading rebounder here this afternoon Dan and theyre double doubles leader all time and there is Psycho T from Poplar Bluff Missouri Music tremendous Rebound with West yep and hes I mean hes such a factor in North Carolina goes to him and hes so hard to defend on the inside well when you put a guy on the inside who can get you 20 and 20 and you know thats the way Tyler Hansbrough was when North Carolina needed a basket they could throw him the ball and he could either get hed either could score or go get to the free throw line he was a tremendous free throw shooter as well yep Joyner but morsel Wolfpack needs a basket its been almost four minutes since theyve scored here is Burns playing with the four fouls and Nance will pick up the foul thatll be his first that is six on Carolina here in the second half 13point Tar Heel lead Vance got called from the foul because hes taking his forearms and hes pushing back against DJ Burns Burns off the Quick inbounds Pass lefthand turn and one for big DJ Burns Applause so the foul on Dance will be his second thats seven on Carolina Burns will go to the line for the and one for Wes the wolf pack is still in this game they need to generate some turnovers and get some easy baskets Burns is good Dan I saw Tyler at halftime his health was back toward 100 good and uh is thinking about trying to continue the pro career but hes also a popular cohost of the Sleep Hawk worldwide podcast that you ought to listen to Its The Travelers the Sleep hop worldwide thats right yeah he and uh his buddy Brandon Staton here is the Miss and in transition Joyner Applause tomorrow NC State trailing 10 ahead of five minutes to go Burns Baseline got the roll tell you what DJ Burns you see him live you realize what the hypes about dont you well you sure do and Wes Kevin Keats waited as long as he could as long as he could afford to and burns has been the offense since he came to the game big fellow from Rock Hills got 16 and Davis just beat him on the drive hes got 22 now Tyler Burns has to stay away from a foul on a play like that right Davis knows it Thomas Applause heres burns with dance defending Barnes turns again left hand and scores nine in the half 18 in the ball game for DJ Burns is wondering how come I have to plug because number five has three fouls I understand that but Im talking about from Nances point of view from the team point of view I understand the thorough right heres the Drive Davis before the shot foul will be called by Jeff Clark the play that started the day on the perimeters now being contested at The Rim Dan but Davis has done such a great job he stretches out there Burns does a good job to stay away but heres DJ burns on the offensive end theres not really very much more that Nance can do he makes him stop hes outside the lane for heavens sakes and he turns and makes that little jump hook a couple of free throws for RJ Davis hes now got 11 points today at the line hes got 23 in the ball game and his tear continues Applause Junior from White Plains New York his dad was a 2 000 Point score at Mercyhurst College and 218 points wow that Gene has translated well for his son and North Carolina has made a season high 30 free throws today West 10point lead under four to go Joyner a three back rim and fake out another rebound thats 18 rebounds for Armando baycott heres Caleb love for Dunn Nance wraps it in for bacon who lost a handle on it to Marcel who saves it to Joyner through the legs of bacon how did he get under there and Sharko Joyner the foul and the basket so NC State cuts it to eight a chance to draw to seven when we continue in a moment so that way shes up in the game with the subways ACC Network basketball presented by Subway Subways upping their game with the AllStar Subway series menu just ordered by name or number with Dan Bonner West Durham Smith Center in Chapel Hill North Carolina leading NC State as we rejoin you in this 243rd meeting between the two schools and our game summary weve had a flagrant too and an injection for leaky black against her quavion Smith who has a neck and wrist injury for the wolf pack at the 9 45 mark Armando bacon has become Carolinas alltime leader in double doubles and in career rebounds here today and not only that Wes he tied his own record theres also a record helped by Billy Cunningham for the most rebounds by Tar Heel against NC State its 18 he did that last year in Raleigh hes done it tonight and Billy Cunningham had 18 back in 1965 Carolina whos only hit one of their last seven saw it knocked away with seven to shoot here in a seven point game Wes after everything thats gone on its sort of a surprise that its a seven point game here is bacon and the jump shot Falls for Armando Baker had seven in the half hes got 16 now here in half two for 23 arrest North Carolina state has been able to regenerate its offense theyve scored a couple of times in a row they cant get a stop Applause out front heres Joyner a straight away deep three slapped out love the rebound I dont think any NC State possession at this point where burns doesnt touch the ball is a good possession Applause thats love all the way home Burns this game hasnt always been pretty rough but it has every bit of the amount of intensity that youd expect in a game between these two teams and I think that foul dance thats his third thats nine on North Carolina hes probably a couple of free throws for joint hes probably just happy to be following somebody other than uh Burns yeah Fair Joyner knocks down the freeform hes now got 15 in the ball game and is five for five at the lot so Burns just went out of the game but Im sure that thats little offense defense substitution to wanna coming in on the defensive end and theyll get Burns back in there just as quickly as they can see Joyner knocks down the free throw hes been the guy hes got 13 in the half 16 now ballgame and quite frankly this is where the offense is coming from he and burns yes Davis tried to get it to love deflected Joyner Nas collects Hubert Davis Taps his head to indicate the offense Davis against Breon pass heres baycott tried to skip a role with love leaping catch with three on the shot clock the floater again so what you wont see is going to catch in the NFL tonight as you saw there seconds to go its a nonpoint game followed Away by Joyner rebounded by Nance Marcel will follow Davis into the front court for the Wolfpack Wolfpack again which they havent been able to get a stop NC State knows any foul sends Caroline to the line for two shot clock at 10 game clock at 111 Applause heres Davis now five to shoot baykai in the corner Nance blocked out of bounds gawanna with six tenths of a second on the shot clock Wes you got to get this ball in point four you can catch and shoot so you have time to catch the truth but you dont have any time to do anything else gotta catch it and let it go love love caught it missed the dump got the rebound and now theres NC State foul theyre down nine and there is Casey Marcels fifth hell finish with a dozen points yes and thats the diploma you face in that situation yeah you got to foul because thats the only way to get the ball back but if you get the ball back this is this is exactly the kind of play that should be with only 06 seconds left and Loves just not able to convert it so here is love at the line five of six at the line knocks the first one back were going to say unless Marcel is one of the best offensive players and you need to foul but if he fouls us out of the game 13 now for love 10 here in the second half yes and this has actually been a very impressive defensive performance by North Carolina you know Hubert Davis told us this morning wasnt worried about his offense hes worried about his defense well doesnt have to worry about this defense 11 point lead Joiner coming to find an alley against Nance fall away is good timeout Kevin Keats oh the charquel Joyner basket 7667 it is now with 414 Hubert Daviss team trying to get to 146 and maybe more importantly Dan this traffic at six and three in the ACC standings at nights in but Carolinas day was geared around RJ Davis at number five Armando baycow plus we talked about Bangkok coming in and how he had a chance today to break the record at North Carolina for double doubles the record held by Billy Cunningham he did it weve talked about the fact he had a chance to break the North Carolina record for rebounds held by Tyler Hansbrough he did it he has been a tremendous factor that North Carolina State really hasnt had an answer for him except in the first half when he got in foul trouble and they had to take him out of the game well hes got 23 RJ Davis has got 24 47 of Carolina 76 now if you want to nitpick a little bit the Tar Heels only have five assists here today Dan well Wes I would choose not to nitpick because this has been a this is the kind of a game Westward North Carolina state is going to pressure you have to attack them one of the reasons they dont have a lot of assist is theyve been so much time at the freethrow line you dont get assists when you go to the free throw line Applause but this has just been a very intense game a very physical game exactly the kind of game you expect in a rivalry game and we said before the game started this game today might have been more important for North Carolina than for North Carolina State because theyre the home team Dan in the quad Factor here or just because of the need for the quad one win well they needed a quad one win yep Davis double team heres love and theres a reach in on China now of course Wes the quad how many wins you have in the quad is he going to be determined until the season is over because its a moving Target but at this point North Carolina State came in today as number 27 in the net and so if youre playing a team thats 27 in the net that means its a quad one game for you at home so here this is what North Carolina is looking at people criticizing they only have one quad one win well this is an opportunity for a quad one win that looks likely theyre going to get then the next two have block two and theyre very important games and then uh Duke and Wake Forest more opportunities for Quad one wins a very difficult stretch for North Carolina yep and you see the 30 in Quad two and then no problems with three and four well they havent lost except in Quad one situations the schedule is excellent from that standpoint 11point game final half minute Joyner step out on Nance and the rebound for Davis but a foul called I believe against DeMarco Dunn itll be his third 10 on Carolina so a couple of free throws coming for Ernest Ross Wes and the important thing is we showed you what North Carolinas record was against wolves and their their net the important thing your net isnt as important as your opponent said Ill give you examples from last year Rutgers was 77 into that and yet they made the NCAA tournament but the reason that they made the NCAA tournaments they were six and six in quadrant games but so the quad one is thats the coin of the realm thats thats what everybodys looking for so you got to get those wins and this at the present time will be considered a quad one win for North Carolina you see Ernest Ross first free throws of the day knocks them both down not a particularly good free throw shoot but Ross is maybe one of the most improved players on Kevin keetzs roster given kind of the climate with injuries and whatnot for NC State who gets Notre Dame on Tuesday night by the way in Raleigh and theres a backcourt foul a front Court foul on Joyner which will be his fourth Wesson if youre if your opponents rank is one through 30 if you beat them at home thats a quad one win so North Carolina state is 27 now if your opponent is one through 75 and you beat them on the road and you on the road then thats a quad one win so for North Carolina State this would be a quad one loss so quad one loss really doesnt hurt you that bad and bacon will come out and a hug from Hubert Davis hey what an afternoon for breakup well and I thought Hubert Davis and Armando both yesterday spoke to local media here in the Chapel Hill in the Triangle of North Carolina about what it means to do this at North Carolina and the heritage of the program and all the players that have been here to get not only the DoubleDouble record but certainly the rebound record and bacon said I want to do it at home I dont want to wait for a Tuesday night trip to the JMA Wireless dome in central New York to play Syracuse so Armando delivered and Carolina did 11 Point Victory for the Tar Heels to go to 63 and 146 NC State will get a five and four and 15 and five now again a quad one win for North Carolina caught one loss for North Carolina State but a very intense physical game as weve said the kind you expect from a rivalry game and the only thing here
