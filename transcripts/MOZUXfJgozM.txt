similar to the way Tony Bennett did here in Charlesville and in talking to Notre Dame associate head coach Kyle G the other day he stressed the fact that they could have gone portal but instead they want to build it the oldfashioned way in South Bend Virginia with the basketball first the whoos in their home whites and the Fighting Irish in there Road Blues with the gold lettering and trim Andrew roie to beakman who brings it back out theres the matchup were going to watch number two in White against number three in blue mcney a dead eyee from three hes got his first of theight Isaac mcney comes into the game second nashley in threepoint field goal percentage and off to a great start here tonight Burton along with Logan Imes JR kesn Who lit up UVA a month ago in the 20point win up in South Bend Tay Davis Kevin NY round out the starting Applause f yeah kesn went for 17 points in the first half and really set the tone on a night where Virginia just got whipped a rarity losing by 22 points on December the 30th and for this UVA starting five Jordan Miner has since moved into the starting lineup and it feels like a little bit different Virginia team right now it absolutely is a different team because you have the level of physicality that Jordan Miner provides and Virginia is a much better team on his defensive boards with Miner in the lineup as well heres beakman working on Burton the double team gets the ball out of his hands swing it to McNeely five to shoot beakman forces it up off the front rim out of bounds its Notre Dame Applause basketball but when you have such a onesided surprising game like we did in South Bend you know thats the largest margin of defeat in an ACC game for Virginia since 2017 can there be lingering effects for UVA tonight Cory I dont believe that will be the case especially in this building Im sure Virginia is locked in and youre talking about the longest home winning streak in college basketball at 21 games so this is a place where Virginia plays with a tremendous amount of confidence Burton with the great ball fake gets by the excellent defender in beakman for his first two but a smart play by Burton understanding that beakman is a very good shot blocking guard gets beakman in the air and gets the easy layup on the fly by Cory you mentioned off the top how beakman is currently leading the ACC in both assists and steals two years ago he did that plus he led an assist a turnover ratio which is a rare triple and hes got a shot at doing it again this year hes only trailing Dukes Jeremy roach in assisted turnover ratio theres a takeaway what we have become accustomed to seeing from number two at UVA and right now douge fresh you consider that Reese Beakmans probably his biggest competition to repeat as ACC defensive player of the year is on his team just set a screen for him well you cant go wrong if you pick Ryan Dunn you cant go wrong if you pick Reese bean I think I would lean towards Dunn right now to be ACC Defensive Player of the Year how about you oh at this point Im going to probably go back with reys and and the reason I say that and and again I can definitely be swayed toward Ryan but the reason I go to Reese is because he normally does a better job as you see another Ryan Dunn block shot and you talk about Reeses stats Ryan Dunn happens to leave the ACC and blocks by the way 23 per game hes also fifth in steals per game the thing that might put it over the top for me is his versatility to be able to defend one through four even one through five and what hes been doing especially lately on the glass agree but one thing I will say about Rees beakman is the fact that he has more lock Downs guys coming in with big numbers that dont get those numbers against re beastman re beefing because he is an elite on ball Defender so hes one of those guys you say has the nickname off Knight oh I call him glove glove I like off Knight I really think thats a neat way to point out the fact that whoevers matched up against you is going to have an off Knight but I tell you who did not have an off night against him the first time was actually Burton and this noted aim team and you see Ryan Dunn showing off his League leading 24 blocks per game coming up with another one to start the game Jordan Miner does a great job of keeping that inbounds and maintaining possession for Virginia yeah we see Miner there 68 242 the grad transfer after a marvelous fouryear career at miramac where he was coconference Player of the Year a season ago we touched on it in the open how it has just changed UVA at both ends of the floor another jump shot by mcne and right now for Virginia youve gotten exactly what you wanted from the start youve got great defense happening but you also got Im might getting going from the perimeter and he is dangerous on this floor yeah that was a two hes got all five Virginia points you see coming in 48 on threes hes actually been better against ACC opponents 51 on threepoint shots another rebound for done off the Miss by Logan and IM got a great look on that when when youre playing against Virginia you get a crack of the paint and get a lay up youve got to take advantage of that especially in this building because they dont give up many easy opportunities roie thought about it tip up by duno kept alive and it comes to the Fighting Applause Irish Notre Dame seven and 13 on the year they have never won a basketball game here in the city of Charlottesville either at your old home you Hall oh I participated in one of those or here at jpj what do you remember about your one game against against the Fighting Irish back in the 90s everything 22 points big win over Elmer Bennett and my God the fs as Ryan Dunn comes up with his second block of the game and hes off to a great defensive start maybe I could be swayy maybe Ryan Dunn is the accs defensive player of the year Music MH when youre talking Virginia and this year with Notre Dame points come at a premium they absolutely do and you consider the fact that Virginia has not allowed over 70 points and 51 straight games in jpj however Notre Dame put up 76 on Virginia on the December 30th matchup so Im sure thats something Tony been talked to his team a lot about in that first meeting to make sure that they were aware that noted Dame can score points even though its been a struggle for them at times well you wouldnt expect the Fighting Irish to make 11 threes again tonight but like you say theyve shown they can do it against this Virginia Defense thats one guy that can do it on Q the coachs son Braden Shrewsberry stepping up and knocking down a three ball and Braden not in the starting lineup in this game but showing that he can absolutely get it done coming off the bench knocks down one out of the timeout well he put 25 on georia Tech earlier this month and over the last six games Braden Shrewsberry has been averaging nearly 14 per contest for to shoot mcney finds roie long three ball and Off the Bench Blake buan and the Freshman gets it back out to pman who buries the three great to see Rees beakman stepping up and shooting the three ball thats his second threepoint field goal attempt of this game already and I love to watch ree bman when hes aggressive Virginia now making that second three has just as many threes as they made in the first matchup his first of the night shooting it just a shade under 30 on the year coming into the game mat Zona Off the Bench for Notre Dame Imes takes a spill two to shoot Burtons got to do something with it and unfortunately for Notre Dame he passed it away and that is a shot clock violation forced by Virginia six college basketball games highlight our ESPN schedule Saturday and three of them are Sonic Blockbusters number four Houston and number eight Kansas tip off at four Eastern then number seven Duke takes on number three North Carolina and 10th rank Kentucky hosts number five Tennessee 12 and a half hours of college hoops that you can also watch on the ESPN app from anywhere some big time matchups on Saturday see a number of rivalries going on and of course what will be a new rivalry in Houston and Kansas probably the top two teams in the Big 12 as Jacob Rose who knows a little about the Big 12 transfer Turing over from Oklahoma steps up and knocks in a third three for Virginia on the evening and I guess hard work pays off he was out this morning with nobody else was out here getting up extra shots and Groves is a good shooter knocks down his first attempt coming off the bench for Tony Bennett and you also understand that bro Groves has played a number of different roles for this Virginia team he was the starting center has started at the four and now coming off the bench but still providing that shooting touch again Notre Dame up against against it with the shot clock no problem for Julian R for the second coming off the bench the Junior from Detroit has his first points and you have to give Notre Dame a lot of credit and when you talk about having beaten a team before youre going to have confidence coming in playing against that team and not Dame has come into this building confident regardless of the success that Virginias had here at home pman comes to the basketball and weve got a whistle and a foul on that action both teams off to a good start from Beyond The Arc Virginia just a little better so far Jacob Gro stepping up knocking down a three he told me that he was excited about this matchup hes hearing all the conversation about RJ Davis is the best guard in the country and um you know those two guys were McDonalds allamericans in the same year if roach is healthy hes going to have something to say about that all right now as it relates to our matchup tonight between Notre Dame and Virginia you saw those standings the whoos with their fourgame winning streak have moved into a third place tie with Florida State a s olds team that looks so much better than it did back in November and December does this Virginia team have the power to push Carolina and Duke over the course of the next four or five weeks I believe they absolutely do one considering the fact that I know North Carolina comes to jpj and Virginia in this building is as good as any team and weve seen Texas AM you know find out that as well so this is a place that has been a you know place of Horrors for really opposing teams because Virginia does this they shoot the basketball extremely well on this floor Jacob grov now knocking down his second threepoint field goal the grad transfer out of Spokane Washington makes it 148 Virginia Virginia now four of seven from distance coring Marcus Burton buries the three gets those points right back for the fighting and that is three of three from Beyond the threepoint Arc for noted Aim so you talked about and by the way Doug Sherman said I dont think that theyll make 11 threes in here today Im not certain of that no name off to a hot star shooting the basketball and none of that from JR kesn who again was the one who set the tone a month ago up in South Ben oh hes not going to be the one getting those looks I can you that no mcne tough shot you can TRS Down The Long rebound despite mat Zona grabbing a handful of his jersey second offensive rebound for Blake Buchan whos coming off the bench with a strong production early so confident that he goes to the one foot dir nisy Fade Away showing off his shooting touch Im guessing that the top 100 recruit growing up in Idaho watched a little Dirk nitzki he knew that shot was coming well Blake buan is extremely skilled again as a first year hes been battling with the roller coaster of trying to learn how to play the college game but he is showing off his ability to get it done offensively as is Jacob Groves who steps back off of great action knocking down the three ball and then Blake Buchanon one foot Dirk nisy style but a great start for Buchanan two offensive rebounds and a bucket early as Tony Bennett gets Jordan Miner back on the floor and you know what Cory its been 16 years since Tony Bennett was the head coach at Washington State but each of those two players may have been recruited through residual relationships that he still maintains out in that part of the country its really something as you know better than I do as Carrie boo throws it down the relationships within this sport Im never surprised by who knows who no absolutely not and you consider the fact that where coaches travel also many people forget Tony Bennett was actually an assistant coach at Wisconsin and was a part of their final four team under Bo Ryan so a number of great relationships along the country for Tony Bennett into the ball game Dante Harris he brings energy Off the Bench for the whoos hes such a welcome sign to have back for Virginia and having him healthy not only does he heat the basketball up defensively but also another playmaker to have on the floor alongside ree beakman so teams cant take beakman out of games yeah whether its 5 minutes 8 minutes 12 minutes a game I think its huge for beakman to have that man off the ball and here he comes once again trying to go one on Three Harris going to bring it back out T Murray still riding high off that terrific game last Wednesday against North Carolina State Miss fires Notre Dame with a basketball down five keep an eye on Harris he Lim back a little bit on that possession now maybe that burst put a little extra pressure on that Applause ankle Roper work on Murray leans in puts it up off the window and through strong move by roer once he gets into the painted area and Virginia not going to help with tame Murray on the Block so roer just a little more physical able to go through the contact for the bucket well after missing four their first shot five shots from the floor Notre Dame has made five of six hanging with UVA under eight minutes to go in the Applause Music half Groves does he have a third yes he does he brings a completely different dimension to Virginias offense often times you see Virginia running what they like to call their sides offensively but often times that big man is a pick and roll God Jacob grov is a pick and pop gu and hes popped alone three three point field goals here already this evening well Tony Bennett new Groves AA coaches back in Spokane in fact one was Tonys dentist so again these are the relationships that get you guy who come off the bench and give you nine quick points and this is the hardhitting research that you get from douge fresh how do you know about peoples dead you know what that may be a heper violation by the way Harris a little bit short got to ask the questions to get the answ this is true go fishing and you never know what youre going to come up with off the turnover beatman have the P for the N the a CC steals leader does it once again Rees peakman turning defense into Applause offense and comes up with the easy bucket and the largest lead of the night for Virginia on top by eight Zona kicks to the corner Shrewsberry thought about it now IMS for three boo track down the offensive rebound hes going to attack Roes into the lane tough Applause shot beakman rejects the screen gets to the bucket and is tripped the foul takes us to break Jacob Groves is not a pick and roll guy hes a pick and pop guy he pops back behind the threepoint Arc and knocks out his third three of the evening Reese beakman doing what he does best the finish no look at the cam to say hi to Mom Julie watching at home free mhm at the wall of Historia and the moldes what about the canopy in Paris bu and honors babe when you want points that can take you anywhere it matters where you stay Hilton for

AllAmerican team coach I am going to get back to you on that one cuz its going to take some thought from me and Im also playing Fanboy as we see one of the greatest of all time Nolan Ryan celebrating his 77th birthday here taking in a game at jpj alongside John grome his wife Renee and being a part of this great atmosphere here at jpj where Virginia is ex enjoying a 21 game home winning streak the longest in the country dougy fresh Im just thinking about seven no hitters seven no hitters another turnover committed by Notre Dame well have a top 15 Big 12 womens basketball matchup tomorrow night on ESPN of the app Madison Booker and number 12 Texas take on number 13 Bay coverage begins at 830 Eastern 730 central right after the Pro Bowl game skills Showdown well Notre Dame has as many made buckets as turnovers so far tonight Cory seven AP piece down by 10 with the basketball Tay Davis denied groes doing it on both ends of the floor oh you got to shoot that I mean if youre as hot as Jacob Rose are come on man I dont think Tony benett is going to mind you pulling up on the break when youre four for four from three not just a good close out by kesn no shoot shoot over the close out youve earned the right beakman UVA by 13 points led by its fourth year from Milwaukee the whoos are now 7 out of 12 from Beyond the threepoint line Music tonight and Stephie graph taking on John mackenro and Maria Sharapova talk about some star power that is absolute star power power right there my guy of course coosf Greenberg who you did a game here with not too long ago as Virginia forces another turnover coming out of time out Michael Shrewsberry who told us earlier today that he was going to be more positive with his team team well let me let me give a little backstory on that so he did tell us this morning that he empowered each of his players and coaches and people on staff right down something and tell us what you can do better starting now for the rest of the season and what he said and youre putting it very PG and I appreciate that yes I do that that hes going to stop being a jerk in certain circumstances okay so anyhow and he told us that of course he referenced and he showed his team the movie Hancock where Hancock was telling everyone good job he was as though it was embroided into his brain as his son knocks down to three ball braon hits the three in the corner to make it a 10point game once again but he says even after turnovers he was going to look at his guys and tell them good job begrudgingly however after the last turn over coming out timeout he did not tell anyone good job yeah that has gone away and Groves just keep on keeping up that is a new Virginia high for him 15 points in counting and yet to touch the rim all five threepoint field goals have hit the bottom of the net he came into the game at 42 that number is going way up kesn with his first three for the Irish and that was much more so of a rhythm shot for kesn even though he shot it quickly he was in Rhythm on that one that wasnt a force shot at all so not it aint battling back continuing to shoot along side within great look by D misslay up with this minor to clean it up Virginia calls timeout after the tip in by Jordan Miner well be back in 30 seconds to jpj this house is a gener house and youre just the person to keep it running because a proud homeowner has a protective Instinct and frankly the brains to know the Grid its going to let you down sometimes thats why when the rest of the block is lighting candles and looking for flashlights youre ready to rock and roll its not just a generator its power move request a free quote today now Virginia is Jake Groves third stop we mentioned what he did at Oklahoma but dont forget he started at Eastern Washington and do you remember when he put 23 on Kansas in the 2021 NCAA tournament no he could come on Cory I dont remember that he can fill it up and hes doing it tonight I can tell you what Ill remember this performance to be sure about that five of five in the first half shooting the three ball here in front of the home crowd and this is one of the reasons why Virginia has been so tough to beat in this building these guys feed off of this crowd theyve got great confidence shooting the basketball and for this Virginia team the way they defend when theyre making shots they are hard to beat you dont remember Jake and his brother Tanner Groves teaming up against Kansas they kind of became media Darlings would you like for me to spell it k w or n o I mean I dont know well you should spell it n because you P dont know well you clearly didnt understand it when I said no the first time I I just cant believe it you as a basketball Savant that was a big moment anyhow my point was in his third stop he is still able to shoot the basketball its another Notre Dame turnover number nine here in the first half no thumbs up coming from that there will be no thumbs up there will actually be three new players coming onto the floor and Michael Shrewsberry is going to probably use a foul to give on this possession to try to stop Virginia from getting anything good there it is thats only their second so why not do it again well heres the problem with doing it again you dont want to put guys in foul trouble that youre going to need hopefully if you this game becomes close down the stretch so you dont want to keep racking up fouls on important guys this is one a scenario where you put other guys in the game if youre going to do that McNeely what a sideline out of bounds beautiful action peakman finds mcne and what a way to close out the half Virginia everything he could to try to get his team a win in the first half he did that by the way got the ball to Jacob Groves which always is a good route shrewbury gets the start in the second half Miss fires McNeely with the rebound UVA will walk it up with beakman this a Virginia team that has brought the defense as expected forcing nine turnovers in that first half and turning them into 10 points to help build this lead mcney tries to bounce it to Applause Dun beakman comes to the ball gives to Dun shot clock down to five Beakmans pass deflected away Imes with it Burton got a hand on that pass and Notre Dame comes up with the Applause Music Applause steal Shrewsbury comes to the ball takes a nice pass from Burton and puts it in that was a great job by Shrewsberry but making himself available is Davis has to put his shoe back on not sure what happened on that possession to lose his shoe but Davis actually trying to get back down the floor on defense with just one shoe on give patris a lot of credit recognizing that giving the young man time to get his feet back together young man out of Warren Central High School in Indianapolis started his college career at Sean Hall a year ago playing with his brother before transferring back to the Midwest in Notre Dame heres roie scoreless in that first half to beat at nine points good ball movement back out to Applause roie Beakmans pass again deflected by Burton thats the second turnover for ree beakman here to start this second half give Burton a lot of credit for getting a handle the basketball and then getting down hill as another shoe falls off now Matt Zona trying to get his shoes together and Im not even going to say what you think Im going to say well you know what Im thinking and I know what youre thinking some things are better left un said Cory Music absolutely Virginia looking for its fifth straight win take the floor tonight tied for third in the ACC behind North Carolina and Duke along with Florida State points now for the fourth year Rees beakman and we talked about the two turnovers of Ree beakman and often times he turns the basketball over because hes not aggressively looking to score the basketball and he doesnt turn it over a lot but the times where he does there often times where he could actually be taking a shot by the way he had two steals in that first half he is now 13 from passing oel Wilson for the alltime career steals record here at UVA and you understand why its so important for that to happen this season four years exactly Reese beakman in his fourth year has an opportunity to play five for Virginia but when you break records its always better to do it a third steal by Burton if he can security he does and maybe he heard us saying that uh the veteran had gotten the better of him in the first half cuz hes Come Out Swinging he absolutely has and hes gotten those three steals against Reese beakman thats the third turnover for beakman in this second half which is very uncharacteristic for Applause him and so the young man who is fourth in the country among freshman in scoring at the line 81 and into the band in student section he misses the first get a look at that matchup that we highlighted I believe there was something on the line there Im not sure what it was bacon oh bacon thats of course Smithfield I should have known that dougy fresh but I tried in the first half to tell you something I thought you would know and you said you didnt know so I wasnt going to put you on the spot again Cory yeah youre right you shouldnt ever do that well you know thats not going to be the case by the way UVA has as many turnovers to start the second half as it had the entire first half Braden Shrewsberry taking advantage of the start in the second half and its back to a 10point game and whatever the fir the halftime conversation was from Michael Shrewsberry to his team theyve been a different group here to start this second half especially on the defensive end of the floor and you know last Saturday at Louisville Notre Dame after dominating the first half against the Cardinals didnt come out to start the second half in the best way little slow to start here tonight pman check that Virginia excuse me on Saturday big bucket there to stem the tie the lead back to a dozen yeah Virginia had a huge lead at halftime in that game at Louisville and its often times its hard to come out with that same level of intensity as Matt Zona steps up and knocked down to three and that is going to be the weapon of choice for the Irish they made it a n point game theyve used the threepoint line very well here to start this second half and I can just go back to the first half one thing I do know and remember is you saying they wouldnt hit 11 threes here in Charlesville and theres a strong possibility that they may we still got a lot of time left Cory well see they dont get a three there Here Comes Notre Dame mes with the basketball for the Fighting Irish TR to work on roie who cut him off and now he glances over to Micah Shrewsberry the first year head coach to set up the off offense Burton Miner got a Applause Music Applause Music piece Ro watched by Burton Applause Miner two to shoot goes to the other side and lays it in great job by Jordan Miner recognizing where he was on the floor under the basket able to finish on the opposite side and stop the momentum of the Irish young man from Kingston Massachusetts makes it an 11o Virginia Applause lead Applause five to shoot Davis in trouble and he throws it away great defense by Ryan Dunn I was talking about Reese bman being a lock down perimeter Defender Ryan Dunn the second game of our NBA double header Damen Lillard returns to Portland for the first time as the Bucks take on the Trailblazers and Im hoping Cory that at least before the game its all positive from the fans in Portland it absolutely has to be when you consider what hes done in the city of Portland the sixth overall pick rookie of the year seven time Allstar and seven time all NBA performer NBA top 75 all time did all of that in a Portland uniform Im sure there will be a great response for him on his first time back will the coaching Change in Milwaukee with Doc Rivers pay the dividends theyre hoping it will this year uh not without something done at the trade de line I dont think its really a coaching concern in my opinion I love Doc Rivers I think it has more to do with Personnel for the Milwaukee Bucks well theyve got another week to make those trades Notre Dame with the basketball theyve been playing well here in the second half down 11 Shrewsberry checked out where the defender was and fired it away hes got 14 points Im going to go as far as to say that Shrewsberry may be an elite shooter especially will be by the time hes finished in South Bend well if you look you look a little deeper hes only 33 on the year Cory but the last six games coming into this one 45 but 33 as a freshman is completely different than being a 33 shooter freshman dont shoot the basketball Well normally coming into college basketball well the more attention Groves gets the easier its going to be for mcne absolutely and you see Isaac mcney who has been a little lost in the shuffle based upon the shooting performance of Gro but thats the third threepoint field goal for mcney as well shooting the basketball extremely well here tonight the Wahoos are now 11 of 18 from three Shrewsberry does he have the Applause answer n pulls it out heres kesn back to Burton puts it on the deck driving on Harris block the shot out of bounds Notre Dame will keep it thats a big block by Dante Harris youre talking about two Dominion of guards going at it but Harris showing off his bounce well this is fifth game back off of an ankle injury that cost him 10 games and what a big piece he has been for Tony Music Applause Bennett 10 on the shot clock and an offensive foul against Notre Dame in a legal screen on ke J and now the 11th turnover for Notre Dame in this game that has truly been a struggle for them throughout this game Virginia scoring 10 points off those first 10 turnovers seeing if they can cash in on this one as well Kane Murray off the bench for Virginia as is the Freshman big Blake Buchanan heres Harris the Georgetown transfer cant get that one to Applause go ji gets rid of it goes to set the Applause screen kesn driving Baseline on Murray still with the bounce Rises up and doesnt get the roll Buchanan kept it alive but kesn has it for Notre Applause Dame back to Braden Shrewsberry missed the Lefty saved by McNeely Virginia basketball up 11 Harris what a crossover panan though cant finish off on the pick and pop and just on that possession alone Blake panon would have been much better served just to shoot his regular shot often times guys get caught up in shooting push shots and Flo oh Murray the reception Im not sure Ive seen that from T Murray yet and Ryan Dunn has become infectuous we saw Dante Harris with a big block now T bur coming up with Applause one mcney F Canon and his pass knocked Away by Roper its another Notre Dame takeaway Fighting Irish have missed their last five at this Applause end Im trying to work on Groves give it to Shrewsberry Imes for three big shot for Notre Dame how about these freshman from the Irish we talked in our open about the fact that Michael Shrewsberry is playing a lot of freshman they did not go the transfer portal route and try to bring in an older team theyre going to go the traditional route and playing a lot of freshman and these guys are growing up right in front of our eyes both these teams making the threepoint shot look very easy tonight the Irish now n of 16 Harris to the left hand gets the roll time out Applause Virginia back at the University of Virginia and there are things in college basketball youre not supposed to do Cory heres one of them Mar buron was able to get away with one even though hes a freshman hes crafty you see the left arm go around and grab Dante Harris pulling him into him to get the foul on that possession and Burton being very crappy as a young player however it did not go unnoticed by the intelligent crowd here at jpj they made sure to allow the officials to hear their displeasure here in Whoville says the former Cavalier pride of wesboro Virginia hey throw up the and again that you know know when you talk wayneb thats part of the reason why Im so partial to officials I had to you after my high school games on Friday nights I had to go referee games Saturday mornings at the wbor YMCA my God John Spears used to make sure I got up in the morning to come do that thats the way we earned our memberships to the Y and thats one of the reasons why Ive always been so partial to official kesn unable to beat the buzzer the next two games for for the Irish are on acc Network theyll play Pittsburgh Saturday at 6 Eastern then next Wednesday theyre at Cameron Indoor taking on number seven Duke in the second game of a double header at 900 eastern time I will be at that second game myself my God WD AKs AKA West Durham and also the Hall of Famer Jim beheim will be in The Crows Nest at Cameron Indoor Stadium maybe might as well be on the roof calling that Applause game heres grov with his first threepoint attempt of the second half after making five out of six in the first Miner couldnt find a teammate so he tried to score couldnt do it Notre Dame the last to touch it was apparently off the hand of kesn so Virginia will keep with 20 on the shot clock but Jordan Miner has been a Difference Maker for Virginia just the physicality that he brings to the lineup Tony Bennett told us often times we dont even have to trap on the post when weve got Miner down there guarding because of his strength and his experience ience Murray no theres Miner on the offensive glass Harris Quick Pass Murray works the Baseline goes to the left hand to lay it in the third year from Auckland New Zealand gives Virginia 12point lead once again and hes been another guy thats really started to give Virginia great production Off the Bench Tony benett told us earlier today theyve had a number of guys stepping up at different times and each one of them will have somewhat of their own game that they help the team win Marcus Burton answers with a midrange shot give him 10 Applause points Murray Rises up four quick points but you can see just how much more confident tame Murray is in the Virginia rotation right now and knowing that youre going to get consistent minut and whats expected of you often helps with your production Zona against the Trap gave it up 13th Notre Dame Applause turnover Harris given Space by Burton instead he passes to beakman Groves got it new career high for May threes in a game for Jake R Virginia getting bench points a lot of production from a number of guys tame Murray getting involved in the action backto back buckets however its been the Jake Gro show here in charville his sixth May threepointer good Bloodlines for both of our leading scores tonight we talk a lot about the fact that br shuberry course is the son of head coach Micah Shrewsberry who was a really good division three point guard at Handover College back in the 90s but uh Jake Groves mom Tara was an NAA AllAmerican at Whitworth University his mom scored over 2000 career points so Mom was a bucket so shes really not impr impressed at all about what hes doing right now because she can simply have done all that before youre probably right Dad Randy also played college ball but uh terrific bloodlines on both sides ball coming our way UVA on a little bit of a run nine to2 over the last three plus minutes to get the lead back to 15 been a clean game throughout weve barely had any free throws you see only two fouls committed in the second half by Virginia one for Notre Dame weve only had four foul shots taken tonight well neither of these teams foul much thats part of their why theyre so impressive defensively is cuz they dont put the other opponents on the line and a great play by Burton once again right there just being able to win the oneonone matchup against the accs best on ball Applause Defender one more three and Virginia will have its season High had I said that t muray would have made that shot by the way I doubt that you jinx more things than anybody oh no not me not me my friend had I called that number out matter of fact Im going to say it now one more three and Virginia surpass is their season High 13 will be their season high do I need to remind you the last time we did a game a guy suffered an ankle injury moments after you were talking him up how healthy he was and how durable he was moments later no you dont need to remind me of that I dont remember that any such thing uhhuh watch Virginia makes the next three though they go inside to Groves that time the Nowitzki didnt work out so well out of bounds padris coming in to correct that the officials doing a great job getting together Virginia will maintain Ain the basketball on this possession some 9000 officials in the stands as well but heres my question now did that shot or is that a a different possession cuz did that shot hit the rim it was an air ball I thought so maybe theyre assuming that oh there you go Groves beat the buzzer but didnt hit the iron so theres your shot clock violation 621 remaining eighth turnover forced by that mans defense you know these two teams have given up the fewest points per game of any in the ACC but to me that doesnt necessarily mean theyre the two best defensive teams right Cory well their offense dictates a lot of their scoring pace so their teams when you play against Notre Dame when you play against Virginia youre going to score less points because you dont have as many possessions I dont think that either of these teams are the top of the ACC although Virginia is going going to be close to the top each and every year Booth was fouled on the shot hell head to the line for a chance for a threepoint play so what would you put Carolina in there would you put Florida State in there where would you go to say the top two defensive teams in the ACC right now I would say in January it would be North Carolina I believe they have been the best defensive team in January now when you lead up to January Im not sure they would have that distinction but I can tell you right now after the performance defensively I saw the Duke was put on at in blackburg on Monday night against Virginia Tech they could very well be one of those teams also and then you got to throw Clemson into the mix Brad brownells group is always going to be able to defend and theyve got some big time pieces doing it now McNeely working on Imes throws to the corner tan Murray puts it on the deck Fighting Irish with it down by 11 520 to go and give the Irish a lot of credit they have not gone away in this game they continue to put pressure on Virginia turnovers have hurt them however when theyve gotten looks at the basket theyve taken advantage of it Burton trying to work on beakman Shrewsberry arounded out gra Groves goes for the onehanded rebound and a whistle against Booth I tell you what though we had a good look on that one the angle where were sitting Shrewsberry three looked really good and he was confident he was on his way back down the floor because he felt like that one was going down and the way the game is gone tonight for that young man and for really his teammates and the opponent you got to think most everythings going in they have been shooting the lights out here tonight Groves gets a nice round of applause as he takes a seat Jordan Miner back in its been a quiet night offensively for Ryan Dunn hes been scoring the basketball so well the last couple of games hes only attempted one shot still scoreless for UVA and that one shot was an attempted tip in so really shouldnt have been a shot that was going after a rebound when you think about Ryan Dunn has been shooting 75 over his last four games yeah 21 for 28 the last four games coming Applause in Daviss pass Tak it away another steal by beatman and Burton commits the foul but if you watch Virginia basketball often is which you and I both do you understand that at every moment when things are kind of in a Crux this fre Speakman coming up with a steal a defensive play to help his team to build a momentum back especially here on this home floor and he does it once again as you see a little momentum favoring the side of the fighting Iris Reese beakman comes up with the steel and knocks down the first free Applause throw Tay Davis will take a seat in between free throws for reys beakman he gets a pair now 16 points three steals as well so he turned another Notre Dame turnover into two more points the lead is back to 13 heres steeld number four and Beakmans going to pull it out were under four minutes now you remember when we were talking about that defensive play of the Year conversation McNeely know how about codefensive players of the year do you like that I I absolutely do like that I think its possible but when you think about the fact that Virginia has two guys who should absolutely be first team all defensive team but this is still not one of the best Virginia defenses that we seen there are areas where they can absolutely continue to grow on that end of the floor Burton this time gets around beakman switches hands and Banks it in yeah crafty play by Burton to be able to use on the inside hand to avoid the shot blocking ability of ree Music beakman so if not beakman are done as conference Defensive Player of the Year who would you go with uh you got to look at Clemson I think PJ Hall could absolutely be in the mix Patman doing it on both ends tonight 19 points in counting but Doug this is the guy that hes got to be for Virginia to be successful and not as much here in this building but when they go on the road theyre going to have to have this type of performance from Reese beakman not to where hes only doing the job defensively but also being aggressive on the offensive end he is now 18 points shy of 1000 for his terrific Virginia Career B knocked away from behind dun poked it away will be Notre Dame basketball when we come back we talked about the matchup between these two point guards and its been a very good one thus far Burton attacking the basket able to finish with the left but ree beakman in the corner three pocket is good fun point guard matchup to watch here tonight the Freshman Burton the fourthe beakman both have played extremely well they absolutely have played extremely well Burton who is used to doing a lot High usage straight for him as a freshman at Notre Dame and in my opinion and only my opinion ree beakman can do more of this on a regular basis hes great at everything that he does but I can see more I know ree very well spent time with him in the Summers working with I know what hes capable of and I think he can have more games like this where he still gets his six assists but he has 20 points to go along with it aant pass kesn has to throw it up and thats another shot clock VI ation forced thats three in this game three and 16 on the season and its hard to be able to beat Virginia when youve got 16 turnovers so you look at what noted aame has done I mean they shot the basketball extremely well but the turnovers have hampered them the entire game and again Virginia is just a better team than it was a month ago when it got whipped up in South Bend with the additions into the rotation of M and weve seen Taye Murray again tonight and again Dante Harris but but look at the last possession thats not a late shot clock play Reese beakman is now being extremely aggressive on the offensive end of the floor and taking the first good shot that he can get and thats the Reese beakman that can help Virginia get to that next level moving forward his career high is 23 against Northeastern hes at 21 now again with the shot clock being part of the equation weve got a whistle and a foul you look at this action look at the shot clock ducky fresh theres 20 seconds on the shot clock when re mman catches this basketball he gets in his bag right to the midrange to pull up shoots it confidently thats not waiting for a great shot to appear thats your best player taking a good shot early enough to give yourself a chance to be successful and not that that shot illustrates it keep in mind he has shown his cruy scores hes got the clutch Gene as well oh yeah hes got multiple gamewinners throughout his career one is a freshman in the ACC tournament another in Cameron Applause indor dun has it knocked away Fighting Irish still fighting out of bounds and Virginia will keep 17 to shoot well well each of the Notre Dame coaches we spoke to today michah Shrewsbury the head coach the associate head coach Kyle getter Ryan Owens Mike Fairley they went on and on about how much they like the team and that theyre still fighting theyre still together despite the record and absolutely you have to you look at the roster you see how many freshman Michael Shrewsberry is playing that is a conscious decision to be able to say hey guys were going to do that with this with young players were not going to go into the portal and try to get guys who we may have for one or two years were going to try to do this with guys that we can have for four years that help us build the foundation of our Applause program beatman dumps it off Miner was fouled and you know I havent said this this year so Im going to say it now Cory if free throws even one free throw is made here he should get an assist on this yeah I I know you have said that already this year not this year not this year yes you have I I remember that conversation you have said this year because I simply said I would had a whole lot more assistant my career if if that were the case no matter what comes out of my mouth it somehow turns to you they arent you talking to me and about me no no no to you but not about you I want beakman to have just gotten another assist because Miner made a free throw based on the beautiful pass made by beakman and I disagree wholeheartly because again now if you make both free throws maybe but not making one free throw no not making one free throw so if you make a pass and somebody makes a three instead of a two should you get an assist and a half no but you actually get an assist where when someone you pass the ball and they get a two right not a one but why do you differentiate a score is a score a point scored is a point scored for your team because because one is only half of a bucket but three is more than two and you give the same assist another turnover a great job by IMS getting back defensively a little too much too late well Burton was fouled by Dunn and that was not what Virginia was looking for Burton will shoot three free throws the effort has been there for noted D throughout this game it hasnt been about effort it hasnt been about their energy Tony Bennett not happy with that foul but its simply been about the turnover and thats another thing that Virginia specializes in this building not the D now up to 18 turnovers and its extremely difficult for you to win a basketball game especially on the road when you turn it over 18 times and someone elses building yeah the season high for Coach shrewsburys team is 19 Burton calmly hits a pair now hes at his season average 16 points for the 511 166 lb freshman from Mishawaka just outside of Southbend Indiana I love Marcus Burton 511 is very generous however that is program height I got no hate for it Im fine with that yeah because you are listed the program height also of course you say youre 6 feet right depends not even close strong performance by the whoos in front of the Virginia fi pushing the nations longest home winning streak up to 22 games and re dont take that shot and see thats the thing again I want him to shoot more but Ill take that one thats a percentage killer right there he didnt want another turn over he wouldnt have got
