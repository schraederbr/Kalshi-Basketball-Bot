ACC Network crew Roxy bernon with you at hos Pavilion were underway Cal in the home whites Cornell in the black and this promises to be one of the more entertaining games here in Berkeley this season the way Cornell plays and the way Cal can score this is going to be a fun night of offensive basketball youre going to see the teams that play fast and those kind of shots can fall Cornell is going to have to match because uh you know Ks playing with a little chip on their shoulder coming off that tough Stanford loss Joshua Ola Joseph with an early three to get it going for Cal the Bears 37 outside the arc and a back door pass looking for now here Williams inside well Roxy I didnt see much there I dont know about you but somehow the pass was able to get through some hands and some Defenders and thats the danger of playing against Cornell you must keep your head on a swivel you must be able to turn and find the ball and your man Cornell team that won 22 games finished tied for second the ivy last year on blackshire Jr feeds a knifing Reus Petrus through the Applause lane here is naer Williams a three and were tied at five and theres a threepoint shooting for Cornell oh you cant relax thats a team Roxy this is a team that just came off a 19 make threepoint outing and thats just again the phenomenal stat they played Sunday at Army and they beat Army 10384 when Ben told you they made 19 threes they went 19 of 35 outside the AR they shot 56 for that game as a steal by Guy Raglin Jr for Cornell and in that game against Army Cornell had 27 assists yeah thats getting it done Roxy I mean think about that a lot of touches a lot of ball movement and then obviously scoring not an assist unless you finish okay okari drop step to the back and Cornell with their first lead well thats a characteristic of a Princeton type offense uh when you can get the ball inside the post guys have a lot of freedom but theyve got excellent footwork so you got to stay on your feet you must stay grounded when youre defending they keep the ball moving it doesnt stick when you play against this Cornell team yeah 21 assists say no more a game Cal coming off that tough loss here to Stanford on Saturday 8981 Stanford blocked 133 shots in that game the offensive rebound elevating over everybody and mon Soko as its stripped out of bounds will stay at this end with Cal yeah you know look at the footwork inside to So you youre youre trying to get up but you got to really stay grounded on the lift fake when it your offensive player gives you that fake you must stay grounded John Jake his first season as the head coach at Cornell he played for the big red was on their sweet 16 team back in 2010 they taken over for Brian Earl whos been the head coach at Cornell the last eight years he left to take the William and marry job as M Soko and one great finish by the big fella you see his strength his agility but you know for a big guy to be able to have hands and finish lets look at the pass look at the zip pass by blackshire through some defenders in the finish by Ma Soko thats a great sign there is Mark Matson beginning year two as C off to a three start after the 10 win Improvement last year from the year before in Mark Foxs final season is mon Soko 71 from the line and Cal reclaims the Applause Music lead naer Williams a constant ball movement and movement from the Cornell offensive Applause players Jake Fegan gets inside and a three launched from the wing by the Clovis California Native AK oari and theres a number of Cornell California ties re is Petrus and the rebound grabbed by Guy Ragland who is not part of that California contingent for Cornell hes from Connecticut Watch how many times the ball goes into the high post the outo we call it entries and a quick trigger on a three from guy Raglin Jr and the rebound grabbed by Cal you can see both teams dont mind getting it up and down the floor they CL Court pressed by Cornell kind of force the tempo against calus petritis attacks and the L to Mar Soko wasnt expecting it necessarily now Petri is the drop off and its lost out of bounds by sasoko and a turnover committed by Cal well I see an effort Roxy on behalf of Cal to get that ball moving they had a tough you know low assist outing Mark mat they had only five assists on Saturday zero at the half mark Manson saying look Ive been in every level high school college and pro and Ive never seen that but you know he took the own and said I got to get my team to do better we dont have unselfish guys but theyre taking you know some some Rush shots oneonone shots we need more touches so theres an emphasis now and a foul off the ball as Andre St yakovich take that as Mark mats would say its a start uh but theyd like to improve on that right now couple of subs for Mark Matson Lee Dort checks in and also the appearance of Jeremiah Wilkinson whos already been an ACC rookie of the week this season The Freshman from Powder Springs Georgia Jacob beckles for Applause Cornell five to shoot back door broken up last Touch by Nazir Williams and it goes out of bounds to Cal the turnover forced by Rus petrius well that was a great uh defensive maneuver because again you your heads on a swivel you see the ball but you dont lose track of your man his man back cuts and he switched and get his denial hand in the way was able to kind of lead that turnover and force that turnover to go off the Cornell players excellent job defensively on the injury front for Cal DJ Campbell not available tonight for Mark Madson day today went through shoot around today but still is not feeling 100 And dayto day for DJ Campbell who did play three minutes against Stanford on Saturday as Jeremiah Wilkinson long on the three and the rebound grabbed by DJ Nicks for Cornell but Javon blackshire again playing in his third straight game after missing a handful of games and a long rebound to Lee Dort who leads Ken rebounding on the season and BJ omot still out with the wrist injury for Cal yeah one thing that H has rocks is depth one thing Cornell has now is the basketball after a turnover kick out and the Bay Area kid Ryan kosin who went to Beller down on the South Bay the Los alos ills Nat and he missed a three and here comes Jeremiah Wilkinson for Cal so hes one of those California connections kosin from Los alos Hills and thats an offensive foul and thats the second on Andre St yakovich not even six minutes into the game yeah thats you know its unfortunate because hes been their team leader in terms of uh scoring and just uh you know his presence but you know look again uh Roxy I think Cals trying to make a concerted effort to get ball movement and theyve done that but theyve also turned it over so you you got to be careful uh you know try to hold your turnovers down but this is a tough team to guard and theyre going to have their hands pulled defensively to guard the big redit Cornell kashin whos got the ball at the top he has about 15 family and friends that made the Trek across the bay from the peninsulas clearing his way to the basket and dropped in by AK okari yeah I like the no call Roxy veteran officials said play on you know were not going to call a flop but were not going to give you the the foul either so great move by Cornell theyre putting a lot of pressure on Cal theyre doubling almost every time down the floor just to make Cal work a little harder take a little time off the shot clock and then not have as much time to have to defend count want them to go late on the blockon black shirt Cs been scoreless for about 3 and 12 minutes now as Jeremiah Wilkinson on the pullup and the rebound batted around and its Ryan kashin who lost it and read is petritis cant convert and its out of bounds to Cornell as petritis who leads K and steals another nice defensive play well watch the drive here you can see that betrus actually still moving officials actually just let him play on but if thats a foul its probably on the defensive player for sliding and not having his feet set but Cornell really a challenge Roxy we talked about this they just are tough to defend nonstop movement spin move and the reverse layup in AK Cari comes up empty and Joshua Ola Joseph pushes for Music Applause count and the ball stripped and the quick hands from Cornell as Joshua Ola Joseph lost it going up Jacob beckles and a corner three is way off from DJ Nicks well theyre getting the shots Roxy I mean thats a good defensive play and then a wide open shot in transition little uncharacteristic to miss that Jeremiah Wilkinson driving to the bucket rebound Ryan kosin Here Comes Cornel leaking out Cooper Nord for the big red well Mark Manson will call Quick timeout here hes not happy with his team in terms of transition you know you miss a shot its okay but its theyre up three as Cornell makes over 11 threes per game ninth most in the country they shoot a ton of Threes And they score almost 85 points a game no they havent even gotten going from free so thats fortunate for Cal youre in this game only down a possession they just have to keep them off their Mark and make them finish at The Rim Joshua Ola Joseph his second three hes been on fire his last two games Roxy hes knocked down shots hes able to played from three tied at 11 AK o Ki and he hits a three for Cornell well hes another interesting story a guy that started out his career as a former walk on and manager and look what hes doing for his team making the pressus petritis for nazer Williams yeah I think Mark Mark Matson not happy with his team and giving up some uncontested you his team has done a pretty good job all year of contesting but when they dont contest Roxy they have gotten burned so theyve spent a lot of their time as you and I know at practice in contesting and closing out and he was not happy with the defense in the Stanford game with a cardinal shot 53 made 113s Nazir Williams to the basket the follow and one for Ryan Kosen for Cornell and again Roxy transition and you talk about Mark Matson hes not happy now were going to break but thats now theyve get ball movement hand backs they get everything uh screens on the ball but what they want you to do is get in a position to help and watch now he freeze it here youve got youve got Ola Joseph thats really sinking in hes trying to help because he want a little bit of room but what they you see now is the screen and though and the screen takes place and watch a wide open play here it is now were going and now it comes through theres the screen now you can see again Ola Joseph cant get through that screen thats just a great job its almost screening two guys and getting the flare screen for a wide open shot and Mark Manson now called a timeout to to really try to address this but theres so many ways that Cornell can hurt you and Mark Manson shared that with us today rocks at at uh at shoot around he said look they did so many different weapons free throw rattles out for Ryan Kos and who prepped at bman down in San Jose twotime First Team all wcal and kinu missed all of last or a couple of years ago with a knee injury played just 11 games last year but a big night for him coming back to the Bay area as Javon blackshire Jr missing a three goes to chase it down and he is called for stepping out of bounds and it goes right back to Cornell well Mark Manson trying you applauding his guys just trying to applaud their effort and hustle but you know Cornells making it tough Roxy theyre double teaming the ball in the back court and then theyre coming back with a little soft pressure back to man and theyre not allowing Cal much time to to attack in the offense half court offense Applause all the way to the basket and the dunk for Ryan Kosen yeah youre trying to pick your poison Roxy and thats again what coach Mark Matson said do you give up the three or do you challenge up hard and make him dry Cs been it better this year when theyve made people drive and then had some guys that can block at The Applause Rim heres Christian Tucker trying to turn the corner jovon blackshire Jr rattles out out of three and the rebound Nazir Williams Here Comes Cornell transition threepointer good look and Jake Fegan comes up empty now didnt have his feet set was still moving a little bit it was so wide open think kind of surprised him how wide open he was down low heres M Applause Soko Josh Ola Joseph three yeah hes been a real Plus for the Bears when theyve been down hes given them a lift Roxy thats twice in a row hes hit big threes hes got 11 of Cal 16 but an answer from Cornell how about the three the dagger nazer Williams just you know ice water in his veins 10 for nazer Williams the senior now Joshua ol Joseph missing the three and the rebound grabbed by Adam Hinton Southern California kid who went to Harvard Westlake the same high school that produced the head coach John Jake yeah know great High School down there I mean theres been so many good players down through the years but how about Cornell you dont think about them as being a Skyhigh team but this is skying high Roxy thats a dunk and the and parting of the Red Sea down there uh but you know again you you talk about what you want to do if youre playing against Cornell youve got to make a concerted effort a to get back in transition it makes a little put the pressure on you offensively when you know teams are going to run against you but you got to get back you get your defense set and then you play defense From the Inside Out Andre St yakovich checks back in with his two fouls for cow yeah they need him back on the floor hesitation and the strong move by Guy Raglin Jr thats Cornell by nine well thats a big strong move maybe you think maybe an offensive foul by clearing away but referees letting him play a little bit today I like it that should favor K by the way in the physical game right now Cornell with the upper hand and the ball knocked away in a steal by AK oari and he steps to the basket on the pass and a foul committed by Cal and its on Spencer Mahoney well one thing you can accept Roxy when youre playing and youre coaching and youre playing is is getting back on defense through a missed shot what you dont want to do is give up transition baskets due to turnovers and Cal uncharacteristically now turning it over you dont see black turning over turn and and Javon blackshire is just is sure with the balls anybody on this Cal Bear Team hes just not like him to turn it over and they turn it over a total of seven times against Stanford on Saturday yeah no theyre a very ball secure team and black are again very ball secure but hes already got some turnovers and the push shot nazer Williams already with 12 and its a double figure lead for Cornell Cs going to have to get a lift certainly offensively but theyve got to solve this this uh Cornell team thats been very Scrappy and the interception by AK Ki but Cal got it right back Christian Tucker attacks Spencer money will get to the line that was an un thats a pretty good break for Cal it was Cornell that made the steel and was going the other direction and then they threw it up the grabs you know the one place you dont want to throw it down the floor and transition is the middle thats where everybodys running you want to try to Fan it up the sidelines kind of like hockey Roxy I know you I know you know that get to get to the outside get to the outside and soccer same thing dont throw it up the middle everybodys going back down the middle of the floor bet Mahoneys been good he hes been a real Plus for scal as well transfer from Washington State Rox hes had a good run for the Bears seen more playing time recently now one for four at the line this year the native of Brooklyn hes played now in each of the last six games for Mark Matson you can see the confidence growing in Spencer Mah well his teammates confidence in him as well thats important you can see Cornells always probing theyre just trying to read you and see where youre going to soften up a little bit and try to attack Music you tack in the Baseline and going inside is Jake Fegan for Cornell well thats a smart move he got you know they play him they close out really short and they get in his drill and he drives thats what you have to do and thats just what he did in the style that they play with John Jake whos just 36 first year as a head coach as we told you played in that sweet 16 team for Cornell back in 2010 played professionally over in Israel after his playing days at Cornell and Guy Raglin Jr missing a three Andre sakovich the rebound had it knocked away last Touch by St yakovich we staying at this end and a Cornell Ball but Jakes 12 years is an assistant to Cornell also wor for Kyle Smith at Columbia now good good background but its Cornell right now you can see his style paying off for the big red this game was tied at 11 since Cornell is outscored Cal 187 as Cornell shooting 59 from the field Cal just 35 yeah the stat Roxy again you look look at it the Cals gotten some assists on the board but but theyve got to go out there theyve got to play one andone defense uh Challenge and just try to use their rebounding you know Cs dominated teams at times on the board theyve got to continue to do that against Cornell Cornell playing a little bit of a matchup Zone here theyre kind of playing the guy in their area you can see him looking for a guy theyre dropping Andreas yakovich and he forces a pass inside Mi Soko tied up and the arrow belongs to Cornell yeah thats not just good defense Roxy that is a matchup Zone everybodys collapsing to the ball you can see three on the ball they drop from block to block thats good coverage uh theyre making it tough on Cal the defense the zone defense effective and thats very typical of of a type of uh Princeton defense Through The Years IV League matchup Zone 10 Cal turnover here in the first half yeah well theyre solving the assists but theyre not solving the turnover so theyve got to just be a little more aggressive with the ball maybe in trying to get a lot of assists maybe they got to be more aggressive with the ball third alltime meeting between these two schools and a three the stroke from Cooper n Roxy this happened against Stanford you you see Cornell now getting their confidence and if you get your confidence early its hard to turn it off and hard to knock a team off you know off that block a little bit once you get they get going Jeremiah Wilkinson rattles out of three Spencer Mahoney in the offensive glass and then he had it knocked away 11 Cal turnover uncharacteristic this is something that Cals going to have to Applause correct and its steel Javon bler out to the races thats a big basket by blacker C was really in a punk and he was able to get that that they were down 14 Roxy till he scored that Deuce stepping out for a three Cooper Nord the miss m Soko the Applause rebound a Soko lost his mouthpiece not sure how sanitary that was here is Soko inside and he fouled and one Soko High degree of difficulty on that one well Roxy look look here whats going on the pass goes into Moko and he just does a great job number one of presenting himself really presents himself for the Post entry and two he gets fouled and he finishes it on the other end you can see here I mean uh you know look look inside here look at the Steel by blackshire hes in the passing Lane hes been a pest this year for teams he and petrius youre playing against those two guys you better not televise your pass second foul and Raglin Jr in the second and one for Marty sissoko already in this first half K free throw and ner Williams the rebound yeah Kels got the advantage inside theyve got to go there I think youre going to see them trying to get some more postups as the apps coming to a Music close a here Williams and a reach in foul and its on Jeremiah Wilkinson of Cal thats good good first foul good call and Mark Madson knows it the defense was late getting in the paint no help and he had he had to stop and get a little physical but you see what Cornells trying to do theyre trying to isolate theyre trying to spread you out and see if they can get you some Some Cuts oh last Touch by Jeremiah Wilkinson to mention this is a third alltime meeting these two teams last met December of 1992 that was Jason kids freshman year he did not play in that game he was injured and Cornell ran that Cal team off the floor at the meal lands in New Jersey Cornell beat Cal 7454 lemon Murray scored half of Cals points in that game he had 27 of the 54 back in your era Rex was back door love too high didnt know that was possible to get it too high for Joshua Ola Joseph yeah he was open but that team also Jason kid didnt play that night Murray went for 27 they had Monty Buckley on that team Jared Hass was a freshman Roxy they were loaded AJ Roberts they were loaded and they thats how good that Cornell team was how about that Al griggsby Jeremiah Wilkinson had a clean look Joshua Ola Joseph the offensive rebound on the reload Jon blackshire then chases it down but saves it right right to Cornell Cooper Nord has time to set the feet Fox you can see again the confidence growing in Cornell when they get open shots if you want to get open shots the best way you can do so is in transition defense is not set thats why his coach J Jakes is allowing his team to get some shots up in transition before kale can get set second three for Nord five threes for Cornell Joshua Ola Joseph from the top three and a season high already 14 I think about where Cal would be without him to tonight Roxy Andre St yakovich has not scored but couple of early fouls Cooper Nord again and the rebound tip free and Nord tracks it down Jake Fegan and their offensive rebound and loose inside and its still Cornell with possession and a three short another offensive rebound long three Nazir Williams for Cornell Mark Manson is beside himself on the bench Roxy he does not like the offensive rebounds hes putting his best rebounder back in the game Lee Dort Williams with 15 four cracks at it for Cornell that time and its steel for the big red and then Soko Dives trying to get the loose ball and the tie up but its a cow ball with 246 seven left in the half but Cornell is doing exactly what they want to do Roxy its been a game I mean look at the action here the offensive rebounds have been tough Cal struggling to stay with the big red from Cornell but Cornell having their way right now yeah Roxy youre seeing Cornell again doing what they do they are getting the an opportunity to attack the basket by the three theyre attacking with the back Cuts you know theyre going underneath and theyre just finding guys behind screens flare screens uh but Cals not doing themselves any favors Roxy theyve got 13 turnovers already theyre only averaging 13 per a game re is petritis missing inside and the rebound tipped and Cal keeps it alive with Jeremiah Wilkinson Cornell has attempted nine more shots from the floor Cal below 40 shooting Cornell at 50 Wilkinson spinning the dish Reus petritis for the bucket thats a good look Cornell back in their Zone Kale did a much better job of finding openings and seams in the Zone by the penetration and Pitch this is where Cals got to get it done and nazer Williams already with 15 and another three AK oari with 10 points his second three we talked about feeling confident Roxy and its hard to get that confidence knock it back Cornells already feeling pretty good about themselves theyve matched their largest lead seven threes for the big Music red Jeremiah Wilkinson and a good box out but last Touch by Cornell but theyre saying it was off Cal that was a good block out by Cornell but Roxy Kels you know found some ability to score theyve had some success on the Block but you know Cornells done a pretty good job defensively too theyve made it tough for the Bears theyve been pesky and again 13 turnovers you cant expect to be in the game with 13 turnovers at the half and were not even there yet first appearance for the sophomore Devin Curtis 611 lanky Curtis and the step back and it rattles in for AK o ke the former manager hes just getting it done what a great story he is and it rattles out but Cal will get to the line and we were talking to John Jake about okari and yes technically he was brought in as a manager but they were recruiting him and he had some light recruitment from some places but he really wanted to go to Cornell and now Brian Earl was the head coach of the time and John Jake was an assistant for Earl and they saw him play now theyd be lying to you if they saw this coming from Oar but they got him there and they started practicing a bit with them when he was a manager practice player and then they realized this kid could play he was no long no longer a manager no they they saw something but you know it just shows you Roxy the progression of some players it takes time and and with Time Players improve but his contributions have been unbelievable uh speaking of contributions Ola Joseph I mean think about what hes done hes scored over half of Cals points uh hes hes singlehandedly keeping them in this Applause game and it rolls in for Ryan kosin and he has six well CH Cornell Roxy theyve been scoring almost at every point on this floor theyre scoring inside out corners elbows uh at The Rim threepoint shots theyre just a really tough Guard team to defend thats why theyre theyre you know theyre playing at this a high offensive rate 21 assist Nation leading total Christian Tucker thought about it Wilkinson on the drive the double clutch and the rebound Here Comes Cornell AK K Oar lays it in again Roxy transition a missed shot shouldnt result in a layup at the other end you know Cs trying to crash you off offensive glass and I get it cuz theres theyve got some Advantage there but if youre Cal now youre got to play for the last shot and hope you can regroup at halftime uh they desperately needed basket to close the half and a foul as Cornell had a couple to take and its Jake Fegan out top yeah thats clever move I mean youre not going to take those fouls with you theyre going to see if they can get TA down to a very clock and not give them a good look they would love to hold this lead into the halftime not get C get back on the board Mark mson racing Javon blackshire back in there well theyll put stovic back in for the offensive power but they surely dont want him to pick up a third foul either so hes got to be careful about collecting an offensive foul on a drive or an offensive rebound 78 to go until halftime Applause heres black shirt gets into the key hangs and it wouldnt go it popped out and the rebound grabbed by Jake beegan for Cornell and the big red leading Cal by 18 at the half Roxy Im Im surpris not so much that Cornells got a lead they were up 18 at Missouri last Tuesday night before Dennis Gates and the Missouri Tigers came back to beat C in a tight ball game a great game and then Missouri went on to knock off number one Kansas in Columbia on so they lost a good Missouri team but you know Cs got to get back on the board Chip Away doesnt have to happen all at once its got to be methodical Roxy but theyve got to get back into this Applause game where is the offense going to come from Joshua Ola Joseph spinning and he is denied the block AK oari four on the shot clock for Cal well thats where theyve had the offense in the first half you know you you you want to get the ball in ol Josephs hands hes been a real Plus for this team but if youre Cal you got to have stovich step up black here guys that have done it you know all year long theyve got to now step up and get their team on the board black shirt needs to go doesnt realize it on the shot clock and then too late another turnover thats 14 now for Cal well again the shot clock was so low oh youve got to yell that out the teams got to communicate that and I and know black here again a pretty heavy player lost track of the shot clock now they find themselves back on defense trying to get in the grind of guarding Cornell and a three on the way Cooper Nord the Miss and a foul going for the rebound its on jovon blackshire Jr ofal yeah when youre down Roxy big numbers you know you dont get it back all at once you start on the defensive end you get some stops but you know Cals had some ability to get to the foul line if they have to get to the line Cornells only been there once and see if he can chip away in that regard heres a three and a foul on reita patrus three shots for Jake Fegan yeah late call by the officials on that flight petrius had his hand up looks like he came down and theres a little contact at the very end that was a good challenge but you can see the body and the referees caught that and now youve got Jake Fegan at the line whos been a pretty darn good player from there 74 for the second best shooter ever from neutri high school well thats what I told Jake and I talked about I said Jake youre the second best shooter there uh he said well whos the best I said well I was the best so we had a good laugh about it today at shoot around but know hes been neither you said John sh huh well John was pretty good shooter I I got to give John credit though Im still mad at him he didnt come to Cal I I dont give him the credit he had him on his visit had him he couldnt close the deal now then Duke came in late Chris Collins I always blame Chris Collins for his late pickup but you know new Tri has been a great school over the years theyve had great programs great not just athletically but academically rated maybe the number one Public School in the in the country so I was fortunate to go there uh and play my career there 21point lead for Cornell Andre St yakovich trying to get on track wave it off and the foul on the drive before the shot buty thats what theyre missing when sto yovic is on the floor hes not in foul trouble he gives them he puts constant pressure on the defense he can get to the rim at will and hes been very effective all year long first on Cooper Nord and thats one thing C has done as a team has get to the foul line as Cal this year has made the 26 most free throws per game in the country Andre sto yakovich and the rebound Cooper Nord for Cornell well if youre Cal now you got to get back in defense theyre going to attack you in transition now here Williams and the offensive rebound the easy put back AK oari yeah Ks just you know again Rocky theyre just a little behind the eight ball theyre trying to figure out where the points and where the shots are coming from Cornells been one of the most difficult teams Ive seen this year at figuring out how to guard they just really present problems for you five straight for Cornell to start the second half step back left open Jeremiah Wilkinson his first points of the night hes going to have to step up to he has carried Cal in a lot of games previously this year hes had 20 plus games a number of times AER Williams gets into the keyi and Williams wont go Joshua Ola Joseph the rebound left open Wilkinson back to back threes for Jeremiah Wilkinson huge effets for Jeremiah Music Wilkinson lets see if theres a carryover effect to the offensive end for defensive end I should say for Cal and gliding in nazer Williams Now cal cant change baskets exchange baskets Roxy theyve got to get stops and put some points on the board good guy out jovon blacker Jr UC see Ks got some Firepower at Roxy their issue and their challenge is on this end of the floor can you stop and slow down at least the Cornell big red AER Williams thats a two and here comes blackshire racing up the floor blackshire to the basket and its blocked and cleaned up by Andre sto yakovich great Hustle by Andre St yakovich first points for sto yakovich tonight and call cut it to 14 and the drive and the lay in Cooper Nord for Cornell timeout big red I like the timeout actually you say was that kill momentum but I think Cornell wants to talk about it but how about paint they got to solve that and theyve given 16 points off turnovers you have to solve that as well but the two guys in blackshire and Wilkinson have shot 44 from the three those guys have to step up now theyre going to get some shots they got to knock them down now back in the zone again Cornell in this matchup Joshua ol Joseph trying to go to work has it strip loose ball Jeremiah Wilkinson three to shoots to yakovich lets fly and the offensive rebound Monty Soko had it strip but Joshua Ola Joseph tracks it down another possession for Cal Andre St yakovich gets inside had a good look just couldnt convert last Touch by Ryan kosin and a CAL ball coming back 16point lead for Cornell it was 23 Cal trying to claw back Music in got to make things happen for you and your team you your your team need you to do that for out of the double team and a foul will get Joshua Ola Joseph to the line its on Ryan kosin of Cornell his second yeah theres a fine line Roxy between forcing things for you and your team but when you know you again you carried your team all year long youve been the leading scorer youre a guy that can pretty much get a shot off uh early in the clock at the end of the clock uh you got to be aggressive anday and so Andres got to go out there and do what hes done all year long dont change and get to the fou line and make some things happen for his team hes too good a too good a player to be uh held to two points at this juncture of the game R out for Joshua Ola Joseph and one more coming but I I I like the the motion now to get all Joseph who carried Cal in the first half by the way scoring over half their points I like the fact that he you know hes there and theyre going to him trying to get him on the Block and get some easy scores but heres where Ks got to really dig in they must get stops to get back in this game he missed both free throws setting up in the corner and a three Miss by DJ Nicks and C the rebound noon blackshire Jr the step back three second three for blackshire hes got eight in the Cornell lead from 23 down down to 13 and an Aon pass Ryan kosin threw it away those are tough passes and well defended by Cal I mean thats just great coverage youre staying glued your man youre playing with a foot behind youre not allowing them to get a full step on you to the basket but you know you look at Wilkinson and black Shire those arent fluke shots Roxy those two guys have hit 44 of their threes all year long and theyre you know theyre going to need their baskets to climb back in this Music game Jeremiah Wilkinson turns the corner the drive and finished by The Freshman thats a freshman Roxy hes done that for Cal and hes hes not shy about putting his team on his shoulders 16 to four run for Cal Ryan kosin backing his way Applause in and stepping on the sideline the turnover is AK oari gives it back over to cow but watch Wilkinson hes got the threepoint ability so you have to play him at the threepoint line but he is so darn quick that he just explodes by you and by the way he can finish hes not a big player but he hangs hes got great hang time and he doesnt mind playing through contact so hes going to have to step up black shirs back on the court those two guys have to stay aggressive they can get it to single digits this trip Joshua Ola Joseph lines up a three career high 9 19 now for Ola Joseph and Cal has cut it down to eight well you see the confidence in Cal now theyre starting to pick up full for pressure and the crowds getting into this game under the beest feeli at CR much different looking Cal team in the second half a three and the stroke Cooper Nord well I think he let the referee know that was three but I think the official already knew that was three just just letting them know that silences the Cal crowd for a moment and there is an issue over here on the sideline as our lead official Ron Gro working with Randy Richardson and Michael Greenstein tonight and I believe something spilled over on the sideline here yeah this is a you know you make your three and you wh beond three but youre letting the official know just know there it is look thats three official said I got you but you know Cornells got some confidence too Rox theyre not willing to give this lead up yet but uh Cals battling pretty hard theyve going to have something to say about the outcome of this one Andre St yakovich but an offensive foul mon Soko picks up the foul for the illegal screen yeah he he you know you got to get set I think the officials felt that he was moving and so you can see here that youre youre youre definitely moving youre youre searching out the defender you have to let the defender come to you you cant go get the defender while youre Applause moving Cooper Nord launching and too strong but the long rebound at guy Raglin Jr for Cornell and the ball stripped and stolen Javon blacker leads the break and its deflected run down by Jeremiah Wilkinson and its saved by Nazir Williams and Cornell comes away with it Applause Music and the loose ball St yakovich Now cal attacks again in transition Andre still yakovich and its blocked but a goal the goal tending on Jake Fegan and so yakovich will get the bucket C coming back Roxy I like that theyre turning their defense into offense not sure that was a goal 10 but the officials saw it differently and uh it was close that was right at the Apex of Applause and keep in mind since a goal was called if the officials at the next break want to take a replay review of it they can because the goal was called on the floor foul and one Cooper Applause Nord well how about Cornell Roxy theyre in the midst of getting you know things drifting back away from them and they just come back and give you a big shot watch a drive by Cooper Nord the spin and the Finish through contact I mean theyve been competitive all game they they are a tough tough out when youre playing them defensively second foul on Jeremiah Wilkinson Nord the Jr from Glen View Illinois Glen Brook South High School double figures now in five straight games theyre back from the John Shire and Chris Collins high schools in Glen glenv good schools there Cornell not afraid to go back in Illinois and get some players Applause M cilo the rebound still 1220 to go it was 23 Cornell by 11 and nor has the last seven points scored by Music Cornell down low mon Soko in the lane thats a big time basket Rox you need a basket you go right down to the block and M M Soko finishes for your team long three and then missed by Guy Raglin Jr and the loose ball Jeremiah Wilkinson and he stepped on the sideline thats a break for Cornell cuz they were Off to the Races the other direction ninepoint lead for Cornell yeah look at Cal on the offensive end Roxy theyre hanging theyre gliding theyre kissing off the window theyre coming back in this Music game against Jake Fegan on the basket that was counted but goal tending was called and they did confirm that it was indeed goal tending in the basket stands ninepoint Cornell Le Jake Fegan Up and Under And The Rebound read is petritis for Cal thats a tough move trying to go over the top of petrius great defense by Reus so a chance to chip even further into this Cornell Lee Applause Music gon black Shir Jr eight to shoot gets underneath Spencer Mahoney in the corner three Roxy theres a big time shot by a big time shooter in a big time moment thats a huge shot huge basket its down to six money now four for eight from three this season and it rattles all the way down and out for AK okari it was all the way down and popped Applause out again its Mone that one is off Lee dor the offensive Rebound in the kick out Christian Tucker launches a three and the box out by Guy Raglin Jr Here Comes Cornell and the lay in the reverse Jake Fegan how about the way they put pressure on the basket Fegan with the back cut in transition I mean they just you cannot go to sleep you cannot nap on Applause Music Cornell heres black Shir double clutches tried to draw contact got the shot to go anyways Im not so sure there wasnt contact on that play Rocky hell of a shot by black Shir for now its a two theyll review it during the next time out but an answer from Cornell Cornells not going away Roxy you know Cals going to have to get some stops but if youre if youre a c you got to like the way youre playing offensively youre playing much more Freer the balls moving uh guys are getting assists guys are scoring Raglin with the jumper now jobon blackshire off on that one last Touch by Cornell and its off of nazer Williams yeah heres the play I mean you can see blackshire here I I mean there was some contact here a little bit of body and the shot goes down that could have very well been a fourpoint play officials choosing to play play on look like his right foot may have been on the line they ruled it a two and again that will be reviewed during the next time out to confirm a two or a three Spencer Mahoney missing a three Reus petritis fouled on a fo back and its the first on nazer Williams cant do that how about Reus P trus keeping the The Possession alive I mean theres a Miss shot you think youre going the other direction but betrus just has a nose Roxy for the ball hes done this every single game hes played I mean you got to love him as a player he just makes plays keeps possessions alive gives up his body uh really hustled on the floor rattles in petritis 82 from the line transfer from the Air Force Academy coached against his dad at Oregon State and I we he and I have talked about that talked to Dad the other day on the phone actually and one for two goes kritis well youre kale now you really want to start stringing together some stops you youre confident in your offense now but you got to get confident in your defense nows here Williams behind the screen and the long rebound Ryan kosin for Cornell another offensive rebound and the three petritis the rebound looks to race up the floor attacks petritis and its blocked by Nicks Spencer Mahoney the offensive rebound backing his way in St yakovich draws the foul the second on nazer Williams well thats a big play and a big take by stovich but you know lets watch here you can see theres the drive by petrius and you can see the challenge and the foul right here uh I mean you know the officials are are letting these guys play a little bit uh but Cals being the aggressor this half Rox thats why theyre back in this game theyve been the more aggressive team the yovich who averages seven free throws attempted per game you know Cals trying to play their big guys Roxy theyre trying to play lead Dort and M theyre up Soko theyre not playing them at the same time because theyre just def field defensively this is just too hard of a team to guard so theyre trying to stay with their guards and in one post at all times Andre St yakovich hits both Cornell by five Music Cooper Nord and foul on Reus petritis is third thats a great aggressive take by Cooper Nord because you got an aggressive player pounding you and against aggression boxing youve got to drive it and stay aggressive you you fight aggression with aggression watch this drive the tri is all over and to the basket with some foul on the on the attempt but you know I do like Ks aggression you you know youre going to Cornell did not get to the line first half only shot one free throw one more for Nord 16 points for Nord 17 for nazer Williams to lead Cornell Joshua Ola Joseph for Cal with 19 to lead all scorers in the game a career high but you wonder a carryover maybe a hangover effect Ben from blowing that 18point lead last Tuesday at Missouri and it just kind of lingers with you until you can shake it off and you wonder if that was hovering over Cal in the Stanford game on Saturday its carried into tonight well but they did come back against Stanford they were down big against Stanford came all the way back there Roxy you made some runs so I think Cals got the ability they they can come back on you their challenge now is going to have to be to score and also get some stops against a team thats difficult to defend Andre to yakovich into the k looking for contact and AKO Ki comes up with a rebound for the big red Hing to the bucket and the L in AK oari a career high tying 18 points how about to give and goes tonight how back the other way and Jeremiah Wilkinson is fouled thats fortunate for kale Wilkinson and the Freshman a 71 foul shooter hes got Music nine Cal by the way 7even for 12 from three here in the second half oh theyre on a roll offensively thereon all 10 of his since halftime yeah their challenge again is to see if he can just get some consecutive stops theyve gotten stops against Cornell but this team is a type of Team you need consecutive stops Applause and the Strip by Joshua Ola Joseph and its out of bounds toward the corner for the big red well he has been active tonight Joshua Ola Joseph on both ends of the floor now hes had a whale of a game and youre going to need his performance as you say not just offensively but defensively Cs good look showing you two three look here Applause tough shot and a foul on Ola Joseph yeah Roxy thats a kind of play when youre when you know that was a try a shot to try to draw a foul you got to let that one go that was going to be a tough degree of difficulty shot on a turnaround uh you know you want to stay aggressive but you dont want a body that was going to be a difficult shot to make two shots for Ryan ke aen whos now 0 for two from the line tonight so one more for the local kid from Los Altos Hills he struggled from the line this year Roxys shooting under 60 57 so Kell if youre going to foul somebody thats who you want to put to the Music line he missed both Joshua Ola Joseph the rebound really two possessions down Roxy theyre right in this game uh they need to score and a stop theyre right here Applause Andre still yakovich the runner off the window and he has done that all season long hes now the present and accounted for in half number two inside 7even minutes foul will get AK Oar to the line and two shots for the Junior from Clovis yeah I love love the aggression of AK o kokee I mean he just says Im going to take you to the basket Im going to go over one and two Defenders and Im getting to the free throw line third on Andre sto yakovich oeri 73 for the line who has the unique combination of leading Cornell on the season in assists and offensive rebounds and he has a per High 19 points now and one more coming Cornell tonight again leads the country in assists averaging as a club almost 21 a game they have only 12 yeah thats a credit to Cal their defense now has been much better uh thats come out much better made Cornell have to go oneonone and thats not their Forte theyre pretty good without the ball one of the best moving teams without the ball that Ive Applause Music seen hey hey Applause Music Applause Andre to yakovich the kick jovon blacker in and out on the three Monty sasoko the offensive rebound Jeremiah Wilkinson darts in and its kicked theyll put 20 on the shot clock for Cal with 625 to go good reload for Cal to go up and keep that alive alive Roxy every possession is going to count now and so Cals keeping the possession alive thats huge Gs going with a spread alignment 14 trying to get Andre stovich to the ball they want want his hands on the ball still got time on the Applause clock body Soko poers it back in he has been big down on the Block for the Cal Bears Corell by four ball knocked Away by Soko off of Joshua Ola Joseph and its a Cornell ball Cs aggression Roxy is really showing I mean theyre theyve been aggressive to the basket first of all and theyve also been aggressive great offensive rebound but theyve been aggressive with their hands Cooper Nord in and out on the three the offensive rebound Andre St yakovich the block Jeremiah Wilkinson with speed Wilkinson LS it in its a twopoint game from 23 down early in the second half Cal is within two and the first time its been a one possession game since 1135 was left in the first half and Andre sakovich lets it go into the Cornell bench off the Miss three from AK okari heres the block how about stay up and Roxy thats not a fluke hes been doing that all year long he leads Callum blocks nine blocks that could call it number 10 I mean thats a huge block now C with a Chance rocks either tie or take the Applause lead just inside five and a half minutes to go from 23 down C turn it over 13 times in the first half the yakovich hits a three and K has the lead from 23 down Cal lead 72 71 KY Raglin Jr a three for Cornell and not so fast as what you know Cornell is saying look we built this lead were just not going to give this away but Roxy they have given it up theyve given up 20 plus point lead so thats a credit to Cal with the turnovers 13 in the first half just three in the second half for the Bears Andre St yakovich Applause drives Jeremiah Wilkinson two strong on the three in the rebound AK Applause Music oari thats here Williams and foul number four on Andre sto yakovich with 413 remaining yeah thats a tough one because youre behind my remember my high school coach always used to say youre either behind or youre in front you cant be in between and thats what happened to Andre you got caught and sometimes youre better off to let it get in but uh you can see the pass there and there was you know there was the body contact the hand was across clean but your lower body made the contact eight team fouls so one and one for guy Raglin Jr 74 from the line and it rattles out Joshua Ola Joseph the rebound Cs been catching a break here as Cornells missed some opportunities from the line see if they can capitalize theyre back in the zone Cornell theyre made the match up Zone one on the ball and everybody trying to match to a man in his area leaving his way in the lob Joseph lays it in and were tied with 350 to go 21 for Joshua Ola Applause Joseph and St yakovich playing with four fouls Nazir Williams got it back that missed everything guy Raglin underneath still plenty of time on the shot clock for Cornell Cooper Nord darts in and Cornell reclaims the lead how about the unselfish play in the cut I mean Cornell knows just when to cut Roxy they get you to watch the ball and then they cut behind you so you cant see where youre going with your mans going youre so intent on stopping the Applause ball and on the sideline call a turnover 259 to go and a twopoint game and Cs going to have something to say about this because they have climbed back stormed back in this game as you mentioned down by 23 theyve just turned it around the second half they climbed the glass 15 offensive rebounds but you know they had 13 first half turnovers and they only have four this half so theyve really done a better job of taking care of the ball now they got to defend Cornell Cal had a brief lead before Cornell snatched it right back Andre St yakovich playing with four fouls Cooper Nord Force back out still tend to shoot for the big red Jake Fegan drops it off and it rolls off for oari and its last Touch by Cal and M coko wants a replay review they cant no cant its not under two Roxy but I I think that was the right call but you know what were not going to know because there is no review as you mentioned off the inbound its stolen knocked Away by Joshua Ola Joseph great defense denial defense jovon blacker Jr gets inside and the loose ball tipped out of bounds by nazer Williams will stay at this hand in a cow ball well Cal scrapping Roxy nothings coming easy but Ill tell you this their aggression is paying off I mean they have been the aggressive team theyre putting pressure on the ball theyre putting pressure at The Rim uh theyve got things going in their behalf but theyve got a figure out a way to score and convert right now 10 on the shot Applause clock and jovon blackshire lost it out of bounds thats again Force turnover uncharacteristic took his eyes off the ball I think he was worried about the short clock now if youre C you got to forget about that one you have to get a stop Applause Music Applause Music tend to shoot Jake Applause F drives and a foul and one Jake Fegan o I dont know how he managed to finish that there was no time on the team to watch but here speaking of exciting team to watch this game has been unbelievable in terms of uh drama in the second half Cals come back and just you know was able to tie the game and now its Cornell with the fivepoint lead so Cals going to have to get back on the board and where are they going to go you know stovich can score Ola Josephs been on fire all game those are two great options Joon blackshire Jr had a good look at a three the rebound kept Alive by Monty sok and breaking out of the pack Cooper Nord for Applause Cornell AK oari pressured by Joshua Ola Joseph oari drives and lays it in Cornell with now a sevenpoint lead Andre yovic and a foul its on Mi Soko and 489 seconds a 7even nothing Cornell run to put them up seven and theyre headed to the line in guy Raglin Jr Two Shots the double bonus for the big red oh they needed to Roxy Cornells come up with some big baskets I mean Cal had a furious comeback and Cornell is just you know theyve withstood this comeback and theyre in a position now Roxy if they can knock down some free throws and get a stop to Salt this gameway from 23 down Mark Madson team rally but give credit to John Jakes and Cornell they down and get a score and so we cant just take the first shot weve got to come down and get a good shot maybe even a free throw a draw Music foul wouldnt be surprised to see Cornell go back into the their Zone but they the Miss now you cant you got to go back and pick up and transition Andre to yakovich on the drive draws the foul thats what Cal wants Roxy thats really exactly what Mark Matson wants Im sure he told his team lets get to the rim lets not settle and look they stopped the clock with two free throws thats thats what you want to do now Cornell is going to counter with the timeout and talk about their strategy second foul on Jake Fegan so a 30 second timeout for Cornell you know get the points on the board then set up your press Cal can press they did this against Stanford cost some turnovers in their last game theyre in position to do the same and they got re Reus petrius coming in if you want to talk about a guy that steals and gets some turnovers uh hes hes tough he gets it done for for covic hits both and now theyll sub him out with his four fouls the trus coming Cs got uh you know I mean Cornells got time uh Cs got time to get a trap before they foul they do not need to foul right away they can try to get a trap or turnover violation if they can and theyre going to try to put uh ol Joseph on the basketball and its a delay of game to cow yeah and what you cant do Roxy is you cannot deny a a pass to pass under the basket and what Cornell did which was clever they put they were going to go underneath the basket you dont see it very often but heres the play and theres theres the The Possession theres a and and you cant do that so now theyre going to talk about this as officials and theyre going to issue a technical foul thats a huge call going against kale Nazir Williams will shoot the technical free throw thats unfortunate I think C was in position Roxy to set up and possibly get a steal a turnover now they have to get the point back and the ball now goes back to the Baseline so lets see if Cal can avoid any other violations and it is just the one shot technical by the way not the two shot variet no but lets see if if Cornell elects to go underneath the basket again and they do and they foul its Joshua Ola Joseph that will send Jake fan to the line yeah you and Fegan is four for four tonight yeah you dont often see that attack I know Ive used that a couple of times uh in the past in my career but its something you dont see a lot and a lot of times coaches do that see if they can draw a technical so a good call by by coach Jake now again if youre Cal you got to hope that Fegan can miss at least one of these two and then out get back on the board still got time left this game is long long way from over Applause Music one more for Applause Music fan 389 to go and fan goes one for two if youre Cornell you dont want to stop the clock I mean I mean you dont you want to play without fouling Andre St Music yakovich drives body Soko drops it in season ey tying 11 for Soko and a timeout for Cornell it is their last that was a pretty quick timeout I thought Cal was going to foul there but but but you cant hold it you otherwise youre thats a turnover Music Jeremiah Wilkinson knocked it free but then ripping it away guy Raglin and a foul that will send Cooper Nord to the line W Roxy that couldnt have been any closer to a turnover I mean that ball was popped Loose by Cal fourth on Marty Soko and its Cooper Nord two for three at the line 82 on the season to shoot Applause two one more for Nord who has a careerhigh tying 20 AK oi ker High 22 to lead Cornell Music tonight and Nord hits both new career B 21 jovon blackshire Jr gets the fly by missed the three the tip in Monty Soko 87 to go and Cal looking to foul and they cant grab and Cornell the exclamation point from AK okari and for the first time in over 70 years Cornell will beat a team from the ACC Applause the final 8880 Cornell stuns Cal
