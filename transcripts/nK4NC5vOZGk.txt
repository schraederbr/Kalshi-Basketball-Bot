different roles looked really good the last time out they did two freshmen in the starting lineup in the back court Foster McCain were both very very good on Applause Saturday and we are underway two seconds Applause in and one of the officials looks back and says we are good to go ostra basketball well you mentioned Thomas an outstanding score theyre going to have another stoppage right here weve been around this hopster team for two days in beted a little bit youd say Doug and the vibe from this team very positive excited to be here in Cameron and a terrific mid major Club coached by arguably the best player in the schools history sure thirdyear head coach Speedy Claxton and Tyler Thomas getting the business from the Cameron crazies and its always fun to watch the nonconference teams that dont often get the opportunity to come into Cameron walk in for the first time yesterday for practice and just look around in the traveling party it is a huge deal for the pride to be here seeing what they can do against the Blue Devils and right on Q Tyler Thomas the fifth leading scorer in the nation has his first two its its interesting that Duke prepared their game plan to slow him down and he created his own shot opportunity on the first possession well before shoot around today the first thing Duke head coach John shy said to his team is yako Fritz comes up with a block shot weve got to defend the threepoint shot HRA shoots the three as well as anybody in the country and on the first possession perhaps that played into Hoster hosters favor with the up fake to drive in for the midrange and I think youre right Hoster will play a five out offense theyll spread the floor and theyll look with three guards to get downhill off the dribble and certainly Thomas a big part of that offense so is D stone dubar with the shot clock under 10 they go inside Fritz has it knocked Away by filipowski long rebound track down by Caleb Foster quickly got thead to his fellow freshman Jared Applause McCain filipowski left alone he was out early today working on that shot showing dividend on his first attempt good pump fake to the corner that threw the defense off and he knocked down the shot only uh shooting about 28 on his career but hes got that kind of range and it really opens things up for Duke heres the first three ball from dubar its Off the Mark Foster will dribble up so without Proctor what do you see from the other guys who are playing perhaps different roles FR I thought they I thought they really moved the ball well Saturday and they didnt really care who got the best shot and I said the ball has energy when you move it side the side the way they did filipowski has his pocket pick numbers for the pride little tear drop by dubar Off the Mark 32 early Duke with a lead in the basketball this is senior twotime Captain Jeremy roach nice pass beautiful feet inside and the easy flush for Mark Mitchell I think Fritz was concerned about coming to double and he didnt come quick enough and that gave filipowski an easy look inside to Mark Mitchell who we said this to coach shy hes finding his identity Mark Mitchell forget the outside shot do all the energy things off the jquan Carlos miss here come the Blue Devils Mitchell back to Foster thought about it into the paint little pull Applause up this is a Hofstra team with a six and three record and the foul called on roach on the reach in now watch this right here good kick out by Foster watch the little ball fake to the corner it throws off that defensive rotation and then right here remember the pride dont come early to double him and that opens up Mark Mitchell inside Mark Mitchell one for 15 from the threepoint line I thought Saturday Doug he cut to the basket he offens rebounded he ran the floor and hes going to be an energy type player in terms of scoring weve seen already this year teams just leaving him open this young man at the foul line from Brooklyn New York you ready for this he wants scored 90 in a basketball game but he did it twice young man from Thomas Jefferson High School I was going to say thats a school youre familiar with from back in the day I did my student teaching there but not not when when he was there trust me long time ago well Thomas Jefferson High School in New York City has produced three first round NBA picks can you name the three of them Fran I was there when Sydney Green played but youre going to tell me who else Jim mcmillion oh yeah and Leroy Alis wow how about that that doesnt even count Phil sers who led ruter to the final four thats exactly right Jim mcmillon a great player at Columbia then LA Lakers Bowski back out front good ball fake in penetration but the ball was lost out of bounds its HRA basketball turnover Caleb Foster Hoster through the years under Speedy Claxton as an assistant and as a head coach has gone to some places and won and Im talking about places like Arkansas and Jaylen Blakes comes into the ball game early for John Shire coming off a terrific 15 Point performance in the game on Saturday against Charlotte but it wasnt just about those 15 points for Blakes no hes hes a great defensive player and thats his thats his role Fritz jump pass back outside dubar no filipowski tracks down the Applause rebound roach driving and laying it in first two points for the senior from leeburg Virginia what I watch about that as he went right at yako Fritz who has a tendency to get in foul trouble and Fritz just kind of was a conscientious objector right there defensively good good smart play by Jeremy roach I like the way you put that a conscientious objector by a man who has filed out four of the first nine games this season for HRA and hes got his hands full tonight going against Kyle filipowski yeah but how about D Stone dubar transfer from Iowa State knocking it down and all of a sudden HRA has come to Music play this holiday season give your family the gift that keeps on going her very own

its your water your way Speedy CL claxtons HRA Pride can hurt you offensively they average over 80 points per game twice this season theyve gone for 100 or more and theyve got a couple of guys not just Tyler Thomas but also D Stone dubar its quite a one two punch R it really is I remember when he played sparingly at Iowa State hes transferred to HRA hes one of those four men that can play away from the basket score inside and then Tyler Thomas all hes done this year has gone for 40 in a game and he is a prolific scorer both transfers Thomas from Sacred Heart I mentioned dubar from Iowa State and Thomas in those 40 points against High Point the game went to overtime he scored 33 of his 40 points in the second half from the halftime to the end of regulation he put 33 on High Point meanwhile dubar has gone for as many as 30 in a game Philip hsky coming out of the break gives Duke a twopoint lead and nice job by coach shy they went a little Flex offense Baseline screen down screen that freed the big fella Philip palski for a 10ft jump shot I was impressed with how huge Kyle filipowski is when youre around him in person yeah listed at 72 48 britz gets the defender in the air and draws the foul hell head to the free throw Music line I think what we saw Saturday Doug and its really a good recipe for the success of Duke going forward is the maturation of the young guards they shot the ball well filipowski has got to establish himself as a low post player I know hes hit a three already and then Mitchell is the Energizer Bunny to me hes he reminds me of draymont green in college draymont later became a really good threepoint shooter but he played with so much energy around the basket Mark Mitchell I think when we talked to the coaching staff they said hes in an identity crisis and were trying to get him to figure out who he is Fritz gets one out of two draws the pride back within a point into the game for the first time TJ power The Freshman Sharpshooter from Shrewsbury Massachusetts I think hes the best shooter on this team former top four 40 Prospect and watching him in practice yesterday we were amazed at how many shots he made oh good cut another terrific pass give him another assist on the layup by Blakes terrific cut by Jaylen Blakes off the ball as soon as it hit filipowski hands he back cut his Defender and was wide open well Blakes had scored 14 total points through Dukes first eight games of the year he had 15 the last time out in his first two here tonight he is a team favorite Jaylen Blakes were going to talk about him some Thomas always draws a crowd defensively how is Duke trying to deal with him here tonight well theyre TR theyre trying to get him off the threepoint line but you just saw incredible footwork right there filipowski HS those two points back yeah I really like that HRA tried to keep the ball screen on the side and filipowski thats what we call a short roll offensive foul on Carlos lets watch this now watch filipowski look for the ball right away and now he plays off two feet so he doesnt run the defender over and I think with with the Dukes propensity to run a lot of ball screens that Mitchell and filipowski particularly are open What in in that area we call the High paint we call that a short roll so he doesnt have to roll all the way to the basket there it is again power finds McCain got it well thats the ball Movement we talked about that we saw Saturday when Philip palski rolls into the lane the weak side has to contain him and that leaves the shooter open on the other side yeah chatting with Jay Lucas one of the assistant coaches at Duke earlier today he talked about the fact that Philip palski is going to be doing more passing on the offensive end going forward hes going to get 18 18 to 22 points every single game the be and hes got great passing ability but the more he sets his teammates up the easier the game will come for him inside good pass again power had it go through his fingertips out of bounds so seven made field goals Fran six assists exactly and that is a recipe for this team and believe it or not without Tyrese Proctor in the lineup their best Pro Prospect and best point guard its giving these young Blue Devil guards a chance to find themselves and theyve done that over the first of the last game in a in a little bit Carlos nice feed inside once again Fritz Finds himself alone for Applause two got a mismatch inside filipowski with a touch pass to the corner McCain has three more four The Freshman from Sacramento has six quick points and the blue Devils lead is four well its great that you pointed out the shooting but that all came off of another great find by the big fella watch bakes hes going to guard Thomas hes an excellent Defender tend to shoot dubar three more its back to a onepoint ball game good basketball they double team Thomas at the top he got rid of it quickly dubar got that shot off quick before power could recover from the help defense and youre getting a taste HRA puts the ball up a lot from three dubar already three for five from Beyond The Ark well the one thing youve seen in the first nine minutes is they play fearlessly remember this is a team thats gone to places like Arkansas UCLA Florida State nice yako Fritz puts HRA on top 20 to9 Fritz is the transfer from Kus heres a crazy stat Doug when he doesnt foul out of a game this year the pride are five Music Applause and0 flakes gives it back to filipowski he attacks and lays it in filipowski with nine points you notice he hasnt scored at on any postup so far short Jumper in the lane and hes making a living on that short Applause roll Thomas with power Applause defending eight to shoot Carlos backs it out now goes around the defender finds the open man in the corner three ball a little bit strong for khil far Applause Music armor roach off the crossover great move L the defender to sleep found his way down the lane its a threepoint Blue Devils Applause lead Carlos pulls up Banks it in not sure he wanted to do that he just wanted to get something up on the glass and was able to knock it in the Blue Devils holding on to a onepoint lead have made eight of their last nine shots from the floor make it eight out of 10 filipowski misses from long range Music watch Thomas now with the ball in his hands hes got great Applause footwork back door Thomas gets it blocked from behind by filipowski who saves for Duke McCain behind the back Fritz denies him back the other way come the pride they love to play fast averaging over 80 points per game Thomas fade away on the Baseline no thats good defense by Jeremy Mo roach theyll give Thomas that shot thats a tough Applause shot John shy delivering instructions

off a rare off game on Saturday but watch the diversity of his offense passing it hes got a number of assists rebounds hes scoring from the three little short roll action here and then watch the spin move n one at the very end terrific start for the sophomore and kind of just playing uh try the best way to put it is unassumingly 11 points and 12 minutes nothing fancy just very effective and partly doug because as Ive said the ball is really moving tonight 11 field goals for Duke nine assists young man from Orange County New York that is Upstate he was born in Middletown raised in Westtown New York played his freshman year at Minn Valley High School in Slate Hill before transferring downstate for him prep in the Bronx and then to Wilbraham and Munson Academy in Massachusetts and now in his second year at Applause Duke Speedy Claxton giving guidance to Tyler Thomas being hounded by roach Thomas hes got good height good size at 63 to get that shot off and the great footwork that step back move against Roach gives him what we call separation and allows him to shoot an effortless 10footer Ive been impressed with him because hes not forcing a lot of action and the Hoster coaching staff saw him first in a secret scrimmage against Sacred Heart they like what they saw and as soon as they saw a few months later that he was in the transfer portal coach Claxton and his staff got an immediate touch 726 remaining in the half Duke holding on to a twopoint lead the Sonic Hickory Barbecue cheeseburger is the perfect quick and delicious fix for when youre craving a melty cheeseburger

Great Taste and nutrition with Fairlife Ultra filtered milk some pictures of Speedy Claxton along with of course thats Jay Wright the man who coached him at HRA Speedy spent a decade playing in the NBA arguably the greatest player in the history of Hoster and were so pleased to be joined Now by his head coach at Hofer Jay wri by Zoom coach welcome Doug Franny great to be with you what a game man indeed and and you know youre a n Smith Hall of Famer twotime National Champion but it all started for were you when you got your first head coaching job at hofra and I want to ask you how back in the mid90s did you go to Christ the King High School and convince Speedy Clon to come and play for you well when Speedy was a junior he was only about 56 not a lot of people wanted him so we loved him because he was 5 foot6 and he was dunking the ball but by the he gave us a verbal commitment early in his senior year by the end of his senior year everybody in the country wanted him he was 510 and including Fran Fran Fel got the job at St Johns he tried to go steal him from us but at least Fran called me first and said I got to try this Jay you know I got to Im the coach at St Johns I got to try it it went about a day and then I backed off and Jay I think Im responsible for putting you in Hall of Fame then Speedy Bray you and Speedy definitely definitely he got it all started did you think he would have coaching in him after his career playing I I did Franny when he was a junior we had a philosophy that I would call the play and then with 8 seconds on the shot clock if the play didnt work we would just give it to Speedy and then Speedy would just go one onone and then in tight games Speedy would just start holding the ball from 30 seconds all the way down to eight and just whatever I call hed go 101 and score and our assistant coach Tom Bora said I like his plays a lot better than the plays youre calling well we we got a little insight into your playbook back in the day tell us about this oh its true I dont know where you got that thats good stuff man come on man come on its Franny Franny knows everybody man Frannys got it all but Ill tell you he was such a big part of everything we did he he was truly the greatest player at Hof and still one of of all the great players weve coached still one of the best players weve ever coached he was tough athletic really intelligent and really one of the most competitive guys Ive ever coached and you can see that in his teams when you watch him right now Jay on a serious note did you ever think about the impact he really did have on your career because its so special to get a player that good at the mid major level now frany youre absolutely right Franny as you know he was a New York City kid with a nickname and he was a great player so when youre in New York City and you got a nickname then you got gained everybody wanted to come play with him so the other picture you show was Norman Richardson from Grady High School who joined him who also played in the NBA but it all started with Speedy because when Speedy decided to come we didnt have anybody he was the first guy that decided to come that hopster and help us build it well Speedy told me this morning Jay that his immediate family calls him by his given name Craig and most everybody else calls him Speedy do you ever call him Craig I started to a little bit in the beginning because I was afraid of his mom and dad they were real strict and then once I could tell they accepted me I was okay I went with Speedy like the rest of everybody in New York City he said he got that nickname around the seventh grade from one of his coaches who didnt know his name just described the way he was out on the basketball court hey Jay by the way weve got a game here I just got to ask you Ive spent a lot of time with John CH the last couple days think about the early part of your career and how you evolved into the coach you became and put yourself in Johns shoes 27 wins last year little struggle early with a young team just give me your assessment of just being a young coach who grows into the job thats a great question Fran because especially following Mike SFI and I did it with I coach under rolling mamino theres so many things that Johns learned from Mike that he wants to put into action but hes got to find what fits his personality what fits his ideas of the game hell use some of Mike got hes got to find his own the problem is I was doing it at hopster when not a lot of people were watching at the time Johns doing it at D when everybodys watching and men are the pride knocking it out Jay thank you so much for joining us great being with you guys thank you Jay back to Cameron in a moment wow Ram makes

points yeah and they are shooting the lights out and we talked about this at the beginning this team has going on the road to a lot of good places and Come Away with wins at places like Arkansas Florida State we watch two days of practice and theres a confidence and Poise that we saw in practice that absolutely has carried over on the court in this first half and the idea for Duke coming into this game you got to run them off the threepoint line but dubar is already five of seven from distance here tonight yeah and I think the Duke offense has been fine uh its been the defensive end where to your point giving up too many and theyre not open looks theyre theyre tough looks but hofr knocking him down very impressive first half by The Pride out of this CAA picked in the preseason pole number four with the College of Charleston number one look at this theres another three ball this one from Thomas wow that just was a kind of a hustle Mistake by Blakes ended up being a five on four filipowski is blocked from behind by duar and here come the pride a long three a little too Applause long out of bounds h ra giv Duke a ball game here tonight absolutely D Stone dubar hes hot whats

else Seth and Zubin coming up at the half well be joined by Yukon head coach Dan Hurley to look forward to Friday nights huge game right here on ESPN 2 Yukon and Gonzaga thats at the half you said it was going to be close tonight yeah I love the spacing and the force that this hster team plays with whether its Thomas or dumbar or Carlos but Im also FR I got to be honest with you I am really disappointed with the intensity and the attention to detail of this Duke defense thought set Saturday they turned a corner their defense was excellent and offensively tonight Doug we talked about this during the break their offense is fine theyre shooting 55 56 but the scouting report on Thomas and then dubar is a good shooter theyve just given him too many easy looks but credit Hofer for great offensive execution and that has led to dubar already setting a new personal single game career high for made threes in a game and we still got three and a half minutes to go in the first half and I would think his family is pretty happy about this cuz he grew up about two hours from here in Charlotte good job right there coming out of the break with a plan and filipowski exec Ed it to Perfection they did they ran a ball screen watch the ball screen by the guard and that means that Sunday cannot get back in front in time and then he just leans in just a little you notice he was trying to stay vertical but when you go from point A to point B move forward theyre going to call that a foul and Kyle who was hot early I think you just got to keep riding the big guy cuz hes your one weapon right now inside I mentioned he is from upstate New York his mom was a parade AllAmerican at Warwick High School 64 and just a tremendous player yes she was she played I believe in the Elite 8 for Long Beach State before injuries saddled U her career father Dave also played college basketball very talented family Kyle and his siblings all college athletes you see a little bit more intensity defensively I got a feeling John Shire sent a message during that last time Applause out yeah and I think they got a foul inside but I did like Dukes intensity coming out of the timeout they started to heat up the ball deny passing lanes and Im sure John Shire got the message across Friday night right here on ESPN 2 well have the rematch of last seasons West Regional final with number five Yukon taking on number 10 Gonzaga this one is part of the Continental Tire Seattle tip off and coverage begins at 10 Eastern 7 Pacific this young man Thomas can create his own shot watch the footwork step back there it is thats hard to guard because you think youve got him coralled and then he steps back and creates that two to three foot separation hes got 11 dubar has 15 as does Philip kski whos got the basketball now for Duke spins Baseline bowls his way into the lane and has another chance for three well I said it to you earlier when we were at practice the last two days hes a massive young guy Fritz is a good Defender thats his second foul I believe so we may not see him the rest of the half but watch Kyle now under control just used that frame and just go right through yako Fritz theres really nothing he can do where is filipowski better now Fran than he was when he got to Duke 18 months ago I I think why hes gotten bigger and stronger he had a very good freshman year ACC rookie of the year the the area hes got to really continue to improve on he will especially when he gets to the NBA is the threepoint shooting but with you got to play through him and thats a mistake right there just what Seth was talking about yeah lack of concentration but you have to play through Kyle I would spend more time if I were him in the low post last year 50 of the time was played on the perimeter because of live lead I would play more inside if I were him and let your guard guards do that right there boy McCain has a sweet stroke he made a couple of Threes early used that to his advantage and hits the midrange to make it a 39 all timee 39 points is not going to please John shy when they get to the locker room good pass look at this dubar about the only thing hes missed today and here comes filipowski and Jaylen Blake says lets slow it down with a minute and a half to go in the half roach absorbs the contact and finishes with his off hand timeout HRA will step away as well the Blue Devils on a run have retaken the lead hurry up were going to miss first chair this one next yeah were going to has anyone seen my old skisuit just wear the new one I dont want to wear the new one Music ready yeah Dads in your car right no I thought he was with you Dad whos ready to shred some pow FL dont forget the BMW Road Home Sales Event is on now free in for credit of up to 2500 plus

you trying to win 10 games for the second year in a row thats never been done in Athens Ohio a place I spent six great years as an Ohio you Bob you always keep your eye on the Bobcats in football or in basketball or any sport love the Bobcats HRA trying to respond coming out of the timeout after allowing Duke to retake the lead you see they spaced the floor well and right now youve got a guard filipowski trying to guard a guard out on the perimeter watch watch him watch him create Tyler the secondary Defender filipowski may have gotten a piece from behind now philipos filipowski trying dont give up on it see Jeremy roach whooped off filipowski should have gone right back to him and thats what John shy wanted he pointed Inside Out of Bounds stepping on the end line was Caleb Foster that is the fifth turnover committed by Duke on that last possession yako Fritz did a good job early in the possession of keeping filipowski from getting it but filipowski kept working and Jeremy looked him off and reversed it you just got to give the big fella a little bit more time to get set John Shire putting on a fullcourt press and it pays off the Steel by McCain filipowski finds the open man again Foster got it first three points for the Freshman from Harrisburg North Carolina and another assist by Kyle good ball movement offense not the problem for Duke final possession of the half here goes the fifth leading scorer in the country and he loses it off the hands of roach though out of bounds so with 29 seconds remaining The Pride will have one last chance do dont want waste of timeout here theyve already used that first half timeout lets see if they have something set up they are excellent on inbounds under lets see if theyve got something on the side without a timeout they scored four baskets on Saturday at St Louis on inbounds plays Carlos will inbound keep an eye on number 23 in blue now they Lobby here it is they got it but a foul is called before that shot they set up a play we call winner its a brad Stevens play throw it to the other side of the court and screen for Thomas and the foul was called because Duke had one to give watch Thomas now hes on one side of the floor and he comes to the other its a great pass but good smart foul by Duke Thomas has it poked away clock stops again with 910 of a second on the clock all right this is still catch and shoot Applause Music territory I like the idea that hastra has a plan you can tell they know what theyre doing Carlos again to trigger they got it shot up no it would have counted if Tyler Thomas had found the range but the to slow down the second best scoring duo in the country and we should mention that officially they changed an earlier foul from the first half that was called on Fritz and gave it to Farmer so Fritz only has one and as yako Fritz goes foul wise often times that translates to winning or losing for HR well theres no question when he does not foul out of a game this team is five and0 the kishis transfer is a very solid defensive player that was him with the ball number 11 giving it off to Thomas the fifth leading score in the nation kicks it out to his point guard Carlos misses filipowski rips the rebound one thing Duke did Saturday really well is they ran off misses and uh the more stops you get the more you got to get it out in transition filipowski with the dump down Miss layup by Mitchell hes going to try again cant do it Fritz Standing Tall in the Applause lane heres Thomas the Sacred Heart transfer averaging nearly 24 points per game he draws two Defenders so somebodys got to be open this time its jako Fritz he plays at a really calm pace for a guy thats a prolific scorer he doesnt Rush hes under control and he was so slow that time that he actually had two Defenders stick with him and it left Fritz open Fran what what youre describing there as filipowski again tries to set up Mitchell but it goes out of bounds back dastra is that innate the ability to play slowly or is that something that can be learned uh I dont think it can be I dont think it can be learned at the college level I think its something you you learn growing up with older bigger players playing on the Schoo yard in the gym he just really has a good feel remember hes a transfer from Sacred Heart New Haven kid I I think you got to I like the double right here roach with the three give filipowski another assist I like the double team but I like the kick out by filipowski they will if they play inside out with him this year they will get a lot of open looks I love the idea that if he gets double team throw it out get it to your open teammates and youll get it back as well thats five assists as Hof returns it over five assists for filipowski and roach may not be the guy you want to double off of making 48 this year no exactly right you see Thomas come off him but Im going to tell you Kyles going to have a big year we know that hes going to score but the more he gets his teammates involved and hes really capable of doing that this game will come easier offensively for Duke and Fran as we saw before shoot around today I mentioned coach Carwell working with filipowski on many things among those for quite a while was how to handle the double team and pass out of it he just did it right there it wasnt exactly accurate but he got the ball to McCain and and as he goes this offense goes Duke with an eightpoint lead its largest of the Music night work smarter not harder with new handsfree Sketchers work slipins just step in and get to work without bending

youre welcome Music enjoy Merry Christmas oh my goodness NBA Christmas day begins at noon and continues all day on ESPN ABC and ESPN plus Doug Sherman Fran prilla back at Cameron and Kyle filipowski is having one of those nights putting up tremendous numbers already a careerhigh and assist and Fran as you got ready for this game as you always do you took a deep dive what have you seen out of filipowski tonight specifically thats going to make this team better the more he recognizes double teams and finds the open man on the weak side and this passes off Target a little bit McCain makes a nice catch but watch the spacing on the weak side and Im telling you Kyles going to get 18 to 20 every single night hes an all American he is a good passer last year as a freshman he only averaged an assist an assist and a half a game hes got six tonight when he handles its almost like a quarterback in football picking up a blitz when you pick up the blitz somebodys open and Im telling you his teammates are going to take him out to lunch a lot this year if he keeps delivering the way he has and when he is playing in this manner how good is this offense its really good because hes still impossible to guard oneonone inside great players make two Defenders guard them whether theyre a point guard or a big man Thomass pass deflected off the Duke defenders leg and bounc back and hit Thomas and went out of bounds so its Duke basketball one of the things I we talked with Coach shy yesterday we call it a repost when he doesnt have it and cant find anybody throw it back out and reset up inside and bury your Defender you know closer to the basket hell do that as the season goes on watch that pass great job Mitchell to Philip p for three excellent ball movement and Mitchell is terrific in that short roll we know hes W for 16 from three thats not his game but that play right there is going to be really valuable this season for Duke remember theyre still finding their identity as a young team coming off some tough losses and we talked to John shy about that earlier today as roles continue to evolve do this just the 10th game of the season Carlos with two more points and he even thought that perhaps the injury to Tyrese Proctor whos still coming back from an ankle injury might ultimately help this team down the it often does because you get you gain the confidence you know of the Freshman Foster and McCain particularly getting playing time look at this another good delivery yep you see the follow through there so much confidence hes got 23 points in counting listen he shot 28 from three last year but you know the is not broken I love the Inside Out nature and the passing of his offense good pass clean look dubar has his new career high with six made threes in a game good answer by hofra now the pride need a couple of stops because theyve already proven that they can score Music points theres that short roll watch Applause Mitchell heres roach calling for the screen back out to filipowski again finding the open man in the corner airball Foster Mitchell with a shot clock down to three missed the rim able to get it on the rim and the ball comes back out to Duke but I love Mitchells energy those will fall big rebound and the foul called against Duke filipowski picks up the personal foul but hes been getting it done from three tonight yeah the versatility of the big fella sevenfooter he dominated the first half inside hes got six assists and then when he knocks down the three ball how do you guard Music him holy canol look at this its like a science project ordering lunch easy for you and me but can be so difficult for a young homeowner turning into their parents are those all different lettuces uh yes sir brown rice

in the sugar bow it seems like these two teams are peing right at the right Applause moment the biggest dream of all is just two wins away Michigan Alabama at 5 and Washington Texas at 845 New Years Day exclusively on ESPN Saturday we have a college basketball quadruple header that begins at noon Eastern but these are our featured matchups Virginia Tech hosting Vermont in blackburg at 4 Eastern and then Virginia squares off against nor Eastern over on acc Network and the app with bran Pilla Im Doug Sherman want to talk about the seconde head coach John Shire of the Blue Devils again so much was made last year as he replaced Coach K of course whats it like for him now in year two that hes gotten Beyond some of that I I think its so so important for a young coach to keep evolving you know I always tell coaches you dont want to be a head coach whos been a head coach 5 years but you only got one year experience five times the best coaches and we had Jay r on earlier the best coaches evolve over time and hell learn what his comfort level is with making changes and adjustments you know I just I like him as a human being I love his uh countenance with his players hes got an intense but calm demeanor this guy is a was a great college player 2000 points and so impressed with him in the couple days that weve been here but the key for him is to just keep improving on his uh craft if you will yeah twotime Captain under Coach K McCain around and out Mitchell again working on the offensive blast and the dunk this is Mark Mitchells game its an energy game its short rolls its offensive rebounds its it strives to the left hand I wouldnt care if he shot another three all season but this is his game right here just that athleticism around the rim youve got the big guy who can score and youve got the guard play on the perimeter I think Mark Mitchell you know and I said it earlier and I Im telling you I watched draymont Green in college he was not a threepoint shooter this kid reminds me of of that kind of game because he brings energy well last year as a freshman he was in the 94th percentile defensively nationally and when you just add that little bit of offense it makes Duke that much tougher to beat they are 19 and2 when he hits double figures and hes got 10 tonight and keep in mind is this another one right here and keep in mind last year he played small forward Philip Pas psky played the four Lively at the five I think hes a college Forman and will have his most success around the basket or going to the basket well the makeup of Duke this year obviously different not having an elite rim protector so a lot of guys are playing different roles this year thats right and thats one of the reasons why I think theyve struggled early to find that identity but ironically weve said it a couple times without their best Pro Prospect and Tyrese Proctor still out with the ankle injury we can see over the last two games some rooll definition and by the way how many assists tonight Doug well it is up to 177 assists for Duke on 23 made field goal thats you know thats thats Elite Kansas right now leades the country at 73 assist to field goal rate which by the way would be the first time thats happened since 1999 if youre over 60 assist to field goal rate thats the elite offense and theyve got that tonight and we just got a quick look at Tyrese Proctor whos off crutches now and making his way back hopefully in the coming weeks from that ankle injury lets not forget about the fact that hes fifth in the ACC and assist he is the best passer on this Duke team yes he is and you just think if he can seamlessly come back into the Rhythm that were seeing offensively tonight itll make him that much better obviously no question about it and I mean one thing we saw at practice the last couple days this team likes each other um they like their coaching staff and theyre still willing to learn and get better good ball movement yes it is a rare Miss from dubar whos already made six triples tonight Duke is led by as many as 12 here in the second half Mitchell left alone I like it turns it down and draws the foul I like it he was open he didnt shoot the three and hes athletic enough to go to the basket I and you know I know he wants to make the three ball we know that and I know hes working on it with the coach in staff but until you gain the confidence in that shot do the other things really well and so the sophomore from Kansas City Kansas with his first its good the NCAA Womens Volleyball semifinals are Thursday night on ESPN in the app with three number one seeds and a number two Pittsburgh squares off against Nebraska at 7 Eastern 4 Pacific and then second seated Texas the defending champ will take on with wiconsin the winners

and the one filipowski denies the reverse layup attempt by Carlos Jeremy roach that would have brought the house down good shot transition nothing wrong with that you had Philip psky and Mitchell on the backboard now Fran you called Jeremy roach a culture Warrior why is that well because hes hes a guy that is was not a one and done hes going to be here four years hes going to have a great impact on winning and Ill give you an example as soon as he makes this right on here yeah his teammate at Paul the 6th Trevor Kels only stayed here one year off to the NBA Jeremy roach is here forever and

customer service what do you protect me from mostly yourself and Z frog inside Cameron Indoor Stadium where 21st rank Duke is seizing control of this thing we just talked about Jeremy roach going to break but theres another kind of glue guy so big in the back court for the Blue Devils yeah but I got a confession to make culture Warrior is not my term his Prep School coach a great Coach Joe Manna at Blair Academy when Duke started to recruit this kid Joe told John Shire listen hes not a one and done hes going to be in your program for four years and make your team better and Joe called him a culture Warrior so yesterday at practice we had fun with John Shire asking him about all the guys that have played at Duke Ryan Kelly zubac Lance Thomas uh Demarcus Nelson Greg paulus these are all guys that were not oneandone guys that stuck stuck around and helped the one and D guys win at Duke Jeremy roach is one of those guys that certainly Jaylen Blakes is yeah Roach commits the foul heres an example of what sets Jeremy roach now a twotime captain at Duke apart hes the first fouryear starter since Kyle Singler way back in 2007 8 9 10 11 thats right because often times if youre starting a Duke for a year or two theres a chance youre off to the NBA but when you think of the great players that have been in this program Through The Years um they poured their heart and soul out on this court and the guys that do stick around now mention Trevor Kels hes played two NBA games two and he left after his freshman year you know what I mean like not begrudging him for going to the NBA thats fine but when you stick around and you weigh it out here for 4 years youre special and when KS decided to go that opened the door for Tyrese Proctor to come from Australia and The Beat Goes On absolutely and as long as Tyrese stays healthy hell be gone in a year Proctor I should say hes off to the league technical foul right here technical foul on Speedy Claxton interesting tonight that we have two coaches at their Alma moders of course Speedy Claxton back in the late 90s early 2000s a 2000 Point score two time America East conference Player of the Year and went on to play a decade in the NBA and of course John shy having played at Duke we talked about the fact that he was a second team AllAmerican and it was neat you talked to him uh this morning about the fact that you know he had a a significant eye injury yeah the summer after he graduated here at Duke and he feels like that did indeed keep him from playing in the NBA I they loved him in Miami you know Eric spoler loved him I I know people in that organization what I like about John Shire you know his dream hes handled adversity you mentioned the eye injury his dream as a high school kid he was a great player one of the greatest players to ever come out of Illinois was to be on One Shining Moment the very first time he was on One Shining Moment Eric mayor of VCU hit a jumper over him and VCU upset Duke in the tournament yeah this gu this guys handled some adversity and Im a huge fan and I think hes going to continue to grow and get better and better yeah 36yearold native of North Brook Illinois he started Glen Brook North High School and caught the eye of another Chicagoland guy Mike sheski yes he did thats so smooth that that jump shot is so smooth and hes just I just love the pace at Tyler Thomass game hasnt forced a lot of shots yeah hes had a relatively quiet second half filipowski misses the three and here is Tyler Thomas the grad student from New Haven Connecticut out of AMD Regional High School loses the handle and theres one of your culture Warriors Jaylen Blakes down to the floor absolutely he spends a lot of time down there he didnt realize that that Thomas was creeping up on him I I think yeah Blakes may be their best Applause defender too easy yep on that Baseline Drive those weak side Defenders are got to start running to the other corner cuz thats where the ball always heads dubar put a careerhigh 30 on Buffalo last month hes up to 23 against Duke as HRA tries to hang around Duke uses a time out well this is called a Baseline Drive Baseline drift and when the ball starts to go Baseline you got to start running to the other side the Closeouts are too late and uh dubar has been really impressive tonight take a look right here great delivery by Carlos thats another assist for the young man young man out of Jefferson High School hes got nine now and remember we said earlier if you just joined us this kid scored 92 and 90 points in separate games at Thomas Jefferson High School wow thats pretty good that is pretty good and you see the uh the onew combination about as good as any in the country they have come together for 36 points tonight Thomas by himself with that 236 number top five nationally and leads the CAA and he is a guy whos going to get a look at the next level and speedy speedy claxon would know that cuz hes an NBA world champion and Speedy spent a number of years scouting for the Golden State Warriors including coming into this building and scouting Kyrie Irving back in the day thats Applause right four on the shot clock filipowski going to have to put it up left it short big big couple possessions now for the pride speeding qua in orchestrating from the sideline they have a butter play give it to Thomas and get the heck out of the way Jay wri was smart enough to do that oh he got the short roll got to look for him Thomas in a tough spot steps through and gets the roll thats legal long as that second put foot doesnt hit the floor I I said this earlier do you see the great footwork the young man has its excellent its apparent as soon as you see him play yeah hes not a great athlete hes just a technician filipowski lost it into the hands of khil farmer big possession farmer gets it back winding down on the 99minute mark Carlos Duke comes away with the stop has it with a ninepoint lead heres Philip powski missed it gets it back and again hes going back to the free throw line this time to shoot a pair of foul shots and Fritz thought he was vertical I kind of did too but uh fishell on the Baseline Mr Cy saw it otherwise good aggressive play by filipowski take a look right here does the arms come down they do good call my bad and so that is number three on yako Fritz the kious grad transfer whats the nickname well you know youre a mat Guy golden Griffin golden Griffin come on you and I have been to the kler center a time or two sure have and not only under the best of circumstances in my case having to coach against John beine a few times yeah were great coaches back then the great skip Crosser John beine Brer at lyola y Ted fiori was great coach St Peters mikee Dean at Sienna all back in the day matching witch with a man to my right Fran Prill Manhattan as I watch hster here I I just love when we used to go to places like this and try to compete with teams like Duke and and the pride have done that tonight well when you were at Manhattan heres a takeaway Blakes going to take it himself when you were at Manhattan who did you pick off on the road oh gosh you know we couldnt get teams to play us we were too good we we we could go to places like this for but this crowd is loving Jaylen breaks defense right now that much I know foul number four against jako Fritz yep poer warrior well coach Shyer told us this afternoon hes the one guy who will go after the opposition for 94t theres no question and thats why hes beloved here scores in transition but its not about the scoring just watch him gets through a screen he knows its a Applause foul I know his coach Joe manner Blair Academy by the way coach Lu Al dang who starred here y pretty proud of that Applause guy roach gives it back to Mitchell finds filipowski whos been hot got it 28 points that is one off his career high against Virginia Tech January Im showing Mark Mitchell that play the first chance I get if Im on the coaching staff gave up to three caught the pass in the pocket swung it to the open man thats great basketball going the other way the foul against hofra and their big man

holiday order your family favorites in the Bojangles app now that tastes like home its bow time hey Doug Ive been talking short Roll All Season lets teach it and Ill show you why its affective particularly for Mark Mitchell heres the pick and roll theyre going to keep the ball on aside and watch this instead of rolling all the way to the basket he short rolls it here and when he catches it he becomes a playmaker now watch instead of the drive its not there he kicks it to the open man thats become a very prevalent play in basketball against pick and roll coverages and guys like Mark Mitchell KJ Adams at Kansas may be the best at it thats where Mark Mitchell can really help this team along with the energy weve seen from him tonight and that setup gives Duke 19 assists for the night on their 26 made field goals and oh by the way Kyle Philip psky has a new career high with four made threes tonight in seven attempts the work seems to be paying off and like you say the stroke does not look broken no he has a good shot hes got so much verse watch him look opposite hes waiting for the double team good pass wide open roach three more for number three oh yeah Im telling you it started Saturday against Charlotte and right now the ball has energy for the Blue Devils eighth assist for filipowski dont look now hes getting closer to a potential triple double theres another rebound for filipowski his 10th rebound so hes two assists shy from a triple double Foster little Runner gets the roll been a quiet night for the Freshman from Harrisburg North Carolina but hes got five now you know what I hes going to be an outstanding player here he plays with I love his uh maturity this kid he was not a McDonalds allamerican and once he was not chosen he was a beast at the end of last season for Sherman Oaks Notre Dame they beat bronny James four times last year britz lost it the lob to the rim gets knocked away Hoster able to save it dubar hammered by Roach probably not a bad foul right there but a little Music sloppy well the Blue Devils going to take a little time off and next time they play will be at Madison Square Garden at Cameron North against the Balor Bears yeah thatll be on ESPN 700 on December the 20th before taking their Christmas break although its a short break the next game will be against Queens on the 30th back here inside Cameron full season begins Saturday with seven games on ESPN ABC and ESPN plus this is the ABC triple header starting at noon Eastern 900 am Pacific Howard in Florida AM then Miami Ohio takes on App State and we finish up with UCLA and boyy state in the starco brands La bowl at Sofi Stadium Miami of Ohio home of arar Sean Woody Hayes Bo shencker frad of coaches there no doubt about it John Harbaugh on and on we go yep Shan McVey also at Miami red used to be the Redskins Im sorry Red Hawks Red Hawks there in Oxford Ohio Kansas Citys Mark Mitchell on the line like the way hes played tonight out of Sunrise Christian Academy and I like the way the pride played for about 206 27 minutes well they led by as many as five late in the first half but that run by Duke right before the intermission is Thomas Bars another three gave him enough separation that gives you the sense Duke has enough to hang on but hosters got enough offense they average 80 points a game and they can get hot yes they Applause Music can roach nice pass with the left hand and no look to set up Mitchell John shy will have some defensive breakdown clips from the first half but hes got nothing to complain about on the offensive end the entire night thats 14 for Applause Music Mitchell now we always say when you pass it the ball has energy and tonight everybodys touching it and the game becomes easy for everyone when you move the ball ball the way Duke has tonight they will have bumps in the road theres no question theres just too much Youth and inexperience here but uh its a growth process for them Thomas missed it with filipowski all over him McCain B three more for the Freshman from Sacramento yeah right now I I I experienced this a few times in my career John shy hes not going to smile but inside hes saying you know what we practiced the last week is starting to pay off its a good feeling for for a head coach well McCain was so good in the win over Charlotte last time out with 21 hes up to 13 Foster has two more hes got seven points in making his second start of the Year again he has moved into the starting lineup for now with Proctor sideline with that ankle injury hes a young man that played on the last oakill Academy team coached by the great Steve Smith before he transferred out to Notre Damon California wide openen Applause farmer Duke with its starting five on the floor get the ball back into the hands of Caleb Applause Foster Mitchell puts it up from three so hard when no ones defending you not to shoot it right it is yep theres a reason hes open but youre up 24 and thats okay hell gain his confidence last year he shot like 34 35 nine points for Fritz just over three minutes to go in regulation Duke looking for its second straight win after dropping backto back games this by the way is the 513th consecutive sellout 9314 as roach Banks it in you know the last time there was a ticket unsold in this building John Shire was 3 years old and who was that opponent Boston College back in 1990 they just didnt want to watch Malcolm Huckabee play Huckabee didnt want to see himself play in this environment he was up against it as a freshman back right after this the buzzer beater

Fran oh Im going to be up I got a got we got a text this morning from Danny Hurley hows Duke looking y know y hes got a little bit invested having his brother star here its also a team that he might see uh in March plenty plenty of fire power here tonight for the dukies filipowski with 28 roach with 19 and the second column is what really catches your attention for both those guys absolutely and for the whole team tonight the ball the ball really moved well and that was something that did not happen in those losses uh to Arkansas and certainly a Georgia Tech of course Tyrese Proctor got hurt early in that game well it looks like filipowski night is done and we get our first look at Shawn Stewart The Freshman from windir Florida number 13 if this is it for filipowski 28 points tied his careerhigh with 10 made field goals 12 rebounds eight assists as a new career high and another new career high by tying having four made threes power is fouled on his drive against Griffin baroo and so power will head to the free throw line hey by the way uh we know HRA you know they were pretty good for about 28 30 minutes that League you see that UNC w beat Kentucky Kentucky right at rup yep at rup Drexel beat Villanova at V I believe that was at Villanova I know it was part of the big big five but Monmouth beat West Virginia yeah there it is right there yeah my man Zach Spiker doing a great job at drexell well again coming into the year Charleston was picked as the number one Im not sure necessarily theyre going to be the the team to beat but UNCW was two D Drexel was three these HRA Pride was pick number four but once again thats a a deep League at the top especially yeah no question terrific young coaches in that league and its the coastal Athletic Association now got it man keyn Robinson The Freshman from aapka Florida out of W uh waka high school with his first three points I thought we would have seen more of him tonight but Speedy eled to go with the veterans yeah theyre really high on him they think hes got a big future as maybe the next really really good guard at hofra Foster picking up the offense in the second half now has nine North Carolina kid love his work ethic hes a gy rat dad spent 30 years in Charlotte area as a police officer and hes one of those guys that I believe is going to be a culture Warrior dont see one and done for him right now certainly again you borrowed that phrase from somebody Joe Manna the coach at BL Academy Im not going to go around stealing people stuff here okay you had a confession to me I did hes a great coach hes had Royale ivy in the NBA hes had final minute The Crazies have had a good time watching their team especially on the offensive end here tonight couple freshman guards getting on the board Farmer for scoring now time out to get more reserves into the game Neil begovic the grad transfer from Stanford gets in Spencer Hub the senior from Los Angeles will get his opportunity to play theres number 55 in white out of Harvard Westlake High School youve got to feed the WalkOns you know my you know what you know what the key to WalkOns are first of all they must be all conference academic yes nobody wants a 24 GPA thats why coach beheim didnt keep me as a walk on exactly you werent you werent smart enough the second thing you have to do is you have to have a car so you could take your teammates who dont have a car to Walmart on Sunday for the toilet paper and the topace yes and then the third thing is whenever the scholarship guys want to be in the gym you go in the gym with them and you dont have to shoot just Music pass foul on the shot will send Robinson to the free throw line but begovic and hubber were very actively involved in the Scout they they their Scout walk through is very detailed and uh Spencer hubber man playing the role of Carlos well Jay Lucas the assistant for Duke had the Scout at their shoot around this afternoon see Spencer yeah yeah they got a great young staff they do Chris Carell was in the gleague hes an excellent coach weve added Emanuel dildy William Avery Jay Lucas shot clocks off hubard probably wont shoot but Im rooting for him to Applause n well Duke struggled in the first half defensively had a big push right before the break and then in the second half never really looked back no hster had
