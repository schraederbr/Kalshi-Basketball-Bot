7 and 13 in the conference Georgia Tech at 14 17 and they may have only won seven in conference play but they can be very very dangerous as we are underway Notre Dame wins the opening tip BT Smith Ry Stein and Jamal Spearman are our officials today here for game one down on the low block Davis will get the touch 69 sophomore Shrewsbury outside anytime it goes inside theyre looking back outside to Shrewsberry and to Burton and is really good off the dribble Burton with a shot clock winding down to five going Cross Court Davis has to attack in the lane tiptoeing through and a nice move to get it started as we look at the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets under Damon stanmire theyre starting five including Nathan George who runs the point and Miles Kelly their top score at 14 a game Miles Kelly can put up over 30 in a game in fact he had 36 earlier this year against Louisville though they do scuffle the shoot at Just 4 2 33 beyond the threepoint line andanga going down the lane and he will lay it in the 69 freshman and youre going to see a lot of that today that pick and roll and then a pocket pass into the middle of the floor and nango is really good in that little short roll situation you got to have your hand low make him throw the ball in the air instead of that bounce pass pocket Notre Dame in a rebuild year but they got Burton to stay home jumping in Davis cant finish it comes free in the corner and deflected out of bounds itll stay on this end M Shrewsbury year number one for Notre Dame and hoping to duplicate the Run he had last year at Penn State when he led the NY Lions to the Big 10 tournament championship game as a number 10 seed that Penn State team was really good jayen picket Seth Lundy Andrew Funk those guys could really shoot it Jaylen picket picket one of the most versatile players in the country Davis very active in these opening seconds Shrewsbury tough and Ang Le shot and somehow got it to go well Bren Shrewsberry had 25 points at Georgia Tech he made five of nine from three what a move look at the scoop by wayy Reeves on the other end going to the opposite side of the iron for two transferred in from Florida averaging over 10 points per game and hes really shot the ball well in ACC play over 41 from Three Irish as Jay mentioned knocking off Georgia Tech in both meetings they were both very close the yellow jackets played a ton of close games Davis is off to a great start he Nails a triple thats only his seventh made three of the season for Tay Davis but he had 17 points against Georgia Tech in Notre Dames home game where they won they won both of them but they won them in different ways Kelly up top hell swing it for the wing jumper and thatll be offt Target by Reeds a rebounding G can be so important in this game Georgia Tech did not rebound the ball well against Notre Dame in that second game they gave up 16 offensive rebounds and that was a Crusher in a really close game the Pari up top you saw how he handles the ball at 69 and a block and a foul thatll go against Booth KY Reeves is an athletic Wing played two years at Florida not quite Julius Irving against the Lakers in 1980 but pretty darn close not bad what a nice finish and then at the other end just w wide open because Tay Davis is not a proficient threepoint shooter he only shoots about 16 coming into this one hed only made six they gave him a little bit more room and he took advantage of it gari at the line deis Damar head coach for the yellow jackets the former AllAmerican at Arizona and was assistant coach with the Celtics before returning to college basketball both of these head coaches spend time on the sidelines for the Celtics number two for kapari and hell drop that one in I confident in saying this about Tara kapari he is the only player in this tournament that has significant Cricket experience thats a deep dive heres Burton got it from threepoint land as we mentioned he stayed home to play a Notre Dame and was named the ACC rookie of the year theres another one of those pocket passes right in the middle of the floor and then Dongo needs to get all the way to the basket if he can on those or be a playmaker out of it its going to be a travel on tay Davis so he will turn it over 1647 to go here in the first half game number one of the ACC tournament back to that pocket pass yeah you have to have a hand low here well this is Burton knocking down the three just stepping back he may be small but hes got a ton of game plays angles really well and hes really improved his game his decisions are better its slowed down hes starting to give the ball up a little bit more now than feeling like he has to do everything himself George running the point for the yellow jackets hell Loft that one up there Booth grabbing a rebound Fighting Irish 11 and8 all time in the ACC tournament they reached the final twice and won it under Mike Bray in 2015 in a magical run Burton off the fake Georgia Tech switching a lot of these actions good fake and swishes it in hes got some game hes really improved that pullup game he can really get to the rim but now when hes facing defenses his middle game has really improved this is a big time pullup little step back the shot fake let the defender fly by and thats not an easy little short Corner shot but he made it look easy what a start for Notre Dame as we mentioned staying home M Walker right down the road there from South Ben 535 points in the regular season thats a freshman record for Notre Dame so his career off to a terrific start and a quick whistle here and we will have a timeout Notre Dame shooting it well five defensive rebounds they gave up in that second game against Notre Dame that was the difference in the game Irish get it into rer up top for Burton by the way is also number six and assists and number four in steals and the conference he does it all guy getting that big rebound underneath will kick it out for a second effort and thats the kind of thing we were just talking about Georgia Tech did a good job their first shot defense was good but they give up an offensive board bton oh pretty shot slamming on the brakes hes lightning quick hes got a ton of game and hes playing totally under control he had the ball in his hands all the time in high school but now he gives it up really impressive to watch at a 31point game against w forest gari and a whistle with 1550 left in the half and Burton already putting on a bit of a sh this is a playmaking point guard waits to get the screen and hes got that first of speed gave a a little pass fake watch the little pass fake he gives here and that got the defense just to bite a little bit capari goes for that fake and that allowed Burton to get that shot off now Burtons on a personal seven nothing run as the Irish have open it up 14 to5 jumper on the way and that clangs high off the side of the backboard by Dango roer moving into the paint double fake battling for the rebound and a tie up on the play and The Possession ER will take it to the other Applause end Notre Dame is an interesting defensive team theyre ranked in the top 30 in the country in defensive metrics they dont play packline its not quite like Virginias defense but there are some packline principles and youll notice that theyre really packed into the lane and then theyll recover out to Applause Shooters and Dogo up top theyll swing it here for stur its been around a long time for the yellow jackets long one coming by Kelly whos been quiet so far certainly a high volume shooter for Georgia Tech they have missed their last five shots and a whistle foul with 1425 to go that was a smart play by Burton he knew that Sturman was going to have a hard time getting legal guarding position in transition and just took it right into the middle of the lane and right into his body to pick up that foul the Irish beating Georgia Tech in both meetings this season they were both close one was overtime in Atlanta 7568 and the game in South Bend was decided by three points 58 55 and they were both different I mean the first game Georgia Techs turnovers were the problem in the second game their inability to grab a defensive rebound theres Shrewsberry and hes really good at coming off screens and setting his feet an excellent threepoint shooter when he when he does that when his shot prep is really good he can shoot it and coachs son was the star in the victory over Georgia Tech at Notre Damia 25 on the drive and thats going to roll in on a smooth move by Kelly who gets on the board and hell head to the line looking for a threepoint play Miles Kelly can really can really score does a great job of avoiding the defense and now lets lets take a look here at Shrewsberry and just watches movement off the ball he goes from slow to fast comes around that staggered screen and sets his feet so quickly just really good work and early work by Braden Shrewsberry had some big games he was five for nine with 33s and the overtime Victory against Georgia Tech he can nail that long shot he had 23 in a victory over Louisville as well and a Time on the floor 1355 left in a half and maybe a little Blood on the floor I think thats what theyre mopping up here indeed that is the case Dave it is not the ACC tournament unless theres blood on the floor thats for sure you were talking to this before we tipped off today about how much you love this event and this has been such a spectacular event over the years its been great viewing whether youre you know here in person or watching on television and I know things have changed over the years I get it but when I played a million years ago the ACC Champion was the tournament champion there was no such thing as a regular season Championship you you could finish first but you werent recognized as the ACC Champion everybody came to whether its Greensboro or Atlanta or Washington DC at that time and they competed their tals off for this this tournament title and I think its still really meaningful obviously its more difficult if you have to play on Tuesday or Wednesday to go ahead and win this thing but especially for Georgia Tech and Notre Dame these are really meaningful games I mean both Damon STM and Micah Shrewsberry trying to build programs and these are are forward looking games for them to play theyre trying to establish something and I think theyre both doing a really good job of it its tournament basketball yeah I mean whats better than this J of top little hand off for Burton Booth will launch a long one got a good look well thats really good action Burton got a screen then came off a little handoff and the screener Booth was the one who was wide open the initial screener good pass Dongo will give it up and that one nothing but net feathery Touch by Nathan George not a big score itss about nine a game but he can do damage that was a great play by indongo he knew he couldnt get all the way to the basket came to a twofooted jump stop through the defense and then was a playmaker looking out to George for that wide open three that was a big time play by indongo good pass kesn now into the game gets into the paint Roper too strong and a foul underneath and rebounding action 17 to 10 Notre Dame now watch this play by Bayon Dango when he catches the ball he catches it in a short roll so hell come set the screen then rolls and comes to a twoof foot and jumps off look everybody around him all four Irish Defenders off the ball are in the lane and he did a really good job of looking opposite to find Nathan George for that wide open jumper boo just picked up his second foul for the Fighting Irish Georgia Tech grabbing some momentum here start it gets a look straight on cant ask for better than that Notre Dame comes away with the rebound well in the last few possessions Georgia Tech seems to have slowed down a little bit on offense and theyre getting better shots that was a really good shot just didnt make it Stant with his second foul a senior on of Norcross Georgia Sturman was the starting point guard last year and hes been really helpful I think to Nathan George sort of been a big brother to him and has put his arm around him and really helped him develop as a point guard and a leader now Sturman coming off the bench he received a ton of votes for the ACC 6man hes their best foul shooter too should have come down to that in the final seconds Himes into the game shrewbury will give it up mat Zona also in now to 69 senior another guys been around forever swung here for Davis shot clock inside boed they move it beautifully and Zona knocks it down boy it looked like Davis was going to come off that action to his right hand drive he is a right driver but found Zona wide open that was a beautiful pass St him again getting Airborne theyll swing for the corner Kelly rebound tipped and controlled by IMS M Dame quick to the other end of the floor but cant get it done Davis with a Miss he got off to such a quick start its a really good challenge at The Rim by indongo thats a traveling Music violation against Georgia Tech moment trying to avoid a third defeat at the hands of to the Irish its so difficult as the old Saiyan goes to beat anybody three times in one season well see about today a zoom action a screen into a handoff good pass Zona downstairs trying to wriggle free nicely done how about the patience of Matt Zona when he caught that ball he didnt go up right away just let everything clear let all the traffic clear until he had oneonone in the post underneath Senor move there big body at 69 Music Applause George looking to get inside cant do Applause it into the paint Claude will finish that one John Claud 68 senior Grant transfer from Western Carolina his first bucket well that was a nice pass by gari took it down to the Baseline basically jumped out of bounds with two Defenders off Irish trying to build on their lead Zona with the fake is Burton shot clock to nine hes going to take a long one and swish it in a threepointer well he just stopped on a dime there and the defense just flew by they couldnt stop with them Marcus Burton 10 points to lead all scorers he is playing like the ACC Rookie of the Year George little bump there no whistle hell find the window for two well that was two outstanding freshman point guards going against one another and Marcus Burton initially did a great job of staying in front but George just pivoted around him that was not an easy shot but he made it look easy George hit the game winning shot when they took down North Carolina in the final seconds a good switch out by Claude because Burton was coming off ready to shoot that thing air mailed by Davis and after a hot start he certainly cooled off aari jumping into the lane will kick it out George is the open shooter and knocks in a threepointer another really good pass you mentioned Nathan George had that 16 points against Carolina including the game winner he also had 20 against Clemson hes been really good in ACC play hes averaging about 10 points and five assists tournament starting right here with this game between the 12 and 13 seeds Davis slicing inside and theyre going to wave that off theyre going to count that basket because that was touched by Georgia Tech count that hoop Music saf Fara gari started the last eight games for Georgia Tech just gives a little Euro and kicks it right out and Nathan George had more time to shoot than he gets in a horse game but look at that stop move by Marcus Burton just backs up a little bit blows a little kiss and tells everybody to shut up Stan out for George looking for a lane to kick here kapar likes to move with it good recovery by Notre Dame defensively stolen away by roer Burton fires got it hes had a terrific first half hes on fire and rer made a great pass there good Vision to Im sure Burton yelled that he was open behind him but thats a heck of a play in transition Burton is playing with so much energy on both ends of the floor from the corner gari short rebound Tapped Out high and another chance here for the yellow jackets down 298 boy smart play by Reeds he couldnt grab it just knock it to a teammate St that one almost went beyond mid court but he saved it shot clock at seven Reeves who has made the shot of this first game so far George has to heave it up there he hits the three with a shot clock winding Music down were seeing two good young point guards go against each other right now Burton is getting a little bit of the better of it but Nathan George is making his name known in this game yeah he has 11 the rookie from Toronto going toe to Toe with Burton a good job by sturen to stay with Shrewsberry on that cut Roper shot clock of factor down to four hes going to have to fire and hits the three its almost like the shot clock going down is freeing for these guys yes little more urgency Dango slicing in will drop in the bucket well thats a tough one for Bron Tru Perry to have to try to stop but and dangos really good in that little middle pick and roll where he can just roll right to the basket his feet are good that was a a quality finish by Dongo at 21 against Duke also five rebounds and four blocks that kind of felt like a coming on party for him he was Unstoppable in the middle pick and roll in that game Burton with a Fall Away off the iron and Georgia Tech will take over possession 3223 Notre Dame whats say get old and stay old well that doesnt apply to the Notre Dame back court right now these are two freshmen and theyre very talented and theyre only going to get better from here and theyre really good now Nathan George has been getting it done certainly for the yellow jackets gari in close not there for him rebounded away by Booth well gaps got a lot of ability and hes only going to get Applause better Burton High up on the wing Shrewsbury midrange range gets it to go that was really pretty a great job by Burton to use that ball screen and then execute the throwback back to the side that he came from and when Shrewsberry caught it gave a little shot fake and that fake was really important in getting that shot George will fire too strong this time Booth another rebound hes really giving Notre Dame a big lift coming off the bench crashing his glass the son of Calvin Booth the Penn State great spent a lot of years in the NBA also an NBA executive bur off the front of the iron one and done yellow jacket is trying to creep a little bit closer George has kind of put the team on his back but inongo getting inside with lay in two thats amazing that was the first shot I think that Notre Dames take in that was questionable and it leads to an easy bucket on the other end its amazing how that works your offense and your defense are connected and you take a questionable or bad shot it puts your defense in a bad spot good pass guy trying to wriggle free hell draw the foul with 508 remaining in a half take a look at this action Marcus Burton coming off that little ball screen just throws back on the shake action and that little shot fake was really important in getting that drive and it was a a terrific floater over the outstretched arms of a Defender Bren Shrewsberry has got a lot of game Kevin ji at the line 75 foul shooter Kelsey Luke Joel and Carlos coming way nothing but net all day between games then they wrap up day one of the tournament after the last game on ACCC Network a terrific crew led by the great Kelsey Rigs and Natalie a tired group oh you didnt know any better youd think there were three Bankers that took the afternoon off to come watch the game 36 25 Luke Hancock ACC legend that never played the ACC he played in the Big Applause East Kelly up high here for George under five minutes to go before the break that crossover slapped Away by Burton he races out in front hell kick it out loose on the Baseline and itll stay right here with 441 going in the half how about the hands Dave on Marcus Burton to get that steal he tried to keep Nathan George out of the middle George was still able to get there but if he shows the ball a little bit Marcus Burtons going to take it from him Burton has his hands all over this thing in the first half for the Fighting Irish thought about taking a three there George came out to guard him Music kzne OD Dame has played a stout first half trying to add to that Davis bulling his way inside will draw another foul and Davis will be off to the line to shoot fouled by kapari thats number two on the 69ine sophomore that was a smart play by Davis to take the ball back out looked like he was going to go for a little handoff action but take a look at Marcus buron here watch these hands just knocking it away just off the leg of Nathan George and all of a sudden Notre Dame is getting out in transition as a result so gapar will head to the bench here again a couple of personal files for him round number one of the ACC Tournament game number one Georgia Tech and Notre Dame meeting for the third time this season I think Davis really likes playing against Georgia Tech hes averaging 13 points eight rebounds shooting 55 in the two games against the yellow jackets coming into this one Kyle Sturman gives it up Dongo got a look couldnt hit Applause it tough catch there by GI and two on the other end Notre Dame and that brings on a timeout Notre Dame is really hurting has been fantastic 13 points four assists a steal and not a single turnover in this game dazzling start to the tournament for him Notre Dame looking pretty comfortable at the moment yeah thats something that the Georgia Tech defense has to remedy theyve got to make Notre Dame uncomfortable because thats a when you say and youre right that Notre Dames been comfortable you know thats on the Notre thats on the Georgia Tech defense to make them uncomfortable they havent done that until now yes picked off by and Dango The rangy Freshman I think thats just a second turnover for Notre Dame and really the first live ball turnover George on the attack pushes it up there and it rolls off the 10 theyll get a second try Kellys been very quiet so far for the yellow jackets they need him badly stur ofan on the spin for two Kyle Sturman can make things happen I think we mentioned he was a starting point guard last year got a lot of experience nothing really phases him never change his expression on the court but he needs to get as involved as he can offensively especially if Miles Kelly is struggling really good distributor Applause too Burton approaching two and A2 minutes to go and the first half hell fire another one and add to it give him 15 here in the first half six for nine shooting he just has every counter doo ah rolled a lot on on that iron but he got it to go Music 4129 hes set a solid half with eight points but the yellow jackets need to find somebody else Burton on the double dribbles out of that Applause Music Applause Davis a hand off back to Burton it spits free he hits the deck and wins it back the possession arrow keeping it here with seven on that shot clock when that play occurred but hes also quick getting down he is and he you know hes small so he can stay low to the ground but just good hands by Georgia tekon knocked that away as he tried to split Defenders so Logan Imes The Freshman will check it Applause in by Applause Shrewsbury and hits a two he is a tough shot maker and he has not had very many easy shots in this game to your point but the fact that he can make these little Runners and the midrange shots is really important cuz hes such a good longrange shooter Kelly drawing the contact on Imes will be headed to the line not name 43 points already Bren shrs got 73 made threes on the season including one today thats ninth in the league but that shot fake having Dongo go right by so he can just step through thats a really nice play and shows good Poise Under Pressure not Dame sizzling 63 Kelly at the line all ACC honorable mention the sophomore out of ston Mountain Georgia but Notre Dame with the 43 points thats a season high for a first half this season for the Irish I think thats going to be brought up at Halftime by Damon stmy and his staff is this how can we give up this many points to Notre Dame we got to get tighter defensively and make a Applause Music stand so 90 seconds before halftime here at Capital One Arena Washington DC the ACC tournament starting with this game between the 12 and 13 seeds much better pressure and resistance by Notre Dame forced a a turnover on the walk but they pushed Notre Dame further out on the floor made things more difficult with their ball pressure and getting into passing Lanes I got to get one of those shirts is that a medium you could pull that off I could not I couldnt pull that off when I could pull it off 4331 and another whistle in the paint and a foul here against Notre Dame as p and Dango goes in strong so he will be headed to the line with a minute six 11 and shooting to The Freshman from Sagal hits 66 at the foul line hes their number one rebounder with 80 game tomorrow night in the ACC network sofball coverage continues number 18 Florida State hosting number 15 Alabama the ESPN F place to get it seals are w six to the last seven and number seven Wake Forest taking on number 17 Virginia second game of the three game series baseball coming way covered Saturday at 400 Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app I love watching softball and let me ask you this as a Major League Baseball Enthusiast if you put some of the best major league hitters having to step into the batter box in a softball game how would they do do hitting that stuff I think theyd be very uncomfortable at those speeds very uncomfortable it would take a little adjustment Shrewsbury slamming on the brakes crowd wanted to travel KI on the Baseline with the rebound and two for him right the offensive class pass has really hurt Georgia Tech not just in this game but in the last game that jackets played against Notre Dame they got to finish defensive possessions with a Applause rebound Kelly wal off up to George 10 seconds to get off a shot 20 seconds left in the half good job by Notre Dame to ice that ball screen action keep it on the right side and Dango floating inside again got it often time it did catch some of the iron there and a whistle with 98 well kesn did a nice job being there to form a little wall in front of the basket when indongo was rolling to the basket but just a really good offensive rebound by George ATT teack Julian roers second personal and Bay and Dongo to the line hes had six double doubles this season bad for the freshman at all but he just missed four others by one rebound and he can get to that iron hes also a a good post Defender and probably at his best as a weak side shot Applause blocker gari back on the floor for the yellow jackets 69 sophomore another free throw coming here for and Dango Applause not to Dame with an opportunity to get off a decent shot should they get the ball back and they will you would think that Georgia Techs going to press Up full court here and they do at least try to slow the advance if not get a turnover you just dont want to take any chances going to leave somebody open from three but Georgia Tech needs a stop here you want to keep this only to 10 points its not been a great first half hes and its deflected out 75 so the Irish will retain possession as we close in on halftime somebody needs to go long here gapar is back and thats going to roll out Notre Dame turns it over just a little bit too bunched up and now Georgia Tech is going to have have a chance to get this under 10 its right through the legs 64 seconds to get up a shot here for the yellow jackets it has been Notre Dames half but the yellow jackets with a chance here and Dongo a Fall Away final seconds that ticks away and its 4535 at the break no different to me uh Notre Dame a month ago they theyve continued to get better and one of the things that struck me whether youre talking to Micah Shrewsberry or Cal getter one of his assistants they talk about the fact that when they go to practice every day youd never know you know that theyd lost seven games in a row at one point they jeez and Nathan George starts the second half just as hot as the first so give him 14 if he just tuning in this is the third meeting of the Season between the two Notre Dame won the first couple but very close games one of them went overtime heres Burton with his first touch of the second half Shrewsbury yes sir a threepointer how impress impressive is the movement off the ball of Braden Shrewsberry I mean he came all the way from the left side of the floor to get over into the vision of Marcus Burton as he dribbled that ball into the paint thats a guy who looks like a different player than much of the regular season where he averaged 10 points a game you could see that going through the roof next year what a back court that Notre Dame is establishing with these two look pass yeah Davis got it to go Burton kind of stumbled through the lane but then a beautiful give Dre two Defenders that little right hand wraparound pass that was beautiful he also has six assists along with all scoring so he is flat doing it all and Dongo off the iron with that one could not finish may he got away with a little extra step just getting started second half here at Capital One Arena game number one of the ACC tournament on the roll Shais going to draw the foul as he is hit by gari will pick up the personal take a look at oh I hit the wrong guy take a look at Shrewsberry right here and watch him now theyre two guys that uh that I screwed that up but Shrewsberry comes all the way from one side to another Davis gave him a little screen there at the end to get him open and then Marcus Burton draws two Defenders little wraparound P Beautiful Finish By Davis well when youve got two guards like Shrewsberry and Burton you know the other guys can really take advantage of it because they draw so much defensive attention and if you set a screen and then you look to score immediately after that screen its just just screen think screen score youre going to find yourself wide open K giant knocks him down Notre Dames getting a little bit of offense from a number of different guys in big offense from Marcus Burton and Braden shrewbury theyre young but gifted back court and theyve opened up a 5238 lead so the yellow jackets need to find an answer pretty quickly and Notre Dame defense has been packed in and at times it can look like a Zone because Georgia Tech is not getting a lot of movement so cament gets the pass away Coleman inside and the big fell will finish that Dongo with the basket for a good drive by Coleman and a nice little pass and give indongo credit for making himself available right in the middle anytime theres a Baseline Drive as a big guy you want to get to the front of the rim Bay andanga with 14 Shrewsbury with a quick release and a three its barely in his hands Jay and he was fading to his right when he took that that was not a your standard you know come off a screen go straight up and down and the answer by Reeves who has the basket of the game on a beautiful baletic reverse in the first half but only four points so far I love the use of the term baletic you brought up Julius Irving in the moment maybe not quite Dr J but it was it was a lovely play when I bring up Dr J is that just exposing my age yours and mine the two of us together we know exactly where to go with that one 5542 the dirt naap is next yes and a whistle theyre going inside to and Dogo over and over 5542 now watch Shrewsberry again coming off the the screen by J just ready to shoot it and still kind of fading a little bit to get away from the defense but that ball was not in his hands very long and hes got double figure scoring hes probably only had the ball in his hands for for about 12 seconds total man he has made some shots so back to the line by andanga The 69ine Freshman Shrewsbury came in averaging 10 points a game he going to blow right by that 75 threepointers made and the second most among D1 freshman playing for his dad and Dongo second got that and Dongo another freshman whos had a really good year he was voted on to the ACC all freshman team as was Marcus Burton the ACC Rookie of the Year its Notre Dames first ACC rookie of the year theyve had a couple Big East rookies back in those days they went a long time as an independent Burton trying to penetrate in the lane oh its blocked by indongo he also took four steps did George trying to convert on the other and that rolls off the Applause 10 rer open from three fight for the yeah he got up there and Dango again penetrating Sturman lost it just had nowhere to go Burton Quick Step itll be short out of the corner Dongo is going to wind up with a big statistical game win or lose but the yellow jackets another rebound for him and now Georgia Tech slowing down to Tempo theres that little pocket pass and and Dongo usually so good out of that but went to the left hand just couldnt complete it hes going to be late getting back into the play Burton over the top thats knocked away a fight for it out of bounds it goes itll be Notre Dame ball right up against the break here transfers to Arizona RJ Davis the ACC Player of the Year and Caleb love the Pack 12 player the year thats remarkable incredible Burton bottled up in the double and a reach in here and going to separate these guys as roer and George kind of go toetotoe Applause and Jamal Spearman getting right in between them quickly along with Ramy Steins and BT Smith the officiating crew here for game number one and they are going to go to the monitor Applause here I think they call a cylinder foul here before it was tied Applause up and theyre going to see if they need to rule on a little something extra after the play as well I think they called the technical foul on Roper oddly enough but the George was in the cylinder early and I think thats what they called but rer came in and pushed Nathan George back and I think thats what drew it technical at least from what I could tell yes that was the case so that goes against Julian roer and Sturdivant will go to the line here for jul attack and shoot with 1533 to go just getting underway here in the second half Yellow Jackets the 13 seed Notre Dame the 12 seed and both schools in rebuilding mode the El has come to Washington as a dangerous team they W for their last six Notre Dame has to this point outplayed Applause them start of it makes 88 that he front rim the first theyll get another one Applause here Notre Dame with 19 losses but they also have come in playing some pretty good basketball he certainly showed it in the first half bridet Tech had the better of it at the line 10 out of 13 and Notre Dame five for six and thats got to be uplifting for Micah Shrewsberry that even though his team out of contention for the NCAA tournament unless they were to win the ACC tournament championship and the automatic bid that his team has has still been striving to get better well getting behind his talented freshman is one way to do that in a hurry thats going to Bean offensive and you have to know when youre setting that screen that after you know technical fouls been called things got a little bit chippy that the referees are going to clamp down a little bit more right away and Matt Zona just throwing a little bit too much into this leaning in and catching George with that left leg I think one of the things that surprised both you and I given the shooting numbers for both schools coming into this game is they both shot it well certainly Notre Dame did in the first half second halfs have been a choppy performance Burton f throttle and hell draw the foul Bo it is tough to keep up with this kid he got to great speed but the bounce of that ball went back toward the NRE Dame basket and really helped start that break but you got to give credit to Marcus Burton for sticking his nose in there and getting in the lane to grab a rebound and then he just body seeks even though hes smaller hes not trying to avoid contact he creates it and because Miles Kelly didnt have legal guarding position that contact is a foul so give the youngsters 16 DJ Burns NC State theyre coming up next he is in the house that is a presence well you use the term Baltic and thats a big guy with a ballerinas feet his footwork is excellent last time you and I saw him he was pouring in 25 points against the Duke Blue Devils yeah Duke did a really good job of pressing up on everybody else they didnt give double coverage to DJ Burns and he lit him up but it wasnt enough Kelly catches fires not there for him rebounds tap to IMS Notre Dame looking to extend their lead now on top 5744 reaching in Coleman Pride it free to give off for Claude to the stop a really nice pass by Coleman just caught Claude out of the corner of his eye coming down the middle caught Claude out of the corner well done Applause Zona looking for a guard Zona rolling to the free throw line trying to back down right into a double can he get free does Booth with the shot and hits the triple thats a a couple of times in this game that Matt zon has shown really good Poise when hes been facing a cluster of Georgia Tech Defenders inside Sturman leans in little iron and it drops it nice touch I think Notre D or excuse me Georgia Tech has to do a better job of getting that ball into the paint and playing out of it youre not going to just wind shield wiper around the perimeter you got to get a piece of that paint Im hitting the deck tied up theyre going to keep the basketball here in the possession arrow Now Matt Zona gets the ball into the middle draws two Defenders he could have walked there but able to kick it out actually it looked like did take some steps so Logan Imes The Freshman from Indiana trying to get it in he does for Applause Music Burton Burton another double on him gets free do a good job swinging it here boo with a slam as he went up into the rafter to jam this one down great shot fake an excellent ball reversal out of the double up top Coleman too strong air mails it and itll be Notre Dame ball here with 1318 left this is how you handle a double team just dribble out of it and reverse the ball and when Booth catches it that shot fake made the play and opened up the middle and Carri Buu is a freshman another talented freshman had a 179 rebound Jem against Virginia so another youngster is really capable of lighting it up on dunks like that well his last two games coming into this one he was four of 15 from the field but he was really good I thought his best game was against Wake Forest he had 15 points and five rebounds against the deacons mat zone of the senior back to the Freshman Burton TR to get the ball out of his hands and cant do it and a shove as hes fouled with exactly 13 minutes to play back to that slam the reversal was excellent and your closing out just gave a little shot fake Coleman comes up and then just opens up the middle for Carri Booth Miles Kelly third foul Zona swish it in from threepoint distance thats his 13th made three of the year and Notre Dame has shot the ball extraordinarily well in this already from threepoint range in this game theres still a long way to go another freshman for the yellow jackets Bay and Dango he has 15 hes got it up high now for the yellow jackets they desperately need a run right here basketball free George Will scoop it Applause up hes in attack mode and the kicked sturdivan yes boy they needed that one they did and the broken play with Nathan George getting into the lane sturdivan wide open in the corner boy was he ready to shoot now Georgia Tech pressing Up full court yellow jackets have to make something happen Applause Music defensively Zona with a three Davis plucks away to rebound right back in there will draw the whistle hes headed to the line to shoot two that was good action by Notre Dame with a screen from Davis in order to free up Matt Zona for that shot but Davis after he got the offensive rebound boy that was a big step with the left foot to go up with the left hand and get fouled Davis sophomore out of Indianapolis whos huge in their victory over Virginia in December he had 17 points 14 in the second half along with nine rebounds transferred in from Sean Hall in one of the games against Georgia Tech banked in a three and I know among the things youre looking forward to here in Washington in this tournament aside from Dan shman coming back to join you at your elbow is going to be watching Virginia and how they manage this tournament oddly enough with the start that Virginia got off to this season you know Joe lardy has them right near the cut line so I think Virginia needs to win Kelly in and out what a rebound big rebound by gari Kelly with a second effort tough bounce in the lane and a whistle and Dongo is desperate to finish that but hell be back to the line so we have 1145 remaining in this one Georgia Tech need foul lets be smart they have to Value their offensive possessions you if Notre Dame can continues to run good offense and get good shots a comeback is improbable for Georgia Tech the only thing that can help them is fouls he said 66 51 and Dongo another foul shot gets that Applause one and now more pressure here by the yellow jackets how about Marcus Burton catching that ball in a cofin corner and getting rid of it right away benni had it knocked away and Georgia Tech touched it last Notre Dame two places you dont want it right here in the corner where you get trapped but Burton got rid of it right away and kesn picks up his dribble right past midcourt and youre just going to get trapped again cant pick your dribble up there offensive again with 1133 to go goes against the Irish and against Burton they got him on that little screen looked like he used his elbow instead of just his body and michah Shrewsberry is probably saying didnt I just say no fouls right he just leans in uses that left Music Applause elbow the first half was very fluid that has not been the case in the second half but Notre Dame continues to shoot the ball extremely well dumped down for and Dango and he will drop in two well kapari getting a piece of the paint and theres another catching it in the wrong spot you cannot catch the ball there you do get it free to Burton into the paint with the kick Booth will fire well short and is this the opening that the yellow jackets require to climb back in this thing the full court pressure speeding the tempo and as a result Notre Dame wound up taking a quick shot George on the drive difficult pass and another whistle and time and time again able to get it downstairs kapari this time will draw the foul and Notre Dame really needs to do a good job of keeping that ball out of the paint for the most part theyve kept their defense tight and made it difficult you know for the most most of the game Georgia Tech has seen bodies and not wood they they dont see a lot of openings but the last few possessions theyve been able to get it into the paint a little bit easier gari 67 leading this team in Block shots and back on the floor now is Logan Imes another freshman for Micah shrewbury he is leaning on his kids as hes had to do all season long and his son one of those guys most prominently raen Shrewsbury has had a really fine game hellow jackets make them both and once again with intent and gari able to be on the ball with that length make it difficult to get it in good decision to bring it back out boy Burton makes a lot of those kind of decisions I think his decision making has really improved over the course of the how you going to stay with that are you kidding oh my I he just took him right then crossed over left and back and as long as gari is hes not stand with that andgo finding Kelly for a long one he swishes in a threepointer well you cant get caught in no mans there Land There When Georgia Tech gets it in the paint youve got to stay with Miles Kelly cuz hes a good shooter Shrewsbury quickly across midcourt Reeves will try that move again that he had in the first half that really lit everybody up G there going for that move take a look at this crossover move he just left kapari in the dirt there and then you you get stuck right here in no mans land ims trying to take away that little Baseline pass but there was somebody else there you got to worry more about the threepoint line especially when you have a lead like this thats just too much ground to have to cover on a close out so Kevin J shooting 610 sophomore now David help side defense generally the further your man is away from the ball the more you can help but you certainly have to move as the ball moves and get back to threepoint Shooters the threepoint line changes everything in your health defense smooth touch there for the big fella to make it 70 to 59 and Doo with a kick out Sturman long one in and out another big rebound and the Finish AAR downstairs and he can be a load at 69 especially with that length that was a terrific rebound but again getting the ball in the paints from the key Tapped Out by sturdivan it will be Notre Dame ball as they continue to press on the Georgia Tech side and one thing Notre Dame cant do is they cant get just keep running through the Baseline cuz they catch it its an immediate trap youve got to take your man to the Baseline then go the other way and you can get on the Run and break this pressure shur to check it in against gari who can leap Burton poked away and a foul here against the Irish a terrific job by Miles Kelly to knock that ball away Burton had it in his right hand and when he was going by Kelly just reached out with his right hand and knocked it away little for pressure theyve sped up Notre Dame and now you knock these two free throws in all of a sudden theres a lot more game pressure on Notre Dame Kyle Stan making number one so Damon stom Mars team trying to Rally theyre doing that right now and theyre making their foul shots Sturman their best guy at the line almost 90 And he makes the pair dont look now this is a sevenpoint game and the full court pressure with kapari on the ball still in force and its speeding Notre Dame up a little Applause Music bit back for Marcus Burton whos been the unquestioned star in this game Irish suddenly need his offense again got a switch got a step back cant fire it good job by kapar kapari to stay down on that fake Davis getting it up there but a misfire and that never touched the iron so that goes back over to the yellow jackets a good stand by George attack well you get these stops and followed up with scores and all of a sudden there a different look on the Notre Dame players faces right now and a furrowed brow from Micah Shrewsberry yeah completely different energy in the building these last 5 minutes or so another D with bunch of turnovers in the second half sturdivan wants to fire it up there rebound comes to Davis knocked away and stolen from behind by Miles Kelly what Applause awareness Kelly their top scorer hes been really quiet in this one but hes got time Applause Sturman trying to attack shot clock down to nine long jumper by George and a foul Applause too my goodness 70 66 and hes headed to the line guess who Nathan George first the steel Davis just tucks it in trying to let everybody clear and Miles Kelly takes it away but a great cut to the ball by Nathan George never took his eyes off the rim and Burton just his momentum took him right into George picked up the foul this could be a fourpoint play how about that what a rally here for the yellow jackets in their third meeting with Notre Dame the Irish won the first two both of them were incredibly close this is his close as this game has been since the score was 7 to four the full court pressure has really affected Notre Dame but we talked about valuing offensive possessions and Kyle Sturman right now is just sticking to Marcus Burton thats a great matchup for Georgia Applause Tech Davis went to make a move and a whistle before that stopping the clock with 812 to go look like they gongo just grabbing a jersey yeah theyre going to get gari for that one thats number four yeah his fourth Kei headed to the line well thats a big foul for Georgia Tech because it takes away the length of gari on the ball for out of bounds underneath the number one shot blocker so J the sophomore out of Centerville Music Ohio and a 75 foul shooter and makes number one guy came over to Notre Dame from Penn State where he played for Micah Shrewsberry he did a really good job on Kyle filipowski in both of the games that Notre Dame played against Duke holding him to seven points in South Bend and eight at Cameron indor and he will have that one roll off the iron Georgia Tech has to keep attacking the paint thats when they can get it into the lane Into the Blue draw the defense and then spray it but Notre Dames done a pretty good job of packing it in George has pulled off a fourpoint play moments ago got the pass to and doo for two Bo he had a terrific day well he really does a good job in those screen roll situations with George now George on the ball that makes Georgia Tech a lot smaller in trying to guard that inbounds pass Davis on Coleman across mid for 7169 huge recovery by the yellow jackets here in Washington Shrewsbury drills that one from threepoint land well how do you leave him that wide open shrewbury with 18 long one Kelly rebound big battle for that the officials will get together hes going to stay on this end 746 9 it looked like Notre Dame had a chance to run away with this overall points off turnovers for in favor of Georgia Tech in the first half it was 8 to4 in favor of Notre Dame freshman have been on Center Stage and dango at 20 George with 18 for Georgia Tech and he went up against Burton George did and hit the elbow as he drew the foul if you didnt know the age of Nathan George and Marcus Burton youd never know they were freshman both of them are are have been so poised in this game and you know Marcus Burton shown great Poise throughout the course of the year but Nathan George just keeps getting better and better hes got 18 points and six assists in this game only one turnover seven minutes to go as George Goes to line foul number four on Marcus Burton and I dont think Micah Shrewsberry can afford to take him out tell him not to pick up his fifth foul but hes got to leave him out there has 19 points and seven assists the yellow jackets making their foul shots theyre back with in three and pressing again this press has been deadly thats the 22nd free throw attempt for Georgia Tech and that was the same number of free throws that Notre Dame got in the second matchup which was a big difference Davis into the paint nothing there but how much different is georia Techs defensive profile in the second half theyre making everything difficult for Notre Dame sure have playing with great energy Shrewsbury long one yes sir another triple you should never have to close out to him you just dont want to leave him he has been on fire in this game another tie up here right around the foul line theyre going to let him play and now the whistle how could that not have been a tie like theres no way indongo could get the ball away from ji without tying it up first seemed to take forever so 619 to go possession arrow will keep it here great job by ji to get that hand low but how do you take the ball away from him without being tied up first boy just a great job of Burton getting into the lane to draw the defense and get it to contract and then Shrewsberry ready to shoot it and I think Damon stmy asking the same question I was is how do you leave him open on that you got a a gang of guys around Burton and if he scores in there its just a two back to a sixpoint lead for the Irish Georgia Tech with the ball Nathan George the Freshman point guard picked up the dribble shot clock down to three with the long one coming oh sorts of Iron by Coleman somehow it went down thats the definition of soft shooting touch weve seen some shot making in game one well you have to think when Georgia Tech gets the ball back theyre going to start targeting Marcus Burton and just go right at him Davis swinging into the lane Imes Burtons been a little quiet the last couple of minutes gave it up its loose again with the save and here come the yellow jackets again great help by Miles Kelly great help the yellow jackets with a chance to tie and they were down as many as 17 George got it to go and thats exactly what Damon stmy was calling out he wanted Nathan George to take on Marcus Burton oneonone put him in a position to pick up that fifth foul or back off set a big big day with 22 onepoint contest under five to go Burton looking for the shot off the window no its tapped right back to him though here shrewbury Yellow Jackets trying to grab the lead its been forever fact they have never LED in this game now Burton was guarding Coleman so Coleman comes over to set a screen just to pick up the switch and another one by George going oneonone to put George a tech in front by a point well thats really smart by George a tech and by Damon stmy keep putting Marcus Burton in a position where he has to guard the fourth foul he picked up was huge in this game Burton again Slams on The Brak great job by Kelly to stay down on that shot fake make him give it up seven to Applause shoots Imes with a shot that wont drop and a whistle 349 to Applause go Nathan George the Freshman from Toronto on Dame as they try and recover the lead they were up by as many as 17 when the score was 65 48 as he makes number one so its been a great comeback by the yellow jackets Notre Dame winning the first two meetings of the year but they were both white knucklers right down to the final moments this one may be two well even when Georgia Tech was down 17 maybe we should have known it it seems like every time these teams play ever since they became ACC members every game comes down to the fire George sealed off terrible pass yeah great save there well sailing out by Kelly Kellys got it way downtown he cant sink it Notre Dame by one and the ball without Marcus Burton in there to run the offense where does Notre Dame Music go Davis on the spin still working shrewbury shot clock to five Davis glanced at it trying to slice in not there for him he battles for it get back its Jai with the basketball dry went after that or indongo went after that blocked shot and that opened up the offensive rebound when he went to the deck Davis and theyre going to call that an offensive foul Applause thatll be his fourth its probably that off arm that Drew the call and Dongo just maintained that legal guarding position stayed in front but my guess is it was the arm that Drew the foul more than the body contact what Kell Zips the pass for sternan Rebound pops up and Dongo again for two more continues to have a huge day with 22 hes been a man inside thats his second offensive rebound that couldnt have come at a better time for Georgia Tech they have the lead Again by one and a timeout and time is about to become a big the yellow jackets with their press in particular and their foul shooting and some big plays are suddenly up by one again Marcus Burton back in the ball game being guarded by Kyle Sturman got the switch Burtons been the man in the paint not there times to drive it with a defense for the yellow jackets has been so tough forcing that shot that will not go but give Georgia Tech Credit not only do they play hard and together defensively but they stayed down on fakes in the first half and the first part of the second half that wasnt the case Notre Dame has missed their last five shots heres the switch now Burton back on George Coleman h a big three moments to go and that one around and out nice save by as on arms on the Baseline gets it fre to Shrewsbury Burton just a blur and the basket boy what a pass by shrew Berry by one Miles Kelly was trailing him and just about to knock that out of his hands with that back tip and Shrewsberry found Tech to continue to Target him defensively they were going right at him putting him in a position to pick up that fifth foul or have to back off a bit yeah he just scored his first points in about n and a half minutes but a big basket as we come to the one minute mark Thats free basketball and out it goes and a turnover by the yellow jackets with 57 seconds to play I just tried that little pocket pass but threw it behind him and indongo trying to tip it to stur ofan he just needs to grab that ball boy the Yellow Jacket has been taking care of the ball so well thats their first turnover in 15 minutes oh its not fatal they just need to get a stop here Miles Kelly guarding Shrewsberry and you got to stay with him Burton back in now Coleman Switched Off onto Burton and Burton can go around him seven to get off a shot now down to five Burton wants it trying to wriggle free and cant connect rebounded Away by Davis and hell draw the foul and a huge board by the 69 sophomore so well defended by Georgia Tech forc the miss their first shot defense was excellent Coleman staying in front the little step through but a terrific job by ji to keep that ball alive so Davis can grab it and Damon stmy not enjoying the fact that his team played such great defense but couldnt cap it off with a defensive rebound Davis shooting two and makes number one hes s 2 yeah whos been very productive down the stretch for Notre Dame had 15 points in their victory over Wake Forest once again Burton back to the sideline least for now 249 seconds that will not count lane violation lane violation here against the Irish so wave that one off they lead by two with about 25 seconds to play and a yellow jackets in possession what a big play that was and heres George who has been a whirlwind in the second half for Georgia Tech they need him again 13 seconds left twopoint game George batted Away by Davis and they turn it over Bo what a play by Davis just active hands 5 seconds left and the foul against Georgia Tech and give Micah Shrewsberry credit he took Marcus Burton out defensively put Davis on to George and look at that high hand knocking the ball away talk about a game winning play for Notre Dame so itll be Shrewsbury at the line hes been marvelous today hes an 80 foul Applause shooter and shooting with 5 Seconds to play and gets number one to make this a ThreePoint Contest knock this one down its a twopossession game and essentially Applause over and the Freshman does exactly that I know today making nine of their last 10 foul shots and a timeout and well keep it right here Georgia Tech taking a timeout not has had in the spotlight today you cant think that the coming seasons are going to be a lot of fun heres George to push one up there and that wont drop and theres the final horn Notre Dame wins it by a final of 84 to 80 Shrewsbury with 23 Burton with 21 and
