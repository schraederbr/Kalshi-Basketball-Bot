Look at the guards They got three potential 40 plus threepoint shooters on the floor And when they get Casey Prior back healthy look out Sand Fruins the opening tip Its in the arms of Mike Kell Brown Jr the fivestar freshman Its in the air and the miss from Ryan Conwell Well see that all night long Shot clock 2 seconds old Louisville will be taking shots More importantly taking threes They will not hesitate to get those attempts up See the Eastern Michigan starting lineup Theyre 32 off a 9791 win over Oakland at home on Friday night Carlos Hart and John Sanders II their guards And thats Sanders with a nice finish The senior transfer from Northwestern State Louisville starting five led by Brown the freshman Ryan Conwell fourth school in four years coming off a 25point game and a win over Cincinnati as he draws the foul right there first possession there and you see Eastern Michigan is switching ball screens Conwell identifies that knows he has the mismatch drives the basketball and draws the foul Both teams are trying to control the paint Some they go about it a little differently but Eastern Michigan guards feel as though they can get downhill when they want to attack some of those switches by Louisville as well Sand the German big man run the offense through him for Isaac McNeely back low through body bumps and could not hit Rebound by Godslo Wabude the sophomore from Nigeria Thats the one area for Louisville where you you have some concern is the production out of the five spot Kernanando Fu catch and finish in traffic Gave him 11 points and a hardfought win on Friday in Cincinnati Now Mohamd Habhav this is Eastern Michigans leading scoreer Leans in Thats the kind of shot they want him taking tonight If he if they got any chance of putting off this upset he has to win that matchup with his skill set and size Hes a high IQ player Pav has to play well Back door Javon Hadley gave it away Threw on the spin And theres your first bucket of the night for Louisville And we talked so much about Louisville scoring from the threepoint line that it starts with the paint They want to own the paint both ends of the floor offensively and defensively Hard came inside had it knocked away And here is what Louisville does Conwell draws a foul in transition on Addison Patterson Understand Heath in year number five Took Kent State to the Elite 8 all the way back in 2002 Stops in power five the GLeague in 2021 And he thinks this is the best group hes had in his 5 years at Eastern Michigan He should and I think he knows hes found a gym and and Muhammad have been red shirt freshman is one of the more talented freshman in the MAC from the skill set and what weve seen from him so far his his issue will be retaining him Got his paws on that one He did Talked about the wingspan You see how his length how disruptive he can be on both ends And just watch four in the corner all night long for Eastern Michigan Just trying to find ways to get him the ball Shot fake from Hart get it out to Patterson Addison Patterson Tough step back Conwells got the rebound Patteradisonsons a tough shot maker so shots like that throw away the analytical chart with him Hes just a shot maker He take difficult shots and has the ability to make them Conwell at the rim Couldnt back door it Thatll stay with Louisville The Pat Kelsey experience is threes and twos from right where Ryan Conwell just took that one They want to get to the rim and when you come in rotate they want to spread out and shoot threes This team is so explosive how many ways they can attack and score you They have a coachs challenge here 172 call is being reviewed Referees Roger Ayes Mark Schneer and Chase Shaw as Stan Heath unfurs it early here This is the earliest Ive seen a coachs challenge so far Its one of the new rules being discussed in college basketball the coachs challenge Get one here early Okay to guess what you think Flip your coin man laughter I think the officials have to take their time take a quick look at that one That was close I tell you what though it does speak I mean again this is early as youll see a coachs challenge again get one if they get it wrong Back over the number four is confirmed Eastern Michigan will be charged with a 30se secondond timeout and lose loss of their challenge Its a Its a strange moment early in the game to use one but it does speak probably to the urgency on the road for Stan Well its a two two game Your team has come out and play and started this game the way you wanted Theyve been physical Theyve met the challenge trying to get stopped So hes fighting right now before this team this Louisville team attempts to go on any type of run Youre also learning to trust your players Your players are telling you to challenge it and you lose the challenge Rebound by Gods love for off the Ryan Conwell miss And here comes Eastern Michigan again Hung 97 on Oakland zone on Friday Best offensive night of the year Take most of their shots from two Get most of their offensive production from two Sanders Thats a three Thats another rebound for Ryan Conwell Down by Kell Brown Fivestar freshman 22 the other night at Cincinnati and it was the first night that he really struggled in his college career Didnt start the night that way though Thats an absolute mishmack Theyve identified the switches now I think hes too quick too crafty You see why he was the seventh ranked recruit in the country and everyones talking about him being a one and done and he is among the best freshman in the country and one of the best classes that weve ever seen Getting 19 a game the first five games of his freshman season and Hart had it knocked away and here comes Louisville and Adley had that knocked out of play Got a foul in transition And Brown does it all right He shoots a three He does this Total complete player Youve got to get your heels on the threepoint line there Quick change of pace and speed Gets to the rim for easy lay He is as talented a freshman as you will see in college basketball First Louisville changes of the night Ali Khalifa their backup fiveman in Great passer Kobe Rogers the backup point guard in Eastern Michigan will go really four or five deep on their bench as well Mai Ellison one of their guards back in and Patterson sees Rogers I think they play differently Things change now when Khalifa comes in They like to play with him in that pinch post Hes a great passer Exhibit A on display at all times Hadley spits it out into the corner First miss on the first shot from Adrien Woolly Shoted at it 41 from three last year at Kennesaw State And we talked to Pat Kelsey about him He feels like hes close Theres there were days early in training camp where they felt like he was the best player in the gym First bunk of the night Mohamad Habhav coming off a triple double for Eastern Michigan The first in the history of the program at least recorded history in the program laughter We talked about with him he leads this team in every nearly every offensive category Conwell back door tried to no look it in Somehow Hadley got it but it falls to Patterson And here comes Patterson Loves the open floor Had it blocked from behind Kobe Rogers former D2 transfer with the block Got a 44 game early Mohamed Hab and hes a guy who has all the makings of a March Colt hero He does You can tell Woolly looks like hes expecting help But Hab again his skill set for a guy his size and his wingspan its going to be difficult for any of these guards to defend him Beats the size attack 24 11 and 10 on Friday night at Oakland The records at Eastern Michigan go back to 1897 They dont have every record Were looking at Detroit YMCA versus Eastern Michigan in like 1902 music But from what they know that is the first guy in their history to get a triple double And they do everything they can to get him the ball Facilitating from right out here Hands to Mai Ellison who can shoot it back to Hab Hes really good at attacking the paint here And he likes it in that mid post using his length squares up so you can get get his body off him Allows him to use that skill and that length Got in there had it knocked away Woolly got his hand in Can I Roots was defending Havab for the first time and now its Woolly oneonone out to McNeely He makes these Not that time Comes back McNeely on the outside Resets with Roots He sets and knocks it down You often hear best time to get a three on an offensive rebound Kick it out Open threes The Louisville guys are always hunting threepoint shots Can Iroots a career 23 threepoint shooter Theyre a lot better if he makes shots like that They dont worry about percentages They worry about number of attempts How many can it get up cheering Patterson at the post to the outside and John Shenu flanked it This is Louisville in the front court in an instant Off to Kobe Rogers down the left Rare offensive trip for him Back outside to Roots Kick it out Khalif a three online but long Offensive rebound Woolly Patterson in his grill He saved it and sets up a three and drills it Another offensive rebound Another three When youre playing this Louisville team they attack the offensive glass Youve got your guards have got to rebound And if youre switching is equally important because against the bigs music there are teams that if they start one for six from three they would stop shooting him That is not Pat Kelseys way He wants to go fast He wants to be aggressive on the offensive boards And those bottom two bullets are who he is in his heart We saw today the enthusiasm of this program Its its infectious Its contagious Its the pillars of this program and everyone has bought into that We heard him pregame in the locker room The toughest team wins tonight This is a Monday night in late November Not for Pat Kelsey Ellison late shot clock Tough pass that went off McNeely and falls to Woolly Hes been in it all day Woolly punting his shot That time fell away Hab contested him at the rim Ellison stopped A rebound by Woolly again Question becomes from Eastern Michigan They want to play the game shooting a lot of twos Louisville is the complete opposite FOUL AND ONE FOURPOINT play chance for McNeely who just hit his first three in two games The luxury you have to have as a team when you got so many guys they can make shot a career 40 threepoint shooter struggles for a couple of games You make a shot like that to help get you out of the slump Just as good a shooter as there is in college basketball there Really great job getting his feet set up the dribble hand off Got the lock and trail on him and run him off the threepoint line He didnt make a three on Friday night in Cincinnati That happened three times all of last year at Virginia Thats a rare miss from him from the free throw line Nine nothing Louisville run ninepoint lead here in the opening seven plus And believe it or not hes hes better off the dribble than hes shown this year I think hes just buying in trying to fit in Sometimes when you transfer into a school youre just trying to still find your way Brown wanted that all the way Missed it Roots on the follow Second try Thats Eastern Michigan ball The length energy there by Kai Roots attacking the offensive glass Upset with himself because he missed the tips but hes really active You think that position that Roots plays and Javon Hadley one and white just came in might be the key to their season I I do and I think when Case Priors health when weve had talked about yet his health is critical for this team and as he comes back hes a 12 game point scorer last year before his injury and he provides a lot of upside ability to stretch the defense and thats going to uplift that front line as well because he brings length and size for those teams that want to play big Eastern Michigan on the end line Mia Ellison stepped out Kase Prior is out tonight Hes in concussion protocol Looks all right Theres no guy in college basketball more swagged out than that guy at all No not at all Hes on his way back after that serious knee injury last year Mel Brown deep three on the way and in Its a threele score I mean you have to stay I dont know how much longer you can switch because hes going to win that matchup all night long Same thing as the other night You know it felt like all right its a little quiet you know not perfect for him And then all of a sudden you look up you have 22 points Time is out This is Mike Brown Jr Just sizing you up the switch He music beat you off the dribble twice You back up step shows you the range knocking down another three Louisville with four threes here so far in the first half good that if they can shoot because the volume that they shoot and I think they can be better and I think some of their shots theyve taken quick shots rush shots kind of riding the emotional wave but the skill set of these guards and the quality in which they shoot through in there off the Conwell miss and hes fouled they dont take midrange 5 of their shots last year were basically that exact shot chart And Ryan Conwell guy who comes over in the corner Isaac McNeely fits with all that throw Fouled by Merritt Alderink who was not about to be put on a poster No he was not And thats what you do Got to come over and be physical and then foul when you couldnt get to the rim But thats what happens They space you here You see the ball screen They switch and as a guard you see Sanders Sanders comes over and hes like Hey Im expecting help No layups allowed And thats the physicality you want and thats just some messages being sent and you have to do things like that Sandanda Fru averaged 12 and six in the basketball bundis Liga last year See this is what makes this team so special We talked about that shark and that chart and the threes and the paint touches and the scoring at the rim but this is the other part of it too Theyre averaging 23 points at the free throw line And thats where were going to see teams as they start If you want to beat Louisville youre going to have to take away something Theyre going to have to say Hey we got to take we got to fight the paint Try to limit paint touches and then dont foul You cannot give up threes layups and free throws They just become overwhelming And its why theyre averaging 97 points a game Friday night in Cincinnati 24 of 28 from the line Thats a block Javon Hadley McNeely saved it Patterson with it sets a fake and a three No good Raquel Brown Jr with the rebound off the miss from M Mancel one of Eastern Michigans best threepoint shooters You watch Brown like he wants to be guarded out there for this a midrange Whoa A midrange happened laughter Thats that one orange dot on the chart Thats another dot on your chart right there A midrange Its going to be a difficult task for any of these front line guys to guard on that switch Hab open to contest from behind by Javon Hadley and Conwell ran smack dab into Manel That is not a good sign for the Louisville Cardinals Thats his first Ryan Conwell still down Thats Ryan Cwell playing making the kind of play that he usually makes which is full bit of his soul behind it Hes done it for the last four years at four different schools And Pat Kelsey the man who brought him here with obvious concern Contact happened so fast it was difficult for him to brace himself applause one of the captains of his Louisville group applause from the cards number 14 replacing Little smile on his face Thats a good sign Well you know Pat Kelsey has something joking about him laughter Good for him to see him smile and walk off the court Make his way to the locker room Heres how it happened Oh yeah he runs right in head first He goes in the back to get checked out Lets hope hes okay Javon Hadley missed the free throw Sets up McNeely off the rebound Brown Woolly So 10 minutes down in the opening half 15point Louisville lead on a 15 nothing run Picked off Mel Brown Jr and he had it knocked away He was on his way up before John Sanders arrived And Brown stays down Little bit shorter there This has not been a fun minute for Louisville fans You got a lot of people holding their breath here 53rus Didnt look like much from there It looked like the foul was up top I didnt see him roll his ankle but I think everybody in the building was like him like Oh no Get up Yeah Theyll be happy to see Brown take this shot Hes okay When you come out of your ankles good enough to shoot youre okay You dont feel anything You know from experience laughter Hadley Another miss Fight for it inside Viguel Zugris the Greek god Every time he gets a rebound whole place goes zoo Now its Brown They missed another They missed four threes on the trip And then Hab gets a rebound Zukers didnt even look at the offensive I mean footback He just rebounded him He knows rebounded Look for my shooters Well its another part of the Pat Kelsey analytical school of thought and its just a reality of that is when you take long shots there are longer rebounds Absolutely And theyve been a top you know 100 offensive rebounding team in the country all season for a team that you know one through three is not very big They get rebounds Got a foul with John Sanders on his way to the front court by Javon Hadley Louisville just plays in spurts and runs They get four threes there We talk about at least they got four threes there in one possession Though they come away empty the percentages are on their side Sooner or later they know theyre going to start knocking down shots Its why when we came back from break there you know we show the percentages The difference between 1 and 2 is bigger for them than anybody else because of how many they take Absolutely cheering Hab lost it Zubris got on him Thatll stay with Eastern Michigan Folks womens basketball coming up next on the ACC Network Hannah Hidalgo the nations leading scoreer and number 19 Notre Dame hosting Central Michigan Also available on the allnew ESPN app Talk about a score and a shooter like lights out You see the game winner the other night against USC Yeah she is fun to watch Just flat out bucket 27 a game Flatout bucket Just scores it however any way she wants Patterson gets a roll So that finally stops the 15 nothing Louisville run First basket since the 1542 mark Madison Patterson former top 100 recruit in his seventh year of college basketball And another foul on some hand fighting in the corner Patterson has the physicality The physicality of Louisville wont bother him much Again he can get to a spot take the contact and finish And he loves to play a little bully ball himself And if he gets the right matchup youll see him post up inside Hes been in college basketball so long Yeah he has That Oregon was in the Pack 12 Not the Pack 10 but the Pack 12 when he was recruited there Northwestern State last year as Brown an 88 free throw shooter Misses the first Little sleepy for Louisville First 11 minutes Patterson stepped through Wanted it Still in there Got his own miss Bully ball man One on the whole universe down there And finally Kobe Rogers out with it Rogers was at College of Charleston with Kelsey Woolly hunting his shot tonight Off to Hadley Back to Woolly in stride Woolly A foul on the rebounding action Louisvilles now four of 15 from three Theres Ryan Conwell So good and bad news Good that hes back out on the bench bad that icing that right shoulder the one that we saw him run smack into Mman cell with a few minutes ago Hes got the heat pack on it now I think its try to loosen that up and see if he can if he feels good enough We watching monitoring if he can come back in the game and Zubris is really upset Yeah I think they teed him up Yeah he was really frustrated with something that was going on right around the free throw line Said something Roger didnt like Roger one of the more respected officials in college basketball And when he teases you up you know youve earned it Pat Kelsey isnt happy about it Zugris is a guy who plays with just an enormous amount of passion Theres a viral photo of him with blood streaming down his face playing for the Greek national team that epitomizes who he is and who hes been in his basketball career And I think whatever happened down there he had he was not happy about whatever happened Well were going to find out what mom and dad had to say about that Youve come far to watch him play and you get a technical foul and get taken out of the game Every Zugris in history is here Everybody just siblings like mom and dad are like What are you What did you say You know his brothers like I know what he said Exactly So two technical free throws good from John Sanders And now he earns a kickball violation There is the Zugris family Dads like Yeah this is what happened This is why he deserved it Grandma is stricken You see moms looking at him like Well what did he say Dads explaining the technical foul Theyve come all the way from Greece Hes had his brothers like Im glad its not me Finally he like See mom he actually does something wrong Melis is not looking up towards section 118 right now Mom is blaming dad for that language He got that from you Inside nice take Carlos Hart coming off 22 and a sixpoint win over Oakland on Friday And this is Louisville basketball Theyre on the wing with 27 seconds to go on the shot clock KHALIFA BACK DOOR BROWN THATS Louisville basketball You have to make the mental adjustment The difference when Fu is in the game and when Khalifa is in the game Khalifa loves to catch that ball in that mid post You got to watch for the back door cuts and the dribble handoffs when he in Hes not more of a ball screen running player They change their style of attack when their five men are in the game You have to identify that quickness Time is out We talked about it a bunch with Khalifa You want to overplay it Male Brown showing you the bounce Goes up and finishes strong Louisville starting to pull away Whatever We got to talk about how John Sanders couldnt name Cranberry sauce Hey no But hes right though Its dressing with the um cranberry sauce man Are you a stuffing or a dressing guy Im stuffing Youre stuffing Im You know its good But we can both name cranberry sauce Khalifa back door right to Rogers Watch him pass man 14point Louisville lead under seven to go in the first half Where Cardinals havent shot the ball that well No but theyve gotten to the rim the last couple possessions and theyre struggling from shooting threes And now youve noticed in the timeout theyre attacking the rim more Theyre not settling for threepoint shots Theyre going to continue to take them but theyre putting more pressure on the rim Another blocking shots Green on his way in Eastern Michigan stills not made a threepointer This would be one It was not from Sanders Shot clock violation anyway Eastern Michigan Khalifa not known as a shot blocker but he was able to get a his hand on that one Theyre more of a positional defenders but that time hes able to come over as a secondary defender This is when theyll get most of their block their block shots And I dont know if I call it an elevation to block the shot He was ready Yeah he jumped over the phone booth Phone booth there and its all he needed Theyve blocked five shots tonight Thats a season high Isaac McNeely thats what he does Second three here tonight Starting to get out of that slump If you want to call it a slump with 38 shooting from three on the season is a slump Thats the kind of slump Id want to be in But quickly adjusting to the zone there Eastern Michigan tried to switch up their defense and Loville prepared for it Shot clock at five again Still beyond the arc Khalif is in the area Hart gets it away to the corner Need to get it up Manel they still havent made a three and I roots with a big rebound Theyll be the one to take it over the timeline Under five and a half to go in the first half 50 Louisville sixth ranked team in the country for the second straight week in the AP poll Thought maybe they would crack the top five Yukon didnt drop after that home loss to Arizona and two top five teams now Isaac McNeely starting to look like Isaac McNeely Yeah hes a difficult player to zone and I understand why coach Heath went to the zone They had given up two straight layups cheering Lovo was struggling from behind the threepoint line and immediately they knocked down backtoback threes One of the many scary things about this team offensively is theyre hot in two possessions again Late shot clock Ellison jumps it down Hab man of the year He was blocked again Thats Khalifa over the foam booth Shot clock reset Must have grazed the rim And then Woollys applause fouled by Carlos Hart Long way from the free throw line where hes about to shoot Ali Khalifa is showing you he has good timing Not known for his vertical jump on his shot blocking ability but using his length Great job cutting off the drive Rotates down blocks the shot Thats a really good defense Its important for the guards to get in rebound on both ends of the floor I think they do a great job of their rotation their pack line If theres one thing the Louisville team lacks normally you would expect its just that James Scotts no longer here That traditional rim protector is not there but Khalifa is showing you hes capable of of helping it out defensively You mentioned Scott gone So right they have two fives between Sander Fu and Ali Khalifa What do you think beyond just what weve seen tonight of those two guys defensively as you think about the longterm final four dream for this group I I I think theyre position defenders and I think FU brings a level of physicality He plays that and coach Kelsey challenged him in the second half of that Cincinnati game and he responded and it was part of the reason they turned that game around and took control because they were challenged physically and didnt answer the bell to start that game and you saw here the example of it Theyre not allowing their defense to slip when theyre not making shots They were missing shots They were able to weather that storm And then here they are again going on another run Mohamed Habh Central Michigan transfer on his way in Kelsey wanted a traveling call Instead its a block for Canai Roots 3 seconds Habh second bite cheering Didnt get the roots finds Brown on the rebound Great defense there by Roots being physical at the point of attack McNeel got up to save that Gets a round of applause for his efforts Now Khalifa mid post looks to pass first always Ali Khalifa looks to score second And Woolly stepped on the end line Takes us to a timeout All Louisville 12 nothing run Its 319 here in the first half place Theyre flying everywhere Uncharacteristically theyre blocking a lot of shots there Just being physical at the point of attack and Louisville not known as rim protection with shot blocking They usually protect the rim by having bodies there but their length right now is bothering East M Easter Eastern Michigan Ryan Conwell is back in the game out of the under four timeout He ran into Mmanel earlier in the game Had a heating pad on his shoulder Was a little scary there with him on the ground but hes in the game Best news in the universe for Louisville fans Tough shot Lay shot clock Patterson gets an offensive board Kick it out Manel three They just have not found a way to get a three to go 0 for six now and McNeely one on three finds Ruth in the front court with under three to play Keep an eye on Conwell It was his right shoulder nonshooting shoulder as Brown goes down Couldnt hit numbers for Eastern Michigan if they hurry Patterson smaller guy on him just kept that foot down Manel air finally is the first Eastern Michigan three after six misses to start the game But I want to mention this too with Mike Brown and I said this to his dad at practice when I saw him yesterday Its hes got to stay off the ground Guards when you drive and you hit the floor you can almost count it Its a bucket on the other end because youre unable to set your defense And thats the example of it there Ellison gets inside finds Patterson He hadnt hit one all night If its two on backtoback possessions and the lead down to 16 You want to get back in the game if youre used to Michigan Thats how you get back in the game Paint touches knock down shots spraying out the three Doing a really good job there controlling the paint Eastern Michigan Eagles Backtoback threes for Stan Heath who at one point was head coach at South Florida They came in here and beat a top 25 Louisville team It was 2012 Final Four Louisville team He was telling us about Rick Patitos headto toe white suit on that night Guy whos lived a lot of basketball lives Kent State Elite 8 GLeague champion coach of the year now four seasons ago And again as he put it to us and its going to take a lot but anything can happen on any given night Yeah he believes that and you can tell by the fight in his group But I love the conversation we had with him just talking about what its like You can see theyre continue to fight at the defensive end here So did Kobe Rogers He got it to the corner and Khalifa couldnt keep it in And he talked about scheduling right This is a game and and I often say in by games you want to one make sure you get out of here healthy and two the check clears and its a perfect day and but great hustle there by Rogers and woo he talked about that these by games are important for their recruiting because this is how they raise money for their NIL they leave here they go play Cincinnati and it these games are a big part of how they build a competitive team to try to be successful in the match and in the NIL universe you know and I know every person watching knows that every dollar you have really matters and they play Pit get Louisville tonight Theyll get Cincinnati on Wednesday Butler in December Thats the difference between keeping your good players getting good ones Another missed three So thats a two for nine start three from Eastern Michigan McNeely missed after he made his last two Shuse got the rebound at 611 Hes Eastern Michigans tallest player Zugris back in the game He was teed up That hurt him spot on the bench for a little bit but families in attendance Hes back out there Hes guarding Shenu 10 to shoot Patterson jumping down Hab in Zugras One dribble spin turn and he traveled before that went He cant believe it Zuggers did a really good job there coming over being physical putting his chest on Hadav and forcing him to travel Just comes over puts his chest on him walls up I thought that was a really good move by Hav there Eighth Eastern Michigan turnover in the first half Rogers to the rim Went down very hard on the foul from Manel Number one Kobe Rogers so critical to this team as a backup point guard and he drives there and forces the contact Takes a hard fall Its been a pretty physical first half Credit Eastern Michigan because thats part of what they believe as well I mean they their their motto for them their pillars of their program is pace toughness and intensity And theyre playing with a level of toughness here boys from Ipsellani Michigan out of the MAC as Rogers knocks down both D2 transfer Kobe Rogers went to College of Charleston last year two years ago Joined Pat Kelsey here at Louisville Played an insane style at D2 Nova Southeastern Up and down run and gone analytical in many ways and it fits perfectly with the way that Pat Kelsey has molded his program Well hes the longest tenure player with Pat Kelsey Hes a help hes a guy that helps establish the culture He knows what it is to play for Pat Kelsey and and the culture and what he demands and Pat Kelsey relies on him a lot to help Patterson blocked Zugras off the bench Like the familys going to like that from Greece Six seconds here on the shot clock And hes doing a really good job Hes probably was upset at him I told you his mom got on him about this He She was blamed He was blamed for that technical foul Have fouled but hes come back here since hes been back in the lineup showing a lot of energy See Pat Kessler here Hes going to come back with a little more size Eastern Michigan really starting to attack that paint with no shot blocker of length on the floor And with Zubris being the biggest player out there probably standing 67 68 69 Mohamed Hab 24 points 11 rebounds 10 assists for Eastern Michigan in the win on Friday Its a unique thing We talked about Khalifa earlier who just checked back in for Louisville Like bigs that are comfortable and and almost want to pass first before they do anything else Well when you have the talent that Louisville has Khalifa just fits in perfectly And again he he forces you to defend them differently I think FU is more of a lob threat you know physicality playing inside Khalifa pulls you out And what makes it so difficult is he when the guards cut opens up the paint youre getting a lot of back doors and cuts off that pinch post But when he does dribble handoffs now and you want to sag off now youre really afraid of these guards shooting on the dribble handoffs So you have to decide how do you want to guard him Final 15 seconds of the first half Louisville up 16 Mel Brown Jr 5 seconds Brown Jr on the step back He missed it and its out of bounds to hand this first half Louisville didnt they held Eastern Michigan to 17 points At some point this game you know theyre going to get it going in the offensive end and I think a lot of that will start with Conwell him getting himself going Alongside Randolph Childris Cooper Borman happy Monday night from Louisville Kentucky Mel Brown Jr had nine in the first half Distributing Sander Fu has two shots on the way Thats the adjustment you want to see out of Mel Brown Gets in the paint that time Plays off two feet Great vision Sees the floor well Unbelievable passer He doesnt have to force shots and settle And great job there finding How hard is that for a freshman Right You you know that youre kind of the guy you know you can go hang 29 on Kentucky when you want to but also you have all of the weapons youve talked about around you Well it talks about the culture but thats what his skill set is I mean hes a really hes an elite passer an elite scorer He has all the skill set to control and dominate a game Patterson barreled in ends up with it out of bounds What the press from Pat Kelsey to start the second half Hes trying to get the team going I think they theyve struggled from three but theyre more than that I think the three ball gets them in trouble sometimes and they take so many of them when theyre not making them And you see a concerted effort here to like hey lets get in the paint You know lets lets we showed that graphic earlier and a lot we weve done the threepoint shooting Lets get to the rim and try to finish in the paint Isaac McNeely made three in the first half from beyond the arc Javon Hadleys only taken one shot He takes another and hits his first of the night When theyre getting threepoint shooting out of that poor spot you it it makes it really difficult to guard this group And Bradley and Roots have both knocked down three And Sanders into the tray is one Nice finish John Sanders I the second Great drive by Sanders there getting in the rim taking a contact with the left hand getting into the body of Fu and using his momentum to knock Fu out of the basket Thats what you love to see We talked about Eastern Michigan again Theyre not going away They play with the level of physicality and cheering Stan Heathon managed that from his team and theyve responded gets a rebound against Gods Love Wude Thats 7 foot4 wingspan from Wubet 13 in green Hadley iso ball He gets a little guy on him Hell just go to work Found Conwell off the tip Big on him Switch back Conwell Ryan Conwell lost it on the way up and drew a foul that Eastern Michigan was not fond of And Cooper this is what Im talking about You saw they tried in previous possession they tried to run Hatley in the post to get him going He dribbles out hits a three That time they run a 13 ball screen to get him inside against a smaller guard And then remember they always run Conwell inside to play bully ball as a big physical 210 lb guard So they dont play in the post of traditional bigs but theyll do that Hatley and theyll post Conwell Thats how they want to make the adjustment from shooting threes through had it go off his leg and out of bounds Mohamad Habhav makes another good play and that Hadley deal youre talking about as you see this with Havab against F Good defensive play here Yeah youd like to see F to finish through contact there but great job by Havab and using that length and getting his hands on the ball and knocking it off Louisville Hart went inside Hav gets a rebound up and through And three white jerseys in his grill Thats Eastern Michigan Attack the rim Try to control the paint and they like to do it off cutting off post or off the dribble Its a great job there driving it This is where Louisville gets vulnerable because theyre not a big team And so when FU gets knocked out now its p its upon one of those guards to get in there and rebound Hab using his length and his his size to be able to catch and finish Four threes Isaac McNeely Four threes there And thats just great execution And youve got to watch Thats a play they worked on in shoot around expecting that zone on the baseline out of bounds A guy whos knocked down three threes Youve got to find him Patterson down to Habhav Mohamad Habhab other way Javon Hadley and one Both teams are doing a great job of putting their head down getting to the rim throwing contact more their what both teams identity really is So this is what Louisville is We talked about so much of that chart of shooting threes but they want to get to that rim force rotation and finish And that Javon Head the one weve seen these last few possessions when they get that switch on the smaller guy You you can see him drooling Thats who he was last year Thats how he gets himself in the game Hes shooting well from the threepoint line Coming in shooting 42 He was three of seven coming in Hes knocked down a three He doesnt take a lot of threes but he take open shots good shots Thats why hes shooting such a high percentage Wally cookies ahead Kobe Rogers Thats two Easy does it Thats what you want to see when youre back up get the game pressure create turnovers opportunities like that with Kobe Rogers He scores on one end He was the first guy back to knock that away from behind Here it is Just give me that there Bully with the pick Unselfish pass there Rogers with the finish And watch these guards Theyre looking to pick up full court By the way those are two guards that come off the bench Absolutely For Pat Kelsece Embarrassment of riches I think theyre the deepest most talented back court in college basketball Woolly Last year was a freshman of the year in Conference USA Kennet State Shot 51 Rogers is unreal defensively as you see Hadley miss Eastern Michigan back on the run John Sanders Patterson had to snatch it against Khalifa out to Aldering comes in Thats another Khalifa contest Great job there just going vertical at the point of attack at the rim and cheering great defense there and a good job You got to get back stop the basketball there And Khalifa everyone on this team can snatch it and push it So when they get a stop and they get a rebound you cant worry about who your man is You got to match up Put a body on a body You want to slow down Louisville Hart hes got two shots coming Saw the layup for Kobe Rogers Hes got eight McNeely has 12 Hadley has five And it is the embarrassment rate I dont think Pat Kelsey was particularly happy with the first defensive possession with Mike Brown So he takes him out He brings in Rogers and Kobe Rogers has done everything weve just seen over the last four minutes The standard is the standard and he has that ability and he has the luxury of being able to do that to say Hey if youre not guarding at the level that I need you to guard you got to sit down It doesnt matter if youre a McDonalds allAmerican or the seventh ranked prospect and a future lottery pick The standard is the standard and thats why everybody is so high on this Louisville squad You and I watched Louisville shoot around You watched practice yesterday I wanted to play He makes you want to get out there and play The level of motivation and its not an eyewatch The level of motivation the consistency that Pat Kelsey brings on a momentto moment basis It matters Wally Oh man Would have seen that snap shot for a long time Other way Ellison Yeah its out of bounds going Louisvilles way And Brilland Green couldnt believe it Kobe Rogers two buckets here in this second half Hes come in the game and injected his energy on the defensive end of the floor and hes been rewarded with that by attacking the rim and getting layups Louisville starting to music take control Whole lot of teams hoping that Virginia loses that game Whole lot of two loss teams in ACC football Pittsburgh and SMU with the Whos at one loss But people and the good folks here in Louisville are focused on this 4725 lead for Kobe Rogers and the sixth ranked Cardinals over Eastern Michigan Eight points for Rogers played great defensively and hes got two of their four buckets here in the second half He does and hes done a great job defensively and you can add three assists to that as well So hes coming off the bench giving you really good defense efficient on the offensive end of the floor and is creating for others And Pat Kelsey raved about him as that backup point guard position A lot of teams dont have that luxury and again we talked about the talent this Louisville team has Mohamd Hab got in there against Conwell Eastern Michigan back the other way Madison Patterson former top 100 recruit Oregon transfer among many other stops to the outside for Sanders Rebound down to Kennai Roots who gave Louisville some good minutes in the first half Adrien Bully having a nice night Young Kennesaw State transfer to Ali Khalifa right back to him Its just beautiful to watch Ali Khalifa pass the basketball Youve got to know you got to make him a scoreer Hes looking to pass but a great job there The cutters of Louisville are really cutting with a lot of speed getting themselves open Patterson traveled for the world to see They want to call Khalifa the Egyptian magician And the nickname I think starting to catch You can see that Mohamd Hav turns his head and looks at the basketball And thats all Wolie needs is a turn your head one time lose sight of your defend your defender and Khalifa dropping dimes and you got to know that from the best passing big man in college basketball and thats what he does Hes a position defender but offensively does a great job on these dribble handoffs allowing shooters to get open and really passes well on the back door cuts Found Conwell here Right back to him Is he going to make a three WHY NOT OH YEAH why not First three of the year Largest lead of the Louisville Knight Now hes knocking down threes Just forget about it What are you going to do now laughter Quick three Aiden Rubio Hes a good shooter And it doesnt feel like Louisvilles had the you know best shooting night of the year But now you look down 9 to 22 Woly cross couldnt finish Codwell in there right back to Khalifa Backto back buckets for the Egyptian big man But when youre relying on your defense and you know youre going to crash the glass as well they can have poor shooting nights and still have nearly a 30point game All of a sudden 39 from three 54 for the Cards tonight Hello Go go go applause and cheering times there impacting the game in every way Oh you dont think I can shoot Watch this Ali Khaliba knocking down three crashing the glass finishing in the paint He is doing it all Youve you know lived basketball your whole life How many big men have you seen that do what he does Well theres bigs that are asked to do it but his what makes him so valuable is that the talent thats around him and hes not looking to score Its like my job is to do the dirty work Im a position defender When I get it Im looking to get you open and guys are cutting and moving because they know that they can pass the ball to him and he can be your deacto point guard in the half court Fanning against Habhav here Eastern Michigan out of their own timeout Heres Khalifa versus Habhav Thats a good pass from Hav and Hart couldnt hit Thats a Khalifa rebound Harts really struggled here tonight and only has four points and his size I thought hed get down here or more They were really concerned Louisville was about his ability to get in the paint but I think hes settled here a lot tonight Eastern Michigan as a team has made seven twos in the entire game Muel Brown Jrs back in Been sitting for the last six minutes Now Khalifa hes just so patient Just stand there now Hands it off Its Brown Jump it back Khalifa has hit one Three Khalifa has hit two Why not applause cheering I mean what do you do Mike Browns coming in off a dribble handoff You got to help And he pops back and you got to give up something Go switch five And these guards are so good You dont want to switch your bigs on them That didnt work early Coach Dan Heaths doing everything defensively hes can but he just cant muster enough offense to stop this team right now Youre thinking about the fivestar and then this Yeah Youre just What do you do Only thing left to do is switch He tried that early That got punished Now youre trying to hedge and recover And now you got Khalifa knocking down threes Also you sit here and laugh but I mean hes a 35 threepoint shooter in his career Its something he does Well when you get open like that I mean you got to hes got to take them and and hes going to knock those down at a high percentage Four or five in the second half as a team from three 42 for the game from three I mean they shoot 42 from three in any game this year Theyre going to win that game Starting they started this second half I thought attacking the rim and and start to game I thought they started from the threepoint line You can see they completely flipped that and theyre much more efficient here in the second half Late shot clock again Mai Ellison Brad and Khalifa on him Have couldnt get there cheering Knocked applause away by Conwell Transition Brown Conwell wing inside Pulls it back out to Khalifa Crowd yell Shoot it Conwell drives and scores First bucket since he got injured Its a beautiful sight And you talked about his importance again When hes in a dribble handoff you youve got to get up And he makes it difficult on your team because how do you defend him First 15 lb right Also like you want to get up and get around him 7 foot 250 Ali Khalifa Oh by the way 5925 Watch him go Ryan Conwell to extend the Louisville lead Proud of support for everyone from across from the NBA landscape throughout college basketball And uh true just I mean just horrible I mean I I I cant tell you how how just devastating this is to so many people in this his accident and uh but he he just reminded us of so much strength and and and how he handled himself conducted himself The gentle giant is what we all called him and he was that and he is a special human being that will be missed throughout you know everyone that he came in contact with and um its just its just hard It really is fun and Im glad Im here with you today guys tonight to really take my mind off it as much as possible and uh thank you guys for doing that because again hes a really really special to me Well I speak for our crew and really the ACC family that were deeply sorry for your loss and probably right were in a basketball game tonight Louisville scores 61 for them 11 to go in the second half alongside Randolph Childris Cooper Boardman Glad youre with us Louisville a big at halftime as Aiden Rubio scores and a night where the Cardinals have shot it from 42 from three Mike Brown has been distributing though he gave that one away Here comes Habhab for Eastern Ellison couldnt hit Still free And now the run for Ryan Conwell He never stopped running behind the back Ryan Conwell Little jelly to finish too 63 applause The one thing about Lova they dont care about the score Its just the standard is the standard Youre going to have to continue to guard Theyve already have 150 point win this year And theyre up over 34 now and there is no letup Theyre going to continue to come at you in ways Eastern Michigan See Brown took a little shot He grimaces Take a look at him Eastern Michigan timeout will step aside as well as the ESPN app Ran off Hard to overstate I mean thats a big couple of days for this conference especially after what happened last year It was And I This league is so much better and deeper than it was a year ago And this have finishes there in the rim with the and one I mean we talked so much about the top of the league and I saw NC State took a loss tonight but the middle of this conference is so much better I think this the 11th place team I think can beat the first place team in this league I think thats how deep the league is Duke is Duke top 10 against Florida North Carolina has already you know played well against some of the best competition in the country Syracuse tonight almost beat the number three team in the country in Houston You had to get that out of the crowd laughter But you know you talk about Syracuse as an example of those middle pack teams No they are really good and really talented And I I for most of the Orange you know fans I gave you crap about being a Syracuse grad I think theyre going to make the NCA tournament I think theyre one of the teams that I didnt think people were talking about early talented enough and they didnt pull a win out against Houston the third ring team in the country but they were right there in overtime and I think this league is back and it should be a fun year Its going to be a battle to make the NCAA tournament and theyre an example of those You know you have the Louisville and you have Duke and you have North Carolina Those middle of the pack groups Clemson off to a nice start Talked about NC State Those are all teams that have taken very big leaps It makes the job for that guy who went 18 and two in the league that much harder Yeah I you know last year it was Duke Louisville and everyone else Thats not the case this year Uh whoever wins the ACC this year will have I think theyll have four or five losses this year I mean you look at that list of teams I think that many teams could possibly win the mean make win a bid and get to the NCAA tournament Um I mean you can add you know I I think Virginia Tech is ranked way too low Theyre going to surprise a lot of people and youre going to add them to that list and its going to be really really difficult path through the ACC and youre going to be battle tested when you get to the NCAAs McNeely took it and had it stripped right back Hes in some pain as Eastern Michigan gets the front court Have baseline two around him Harts had a tough shooting night McNeely walling him off gets in the lane Fell I think on the reach from Kobe Rogers You know we show Kelsey and the league being better I think if youre a Louisville fan is actually Good news right They were 27 and 8 182 in a high major in a top four conference in college basketball And they were an eight seed last year right They were better than that They just were injured late in the year last year And like we talked about this year again Jason Prior not here tonight and I cant emphasize when music they finally get him back and hes coming be getting healthier and healthier coming off that ACL injury and youre talking about getting the march it just you know youre going to see his impact as the season comes around and once he clears concussion protocol and he takes off the glasses and the chain and everything and get back to playing basketball its going to be look at him nobody rocking a Louisville sweatuit better than that guy not at all not at Oh is he wearing Pat Kelseys glasses laughter Can I Ruths another guy that matters I mean hes 68 last year 610 this year And distributing Hadley shot fake Javon Hadley Look at this beef inside Missed it Harts got the rebound He held his own there Carlos Hart This is a big lineup here for Louisville I mean you got Hadley playing the three Put the roots in Usually those guys play back up I mean they play the forward position and throw in This is a bigger front court lineup as youll see Louisville play with Well you think about Kai Roots You know this is a guy at 68 last year Hes 610 this year cheering And in the NIL era this is a guy that got a Louisville tattoo Literal Louisville tattoo Pat Kelsey was uh was okay with it And again like this is a guy that is not their number one option or number two option This is somebody that you know cares from the bottom of his heart about this program and they need him to take a jump this year Well hes the example of what Pat Kelsey preaches you know stay process ready Hes a guy third string big a year ago not playing at all and then injuries happened and now hes playing 25 minutes a game And hes shown you the step that hes taken So hes bowled in all the way And when you got a guy coming off a bench thats giving you that type of effort it makes it easier for everyone else to buy in because they see that knowing the potential he has And hes bought in Half two round him again Hes had everybody around him all day Hes finished sometimes over that Hes into double figures with 12 Back door Theres Kai Roots tattoo and all rising and Louisvilles got 65 with eight to go Great job there by Roots try you know back door cutting off the drive and he wanted to get back and have had Fern making that basket on the other end again with roots He grew two inches between last year and this years Patterson misses You get the feeling he could go to bed and wake up 7 foot tomorrow laughter I didnt have those issues with those late gross persons No me neither Kobe Rogers off to Roots Here he is again Can I Roots in the post now Can I Roots One more touch Hadley all the way Thought about dunking it Hell take two anyway applause Havs got to know personnel there but youre so concerned All you hear about is the threepoint shooting and you got to run him off the line and that fatigue set in You dont know whos shooting and it doesnt matter Youre just running out there Great job by Hatley The shot fake and the drive Another high rebound for Kennai Ruth Eastern Michigan here You cant get sloppy here Youre not matching up to the basketball here And theres no let up in this Louisville team Theyre going to keep coming at you in waves Pat Kelsey calls Canyuse a believer Believe that Yeah Take this drive Hes laying it in with the left hand as he gets to the basket Hatley says All right I got one too music Its a layup line going on Leading candidate to win freshman of the year right now and leading the race is Cameron Boozer And he poses a problem with everyone with his physicality at that four spot That could be a potential problem for Louisville And you know theyre undized at that spot And thats where you talk about a guy like Kase Prior And is Hadley big enough Is Roose enough Everything else is Look forward to those matchups Its just exciting times in the ACC but I actually thought the experience of Louisville is why I voted them as to finish first in the in the ACC over Duke and because of a guy like guys like that just got the bounce Older players get that bounce Older players just an experienced battle tested You saw first team all ACC preseason Hes the other guy along with fivestar Mikel Brown on that list and for very good reason Absolutely They have two guys on the first team Its not two Duke Blue Devils Its two Louisville Cardinals And again the upside of Duke is incredible I think the upside of this team cheering if they stay healthy and then they get Prior back and also the steps is going to be taken by Mike OBrien Conwell just off to the left Habhab gets a rebound for Eastern You talk about Duke freshman and you got to include Male Brown in that as well Hes going to continue to get better as well which also helps Louisville right And thats why you know its 72 385 to go in the second half in a noncon and its a noncon week for Louisville you know against kind of the lower end of division one on paper Deep one Mike Brown a foul against Willie on the rebounding action but its why these kinds of games matter Its why the rest of the nonconference schedule matters For a young player like Mike Brown Jr who you know come early January when they see a team like Duke for the games that really matter they want him to be growing between now and then Absolutely You look at that list there of look at the ranking You got six of the top 20 recruits in the country playing in this league and really talented in and cheering some I dont even know if its an argument anymore This is the most talented from a depth standpoint The best freshman class maybe in the history of the sport and you can just see the talent Brown got fouled Patterson had something to say after cheering he blocked Brown Theres a Louisville brotherhood around him Competitive fire 446 to go Thats what you want to see You really want to see that Its okay He drives Hesitation Hes questioning it Thought he got him going up and he has something to say Like Carol Brown you know its going to the line for two Its like man just look at the scoreboard here Not a whole lot to talk about But again if youre Eastern Michigan thats just some pride as well I mean youre youre down Theyre not quitting Come across a better team and Pattersons been frustrated tonight Hadnt shot it well and struggled Three of 11 from the floor and crowds letting him have it as he leaves the game He urged Dean seventh year guy Addison Patterson And that is one of Eastern Michigans leaders Thats a you know little moment of competitive fire on November 24th that you know matters for them down the stretch And they have 36 points here The problem of like I said with Louisville when we talk about coach and standard theyre up 36 Theyre still picking up full court This is just who they are Youre expected to play 40 minutes and now theyre not clearing the bench No theres theres essentially three starters out there and Khalifa plays like a starter and Bruce is a rotational guy Not even that Thats a foul out near mid court with four 33 to go in a you know 40point game almost And theyre not happy about it No no theres no let up Youre going to get coached for 40 minutes and theyre going to expect you to play it And that means more importantly defensively Second half of the ACC Network double header next Hannah Hidalgo and Notre Dame must see Look at the numbers for Louisville 67 from the field in the half Theyre five of eight from three You mentioned Hannah Herado there a second ago Wow look at this score I was this close to saying You think she can outscore Eastern Michigan tonight But now theres 40 I dont I dont want to put that kind of pressure on it If it was 30 I would have left it alone But I mean she today so shes got a chance Shes got a chance Its 25 Just book it Im just saying its its easy 25 I didnt want to make her have to go for 40 That be a tough night to be a Chipoa Can I root now had a nice second half for Louisville Mel Brown Jr two around him Ali Khalifa He said a couple Yeah cheering cheering applause Khalifa had a smile on his face and then blocks one Jump ball As good as he has been on the offensive end of the floor thats the end of the floor Hes been unbelievable here tonight Egyptian magician You dont want to close out Ive already knocked down two Have another one Khalifa dominating the Eastern Michigan squad here They completely flipped that in the second half Made it a conscious effort of attacking the paint Only nine threes on 25 shots Theyre just taking control of this game shooting 68 and the defense hasnt let up at all Gregory Lawson in the game Hes got his first collegiate bucket right there for the freshman from Sagena Michigan Shoot touch there by Lawson Taking a nice midrange pull up there Its a roll hell always remember He just remembers it Goes in Another offensive rebound One of those Louisville Knights Javon Hadley Adrien Woolly Gave them some good minutes early in the second half late in the first half Zugris off to McNeely at four Hadley There goes out of bounds You know we talked about Kelsey about rap poison Little Nick Sabin You know you you beat Kentucky and everybody thinks that weve hung the moon right and the seasons over and theyre going to struggle and he knows that and when that happens everyones going to think that you know the world is ending and the reality for them is its somewhere in the middle But the way they played in this second half up huge has to make him feel good when he thinks about that He knows his team is really good and I dont know how much struggling the Louisville Carter is going to do this year He means a lot is what he means to these fans Thats a tough stretch there talking about Arkansas in the ACC SEC challenge and and a Indiana team thats really good Their spacing and their shooting shotmaking ability creates issues And then a Memphis team that played really well and lost to the Deaks And that Tennessee matchup is going to be must TV cheering when those two match up No the reality is is Louisville just as a team is must see TV Like you you walk in here on a Monday night week of Thanksgiving and theyre just theyre just fun I mean the way they play the game the up and down the threes Isaac McNeely missed it Von Hadley on the refeed Woolly underneath Hes got a whole man all around him And then a foul called on John Shenu3 and theyre still playing hard and and I cant say this enough how unusual that is Theres no clearing the bench You know walk on was playing yet You know youre still shooting threes Starters are on the floor McNeelys out Mike Browns out there and and Roose about to check back in the game I mean it just replacing Brown and for Mel Brown Jr applause for that noncon stretch Wednesday night against NJIT 900 pm tip right here You and I on the call together to hang out with you a little bit here Were hitting the Slugger Museum tomorrow laughter Railen Green for Eastern Michigan Bowling Green transfer in Zucrris all over him and out of bounds Its also you know a guy like this hes a good player Hes not playing a ton right now for Louisville These are moments that matter to him Well these are the moments he has to produce if he wants to get extended minutes And thats whats so val you know invaluable to a team in a squad like this The standard is again the standard Youre going to continue to play and play hard in these minutes if you want to earn minutes Hadley forced it up Hes got two more shots coming Take their 18th and 19 free throws of the game We talked about it They average 23 made free throws a game And thats what makes this group dangerous when they do struggle from three If you want to consider 12 made threes a struggle Um and then they picked it up in the second half scoring in the paint But its the when they start getting all three thats when they can beat anybody You have to if you want to give this team trouble I think you can punish them with the switches on the offensive glass and youve got to be able to defend them without fouling And uh Eastern Michigan matched the physicality There just was a significant difference in the talent of both teams I thought they fought well They just couldnt score losing for Reed and by Nai Richard freshman from Sagal and the game for Stan Heath with 157 to play again fullcourt press roots right in there and coaches are not upset because you know when youre coming in and you watch this team on film youre warning your guys youre letting your guys know and you put freshman and you put young players in so they can see how important it is to play hard no matter when you get in the game So if Louisville has starters in the game right now when you go in whether youre a red shirt freshman walk on what you know it doesnt matter You know what youre going up against and whats expected of you Enjoy He got the roll His first college bucket Mbeai how about that Nice drive to the middle of the lane And great thing about that if youre Eastern Michigan you get to say Hey I did it against the Louisville starters You know hey coach I should be getting more playing time Isaac McNeely on the way Thats Thats it Isaac McNeely Hes hit now five threes I think its safe to say this slump is over I think hes back I think hes okay Worlds shortest slump laughter He busted out of it early cheering In and out And can I Ruth has it with one minute to go applause And Louisville get the walkons in now Rolling time out there by Pat Kelsey is sub guys in and applause moments away from Notre Dame and Central Michigan take you there on ACC Network in about 55
