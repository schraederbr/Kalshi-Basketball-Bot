looking to snap this losing streak jackets have lost seven of eight Syracuse trying to keep the momentum rolling from Tuesday and off we go from the ATL each team won on the others home court a year ago by a large margin loose ball poked away officials look at each other and say C Ball T in the shot clock and thats one of the things for Georgia Tech youre going to have to have active hands against the the Syracuse gu guards because theyre going to want to put a lot of pressure to get to the Lane got to stay in front of the guys and not allow them to have Applause blowes clock down to three Judah mince recognizes and Banks it in around the rim off the glass for three but one of the things we talked about in the open is this a guy that you can give the ball to that can just go get you a bucket you saw the off balance Bank three and the foot was on the line so its a two for cuse and at the other end some contact and the fouls going on Taylor I mean look at the off balance shot I mean yeah it was a two but I mean you got to give him three for that one because again Judah men he was actually surprised at that by not but none against the current top four in the league so I know after Tuesday that Syracuse fans have started to imagine what could be if they go five one or even six and0 down the stretch I think that what it is theyve got to finish out strong and then you got to go into the ACC tournament and at least get a couple of wins I feel like especially with the way the other teams above playing and what the league is being projected as two for two for Dongo Justin Taylor air mails one and its Georgia Tech ball Applause EV youll see Georgia Tech mix up their defense that first time they started out with with a manto man last possession in a Zone youre going to have to mix it up against Syracuse again give them different looks make them have to work some time on the clock Nate George too strong off the glass rebound pinballs to Mintz was curious what the orange would come in out in defensively Brian they played a lot of Zone against Carolina on Tuesday been man through the first 90 seconds tonight JJ Starling creates contact its a the three ACC wins that they have as you see Starling come up short on that one are against Carolina Duke and Clemson and so I think that when we talk to Damon STM is the the frustration is that there are a lot of games maybe six games that this Georgia Tech team had and they were up but then they take their foot off the pedal the other thing that we may not discuss enough Brian is how difficult ult it is to be successful in year one you know its not all Hubert Davis taking the Tar Heels to the National final Bobby Kremes in his first year as the head coach on the flats was three and 11 in ACC play thats exactly what Georgia Techs record is now one of the things too as you see this play Georgia Tech is those live ball turnovers against the Syracuse team you cannot turn it over and allow them to get in transition because thats where they do a lot of their damage Min before the shot they got the foul on George Judah men is going to put a lot of pressure on the guards from Georgia Tech today because this is a guy thats got bounced he he tries to search for the the contact and he puts a lot of pressure trying to get downhill Taylor inside surrounded kicks it out Starling for three good good pass by Taylor realize he didnt have anything gets the ball out of Starling how good have JJ Starling been as of late again we talked to Adrian alry he said that he thought that he was a guy that was really coming into his own double figures in nine straight games a stretch in which hes averaging almost 20 a game pretty good rebounder too for his size with Starling and mince playing confidently and cohesively Syracuse is dangerous against anybody as Taylor misfires from three oasi Reeves the Florida transfer streaky shooter say the same about Kelly Reeves pulls up over Starling rims out Georgia Tech started this game 0 for four from the floor and that thing is if its not turnovers as tough to you see gari come over with the block but Starling in the corner in the right spot to knock down the three you see Syracuse on a 70 run right now a lot of that is the perimeter guys from Syracuse coming out being able to make Georgia take pay Starling two for two from Beyond The Arc in the opening three and a half minutes George found an open shot unable to connect thats one the jackets need that pass was off the backboard its like a Globe Trotters event here Starling he check kapari rebounds George on the drive to the corner for Kelly for three good recognition by Nathan George got down there didnt force up a shot realize he had Miles Kelly right in the corner and thats what Georgia te has to do theyve got to be able to break Syracuse down get to their second and third Applause options 12 to shoot Starling gives it back to Taylor who discovers mince Juda left all alone not sure that was how Damon stat wanted to play defense there but it worked out okay George again is is getting into the paint Brian hes been able to maneuver himself to create some penetration and thats one of the things thats going to pay off for them you see Kelly but another that comes up short long rebound tracked by kaasi Reeds Jr and fouls going on Bell thats his first and allows everybody to catch their breath JJ St you basically talk about what hes done not only Tech but just the dynasty that hes had a hand in I mean how many games that has he won for that Chiefs team wow he accounted for 13 of the 25 points this past Sunday in Vegas wow you think about it like that that is that is what I call a g including the 57 y longest field goal in Super Bowl history tie up aggression being unloaded Dongo and brown message prior to the tie up dungo got a chance to get a little glass and you see both guys fighting over for it and you know your coaches you like to see your guys this is these are the 5050 balls you want to see your guys get down there and scrap for Arrow belongs to Georgia Tech after cuse won the tip George didnt have anywhere to go and jacket turn it over but then Kelly pokes it away from Taylor cerent into the game and Georgia Tech ball see weve talked about Georgia Tekken when they have these these scoring droughts a lot of times they dont stick to the script you got to get down to your second you cannot always take the first option thats in front of you weve seen him already has some costly turnovers and not getting good shot quality you have to make sure you run your assists this is a Syracuse team you see a good pass down to Kyle stur right there but also you got to come up and make shots Bell tracks down the rebound yeah making shots has been the tricky part Georgia Tech one for Nader Copelands in the game how good was he doing so many little things against the Tar Heels on Tuesday Chris bell comes up short Dongo grabs another rebound its his third Stan penetrates in the lane kick out passers deflected still found its way to Kelly Copeland making an impact defensively again and thats where Copeland is at his best you see the Finish oh my God you see Malik Brown the dump off in the finish that was an orange tsunami making its way down the floor five on nothing it looked like Malik Browns first Deuce third of it open burries it and good recognition by Miles Kelly realized that Kyle Sturman was wide open and again for Georgia Tech ball movement you have to get down to you multiple options Georgia Tech two of three from Deep 0 for seven from inside the ark what does that say you well it says to me that theyre getting the uncontested shots and then what theyre doing is theyre staying in the game because of their defense doing a good job of limiting Syracuse from getting the paint St it finds the open man and Dango lays it in heres the thing too you see Georgia Tech get the stops and theyre getting out in transition they may not be getting fast breaks but they getting early offense weve seen them be able to get good defense and turn it in some early opportunities on The Fast Break Jack back within one mince playing through the contact and scores regardless I mean that those are pro movies when you watch Judah minz and his ability to score the ball he will not allow you to speed him up hes able to get wherever he wants whenever he wants 14 point shy of 1000 just his second year at Syracuse going to wave off the basket fouls on the floor against Malik Brown and now heres the thing for Georgia te you talked earlier about Nathan George he has been able to use that pick and roll to turn the corner and get whenever he wants to the paint Adrien Entre going a little bit deeper into his bench the first half Kyle cuff Jr has not played the last three games the oranges in for the first time in a couple weeks number zero the guard from Harlem transfer from Kansas they dealt with a tough knee injury Brown rebounds the cerent Miss see Syracuse mixing up their coverages dropping back into a Zone there qu dear Applause Copeland Kelly finds Claude mat perfectly at The Rim by Bell and the orange will take over hey great defense and rotation by Chris Bell what looked like it was going to be a wide open layup Bale good rotation stayed solid by going straight up in vertical it was fun chatting with red ay before the game you and red go back a long long way Brian we do we go back uh I remember being a counselor at what used to be the a BCD Camp up in Jersey and being from going into my senior season red was an upcoming senior in high school you were four years ahead of him and then you had a huge senior year and he was like I know that guy oh he was a he was a great player I dont think that got enough credit for the type of player what he was you see another pass CLA able to finish but heres the thing is that you are seeing Georgia Tech theyre using their Pace getting the stop getting that ear ear offense and their bigs are running right towards the rim Georgia Tech jobs guards doing a good job of finding Applause them shot clock at 12 Syracuse wanted a ball screen copelan floats it inside Brown tough catch kicks it extra feed for Bell got it thats where you talk about rotation you pass up a good shot for a bad shot that last time it started with Copeland copelan didnt force anything gets the ball out of his hands you get a wide open three nice expl the man for GU has been F hasnt really been able to score thats the way to get it going re just has a rip and goes straight to the Applause bucket mince was looking for a foul didnt get it and a lengthy stretch of uninterrupted basketball were not complaining Miles Kelly thats a nice Rhythm you caught it we talked about Miles Kelly hes got a chance to get going you can tell Zion Williamsons Duke freshman scoring record today 35 points for the Blue Devils in Tallahassee and they were playing with Tyrese Proctor so he stepped up Georgia Tech has its first lead of the game after the last Miles Kelly three mince circles the wagons Copeland fakes it takes it oh man but hold on but did you see him put it through his legs first I mean and I thought we talked with Adrian AR we talked about Copeland this is a guy that pretty much plays with swag and theres a lot of things that last move was unbelievable he got style thats for sure and hes also got one foul as he bumped Kelly on the way to the ring but check it out first I mean okay watch hes he puts the ball through his leg and then goes and gives you a little bit of a finger roll there I mean I love watching him play because he just plays with swag I I love it this is the guy thats plays with a chip on his shoulder ask red ay just I want to ask you about quader Copeland he just starts giggling like hes just that type of guy he crashed crashed Reds press conf after the Carolina win on Tuesday night contested Corner three wont go battle for the rebound tipped and controlled by Applause Syracuse mince has started two of five from the floor starlings two for three this is Chris Bell its followed by Kyle cuff J if your Dam start you have to be frustrated because again you play solid defense and then you give up a a run a run at the rim for got a finish you see great defense Again by Chris Bell hu on a little bit of a run fouls going on Reeves we talked about for s getting in transition and them getting in transition is not so much always to get the fast break its to get into their early offense theyve got guys that are Dynamic that can go upstairs Georgia Tech for the most part has done a good job but they have to turn and rebound because you got guys that are coming and crashing offensive class that was what Damon STM felt toss the jackets in South Ben the steel for stur and the score what have we seen in this first half is that in half court Georgia Tech hasnt really had a chance to really get a lot but when they can get deflections they can get Steals and get in that early offense they put a lot of pressure on Syracuse in this first half no doubt about it mince first Stan foul on Kyle his first and heres the thing we talked about Menon and his ability to be able to score he puts a lot of pressure on just defenses because this is a guy that can basically penetrate you saw him create shots and its hard for Georgia to take at some point theyre going to have to send multiple I think theyre built for for doing a lot of things in the tournament we apologize for what we understand weve just learned was technical difficulties Brian and I have had a good seat court side were fortunate we apologize and hopefully no more issues the rest of the night been an entertaining first 13 minutes Brian Syracuse shooting 40 from the floor and uh second personal foul going against Chris Bell so Taylor comes back off the orange bench P Georgia Tech Dongo is the guy for me thats got to get going hes had some really good games you know has come up short Syracuse is doing a good job of liming his touches and his ability to get to the cup heres the two three weve got used to seeing over the past four decades Dongo on the offensive glass youre talking about and thats where he at his best because hes a high energy guy you know hes long athletic and being able to get going is definitely going to give Damon stmy an inside presence something that they desperately need six points for the Freshman Applause Dongo AJ Starling Started Hot hit a couple threes in the opening minutes hasnt scored since then this is quader Copeland rebound for gari Here Comes thiran orange back in the two3 youve got to attack that middle part of the Zone entering tonight according to Synergy the stat tracking software Syracuse has played Zone its less than 20 of the time this year but over the past three games it has more prevalent watch but the collapse that last time when dungle got the ball there are three guys around him Min about the three gives it up to Taylor orange coaching staff wanted their team to move they did not move enough and its George Tech Ball but heres the thing is that when Judah Miss gets the ball there are three Georgia Tech Defenders you got the on ball player and then theyre surrounding him right now you see the officials confirming Georgia take ball if youre Syracuse you got to make that ball pop because Georgia Tech is literally sitting down JJ Starling is another weapon if youre Jud men you go ahead and allow him to get cooking its going to free it up for you later ster said yesterday you know were going to be in position to win the game against zuse we just have to go do it and thats what youve seen with this Georgia Tech Team theyve had six games where theyve been up plus five and multiple occasions lost the game they have those laws of scoring droughts where when you put it they get a little bored with doing whats been working hows going on cuse Taylor battling for position inside with Dongo yeah thats where Dongo let you see feel his presence number two on Justin Taylor and thats an opportunity where if youre Justin Taylor you got to get in front of dong go you dont want to give him those offensive rebounds and the putbacks by Dongo currently fourth in the nation among freshman in rebounds per game number two in the nation among freshman in field goal percentage it is astonishing thinking about it after the fact that Georgia Tech beat North Carolina here mostly without Dongo remember he collided with Harrison Ingrams knee less five minutes into the game but the thing that that during that game it was the level of conf consistency on both sides of the floor but youre seeing for Georgia Tech right now is theyre up 2221 a lot of that is their ability to be able to limit the Syracuse team from getting to the PACE to the paint against Carolina Syracuse was able to break them down Georgia Tak in the first half is doing a better job of doing that gets underneath Loops it back out starling H driving on gari pretty good defense by Tara block down at three Taylor needs to fire good defensive rebounding there both Dongo and George attack and the other end looking High a foul before the follow kapari will get free is stay in front and not have to force weak side help has really been something thats helped him this first half is that a gouch scad scad you got it folks who havent watched Tara gapar this year he is an unreal athlete sophomore from New Zealand parents moved from Zimbabwe to New Zealand right before he was born hes got Oodles of potential turn by the way and if youre Syracuse you see Georgia te mixing it up you see the shot by Judah Min thats a little bit of a bailout I feel like you got to try to move that zone get into those gaps and force the help and then pass the shot you see Copeland being able to finish that shot hes hes a fun player to watch plays with a lot of emotion yep hes got style and hes got four points make it five points now for quader somehow that pass got all the way through to gari but it was almost automatic dong go had in his mind before he got it he was pass it to gari it was just that Taylor fell down but Georgia Tech has done a better job of understanding against this Zone get inside the middle of it Force the help and you get good things have happened for them Taylor passes up the shot Min does not fry iron no good rebound Kelly kapari to the wow talk about the athleticism in the length how about gapar right there again Georgia obviously made his first two threes and he missed his heat check hes only taken one field goal attempt though in the last 15 minutes or so and thats the guy that I think that they need to get going if you can get him rolling again that thats going to open up for Judah minz Georgia Tech is focused on him but you know JJ Starling is that guy to you got to get him going you see a nice move by by Copeland came up short on that quickness but quader unable to convert at the cup Kelly Rising Fire for three and again Georgia get an early offense realizing you got a wide open Miles Kelly we talked about Kelly needs to show up and I like the fact this first half is Let The Game come to him as knock down some timely shots seven nothing run over the last minute drought continues for Syracuse Taylor comes up short good start today for Justin hes 0 for four steel for Syracuse Starling the theft and the Finish plus the foul thats exactly what the orange needed and again Starling we talked about him EV as hes one of those guys that if you allow him to get into the open transition active Hands by by starting to get out and then watch just gets downhill you see not set hes able to gather himself absorb the contact and the Finish opportunity to get the threepoint play the oldfashioned way Brian one of the accs good writers Luke de of the Raleigh news and observer wrote a piece today about how fewer offensive fouls have been called this year compared to last year say last season there was about 37 offensive fouls per game this year its down to 22 its a drastic drop and its all because of the rule change with the with the officials calling that block charge differently and I think that was a situation that last year might have been a charge absolutely Dongo has it poked away the fouls on George Who undercut the hustling Min they both took a beating on that one though but how many times have we seen Syracuse and their active hands be able to come up and steal the ball this last time you see again goes for that ball comes up with the foul but the energy from the Syracuse bigs and the guards I think thats allowing them to be able to get back but has done a good job of being able to maintain this lead one and one for minz by the way George just picked up his second personal foul with 217 to Applause go those are cley missed front ends George stain in the game with two fouls that pass looking for Doo if youre gapar you cannot turn it over have to swing that ball Copeland again trying to be a showman hits the bottom of the back geia tech with numbers now Copeland just now getting back into the play if youre D going you get that ball at the free throw line you got to careful get that again it looked to be almost three consecutive turnovers my goodness Dongo just threw an outlet pass to start the fast break and lays it in time out George Jud minz within 12 points of a thousand and Damon stamer has had that look of disgust on his face too often lately for Georgia Tech fans to stay wide anytime that that b b gets inside were were scrapping at it we want to go ahead and have the active hands because Georgia Tech has shown that they will turn it over if Im Damon St I I tell my guys to be patient do not try to hit the Home Run let that ball move lets shift that Syracuse Zone and ball security value the basketball because you literally have allowed Syracuse to get back in the game with your own turnovers Brian is a Georgia Tech guy and this is the first Georgia Tech game youve this year curious to get your general thoughts on Damon St what was your reaction when he was hired how well did you know him before he took this job so I had known Damon for some time before because just in you know the inner circle of being an X NBA guy and you come across I thought it was an amazing hire because again I knew that he uh the type of Staff he would bring in here and then obviously the recruiting being able to recruit the Georgia Inter Metro Atlanta area bringing the talent in would be great you see again J getting downhill talking about a guy that puts a lot of pressure but back to the point I thought theyve had done some really good things obviously in year one we talked about the fact that it takes time you know with the transer port portal allows you to get good early um but then theyve done some good things theyve come up short that you see Georgia Tech coming up emptyhanded again this is one of those droughts that have plagued the jackets lately 70 run would have been a 10 run if Bell could have hit that shot and even though Georgia T is still up two I feel like theres a shift in the momentum it feels like Syracuse is basically gotten a little momentum going here but Georgia T got to get an easy bucket thatll work but heres the thing you saw kapari get it he took his time no one came to him and he knocked down a simple shot stick with whats gotten you here you dont have to reinvent the will youre Georgia Tech stay solid but if youre Syracuse continue move that ball attack the gaps and put pressure on their perimeter despite nine turnovers Georgia Tech leads by four final five seconds of the half Starling air Ms one and thats the end of the opening stanza here at mamish Orange jumped in front 19 years ago Georgia Tech played its first basketball game they lost to Auburn but they bounced back with two wins Over Georgia and what time was just moderately hate clean oldfashioned there wasnt as much hate I was going to say before you decide to try to be funny no I did not play in that game do not ask me how many points did I score those three gam you were at the game nice try nicey coming starting the half Ive always looked at the second half as the first five minutes and enough Im Syracuse if Im if Im Adrian alra I tell my guys hey we got to try to get downhill even though Georgia Tech playing his Zone we dont want to settle as you see Judah Miss go right back at of his with the contact youre three for 17 and if Im Damon St I tell my guys we want to continue to attack the paint and we have to Value the basketball nine turnovers is way too many eight points in the first half for Judah minz hes currently 10 shy of a thousand in his Syracuse career scad free throw is good or is Po from the new movie Kung Fu pan 4 might say scad dont miss Kung Fu Panda 4 only in theaters March 8th you know next time I play a little pick up basketball every time I score Im GNA start yelling that out SC in your face SC that could be your new tagline know what hey do you know kung fu yeah Im not convinced so look Georgia Tech had a first half that you could say was a microcos the season they were down they were up they were sloppy they were exciting and they come up empty on the first trip of the second half as Dongo picks up the foul good news is its only his first and going back to Georgia Tech is that they have to make sure that they do not create their own issues because again this is a team that has shown that they will have lows well they wont value the basketball theyll get outside of what they normally do against the Syracuse team youre going to have to be very consistent did you see that move by JJ Starling youve seen two times Starling be able to get downhill to his right hand that is by Design and if youre Georgia Tech you got to force him to another Direction get him to his weak hand some kind iron there helping JJ Starling on that Runner kick ball will keep it with Georgia Tech jacket been called for three fouls in the first minute of the second half does that matter no heres the thing is I you want them to be aggressive and in the zone and going back and forth you just got to stay solid but Syracuse again weve talked about their perimeter guys theyre going to put a lot of pressure on you to stay in front by Dongo scores what a move and that was a tough two because Dango was able to put the ball on the floor we talked in the first half J Techs going to need his production hes going to to put his head down and attack the bucket Taylor did not score in the first half thats the way he wanted to get the second half started but heres thing you saw that last time Taylor not settling for the outside shot that Georgia Tech is giving him hes trying to close that Gap and get to the bucket second foul on Jud Kelly nine points in the first half all from Beyond The Arc looking for three more rebound pulled down by Reeves stur if youre Kyle stur you got to shoot that shot yes he did there were two guys one guy was guarding tried to be a little cute threw it in the defense Taylor feeling it or not seventh rebound Miles Kelly Syracuse bench wanted to travel they might have a case but Ka Reed scores Reeds doing a good job of being able to attack the paint and then getting that separation again you dont want to settle did you see a travel there on the catch I did I thought I saw a little a little Texas twostep going on Taylor not shy comes up short again stur at the rebound this time he takes it Miss fires getting some half decent looks here three minutes gone second half me step back all of a sudden both teams have gone cold well and you look at the shot call that last time if youre D the men thats the shot that you won Adrian AR cant be upset about that if youre Georgia Tech you got to continue to move the ball and youre spacing Kelly to Dongo off balance EV Im Dongo bring the ball down gather yourself you dont need to make the highight Applause play weird VI to this game right now tied at 36 mince nope Kari the rebound and if youre Judah miss you have to make sure that you stay on balance just because you get a chance to get that shot up does that mean that thats a good shot and so again whichever team can stick to being disciplined with their looks and running their sets is probably going to be able to expand this lead thats a huge shot for Kyle stur and it was because again I still thought it was a contested shot but then when you Kyle stur he was able to come up that pick and roll and get a good look at it and then basically finish it if youre Syracuse you got to find a way to continue to get Applause downhill mins Applause turn gives it up for JJ Starling cant connect rebound Dongo all of a sudden Geor Tech back up by five oh nice pass it is nice pass good back door for M by Kelly good dime by Kyle stur that was pretty Kelly in a double better job of being able to get some shots to go I mean the only offense for Syracuse has been JJ Starling and Judah menz uh the Zone it seems has slowed them down a little bit but as you know see you see Starling get downhill Georgia T is doing a better job of taking care of the ball you see Syracuse falling back in that zone Georgia take a close out the first half did a better job of be able to get the ball inside and capitalize on that you dont want to stay just east and west and end up throwing up a threepoint shot stur shooting over Malik Brown gets it to go but did you see that stur call for that pick and so by calling for a pick it allowed him to touch the paint and basically get a better shot again if youre Syracuse you have to step up and again this Zone that Georgia is plan they got to find a way you see the penetration and finish by Judah mince that snaps the N nothing run for Georgia Tech mince now within six of a thousand 58th game of mins career only five players in Syracuse All Time have reached a th000 points in fewer games games than Judi if he can get there today its a pretty illustrious list Timeout on the floor 14 minutes to go in that coveted ninth spot which means they wouldnt have to play on Tuesday in DC it advance to the second round in play the8 n match up to start Wednesday winding down Reeves cant connect rebound Brown hey good defensive possession by Syracuse Kyle want to come off you saw not being able to get any clearance youre Syracuse you got to find a way to chip away at this lead likely to be a guy who will be involved in that process Copeland unable to finish Bri te doing a pretty good job defensively in the interior defending without fouling is that theyre doing a good job of staying one one man in front of the ball that would have given Georgia Tech his largest lead of the night but stur was off the mark M again comes up short rebound ripped Away by s and you seeing some of those shots that failed in the first half with J the men coming up a little short for him in the second half Kelly takes it rebound Tipp by Reeves but mince has it one on Two and a foul wave off the basket see coach Adrian audre lobbying for the an one watch this last play again Syracuse you want to get downhill you the men realize hes got Kyle stur it you know its good thing Im sitting in next to you because for me the foul was called he gathered not sure why he wouldnt give them the n one in continuation on that one D is good but he not Trey Young tournament is third 14 by the way who you got tonight in the uh the Steph vers Sabrina ThreePoint Shootout hey man Im I love Steph but Im going with Sabrina and esue I just my gut tells me shes got that swag I think Steph has got the pressure but she is amazing I Im Im serious I really feel like she shes going to go first and shes going to put the pressure on step excited to watch it later this evening Copeland unable to connect Syracuse has gone ice cold here theyre one for their last 10 but heres the thing is that Georgia Tech is forcing them into two tough twos and then Syracuse still has not found a rhythm behind the arc Claud got poked in the eye able to get it back out Claude feeling good enough to get the ball inside hes bumped its on Bell its no theyre giving it to Copeland quader now has three so one of the things Evan that Georgia te has done in this second half against the SE Syracuse zone is that theyve been able to get inside that zone that last time you saw getting the ball right in the Sako and then he found Claw on that low Baseline Geor got to continue to do that Nate George has not scored in this game and Georgia Tech has turned it over a bunch still up by 10 in the second half and the guy whos given them the shot of offense Off the Bench Kyle sturup it that last time could have gotten into the pain had a step back that shows me a goddess actually in a nice rhythm is feeling Applause it theres some Syracuse fans out there who are thinking oh this is predictable yes of course were going to beat North Carolina at home and then lose to one of the bottom teams in the ACC the nature of college basketball it es and flows thats what makes the great teams great being able to produce consistently game in game out can the orange dig themselves out of a hole on the road Jack lead by 10 I mean I I got your back bro I know shes going to be watching that great to see your wife and daughter here at the game today big Georgia Tech fans yeah my daughter is a eighth grader and shes gotten more into watching basketball and mens and womens and so you look right now Georgia Tech on a 122 run you and her will be watching womens basketball at noon tomorrow in the C absolutely will Jack gets wolf pack up in Raleigh Syracuse two at the line for Copeland interesting going to break there we saw Copeland and mince conversing somewhat aggressively somehow that layup didnt go in but another chance s of it would have been a big bucket the rebound finds Brown and Loops it ahead Starling all the way and its a sixpoint game a great for the Syracuse Orange because again up until then they had been struggling only 25 4 for 13 in this second half theyve got to be able to generate some early offense and get that rhythm going we were talking about it with red ay before the game though to some outside perspectives may have looked like the players were jawing at each other or arguing but thats coach ays imprint on the program he wants guys to be aggressive and have that sort of fiery style yeah he encourages them to be interactive because again when you see him I remember him back when he was a player he was a guy that played with a chip and you see hes animated he wants to have the conversations he wants these guys to be able to have input but right now theyve got to find a way to continue to get back in this game down only six because Georgia Tech has not been shooting the lights out of it find a way because now Georgia taks in that in that manto man Zone get down H you got two guys or actually three on the floor that could go get a bucket Georgia Tech after getting out rebounded by n and Southend on Wednesday has a plus 13 Edge on the glass today JJ Starling again comes up short Second Chance Starling scores 60 run for C and thats what it is is that you get the second chance opportunities between Copeland mince and also Starling youve got three guys on the perimeter that can put the ball on the floor and attack and make Georgia Tech P oh wide open underneath easiest two of the season for dong and great recognition by gari he had three guys rather than trying to force through it realize he had Dongo wide open by himself under the bucket orange just three for 20 from Beyond The Arc 14 for 28 from two clear 50 thats a good look and great recognition Evan by JJ Starling he realized when he turned the corner the big Georgia Tech didnt commit youre able to get close nice little Runner I would continue to try to milk that as long as Georgia Tech stays in that manto man and gari missed a great opportunity down low and George Teck had a lot of success with getting that high that high man right there and then getting the ball down low gari you got to shoot that ball underneath Carter Murphy steps out of B BS his first action of the night heres the thing for Syracuse space Georgia take out and then you go and you go right at them get downhill Hopeland almost lost it but maintains possession heres Bell turned away n minutes to go in the game Bell takes it airball three for 21 from Deep not sure that was the shot that Adrian alry wanted I thought if youre bill you could have gotten by the man and gotten to the cup Kelly RI down by Bell but poked away and stolen by gari Locker charge how about neither oh wow Kari scores in the play because again Kari basically went on and was able to avoid the charge kapari the fourth yellow jacket into double figures nce probing Copeland Baseline three up fakes and around the rimin in yeah there two opportunities where refs decide to keep the whistle in their in their pocket theyre allowing both teams to be able to play Copeland did a good job of being able to absorb that contact and finish Copeland averaging double figures in compsons play hes got nine today under eight minutes Kelly from the corner Dongo has done an unbelievable job on the glass today and Georgia Tech convert Another Second Chance opportunity shot clock winding down third of it gets it to Kelly another try Dongo keeps it alive again Dongo and gari for Georgia Tech are dominating the glass and a foul is going against Syracuse the feeling of frustration for the rific life can revisit our keys to the game in the process Brian yeah one of the things for Syracuse was attack the paint and right now you see 28 points in the paint for Syracuse theyve shown that that when they can get past Georgia teen put pressure and get downhill theyve been successful successful but for Georgia Tech the guy has come in has been huge for them off the bench is Kyle sturen today already 13 points 5 for 12 but I think its been his shot making ability especially shooting from downtown thats really helped him extend this lead and maintain it Stan scored single digits in his last four games after he had been really hot in the previous five stman 13 points Off the Bench one of four jackets and double figures eight rebound rebounds a piece for gongo and Kelly kapari has seven boards kapari from the elbow rebounded by Copeland but thats a shot hes got to take you got to be able to get the ball inside you cant get bored with whats been working Syracuse playing that zone youre able to get into the the teeth of it again a Syracuse again look at the mismatches good pass by copelan and theyve been able to do that you run that pick and roll and then you get the dump off thats whats been working for you Malik Brown just his second basket of the game only a second field goal attempt knocked Away by Brown orange with a chance to tie cuff that was go tending 52 all this is what we saw the the first part of the first half Syracuse was able to play that zone active hands hit those steals get out in transition you see right here you see cuff go up and it looks like right there Dongo touches the ball gets his hand on it official signal that theyre going to take a look at it during the next break with clearly a gend and it should be 52 all ball security has got to be huge for Dongo when he gets that ball right around the free throw line because again once he gets it then you know that Syracuse is coming up there for a big you have to make a quick decision even youre putting the ball on the floor youre making a pass but you cannot sit there and play with it Syracuse is way too active right now donga gets the bounce but you see what just happened he basically realized soon as I get it Ive got to make a play he turned around because again you have Malik Brown thats basically a couple of feet off of him we basically got a sixminute basketball game here in Atlanta Syracuse and Georgia Tech Copeland kicks it Corner three is good for Chris B and the play was set up by C because again he was able to get down and break down the defense caught everyone focused on him good cross pass to get that wide open Corner three reaching foul against Brown yeah still same with dungo when you catch that that ball off the bracket long Outlet pass was dangerous from the moment it left thrower hands a h play by Kyle stur you run your offense get your set last thing you do when you want to throw up something and oh my gosh throwing up something that was something yeah and if youre Nathan George you dont want to go for a home run play again Sako is not a guy thats going to go ahead and play Above the Rim like that Damon t with a coach teams in there that can definitely go to the final four ton of talent and lead the orang its a 176 run over the last six plus minutes quick catch and shoot almost wedged in there Sak pulls down the rebound Here Comes Applause Turan through the Dongo screens Stan for three got not why not K St you pass under as they talk about a guy thats taking advantage of the moment Kyle Sturman has come in knocking down those threes Applause average fewer than five points per game in his last four but hes got 16 today 11 since halftime copelan shoves it inside thats the 17 foul on Georgia Tech and watch Kyle sturbing basically when he realizes that you pass under Dongo does a good job of being able to set that pick and he shoots that three already 16 points we talked about a Georgia Tech team that sometimes struggles to find points but theyve done a good job so far this afternoon four guys in double digits and you got a guy in Kyle Sturman comes off the bench with 16 remember in the first half Judah Mintz missed the front end of a one one this is the same situation here from Malik Brown not not quite a squad battles it in Im going to give him a Squad you are all in on the panda Im all in on it Im all in and we are tied 57 all and you and I talked about this we thought that this is going to come down you know to whoever has the ball game the ball uh last and has been runs by both teams against this two three Zone Kelly for three rebounded by Dongo he missed the lay third chance for Georgia Tech as we tick under four minutes we talked to Adrian Al you see it Kyle thats a heat check by Kyle thir deep three and the foul on Reeves another one and one for Syracuse after the timeout 354 to go to win interesting to see as you come into the gut of the game Evan which team can impose their will for Syracuse theyve had success when able to break Tech and get to the paint but Georgia Tech that Syracuse Zone if you can get inside that zone pass up good shots it gives good things for you one and one here for CER Copeland out of the timeout one thing that has stood out for Syracuse this year games decided by 15 or fewer theyre 13 and two theyve also lost seven times by more than 15 and another missed front end of a one and one for the orange its their second of the day those are gut punches orange back in the two3 I think it interesting that Adrian alter is decide to go into his Zone you know in good of the game because theyve had success Georgia Techs got a lot of rebounds Second Chances against the Zone Stan hangs in the air gets it to clae who missed the layup Dongo and Claude now battling each other two other orange there as well its a jump ball thats a bunny if youre claw you got to finish that down there but again Adrian alry talked about the thing thats really important for them is rebounding d s just got a new piece of gum Georgia Tech is eight for 17 on layups another chance up and under it D and heres the thing one of the things thats worked for Georgia Tech against that zone is you get it right there at the free throw line you force The Bigs to have to come up that backside guy in Dongo watch the fact Dango gets the ball gathers himself absorbs that contact from Copeland is able to finish Georgia T has done a good job of that four fouls on cordier Copeland d able to complete the threepoint play rebound Tapped Out controlled by Mint you talked about the fact that close games favor for Syracuse at 13 and 12 and two is because theyve got guys in Jud the Min and a guy like Copeland that can finish because theyve got guys that you can throw the ball to can tell to go get you a bucket back outside C no Applause good if youre Georgia Tech possessions are everything you want want to go with whats working again against this Zone youve had success in getting the ball in the middle and you force it to go inside out Miles Kelly is a guy that they desperately need to be able to make up shot because he has been a little absent as of late wasy Rees comes up short long rebound Tracked Down by the shooter and if youre Syracuse youve got to go and get those its gting rebound You got to go and lock down those defensive rebounds they played zone so sparingly this year crunch time moments loose ball scooped up by m cuff is all alone stman joins him and meets him at The Rim but a foul was called you see cuw looked like he was going to go upstairs to the upper room and Kyle Stan told him not so fast again you say well look like a breakaway DK how about Kyle stur of it comes back gets a piece of it and again watch that replay thats a foul thats a foul because he got him with the body he may have gotten a little ball but its clear was in contact with the body thats number four on Sturman free throw good or as Po from the new movie Kung Fu Panda 4 might say SC dont miss Kung Fu Panda 4 only in theaters March 8th for the tie Applause no h 10 of 15 from the line that includes two missed front ends of one and ones under two minutes in a onepoint game Dongo had it poked away its George Tech ball 14 to shoot under two minutes they can review it so everybody can take a deep breath grab his Snickers and The Bigs from Georgia Tech theyve got to have ball secured because every time that ball goes around Syracuse so Im looking at Georgia Tech playing manto man and if Im Adrian alry I continue to spread them out because you got a guy in Judah men JJ Starling that can easily get by the tech Defenders pretty good defense by Applause Dongo Copeland hes an adventure tend to shoot Starling pretty good defense from ja solid defense by Miles Kelly because again you want to stay solid and force him in the contested shot that last time Starling was able to get there but then you forced him to shoe over contested Reeds doesnt get the bounce closing in in a minute to play in a onepoint game orange only have one timeout left any Georgia Tech foul would be two Applause shots mince puts it up and he has just not gotten the bouns today but the foul is on Malik Brown that last shot by Judah menah again Georgia te is forcing him to his off hand if Im Adrian alre I try to see if he can get that and you see this last foul here you see kapari comes up with it and that last time it looked like Malik Brown reached in there committed the foul one thing Georgia Techs done well is they havent sent Judah Min to the free throw line they have not two for three from the line big possession for Georgia Tech if you can get the ball inside without turning it over if youre Syracuse you want to stay solid soon as that ball goes in you want to have active hands and you got to lock up a Applause rebound jackets by one final minute 12 in the shot clock cerent has had the hot hand finds Kelly with a left hand the foul Miles Kelly and that was the guy you need to make a play I thought that play was set up by penetration by Kyle Applause stur watch the little running you see Co up with the left you see Malik Brown come over able to absorb the contact and flex on him Brian let me tell you Miles Kelly is channeling his inner dragon warrior and yes that is part of the Kung Fu Panda 4 promo only in theaters March 8th Malik Brown just fouled out for the first time today munir hea is entering the game with 35 Point 315 seconds left so heres the thing Georgia Tech already up by three important for Kelly to make this because now what youre doing is making it a two possession ball game with 31 seconds if youre Syracuse you if he does miss it you box out and youve got to secure this rebound thats a big Scott dou for Miles Kelly fourpoint lead for George attch M to the basket and Dongo called for the foul good move but love the decision by Judah men to try to get downtown but that down downhill because now what you do is you go to the free throw line get a chance to get two points and still stop the clock Jah Min hasnt gotten the line of T but hes still draw seven fouls today two for three from the strike these are Applause significant now the advantage Syracuse has they got seven team fouls so the next two times they fouled Georgia techet one and one that puts more pressure on the shooter well and heres the thing is that assuming that Judah men is going to make this make this shot if youre Georgia Tech you have to be careful with the basketball because Syracuse has guys that active 62 60 youre Syracuse you dont have to foul immediately what you try to do is you force the ball to go into the corners try to get Georgia taken to some type of trap theyre trapped stur right in front of the Syracuse pinch and a fouls called they had Kyle Sturman where they wanted him not sure who the foul was and again you talk about right there there active hands not sure yeah you see the reaching right there back Copeland with the left hand watch right here do you have it where you want copelans going to go ahead and body him and theres that left hand right there got caught with his hand in the cookie jar thats his fifth nine points three rebounds two assists and 30 minutes off the bench for quader Copeland Georgia Tech will shoot a one and one be stament his first three throws of the day hes 88 from the line this season and this is a one and one for number one there big free throw and again for this for Georgia Tech Kyle sturdivan has been the one thats carried this ball Club in the second half the shot making Damon star there a guy that shoots 88 from the free throw line one for two but the rebound for Doo he had it and he lost it and its in the corner Georgia Tech got it and mil Kelly will now shoot one and one Syracuse got the Miss they needed Brian he yeah that was the M we talked again you have to lock up that free throw excuse me the rebound and again you get the miss that you want and then Dongo comes up with that offensive rebound keeps it live frustration for Adrien alry again youre still only down three Georgia Tech still has to make these free throws you still have 18 seconds left to go in the game Big Time hustle from Dongo Kelly one and one fourpoint game time out Dam 181 left in a fivepoint game and Syracuse do you think they need a three that has not Jack at 10 of 12 from the line today and Evan if youre Georgia Tech you see them extending you do not want to give Syracuse an easy run you want to force them to take some time off the clock to Starling back to mince open three missed it D rebounds falls to the ground see Dongo they call it foul or a travel they call a travel Dongo fall knocked him over little friendly fire so Syracuse still clinging to the flickering life theyve got tonight Le Cel cleans off the game ball Syracuse just needs a basket immediately orange do have one timeout Starling for two nope that shot has not been there all night and Georgia Tech is Victorious because of it Jack is Win It 6560 Damon team gets off the
