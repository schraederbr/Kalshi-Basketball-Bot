today as the tigers head coach in his 11th season already the alltime winningest mens basketball coach clemson history brownell looking for a milestone and that guy hoping to spoil the show here in south carolina Music tim clackerty throws it up in the air and were underway hemingway trying to pick up where he left off on wednesday scored 17 in winstonsalem knocks down a three 15 seconds in and evan thats one of the reasons why hemingway is in the lineup because this is a very good defensive team that sometimes has a problem with scoring good look for him to come out and knock down that first three of the game he was an efficient scorer on wednesday too bryan 17 points on seven field goal attempts five of six from three the rebound for hunter tyson we know miami is shorthanded Applause and yet these two teams have typically played close games last four meetings over the last few years decided by five points or less but its six nothing tigers as sims connects from outside again we talked in the open about amir sims and the fact that hes a mismatch youve got a guy like walker guarding him he has the option to take him inside and out i got a dual threat because he cant stretch the defense for knocking down the three sims knocked down three early threes in the game in florida back on january 2nd its early but you feel miami needs that one to go down and isaiah wong delivers well you talked about miami and them being shorthanded but theyve got a really solid five when you look at where they are on the perimeter and the fact that theyve got three guys at alanahi and mcgusty and obviously wong they can put points on the board its just a matter of how fast they come out you see hemingway with another jump shot clemson coming out star now strong hemingway feeling it and the steal for honor but the rebound for walker hurricanes in their last game losing to florida state by 17 as isaiah wong gets two more its been a really tough stretch from a scheduling standpoint before the hurricanes with battles with florida state obviously a tough one last saturday against georgia tech and it doesnt get any easier this week they go to charlottesville next and every one of the things we talked about is that clemson has won four in a row miami loses a four and so for them thats big is that theyve got to start out with a lot of energy cant fall behind early especially against this team this team with clemson in their defense amir sims not this time and wong flies in for the rebound anthony walkers become a really solid consistent scorer lately for the hurricanes draws the foul on hunter tyson walker scoring in double figures seven times in his last eight ball games after doing it just three times in his first dozen and thats thats the guy for me is the wild card today for miami is that walker gives you a lot of opportunities for scoring and defense again we talked about the backcourt guys but i think for them to win the day they need some production for him he doesnt have to have a big solid day but hes got to get up into the teams getting some offense from nasir brooks would be a bonus too keeps it alive olani to the basket lofted off him out of bounds clemson ball one of the things youll see about this clemson team that makes them so good is that they play solid defense do a really good job of being able to help weak side come up with a lot of deflections that last time being able to force that turnover jonathan bears in the game for the tigers brad brunell has much more substitution freedom than jim laranega has because of the depth on his bench on or off the mark from deep rebound cameron mcgusty augustines another guy that the hurricanes would like to get going brooks from the baseline nothing but dead well if you jim laranega you have to be ecstatic with how your team has come out and started out right now again we talked in the last few games against florida state and georgia tech they were really slow as far as the start right now doing a good job of being able to knock down shots early both teams are three for five as honor rises up and makes the tigers four of six and nick honor is a guy that i really dont think it allowed a lot of credit because of what hes been able to do this is a guy a couple of games ago hit the gamewinner against georgia tech i love his ability to be able to get in and play within himself and take the offense as he comes a couple games ago but two and a half three weeks ago now considering the second coveted pause that this tiger team has endured as hey wong has come to play hes hit his first three shots and this is one of those matchups that ive been circling to between honor and uh wong wong is able to get to the the point where he can shoot over him hemingway cools off its amazing how easy at times isaiah wong makes it look at the offensive end well and the thing is with no likes hes taking a lot of responsibility you see anthony walker feeling it again how about the offensive outburst from miami again this is the team that has struggled in the past in the first half doing a good job coming out and finding their offense and knocking down shots hurricanes take their first lead on the walker three really improved from beyond the arc over the past month hemingway lost it on the drive and he touched it last its miami ball weve got both teams coming out showing some offense early you see anthony walker knocking down the three got a nice one miami up by two scored the first immediate time i think was two to two or four to two high flying offensive game so far 12 10 kanes lets check our forward keys to the game what you got for today brian well for miami we talked about isaiah wong and what he does i think that they need to have offensive production from the supporting cast and for clemson we talked about that stifling defense turning that defense into good offense right now evan both teams shooting the ball extremely well miami 57 shooting 71 percent clemson four for eight already knocking down two from behind the arc augusti attacks bear and scores and now the hurricanes are six of eight and im curious to ask you brian how how frustrated do you think brad brownell is with the tiger defense at the start today he has to because when we spoke with him today he talked about one of the things that he can tell is that when they come out how intense are they paying attention to detail especially defense miami being able to get whatever they want early in the first half theyve hit some tough shots theyve played with aggressiveness at the offensive end and they lead by four and thats a guy the tigers would love to get going alamir dawes hasnt scored much lately but he knocks down a three his first shot today well one of the things youll see today is that clemson is a lot deeper theyre going to go 10 11 guys and then what theyre going to do is try to wear you down interesting to see if miami can keep up this production clemson doing a good job of knocking down shots as well the hurricanes are now three for three from deep as aulani hits when we talk devon about miami the fact that theyre shorthanded and when you look at the production they get from the three guys on their on the on the outside alani he is one of those guys you see great penetration by mcgusty realizing he can get a lot of heat over there set it up definitely got to be ecstatic if youre jim larry larrinega his team already out with 17 points right now early in this game now kim augustines on pace for about 25 assists hes got four assists in the first six and a half minutes unable to respond john newman missed it but sims goes for a little stare walk into the crowd its miami ball you also see evan with this miami lineup when you have dane gack in there a lot smaller they have to do a good job of being able to limit clemson to one shot and done cannot afford to have offensive rebounds and putbacks dawes extending the pressure on wong longs got the size advantage on dawes there walker juggled it recollects seven to shoot here for isaiah and on the weak side its olani who read it well and lays it back up and in if you got a look at the pace right now that miami is playing with that last time melanie being able to crash office aboard john newman not doing a good job of being a return to put a body on him by the way clemsons last bucket ruled a two instead of a three for alamere dawes who attempted a seasonlow field goal attempts on wednesday at wake sims a double double against the dekes tipped up and in by bear anthony walker got caught weak side not paying attention hes got bear coming back bear doing a good job of being able to crash the board again talking about for clemson you have to turn and put a body on them because theyve got bigs that are very active especially in offensive glass walker trying to keep it rolling first time in the last six seven possessions that clemson has gotten a oneanddone miami had been six of its previous seven from the floor the one missed hit back up and in by olani so heres dawes looking for his shot behind the line this time but it wont go dang doing a good job of being able to show to buy isaiah wong just enough time to get over there and challenge that shark thats shot by dawes olante claims one off the iron and hemingway pulls down the board harrington out there defensively the walkon from illinois and a valuable walkon for this team when theyve needed a body to give it their all nice pass from sims one dribble for bear no sims no good defensive possession by miami because you gave clemson two opportunities clemson falling short not being able to score close to the rim and in that putback by sims coming up long kicks it walker gets his own rebound and then missed the dunk certainly the hurricanes brian playing with more energy right now yeah and you can tell that on that plate just to seem like theyre quicker to the ball penetrations being able to get to the lane and break them down again this is a good clemson defense not easy to score on step back long no and hemingway pulls down the rebound only had one foul call in the first nine and a half minutes free flowing action and of course you can blame that one on me harrington called for the bump and well take the time out im sure ill get chastised by the truck during the break brad brownells team needs to dial up the defense because the canes have been hot Music miami up by five with 10 24 to go in the first half time for our honda startup hurricanes made their first three from deep theyve cooled off a little bit but getting second chance buckets you see the rebounding disparity and one of the things we talked about is the fact that they need to be able to find production from the other guys so far miami doing a good job of being able to score behind the arc i think being able to break them down and one of the things that theyve been recipients of is being to get inside the lane and finding the extra guy theyve come out and i thought this break the offense and force crimson have to recover and youve got to make shots do evidence so clemson not being able to recover miami doing a good job earlier on of knocking down shots most notably knocking down three early from behind the arc brian obviously georgia tech came out on fire last saturday but you saw that in person what difference in miami do you see today compared to last week where its the energy level i think that they came out and you can tell from the beginning not only are they knocking shots is how theyre getting getting to the extra balls and then also being able to limit clemson this is a team thats big and they they are deep theyre going to run guys to the offensive uh glass and so far theyve been able to knock down shots you see amir sims being called that offensive foul just flat out just shoved in the sheer nasir brooks and did not get away with it its his first personal jim laranega losing his point guards no chris likes officially ruled out for the entire season its just a heartbreaking way for likes of season to end he played just two games none since december and then harlan beverly ruled out for the season as well so isaiah wong playing out of position larranega said hes done as well as i could possibly expect but its not how he could get him to be his best brooks has size with sims amir nice move off the glass and so i like that move because thats a massive matchup that sims can win and he basically tortured them in coral gables he took his time nice little jump hook over his left shoulder if youre miami you have to consider being able to help a little bit more if you can he was 10 for 14 in that game in early january first game of 2021 for both these teams the next time each of these clubs take the floor it will be march and on the baseline the foul is going on omax prosper evan you see amir sims realize that hes got an opportunity take a couple of dribbles get a little a little separation jump hook and you see isaiah wong a little late and one of those things if youre nasir brooks you want to push him back to the help in the middle a lot of times if you give a guy a chance to get back to the baseline then youre basically in no mans land long off the inbounds knocks it down nice out of bounds played by miami being able to run isaiah wong off of that screen again for a guy thats shooting the ball you like to be able to come in and step into it being able to receive that that ball right in the shooting pocket nine points in the first 11 minutes for isaiah wong clyde trap hasnt looked for his shot early so hell attack here flips it up wildly shot clock did not reset and the three beats the buzzer and again that shot was made because you saw amir sims not giving up on the play coming with the offensive rebound best time to shoot a three especially off of our offensive rebound dave alameda dogs are glad and he comes up with a nice little pick dawes looking for another bucket he delivers seven points for alamir and thats where clemsons at their best evan when they can get you turned over get out and you see the fans you can hear them here clemsons had some solid crowds certainly limited attendance 17 1800 but theyre passionate they make noise and thats a nice backdoor feed mcgusty how about the dime bomb nasir brooks and again hes one of the better passing big guys you see putting that ball right there where kam magusky can get there easy run at the rim alamir toss feeling it you talked about him earlier not getting a lot of playing time and not being the guy of old but alamere dawgs has come out and giving clemson a nice shot in the arm especially on offensive end Applause brad brownell was telling us he had a little bit of a groin injury for a couple weeks when the team wasnt playing well he wasnt playing well in only double figures once in his last 11 games but coming into today looking for his offense and defense leading to offense hell take this himself 12 first half points off the bench for dawes and again where clemson is at their best is that they get up in you and they are aggressive been able to turn the tide alamill dawes has done it on both ends of the floor with deflections and then being able to finish he was really struggling physically brad brownell said but he really tried not to show it hes one of those guys that wont really tell you that hes injured hell just keep playing through it anthony walker knocks down another jumper hes got five in the half how about the play of anthony walker again talk about supporting cavs hes come out and has been hunting his shot a lot of times i feel like hes a little too chill when it comes to playing but today definitely being able to come out and be aggressive toss passed up the look still 10 seconds trapple fire Applause miami looking to snap the fourgame losing skid you mentioned tough one coming up in charlottesville against the struggling virginia team wong creates contact and he will get himself to the freethrow line but first well get ourselves a timeout tigers brian getting a shot in the arm from alamere dawgs alamera dolls has come out and giving clemson a huge boost being able to get back in and take the lead up by one back in clemson south carolina tigers by one entertaining first half and alimir dawes has been phenomenal quiet most of february hes waking up and you talked him up because he came into the game and i thought that he did a good job on both ends of the floor being able to give them not only a shot in their arms offensively but come up with some big plays defenseman a lot of times when youre a shooter if you can get it going early you start to feel it and right now hes feeling off to 12 points five for six two for two for two from behind behind the arc right now telling us youre lucky to find out if hes hurt because he wont tell you hell just keep playing groin injury bothered him during much of the late january early february stretch but after going scoreless and taking just two shots on wednesday at wake forest al mir five of six hes knocked down two threes from deep 12 points in nine minutes and now long at the line and heres a quick word from works works for android robotic lawnmower available at mylandroidcom the future of lawn care is here isaiah makes a pair and puts miami back in front long with 11 points brooks closed out nicely on sims Applause amir will take it make it evan i think thats where sims is going to win the matchup between brooks down on the post brooks is big enough and strong enough to keep him from getting where he needs to what youre going to find knows when they run that pick and roll a lot of times sims is not going to go to the basket hes going to flare out he said last time being able to get it yet another three hes been scoring more lately too about 17 a game in clemsons last six eight and a half for sims another backdoor feed mcgusty trap off the off the cut and again i talked about the pass and ability of nasir brooks thats the second dime that hes put out there and again for cam augustine a lot of times you want to go ahead and throw the ball in and make a cut brooks doing a good job of being able to dime him up for that layup you talked about that you mentioned jim laranega brooks being a good passer from the post and that was one of the things he says a lot of times he looks first as you see walker come up with an amazing block trap rejected by walker in a well played half of basketball brooks is going to try it and that is not his shot somehow i dont think that jim laranega is too happy about that one he had two nice passes and good defense said why not chase hunter tough shot comes up short wong lost it and theyre going to rule the last touch by sims itll be miami ball to the dismay of the crowd here at clemson and as i look at this game you look at it knotted at 29 i look at the pace of it and if youre brad brunell you cant be too happy in the fact that youve already given up 29 points but a little bit more than four minutes left to go we talked in the beginning is that this clemson team is second in the conference and points allowed at only 63 so if you look at where they are right now clemson needs to tighten up a little bit more on defense tigers leading the acc and adjusted defensive efficiency on a ken palms goto metrics and a good defensive trip that time sims tipping the rebound to his teammate Applause and now when you see with dane gackin on the floor i would try to get amir sims in the low block because hes got a little weight on him and can take advantage of that oneonone just the second foul called on miami in the entire half its the first for aulani 3 42 to play in the first half tigers who usually talk about defense although miami has been an impressive 52 percent from the floor in the first half clemsons gonna have to put the shackles on him if theyre going to keep him to 62 well thats one of the things again you talk about how they have won those last four games they have been very impressive and dominating on the defensive end but if youre jim laranega you have to be good with the fact that how you guys have come out right now not only on the defensive end but how youve been able to score again miami doing a very good job we talked about isaiah wong with 11 points cam augustine off to a good start six points five assists and three rebounds for clemson they need to tighten it up a little bit more those were todays acc leaders brought to you by whole foods market sims again juggle the catch sets up tyson for an open look and the rebound for walker miamis led by as many as seven tigers led six nothing at the outset dengak hasnt taken a shot yet back outside for walker who lost it on the way tried to recover and then touched it last out of bounds and that play was made by nick otter being able to stay in this ground oneonone against anthony walker good deflection and you see help side thats where clemson is at their best because they do an amazing job of being able to help off the ball weak side but nick honor very much is the head of the snake on this clemson defense just 5 10 but capable of guarding a bigger guy and hes like hes like a pit bull when it comes to playing defense and one of the things we talked to brad brannell he likes to be able to extend his defense and trust his guys to be able to play oneonone sims going at gac got great position and puts it in evan we talked about when when youre looking at how miami has their bigs on the floor for amir sims if youve got brooks out there float outside and knock out in that three and try to put the ball to four when you got dan gag there pound the ball inside and allow him to go to work over the course of the season brian clemson has found a way to get sims in the right spot at the right time without forcing it mcgusty was hooked and before the shot i think the foul is going on hemmingway and you see penetration when i thought that mcgucket was a little bit out of control you see hemingway fall there and give him a little tug on the arm yeah but im gonna look at but be honest which i thought that was a little bit more a little bit of a bailout because you saw mcgusty a little out of control trying to get it into aulani officials look at each other and it will stay in miami ball brad barnell is arguing with the officials and im not sure that i dont agree with them that last time it seemed like nick honor may have hit that ball off from the gustys on leg look at the replay its a good thing im sitting next to you and i dont have a whistle in my mouth isaiah wong nope another offensive rebound aulani kicks it out and they call traveling on dengak not a threepoint shooter that last time opting to put the ball into florida a little bit of a jump hop there again if youre jim larry you have to be content with where your team is right now brad braunell you have to finish off the half right again you see brooks back into the game and a turnover something that clemson doesnt do a lot of thats only their third of the game Applause well played half though seven assists for miami kim augustine has five of them which is a season high right back to mcgusty skipping into the lane not sure what what he just did was different from what gack did the previous possession we know a lot of times theyll give guards the benefit of doubt big guys never you see big block yes indeed Applause clemson defense picking it up to the basket oh trying to detonate tyson could not get to the rim cleanly ive got to see that one again i dont know if that was actually a file on brooks because i saw tyson come down the lane they call the foul blaring is very frustrating well you see the pass and him give a running start how is that a foul because i just see nasir brooks there and tyson seems like he tries to avoid him you see jim laranega letting him have an earful and every foul from miami is precious because they dont have too many subs we encourage you to stick around in the second half for the forward fast break youll know it when you see it hunter tyson averaging about six points per game he did not play in the first meeting this year against miami its one of two and we got a timeout with 135 to go in the half heres the stat of the day for you brian the miami hurricanes its not just this year that theyve been lacking depth its been 105 games since the hurricanes played 10 players or more in a game you got to go back to december of 2017 and you compare that with clemson this year i mean theyve had doubledigit players in all but one game ironically its the miami game when hunter tyson was out and john newman was under the weather clemson only played nine but the difference for these two coaches in terms of what they have the weapons to utilize its striking well and its been unfortunate for jim laranega and his ball clubs and obviously when you look at some of the guys that theyve had in sam wardenberg that have not been able to play rodney miller thats been out and most notably the up and down with chris lights i mean this was something where they talked about with his injury maybe coming back at the beginning of january its kind of stretched out to the point where hes out for the entire season and when you look at this was a team that many were picking to finish in the upper echelon but theyve been played with injuries throughout the season hurricanes had six guys who scored between nine and 13 points in the earlier meeting with clemson half those six guys are not playing today to the basket brooks fouled by tyson from behind great read by isaiah wong because when you have him playing in pick and roll action you have to honor him and he pulled two guys realizing hes got a cutting nasir brooks good read a lot of times you want to give your big guy a pass we can finish and sear brooks doing a good job of being able to come up big on both ends of the floor a lot of empty seats on that bench earl timberlake had a good game against clemson 11 points eight rebounds hes no longer available harlan beverly scored 10 with three rebounds three assists against the tigers and theyre also missing matt cross who just announced hes going to transfer to louisville i thought it interesting too when we talked to laranega i mean obviously you want to stay focused on this season as you look ahead for next season and the opportunity to have this year back wondering how many guys their decisions to take advantage of that will play into next year especially with their health miami has had no covet issues one of the couple teams in the league but they havent been able to practice because they havent had the bodies due to injury issues final minute of this first half neither team being able to score in the last few minutes i talked about the pace as favored clemson as of late good defense by sims on the drive mcgusty barely able to touch the iron shock lock now off and the tigers will slow it down and look for the final shot and thats where good leadership you see nick honor realize he could have shot that wide open three but he wants to make sure that they get the last shot going into the half tigers up two looking to add to the lead honor with four honor to the bucket spins it off the window for two nifty finish to the half for nick honor well nice little finish and you see the penetration by nick otter being able to go ahead and put a little bit of extra mustard on it as they go into the half good half of the clemson tigers will lead by four yeah january 2nd the halftime score was 3432 miami today 3430 clemson of course we know clemson came back time for the toyota halftime report from littlejohn coliseum clemson looking to get to 15 and five on the season leading miami 3430 at the half back in our broadcasting perch here at littlejohn evan lefler with brian oliver entertaining first half well played brian isaiah wong was really hot to start and alomir dawes really sparked the tigers off the bench yeah i have not thought that miami came out and they were able to edit as soon as he came in you talked him up and he came in and he had points in his hand so again the second half i think that for clemson that defense has to be able to create all season we got a double header for you starting right here at littlejohn coliseum with justin champagne currently the accs leading scorer and rebounder bringing the panthers down to little john hopefully hes still on the team because the panthers have lost xavier johnson Applause with a win today the clemson tigers would have five straight acc wins something that has not happened in 31 years since brian oliver was clemsons nemesis in the acc tigers won the regular season championship in 1990 of course brian oliver dennis scott and kenny anderson the yellow jackets were tournament champs sure you remember some battles with eldon campbell and dale davis here at clemson south carolina way too many and that year clemson actually with those those tower tower guys they were they were the favorite they were the better team in the league than men duke you know every single acc team that year albeit there were only eight of them compared to now 15 every team in the league in 1990 had multiple guys that would play in the nba and thats an offensive foul called on olani jim laranega pointing to the restricted area well see if he has a case and you see the penetration and you see tyson outside the restricted area and again if you see great camera action by the guys out in the truck and you see tyson with a nice little recovery there thats again thats clemson at its best when they were making the rotations hammond way only took three shots in the first half made two of them and well be going back the other way when you think of your playing days do you kind of recognize that every team in the league had multiple nba guys on the roster even the teams in the bottom of the standings i pay more attention to that later in life but then when youre playing youre not paying attention because im again im not thinking that those guys are potential nba guys but its amazing that going back over the time and see the number of guys that have gone on and you see anthony wall could knock down that shot that have been able to make it to the nba indeed whats the first field goal for miami after going the final 511 of the first half without a bucket back to a twopoint game minute into the second half as we said earlier last four meetings between these two teams have been decided by one five five and one sims with a left hand good to see amir sims being able to back down brooks again most of the first half hes been able to make his lift living on the outside because hes got a little bit more physical match up against brooks Applause beyond the winning streak and wanted to be playing good ball this game is important for the tigers as they try to earn one of those top four spots in the acc standings to get a top four seed in the tournament advance directly to the quarterfinals in greensboro shot clock winding down mcgundy magusti lost his footing in hemingway great help side defense and the pullup by nick connor no too strong you see brad rannell looking over and questioning his coaching staff probably not so happy with that with that shot selection Music they got hemingway number two on alex hammond evan ive always looked at the first five minutes of the second half and try to think for teams you look at how close this game is from miami theyve got to continue to be able to find shots and knock them down and for clemson again use their defense and they had alamera dogs come in and give them some offense theyve got to get another guy going on this starting five even as hemingway or nick honor theyve got to give somebody get somebody to get rolling to help amir sims out offensively clyde traps a guy theyd love to get some offense from two clyde has not scored reaching in on sims in the foul called its on brooks and so youve got a guy in this year brooks thats a seven footer hes not going to want to hang out there and chase a guy onto the threepoint line and again with sims ability to knock down the three hes got to honor that he saw the last time being able to put the ball on the floor speaking of honor his outlet kicked knocked away by iolani 14 to shoot for the tigers clemson allowed 12 field goals in 40 minutes on wednesday at wake forest they allowed 12 field goals in the first half today holden wake to 39 points heres tyson for three got it nice pass by trap and you force the defense to have to recognize that pick and roll there was a shift and they laid off being able to get hunted tyson with his feet set and again we talked about clemson fighting offense nice play and this is danger time for miami clemson has its largest lead hurricanes need to answer good ball movement long from the corner hits it and that play was set up and you saw a lot of heat being able to pull two players on the baseline good recognition good ball moving to be able to get an uncontest or semicontested three by elijah juan pretty good isaiah excuse me pretty good close out by tyson who then missed the runner at the other end elijah wong would be a fun player combine the two of them Applause heres elijah olani the former stony brook sea wolf missed the runner rebound for trap theres a guy love to see the tigers get going trap has been such a key energy guy through his four years for the tigers clemson missed an opportunity when he realized that a lot of he was guarding sims wed love to be able to see sims get him down and seal him under the basket trap great pass inside for sims good recognition by clyde trapp realizing that he again on that pick and roll a lot of times you tell your guards to pull out two guys that last time realizing brooks was pulled away from the basket good recognition to be able to dim up amir sims under the basket beautiful bullet feed with the one hand for clyde trap Applause sims the beneficiary hes got 14 and isaiah wong now has 16 draining the baseline jail how good was that uh again isaiah wong being able to be able to get to the to the corner realizing that at 63 he can shoot over nick otter whenever he can get his feet set longs offense keeping the hurricanes in it heres trapped to the bucket clyde trap doing a good job of coming off that pick and roll with a little bit of a hesitation he froze brooks brooks is calling no mans land not knowing whether to help off the ball to get back over to mere sims good finish by trap appreciate clyde coming through right on cue its just you watch enough clemson games and you know they get offense from him its a huge difference maker next factor mcgusty through the contact brooks unable to slam it down and heres trap marching the other way sims going to work on walker kicks it clyde for three no sir you see the extra pass by sims but i thought he had a matchup issue right there with walker you see on there just ripped it away from walker good defense by nick honor sims looking for tyson pretty good defense by olani to poke it away okay these are two teams that are both really grinding you wouldnt necessarily think from their body language and effort that miami is the team on a fourgame losing streak clemsons in a fourgame winning streak both those things are true but theyre both playing tough long two more tough points love the fact that jim larry nagel was clear and he was clear to run a clear off isaiah wong tell him to go get a basket realizing hey youve got to youve got the match up right now and you can go get it get finished by isaiah wong seven of 11 from the floor 18 points and thats the shot that amir sims is going to hit all day long too Applause 18 for wong 16 for sims and an entertaining game at littlejohn coliseum pretty good close out there by tyson but wong hits it game between the hurricanes and the tigers 30th alltime meeting between these programs and isaiah wong has just continued to play at a different weight class than what he belongs i mean the responsibility he has right now to be a play maker and a shot maker and an energy guy its pretty incredible how hes risen to the task and where miami has been able to exploit his ability to score is get away from the pick and a lot of the pickandroll where clemsons allowed to switch when you see him score is that hes been able to go off a clear out or a penetration again clemsons defense has limited miami and the other guys for miami to get back into this you got to have great spacing and make sure that you do not turn the ball over now you think about the injuries wong has battled through too turn his ankle against wake forest again against georgia tech chance for a threepoint play as wong crosses over 20 drawing the foul in the process goodness well get ourselves another timeout but it is the isaiah wong show 20 plus for the ninth time this season five hour point game and its largely isaiah wong brian hes four for four from the floor in the second half and hes been able to carry miami especially in the second half with being able to make baskets again we talked about his ability to be able to shoot over guards and as of late in the second half its been a shot making ability thats allowed miami to get in and most noticeably the and one that we would just talk about going in the break i love the fact that he has been very selective in how hes gone about his business again we highlighted him evan about him being able to get his offense and having supporting cash as of late clemson doing a good job on everyone else but isaiah wong is going to find his offense isaiah scored 30 along with seven rebounds six assists and no turnovers in the win over louisville back in january and you know brad brownell was stressing to us when you asked about maintaining focus for this game look miami doesnt have a very good record theyve lost four in a row but you look at the teams that theyve beat you look at the fact that they almost beat us they almost beat virginia tech they arguably should have beaten virginia tech theyre hanging with the best teams in the league often well and it seems that you talk about those three victories as they beat louisville beat duke and nc state team thats playing just as well as anyone especially most notably knocking off virginia on the road this fouls going against clemson brad brownell cant believe it Applause they called it on tyson its his third Applause Music you see it clemson extending your defense and thats one of the things that brad ronnell emphasizes that during the course of the game they want to exercise the ball handling make them a little difficult for him to run their offense if youre miami keep your spacing wong has got the hot hand you find a way to get him the ball and clear out and let him go to work gets past hunter sims picks him up in the switch so he kicks it for walker rebound battle won by clemsons hunter tyson Applause again we talked about matchups and you see with gang daca on the fall you see i would go inside but miss shot by chase hunter Applause isaiah wongs four for four in the second half rest of the canes are one for five since halftime walker not bashful i thought walker had an opportunity inside the paint there seemed like no one had committed to guarding him but you gotta recognize where you are you see miami opting to go into a zone key to getting beating that zone is getting the ball right there inside right around the freethrow line or to knock down a three and alamir dawes hits and if youre miami you look at the guys as far as hunter and trap alamere dogs is one of the guys you definitely want to keep an eye on if you want to give up a three you choose those other two not the guy thats come off the bench and has lit you up for 12 points in the first half 15 now for dawes it feels like his best game since december Applause long basically with two defenders right there finally missed one i didnt like that that offensive possession from miami it just seemed like the spacing was off they had all five guys on one side of the floor chase hunter for three in and out again where youre going to beat clemson is that you have to space and be able to make some penetration extra pass great defense by sims knocking it away clemson is one of the better teams in the acc as far as helping recover tigers now in the secondary break wide open tyson got it great play by clyde trapp to be able to create the help and you saw a hunter making the extra pass to get the ball over and you see one pass get over to another one clemson being able to knock down shots and expand that lead Music clemson scored the last six points on two big buckets after miami had gotten back within three our coyote tractor turning point alomir dawes and hunter tyson and for a game that having gone back and forth when he was very close clemson being able to expand on that lead by making two big threes again one of the reasons why clemson is so good is because theyre a good defensive team but their team also without eagle that loves to share the ball so this is the largest lead now for the tigers up to nine Music isaiah wongs been fantastic anthony walker has seven mcgusty has six olani has five brooks has three along with isaiah wongs 21 thats the miami scoring so heres what im going to tell you evan is that isaiah wong is very very good but miami is not going to win this game unless they have one other guy step up either thats alanihi or mcgusty theyve got to have somebody else as you see clemson right now opting to change their defense into a zone making sure that theyve got one guy on isaiah 1 shot clock winding down here wong over sims he was bumped just slightly over aggressive from sims and hes called for a second foul one of the best ways to handle the zone is you usually pick a role and you see wong being able to realize to get around there and then you never want your guys to challenge and foul the shooter now quick word from coyote tractor at coyote we hold dirt in the highest regard coyote we dig dirt 23 points now for isaiah wong as we tick into the fourth quarter of this basketball game under 10 minutes to play last game of the month clemson looking for a perfect february a month that was interrupted for nearly two weeks due to another coveted pause all the way to the basket count it plus the foul clyde trap strong take when you see clyde trap come off and have a flea run and you see alana here a little late right there but how about clyde trapping being able to turn the corner realizing hes got his man trailing him in mcgusty good finish by a trap at the rim veteran tiger todays is 104th ball game as a member of this clemson program Applause towards acl right before the team traveled to italy for the 2019 world university games has come back from that to be a huge blue guy stretching the lead to 10 Applause walker hits olanie sims went straight up olani is slow to get up five on four right now and the tigers have hemmingway now olani trying to come back into the play but dawes wide open and if youre a good ball movement by clemson but if youre gusty you got to realize that youve got aller mill dolls in and you go ahead and you sacrifice that three to trap clemson doing a good job of being able to take advantage five on four has matched a season high with 18 you see moving the ball from east to west good skip pass and then rotation over to alamere dawgs who has been el fuego today being able to knock down that shot and then again you dont want to claim him as your guy but you may want to reconsider alameda dawes 18 points seven for eight and four for four behind the r you just drop a little italian on us i did just a little love it brian oliver a superstar in italy for how many years oh god 12 13 yeah you had quite a career over there trust me im going to tell you the greatest prize at playing overseas is meeting and marrying my wife eliot nora oliver shout out to youre earning big points right now because shes watching with a big smile on her face shout out to my wife tiamo i love it oh great pass trapped to bear kind of awkwardly caught oh wide open layup it just seemed like he couldnt gather himself down to the final three this possession nothing do in there for trap no whistle now five on four the other way and a foul called on wong before he ran over hemingway i believe you see miami coming with a big defensive play walker coming with that block on trap not being able to take advantage of having the numbers clemson with that that lead expanding to 13 if youre miami you got to find a way to be able to penetrate that zone youre not going to beat them by knocking down threes walker snaps the long drought it had been about five minutes and 15 seconds since miamis last field goal make and again if you saw how they were able to get that shot for walker you got to penetrate that zone and give them opportunity to score neither team is one of the better threepoint shooters next to last and last in the lead going back to clemson theyve been able to to stretch this lead out by being able to penetrate you see yet another turnover by clemson good defense by brooks and i think theyre going to roll this one off brookss foot they do theyve changed the call its clemsons ball and everybody can take a breath tigers by 11 footer nasir brooks getting a piece of that shot you see the penetration and thats actually i think that was anthony walker that came over but one of the things for that miami team is being able to come up with some stops theyve got to come up with some bigger stops and with less than eight minutes left to go you see blocked shots clemson three miami two indeed walker with the block brooks is still seven feet that part is true Laughter transfer from cincinnati whos played a lot of college ball 125 games hes an aspiring chef as jim laranega has he been able to cook your dinner yet this year and jim laughed and said no cola protocols pretty much prevent that i bet after he graduates hell come visit jim laranega and cook him some fancy southern cuisine next saturday pitt clemson at noon virginia tech nc state at two on the final saturday of the acc mens basketball regular season i mean time is a vacuum these days brian but is it hard for you to believe that were a couple days from march 2021 has already shot by and its amazing that were embarking upon march i think for so many trying to get out of 2020 yeah its amazing how quickly these last two months have flown by feels more like 2020 than it does march 2021 and yet were a couple days away got a womens basketball double header for you tomorrow in your regional sports networks including these two schools going head to head same time same play same schools different gender same play by play man kelly dale will celebrate her birthday alongside me and brians chair tomorrow looking forward to that beautiful play you saw they ran mcgucy off of a pick nice curl forcing the two guys to help but for the nice little dump off to walker good decision there by trap pull it back out if youre miami youre going to get back into this game because you can get some stops again clemson again talked about how good they are defensively but a very disciplined ball club as you see alamere dolls coming up short just a second miss in nine attempts olani that would have got it back to a seven point game heres mcgusty with a careerhigh seven assist today wong for three great recognition by brooks realizing that hes got a wide open isaiah wong brad brunell not too happy with his ball club miami being able to cut that lead down to six 26 points now for isaiah wong the sophomore from piscataway new jersey yeah that play was started by magusti being able to penetrate force to help and then good recognition by brooks getting it over but if youre jim layer youre impressed upon your ball club is that hey weve been able to climb back into this game we were down by 13 defensively you got to limit clemson and be patient on the offensive end tell you brian you look at the miami stat sheet obviously isaiah wongs the big scorer with 26 anthony walker has 11 other guys are doing other things olani has nine rebounds mcgusty has seven assists theyre not big scorers but theyre still making positive things happen for the kings so heres the thing on the offensive end evan theyre occupying the defender a lot of times a penetration here to force the help the extra pass is whats getting the ball into the right hand right players hands and so as of late like you said is that you know you may have a good pass by camera gusty but then weve seen every now and then anthony walker come up with a big play its not a matter of all those guys having to score a ton of points but again theyre all doing their own little things to allow miami to get back into this game a little full court pressure from miami the tigers break it daws brings it back outside and the tigers offense will reset dawes crap sims hemingway and tyson five on the floor sims little stutter step hemingway pulls up and miami i thought hemingway pulled the string right there again a little indecision between shooting that ball and i thought that he could have gathered himself because brooks was hesitant on whether to guard him or get back over the sims Applause tigers crowd hoping for defense brooks right at sims didnt get the call tip wouldnt go walker keeps it alive Applause aulani under the bucket plus the foul what a pass by anthony walker realizing he had a lot of heat wide open underneath the basket and that was a fantastic pass and then the finish by ilana you see anthony walk with the ball realize hes got a lot under the basket nice pass a lot hes trying to gather himself underneath to get the and one i mean usually a pass where you have to catch it underneath the backboard isnt a great pass but that time it worked out beautifully eight for elijah and its back to a threepoint game this is similar to the last meeting between these two teams in florida where the hurricanes just would not go away well and it seemed like for clemson is that when they were up 13 that they were about to run away with this miami coming up with stops and then the fact that theyve been able to find some offense honor all the way for two nice finish by nick otter and ive always thought that when you have a team thats trapping you youve got the advantage especially if you can get ahead of the pack nick owner doing a good job of opting to be able to finish he just put his head down and said im taking this oneonone and im going to score snap to 100 miami run now mcgusty will try brooks called for the foul youve seen this here brooks bend get caught and you see a penetration right now and see honor being able to realize hes got the advantage a guy can finish with both ends and then the other end you see nasir brooks with a nice little chicken wing in the back of of sims sold well by amir and thats number three and this year brooks if youre miami youve got to make sure that you get back you do not want to give the guards from clemson an opportunity to get downhill and go right to the basket in the final five minutes though that was a cross check right there from anthony walker daw staggers but hes back on his feet let me see the penetration and step out by anthony walker trying to go for that still the alamere dolls trying to get in a pushup that was a hockey maneuver big possession here for clemson trying to stretch it back to a threepossession game deflected by brooks who saves it to wall great play by nasir brooks being able to get down and to recover keep that ball in play give out miami an opportunity cut back into this fivepoint lead look at the box score brooks has three points one rebound three assists he has made his mark and been an impact player at both ends of this game nine to shoot for the keynes mcgusty gets inside the paint and the rebound for tyson good defense by alan milds you saw that last time being able to stay right in front and Music challenge good ball movement for the tigers tyson will take it would not go down heres what i always thought that as a players at the last three or four minutes of a post game im trying to put myself in a position where i can get some spacing and get the ball and try to make a good play at the rim great defense on the perimeter and the loose ball picked up by dawes if you can magusti you gotta be better with the ball ball security is important if youre going to pull out that win that last time you got to be a little bit more decisive and getting the ball to isaiah wong clemson would love to get buckets but you get the feeling theyre going to win this game with their defense and that has so often been the case this season under three minutes we go seven to shoot this trip honor kicks it for sims big shot amir sims and that play evan was set up because honor turned the corner and he forced brooks to have to help a little bit good recognition realizes hes got amir sims coming out and all afternoon long taking advantage of knocking down the three when he has it 19 for amir sims eight of 12 from the floor three of four from deep augustine stripped by trap tigers defense getting stingy again kama gusty caught trying to do too much with one of the better defenders and clyde trap you see trap coming up with maybe seems like it may be a little bit of a leg cramp holding his cavs if you watch this play and you see the play amir excuse me amir sims knocking down clemson up by eight clemson by eight with 218 to go the undisputed leader of the tigers is amir sims brian oliver he has played every single minute so far today hes got 19 points to show for it and evidently we talked about how he was a problem for my coral gables and today hes done the same hes a guy thats come up big for them inside and out i like the fact that hes made big plays of being able to defend and be the leader of what clemsons been able to do and again knocking down threes hes three for four from behind the arc 19 points six rebounds and again i think that without a doubt you know that hes the leader of this ball club because he has stepped up this afternoon jim laranega would be fine not having a game plan for amir sims again and his two games against the keynes this year wong knocked that one out of bounds sims in the two games 18 for 26 from the floor 44 points and counting tigers won 6665 at the watskos center on january the second only game all year hurricanes have lost from winning at halftime tyson with a dagger nice play coming out of the timeout by brad brunell running that pick and roll you forced the defense to have to show they showed two guys had to pick up the the cutter allowing hunter tyson to be wide open how about hunter tyson what hes been able to do knocking down shots today yeah great defense tyson with three threepointers hed only made a three in two of clemsons last eight games a lot of you saved it mcgusty needs it and its not there for him you could tell that shot by mcguz he did have his legs and you wonder if fatigue is a factor well hes still playing hard defensively but dawe is able to keep possession alive and brad brown just wants this possession to stabilize obviously where you are with clemson up by 11 the clock is your friend you take time run the clock clear it out go for penetration extra pass nick honor and they got sims for the foul number three in amir 585 remaining and that will be one and one at the other end seventh team foul on the tigers anthony walker has improved from the freethrow line up to 67 percent now on the season and heres the deal for miami is that you want to knock down these free throws and get immediately into your your pressure you want to get some turnovers because this is not one of the better threepoint shooting teams in the conference i want to say last at 29 so you want to try to knock that and get some deflections and try to stretch this game out obviously the story of miami season has been told many times a ridiculous barrage of injuries and theyre on the verge of losing their fifth straight game they lost five in a row one time last year miami mens basketball has not lost more than five games in a row since the 0607 season and they dropped seven straight and the frank heytheiro clemson looking to put this one away you talk about this miami team how about the fight from this larry negas timmy you see wong come up with the foul with such a short bench and then playing against this clemson team thats so tough defensively and the fact that they go 1011 deep i think its just a matter of clemson wearing them down and making up big plays i thought they shot the ball extremely well too 49 and then knocked him down six threes clemson has six threes in the second half 11 threes in the ball game 11 of 22 just their fourth fifth time all season with double digit threes 391 seconds left clemson will shoot one and one after the timeout lets talk about whats ahead for the tigers i mean theyre about to do something that hasnt been done here in this program since they won the acc regular season title in 1990 theyre gonna win five straight acc games they go to syracuse this week and then close the season next saturday against pittsburgh well one of the things that you look at as theyre ten and one at home is being able to use that defense and so were talking to brad brunell one of the things he kept talking about is that how intense his team plays how they play pay attention to detail and their defensive intensity and you saw that today miami came out was able to get what they wanted but when you look ahead and what they have ahead of them is that this is a team that is deep thats got scores and youve got a star and amir sims and you play really good defense thats a great recipe for success well brad brown now the seventh longest tenured coach currently at miami i think if he were an nba coach hed be like the fourth longest tenured nba coach but seventh in the acc 39 seconds away from his 200th win at the helm of the tigers thatll put him in the company of mike leonard hamilton roy williams mike ray jim beiheim and tony bennett to have at least 200 wins at their current acc programs and by the way jim laranega is at 197 wins at miami in his 10 years there thing about this clemson team bryant they they have an identity and that will serve them well you think in the month ahead well a lot of times evan a lot of teams will go in and you want to hang your hat on something and its obvious that with this clemson team they hang their hat on defense and the biggest thing too is that will your defense travel and again you talked about this team that has had the stop start with the protocols and i thought it was interesting to talk to brad brunell when they shut down theyre not allowed to do anything and so for a team that uh hangs their head on that defense it takes a little while to be able to get your rhythm back one of two for dawes hes got a season high 19 points all off the bench long to the bucket not 28 for isaiah might be too little too late for miami oh sim slipped the pass was behind him good thing hes all right 239 to go eight point game seen crazier things happen but reggie millers not in the house dont believe reggies in the air our director lonnie dale could get reggie on the phone in 10 seconds nice Music working with reggie for a long time on tnt no good for isaiah hes going to finish the day 10 for 18 28 points but in a losing effort and the clemson tigers for the first time in 31 years have won five straight acc games 6658 the final today as brad brownell wins his 200th as the tigers head coach that was a big game by clemson at being able to fight off miamis early run good defense again amir sims coming up big but the guy that i thought they came in and gave him a huge shot in the arm was alamir dawes you talked about his 19 points four for four behind the arc
