trying to build some of what Earl Grant taught him yeah he talked about winning habits thats the big thing for him not necessarily wins and losses but winning habits hes seeing the we are underway our starting five highlighted by Akai Ashton Lankford Jaden Zachary and Mason Matson Fridays hero in the back court the three by Ashton Lincoln Lankford and track down by Maine the black bears starting five it has been pretty consistent scoring the ball Getty uazepitus a fifth year hes a transfer from Georgias Southern hes the man that makes their Edge and hum on the offensive end and he has the ball a fade away rebound out of bounds off of TJ Bickerstaff Bickerstaff eats the glass for breakfast lunch and dinner a big story for BC injuries Demar Langford is dressed we do expect to see him play but the three after him very uncertain when theyll be back and I think Quinn post is a big one for them the sevenfooter uh for Earl Grant takes up a lot of space provides that inside presence they need him back into this lineup Applause Kenya division two transfer for BC both teams searching for an identity here in the first minute plus and a steal by Bickerstaff headbands a Bass to Zachary weak side outstanding block by Jaden Clayton a guy that Chris markwood is extremely high on and thats a great recovery looked like a easy uncontested layup of Fort Boston College and this is what Boston College needs to do though dont settle for jumpers use your defense which is your strength right here bicker staff in the passing Lane Zachary looks like hes going to have a wide open layup but thats a great individual hustle play on the other end Zachary 10 points per game last year in his terrific freshman campaign good penetration by Ashton Lankford and picked off by Clayton it was a pitus pretty move in transition the Euro Step for Getty textbook Euro Step right there off of the turnover and speaking with Chris markwood and the main coaching staff they said thats what they want to do the opportunistic and then rebound and limit Boston College to one opportunity but then when they get turnovers try to get out and push the pace before their D can get set up Addison to TJ Bickerstaff hes tough on the Block tracks it down for Matson out of bounds John Gaffney the veteran official heres your Euro Step you cant do it any better right there thats uh what you would see in the dictionary off of the turnover and this guy right here uh heres a bucket uh he is really the key matchup for Boston College and this one right here very good offensive player and that Nebraska game they lost by eight points but they only were outscored by a point in Lincoln Nebraska in their opener 3938 corn Oscars so that was encouraging for them yeah Big Ten school and and they played them tough Chris markwood likes what he has in this mix right here and I think theyre going to be a tough out in conference Play Good pass down the lane and the layup is converted by purebirds Christians fearbergs whos averaging 12 points hes a sophomore from Riga Latvia Eagles scoreless two and a half plus minutes and away from the ball foul and this is where they missed Quentin post right here again excellent pick and roll defense on the back end right there to Boston College defenses late on the rotation and you cant ask for better offense that time not settling for a jumper aint touch off the pass and Applause other nice offensive possession for Maine Chris Mark returns hes worried about Maine taking away BCs transition baskets Zachary the three is good he led the team in threepoint shooting last year they only shot 31 percent for distance in 202120 22 yeah and Zachary again last year percentagewise 47 from the threepoint line for Boston College thats a nice little pin down off of the out of bounds Applause and the rebound engulfed again by Bickerstaff who averages 10 plus boards pokes Away by The Freshman Clayton quick trigger and the three rolls home all done by jashante Wright mcleish the senior from Montreal as he has his third three and 13 attempts and Boston College has got to find him in transition close to 40 percent from the threepoint line uh last year so again hes a guy you must find in transition adson with a quick three Here Comes Clayton running the break aim running and gunning and laying it in thats Jaden Clayton a little bit of a wakeup call for BC on the offensive end I said it at the top book Maine is a very good team theyve been playing really well to talk about the loss of Nebraska only by 10 but that game was in hand late in the second half and a good push down low by Zachary to stem the tide but seven of the main buckets have come off transition yeah right now Boston caused a couple things turnovers they need to cut down on those and then transition defense whether its off of a turnover or a Miss needs to be better here comes Matson in transition for the Eagles to pick her staff the put back by Penas off the line and out of bounds off of PC so Maine is on the Run the black bears are feisty and the beneficiary was Clayton for the easy two Music foreign with everybody impacted by this uh tragedy hard to believe senseless tragedy BC trailing Maine by four and Malcolm an impressive show in the early going for the black bears yeah it is and I like though to change by Earl Grant now theyre trying to push the pace a little bit pick up full court see if they can get some turnovers and then get out in transition the guy with the ball Kellen times for transfer from Montana State converts and a 63 sophomore from Nova Scotia averaging 11 points shooting 60 percent and thats a beautiful Up and Under move right there reverse layup fourth pick and roll defense Again by Boston College James Zachary down the lane he misses the runner Here Comes Maine whats Maine is going to bring up their big set of screen and then right here thats better that time Boston College on the pick and roll defense foreign Applause the first time we see number five in white tomorrow Langford but check out the times Drive yeah right there again the big is trying to slow down the ball in that situation we saw Earl Grant working on this pick and roll defense in shoot around this afternoon the big has to stop the ball give the guard chance to get back around at that time miscommunication for the key points for this BC team with his brother Makai what does he bring to the table this right here I think the ability to be another score in the paint I think thats huge for Boston College right on point right there again you can throw him down in the post and for me hes an elite athlete and the ACC he could be uh one of of the better athletes in the ACC urate build he averaged 11 points last year dribbling and converting again is Kellen times these dangerous went distant six point black bears lead and Chris mark would talk about he recruited him when he was an assistant at Northeastern under Bill Cohen and loves his ability uh to knock down shots thats a big time crossover pullup and has made its last four shots Applause to Langford Applause Eagles shooting 25 percent ages three out of 12 one thing uh John that Maine is doing a really good job of is defensive rebounding oh theyre limiting Boston College to one opportunity I think this is the area Boston College needs to get at right here in transition the blow by by Makai Ashton Langford and he is superb he has that extra gear and Earl Grant gives him the green light oh Earl Grant just Raves about him and easy to see why he is the leader hes the energy guy turnover four pass by Jayden Clinton but tomorrow Lankford you like this move yeah I do again hes got a great lift uh dont settle for jumpers put him down in the post and then this right here I think this is going to be key in this game get out in transition uh that time the brother Makai Ashton Langford out in transition Eagles first two games shooting 44 percent into the game double zero and white Chaz Kelly highly touted freshman good pass by Matson to a driving TJ Bickerstaff he picks up contact that was a terrific feed by Matson yeah and I like that uh Manson the last game made five free so you know hes going to draw some attention nice back door cut beautiful interior passing that time thats one though that picker staff wants back that should be an and one but you have to be pleased if youre Earl Grant again the last two possessions in transition and that right there nice half court offense tomorrow night well have a mens basketball doubleheader right here in the ACC Network in the ESPN app Louisville State at six Eastern then Armando vapecott number one North Carolina hose Gardner Webb dont miss it on acc Network Carolina had a fight the other night Friday night at the dean Dome College of Charleston but College of Charleston held strong theyve seen a lot of these games early on it goes to the parody and also the transfer portal a lot of teams getting old and good through the transfer portal so it makes for a lot of early season exciting games good ball Movement by name well work it outside on the perimeter times Applause now in the lane a runner is good was terrific by jashante Wright mcleish they kill the shot clock but he converts yeah that right there again beautiful jump stop jumper under control ball went left to right Dicker staff has hounded but somehow put it in good control by TJ Bickerstaff yeah and I like it and again another possession by Boston College the ball goes into the paint something Earl Grant talked about look we need to get the ball into the paint off the bounce or to pass thank you Applause and a foul called on PC its going to be on Jamar Langford his first but TJ Bickerstaff following Chaz Kellys lead yeah he can put that one up and in got a good one brewing in Chestnut Hill Music when you buy 10 tickets coach markedwood and the main staff were really concerned about keeping this guy off the glass and Earl Grant told us he had Mono he missed the first 10 practices of the season and the first two games he was winded a bit youd expect that he was dealing with game conditions pulls in and out for Philly of Povich and BC Garners the rebound Chaz Kelly hands the point hes going to be important for BC with Donald hand out an extended period yeah again that backcourt high Austin Lankford and Jaden Zachary but theyre going to need a third guy to come in and spell them and Kelly is that guy right now door passed by Langford Kelly gets it back and the rebound ripped away by right mcleish Music how do you like that on the weak side I said it earlier hes one of the better athletes in the ACC Demar Langford and good reversal by Bickerstaff to Kelly who Nails the three Chaz Kelly more of that to come thats his second three and four attempts limited run in the first two games but again that will increase Applause to pass to the corner phillipovic he knocks it home thats all set up though by Jaden Clayton beautiful dribble drive again you cant do it any better break the defense down with the split of the screen and then kick it out to a wide open threepoint shooter really a Povich was big for them down the stretch last year in their final four games 46 points 19 rebounds eight steals black bears went 623 last year and 315 in the America East passing the pay what a block by TJ Bickerstaff as he pins it Pena beautiful in transition both ends of the floor working well all starts with the defense vicker staff beautiful block and then leading the break Applause Delia Povich with some confidence and a foul on Chaz Kelly but Demar Langford providing the thunder on the defensive end yeah getting beat that time but because of the elite athleticism able to recover and then right here Bickerstaff idat has some quick Ops and then hes able to lead the break he really to me is a guy thats ready for a breakout year in the ACC TJ bicker staff he can do a little bit of everything we talked about his rebounding uh but offensively theyre going to need his offense as well too hes averaging 12 and a half points five for second on the team good up fake but no dice for right mcleish Applause UC has never LED Zachary he got draws contact Applause John thats good recognition by Zachary and Boston College again sometimes you just got to simplify your offense if you have a team thats playing man and you have a bigger guard in Zachary and theyre not helping just isolate them down low on the block thats what theyre doing right here let him use his big body and get down and force Maine to make a decision are we going to double or lead them there mantoman and right now Boston College likes that matchup of Jaden Zachary down low in the post on the smaller main guards if I was on Clayton is second she heads to the bench for Chris markwood Applause Eagles tie it up at 18 free throw shooting a concern the first two games 62 percent from the line Applause Dierbergs Applause milia polvich and that one is off the line by times here comes Ashton Lankford the pass block though he was a pitus making a page on the BC Playbook Applause each side defense and a 64 fifth year from London England draws contact to the foul and then one possibility of a fourpoint play for Peter phillipovich foul on CJ Pena this was good stuff oh yeah he hits that from Arnold threepoint main lead Music what direction continues to play a good brand of basketball yeah but this Boston College needs more defensive possessions like this right here theyre connected theyre communicating this lineup they can switch uh TJ Bickerstaff doing a nice job of moving his feet and then get out contest the shot thats all you can ask for if youre Earl Grant and then off of of the Miss get out in transition and try to get some early offense before the main D can get set up and a trend has been set unfortunately for BC Mountain early Slugger starts they led by one point or two points against Cornell and theyre opener last Monday night and against Detroit Mercy on Friday they trailed by one at halftime what do you think thats a result of well again whatever it is uh they cannot have that they need to tighten that up as they get closer to ACC conference play and Zachary missed the three but follows it Armani Mighty 610 freshman and he draws a foul hes raw this is his fifth year of competitive basketball former soccer player but he is athletic he ran an under five minute mile just like how could be used to in Chestnut Hill I mean Ill tell you what when Earl Grant told us that I was like my goodness I ran a 5 15 and I was a guard so here you have a guy thats you know 610 and running an under five mile he is going to be a guy they are really excited about his upside obviously a great athleticism can run the floor really well has to refine his offensive game a little bit but certainly hes got something you cannot teach which is length and great ability to run the court and he comes up Shy on both free throws but youre right can harness some more competition for him and get him involved a little bit they think maybe six to ten minutes a game part of a terrific freshman class as you just saw Billy apovich trolls the offensive glass gets it back and moments ago at three as we went to break and it was a Vitas with the rebound aint industrious off the glass how about that move by Philly Povich beautiful spin move by phillipovic that time off another offensive rebound by Maine and spend and finish with the left thats big time elbow jumper by Jayden Zachary all right mcleish with a board and the Deep three by fear Birds rebound by the Cincinnati transformation Matson and a foul on Peter Philly Povich all right here again you cant do it any better footwork beautiful concentration the whole time and then finished with the left look at it spin move a go up against the 610 freshman and then finish with the left theyre playing with a lot of energy theyre getting a lot of the 50 50 balls and again I think this is where Quentin posts the sevenfooter for Boston College being out spoke with Earl Grant and said you know hes daytoday right now having his presence in the paint really hurts them on the defensive glass Quentin post excelled the late stages of the season for BC averaged nine points going to be a focal point for them thats in the fade away three you see scoreless Stroud over two minutes and 20 seconds in the eagle injuries theyre battling them tomorrow Langford is back but post a league day and hand all out and theres a three by Wright mcleish largest lead of the game for Maine nine points as they are riding a nine to nothing run and I think the change of defenses 32 matchup zone right now and they are forcing Boston College into some deep threes and thats what you want to do when you go Zone a great Change Up by Chris markwood in Maine uh changing the defenses up against Boston College Billy Povich the up fake doing a good job too in the dead Corners Malcolm theyre swinging the ball around the perimeter Chris Marshall would talk about spacing and theyre doing a good job spacing the floor they got Boston College chasing and then theyre finding open shooters good take by Wright mcleish whos got some confidence theyre taking advantage of a threeminute 10 second scoring drought you see has missed his last five field goals theres a three by Matson didnt help the cause look out good defense by Makai Ashton Langford and a foul in the backcourt Valentines and this has been the spacing right here look at that you cant ask for better spacing eyeball screen and then diagonal pass across the other way and again because Boston College so spread out theres no help on the Baseline you get beat another uh good high percentage shot by Maine on the other end I think offensively for Boston College theyve settled for jumpers have to get somebody to that high posterior foul line area tried to break down that zone that way see if you can get some paint touches off the bounce or to pass but you cant settle for a quick threes theyre also being a rebounded 1712 you see traditionally a good rebounding Squad started two for their first nine from the floor and theres Ashton Langford Makai Ashton Lake for their leading scorer entering the ball game hes up to Four Points two of five from the field Shante Wright mcleish pounded by CJ Pena Applause steal last delay for to his brother Demar what will he do with it lost it in transition Applause its main ball theres missed opportunity for the Eagles yeah again that time you got to have two pans on the ball uh you have a steal hes trying to go up with the onehanded dunk right here again great play uh by his brother Makai Aspen Langford and then right here hes going up with one hand thats got to be two hands on the ball either finished with a layup or dunk theyre trying to get back into this game missed opportunity but I do like if youre Boston College the defensive pressure empty possession for the Eagles in Maine with a counter punch again Kellen times the Montana State transfer Ashton Langford oneman fast break and a foul Applause will bring us to a timeout after the foul on Maine and fearbergs but Kellen times hes been fun to watch she has six of the 31 main points and this was pretty around at Omar Lankford yeah of course got a report that time by Boston College close to 40 from the threepoint line last year scoring on all three levels nice little jump stop jumper but this is where hes done his damage elf is late and he has knocked down some threes for this main team theyve done a nice job spreading the floor and then theyve got high percentage shots Chris Mark with their first year coach seventh years on the northeastern bench under Bill Cohen who all by the way was also a BC assistant back in the Jim OBrien and Al Skinner days and mcleish Lily a linchpin on the offensive end but another thing about Maine is balancing a young team versus an old team Trey mcleish is one of those guys whos been through it for the black bears yeah hes really likes what he brings in the leadership Department you called it and I think the guy at the line right now for Boston College has since that and hes pushed the action rightfully so a couple of times Ill offer some misses and its going to start though with Boston College trying to figure out this main offense they got to cut down on the dribble drives and full court pressure by the Eagles Music Master Lakeford Zachary Jamar elect for CJ bickersoff and CJ Pena on the floor for BC good defense Applause Nelly Povich thicker staff with the board Here Comes Zachary with six points foul line jumper and the board by time tynes a good addition for Maine doing a really nice job again one opportunity for Boston College Steins has four assists Applause Getty Applause followed by Isaac Barnett whos a first year official yeah right here lets see thats a judgment call again but that one can go either way right there tough call for the rest to make Thursday night well have the womens basketball game of the night on acc Network and the ESPN app Don stallion number one South Carolina take down Clemson at Little John Coliseum both teams come in undefeated and our coverage starts at six Eastern you do not want to miss that one a blowby and a mischance there by Kellen times he did the hard part screened by bicker staff for tomorrow Lankford Baseline and a foul do you like to take I do and again its not a jumper uh Force the action a little bit theyve been settling for jumpers try to get the ball into the paint nice Move This Time by Demar Langford use your strength which is your athleticism and size now on right but cliche that was his first Easton Maine free throws arent helping the cause Malcolm and right now thats uh 50 for Boston College Music where eight and then excuse me now its four or nine down to 44 for Boston College from the free throw line and two attempt from the threepoint line for 20 so not shooting the ball uh well thats why Im saying you got to continue to try to force the action get layouts Applause Ashton Langford eyes times Philly Povich Applause d by The Eagles but the up fake and a foul Hilo ditch 610 sophomore from Kitchener Ontario yeah a couple of breaks right here looked like vicker staff was going to just rip the ball out of his hands but Zachary gonna have a steal bad breaks uh that time for Boston College and Applause I want Jamal Langford his second and a ditch still an eight point main lead Saturday morning at 11 halftime shows and free of both game shows throughout the day at 6 30 you get a complete wrapup of the afternoons games theyll get you set for the prime time matchups between Syracuse and Wake Forest on acc and at eight all right here on acc network of the ESPN app no field goals for BC in the last 245 the Big Stretch for Boston College needing to have something good to happen to close this half out nicker stop this is the funny but his industriousness continues off the glass and a foul on me well for as well as Bickerstaff has rebounded the ball in the first half hes missed a couple of these layups uh in this situation right here again this has got to be a make thats just a mislayup but again hes such a good offensive rebounder able to go get his Miss but thats a missed opportunity for Boston College and just what you dont want to see happen another missed foul shot and theres our opponents at BC first half second half BC the edge in the second half thats the good news for real Grant they are 20 but some Slugger starts sticker staff one of two Applause Applause good pass up fake banana dish Here Comes Mason Matson Eagles have cranked up the defensive intensity in the last couple minutes CJ Pena at the elbow the take and a punch Away by Bickerstaff but Maine takes it Kellen times Music zero and blue Byron Ireland for the ball its his first run of the first half 61 sophomore from Annapolis Applause again Applause and the foul we got TJ Bickerstaff coming up for halftime getting to know BC basketball fun sequence for the BC players interview with both coaches and our highlights and stats will be some reflective moments for Earl Grant his coaching staff what would you do I think right now keeping ball dribble drives uh under control for Boston College has been an issue times Kellen times has done a nice job of getting into the paint that time again using his body uh drawing the foul theyve been unable whether its Boston or in transition of credit Maine theyve done a nice job spacing the floor and then theyve dribbled drive and either gotten layups or kicked the ball out for some open shots this is the guy that Chris Barkwood was banking on to make a impressive contribution while he wanted him from Montana state to go to the Florida when they find it for Kellen times Haynes largest lead was 11 back to double digits thats it with a three hes got it Jason Matson drilled the gamewinning three against Detroit Mercy on Friday Applause shot clock off for the black bears removed four shots Zachary two seconds lets it fly Jayden Zachary my goodness fantastic ending to an unsteady second half for BC but that should help the cause all set up though but Makai Aston length theyre denying the ball to gelentines get this Zachary as advertised he can shoot it Earl Gray says they were just off kilter they were uneven on both ends of the floor got better as the halfway done and thats been a trend set by BC yeah I think he said the energy lets see how they come out in the first five minutes I think they need to pick up the pace pressure Main and try to get some easy opportunities off the turnovers Spain in blue BC and white good to have you with us from Connie forum ITA perel with Malcolm Huckabee our producer Russ Ken director Mike Baker and a terrific crew as the ball is punched out of bounds by Zachary John Gaffney Bert Smith Isaac Barnett your officiating crew CJ Pena division two transfer for the Eagles guarding the inbounds chasing you is about us shot on the way is good Well Done by fear birds from distance Christians Pier birds from Latvia and just how they started off the first half excellent spacing dribble drive and then another uncontested three cant ask for better offense if youre Chris mark would to start the second half hit five of 11 threes Zachary punched Away by fear Birds here come the black bears foreign Applause Music good position by Bickerstaff nine rebounds already Ashton Langford and the put back no good by TJ Bickerstaff he sees me some high percentage shots without to go along with the free throws that you reference really the big difference why theyre trailing by seven in this game slip and what a layup Jayden Clayton The Freshman from Whitby Canada nine point lead for Maine the largest of the game 11 how was that what Chris mark would say thats the first kid he offered when he took the job uh for Maine and uh they are really high on him you can see good basketball IQ that time though showing off the finish in the lane Eagles scoreless in the first two minutes of the second half Clayton Applause tines against Pena right now John the Maine is getting the ball into the paint too early easy off the dribble Turn Around by fearberg my goodness he has five points for the first two and a half minutes of the half look how Maine matches its largest lead of the game played Nebraska in their first game and they lost by eight yeah after a good pass by Matson thats great Patience by Matson that time not settling for a jumper theyre gonna need more of that but I think it starts right here defensively theyve just been inconsistent with their ability to keep Maine out of the paint Eagles six assists on 11 made baskets DC shooting 31 percent Skips a pass to times fade away and thats in the rebound Applause had some transfer from Cincinnati launches is that too quick in the shot clock yeah we dont need it again he made five threes in their last outing uh but its not off of good ball movement nobody touched it you come off one screen and then you shoot a deep contested three thats one that you gotta make If Youre Gonna Take It Music was a penis all fake and a travel on right mcleish and this right here again just a beautiful individual move uh by The Freshman thats not bad D thats just a tough shot and again right here not really bad dick d by TJ Bickerstaff thats just a guy shooting a turn around jumper thats the night that Maine has had theyre playing with a lot of confidence theyve been making some shots shes giving them more confidence as you know game wins along a nonpower five opponent they feed off of that moment its been huge and again weve referenced the injuries for Boston College now at full strength take by Zachary to convert Applause would you do anything differently on the defensive end if youre a BC well the way main shooting it and spacing it I think it starts with the boss green coverage how about that and one opportunity Applause tough to stop Jaden and Clayton hes out himself a good start to the second half but Maine Riding High in Chestnut Hill since being the first to make wipers over Ascension a league Bay going down with an injury yeah he was a guy they were counting on and then right after that Donald hand uh goes down with a lower leg injury so those two guys not available to go along with Quentin post their sevenfooter guy that they were planning on starting for them after Center Spot uh you add that in you have some guys uh had her out and its a big loss for Boston College it gets magnified in these types of games where you know you could really use that seven foot presence against an American East Squad in Maine yeah and again hes a guy that you can dump the ball down low to in the post and get some easy offense make main Force to force them to double down and then obviously the presence that he provides defensively for them so big loss but certainly at the end of the day nobody is going to care when they look at it theyre going to expect Boston College to uh be in front on this game yeah no its Classic No One Cares tomorrow Langford takes it and makes it Lankford Brothers need to get going for these suits they need more of that but I think its going to start again sound like a broken record defensively man they got to get some stops it starts with getting the ball out of the paint and the layup Miss Here Comes Ashton Lankford charging in a transition but he forced the pass and Clayton what up puts him in by tomorrow Langford to punch it away looked like an easy bucket for Kellen times for tomorrow Langford terrific hustle Earl Grant onto Sidelines clapping these are the hustle plays right here uh that lead to wins youre trying to get back into the game dont give up on the play and give up a uncontested layup beautiful hustle play that time by Demar Langford upperclassmen showing the youngerclassmen what it takes on the defensive end looks like they might have got away with a step but a basket nonetheless put in by nanadich Applause Ane has led throughout it has been a struggle for PC Justin Langford Dania too late at the rebounded tip here come the black bears right mcleish hes got it in transition they match their largest lead of the night my goodness Zachary the Baseline Drive and he converts Applause trading buckets in John youve pointed it out earlier theyve missed some characteristically missed some point blank layups yep Zachary leads the eagles with 13 in the turnaround no good by tynes has been an influencer on both ends of the floor for Maine Applause oh my God Ash Delane for the Providence transfer and hes got his eighth point of the night before that would be advertised hes really worked on uh his jump shot during the offseason thats a beautiful pullup jumper Applause the pass the double team working out of it to times and Ashton Langford its like hes got some momentum and he takes it Coast to Coast so quickly the 11 point lead sliced to five Applause and a timeout good defensive adjustment by PC Malcolm well when we started this show off tonight we said Makai Aston Langford is the leader for Boston College this is what a leader does in transition Boston College needed a bucket beautiful lefthanded a layup Boston College theyll still trailing by five this is what a leader does right here beautiful pullup jumper off the high ball screen and then in transition energy uh thats what he brings to the table for Boston College and you take a look at his second half numbers look what he did last week in 14 minutes scored 15 points three assists to close out that game for Detroit and thats something that he is known for second half surgeons yeah its a pleasant development for real Grant and his coaching staff Machias delay for playing his 114th Career College basketball game some of those coming with Ed Cooleys Providence Squad so Maine after taking the time out to see if they made some adjustments Eagles cranking up the defensive pressure three to shoot for times Big Time bucket Kellen times has a lot of them tonight yeah sometimes thats what you know your offense is uh get a breakdown and then you just get a guy in an ISO situation let him go to work at times time and time again has had that crossover pullup going tonight tomorrow Lankford returning from a knee injury Zachary and the rebound for times well with this lineup for Boston College looks like theyre going to switch ball screens in Applause Billy bobich hes been quiet and he Maneuvers around tomorrow Langford clearly a good timeout for Chris Barkwood and they just isolated him that time against a very good Defender and Demar Langford and just kind of a big boy move barrel down the lane was patient and able to get a little head fake get him off his feet uncontested layup again Applause its in the threes got it thats what they brought Mason Batson from Cincinnati to do hit the long ball Eagles struggle with the long ball last year outside of Jaden Zacharys success and theyre struggling on threes again as you see thats just their fifth three of the night oh Julie poich Applause in the post and the contact and then one much to the Chagrin of Akai Aston Langford you know the frustrations evident on the floor for BC a trail by eight other carriers take your money and knock you around boost Maine is made nine of 15 buckets in the second half as they leave BC by eight and theyre playing good offense Malcolm Montgomery yeah their energy is there right here a break for Maine almost the turnover and then again great concentration to help is late right there and every time Boston College looks like theyre going to try to get closer to tie this game up or take a lead Maine has had an answer this Saturday is week 12 ACC Network college football lineup at dude Eastern 73 Duke theyre riding the high at three straight wins they square off against six and four Pittsburgh whos won two in a row the NC State is in Louisville to take on the Cardinals the day is capped off by our accn Primetime matchup Wake Forest hosts Syracuse all coming up at 8 oclock as always black Blockbuster football action on acc Network Applause and the threepoint play completed by Ophelia Povich after the second foul of the game on Makai Ashton Lankford how much stock do you put in the fact that Chris marquard was on the BC Staff last year and maybe had some Keen Insight on their personnel uh no not really I think its a Personnel thing obviously weve referenced the injuries for Boston College but give credit to this main team theyve done a nice job in particular their back Port theyve done a good job controlling the paint and then the bigs for Maine we talked about they rebounded advantage that we thought Boston cows would have theyve limited them to one opportunity on the offensive end Langford other opportunity and he missed a high percentage shot but hell go to the line Dierbergs whistled for the foul yeah right here again but weve seen this time and time again Boston College have some good opportunity thats just a mislayup again not much resistance there you get your own offensive rebound thats great but lets see if they can make up for it at the free throw line where theyve struggled tonight you see shot 33 percent in the first half better in the second half thus far 47 percent and another Miss from the foul line Music seventh for 14 do the math that would just be a onepoint game with all those mates Applause tynes swings it right mcleish Aston Langford grabs the board foreign Kelly back to the lineup for the Eagles hell get some more time with the injury to Donald hand freshman Guard from Houston Ashton Lankford thats a nice block out of that time by the Freshman Jaden Clayton on TJ Bickerstaff now he didnt get the rebound but he just blocked him out turned and face guarded him to make sure Bickerstaff did not get the offensive rebound Eagles five for 16 from three Billy bobich up and in hes been a handful and theyve gone to him simple basketball Boston College playing mantoman uh he has got it going on his isos hes just barreled his way down the lane and making some tough shots hes got 16 points came into the night averaging 10 and a half and seven rebounds 67 Junior from Hungary Kelly in the Deep three it won the first half Applause take by Clayton that was too easy Breaking some ankles of Jayden Zachary largest lead of the game for Maine and Jayden Clayton not playing like a freshman thats a beautiful spin move and finish hes been under control all night and solid defensively and offensively for Maine Zachary runs into a double team and a foul freshman for me Jaden Clayton right here again watch the block out again just turned keep TJ Bickerstaff uh off the offensive glass and then on the other end uh spend and finish great concentration and you can see why Maine Chris Mark was so high on this young man first person he signed in his class when he got the job at Maine its been a balanced game Malcolm theyre a rebounding PC theyre out shooting BC theyre playing ferocious defense when they need it they havent done many things wrong on the other hand BC has Kelly Music Applause the bar Lankford Baseline and the Nifty reverse that was a good look by Chaz Kelly too it was Heads Up played by him patient and then Demar Langford showing off that strength in that Less athleticism do you utilize more full court pressures well the problem is Maine has beaten it pretty handily and then got a steady dose of this right here Ashton Langford Music spinning wild shot and a foul bow is on getting you asapitis so Maine trying to pull it up set up by 10 theyve LED from Pillar To Post to Chestnut Hill we pick up the phone because its ringing I should get this hello this is Sam how can I help you that simple human sense you see inner glass Springs ACC tournament is the 13th seed they beat the 12seat pick by 20 led by James Carnage 13 points in round two they can move on to face this seed Wake Forest over time they overcame a 10point deficit late in the second half then the momentum carries them to round three they lost to fourth seed in Miami at the buzzer in overtime in the quarterfinals after a Makai has to lay for Miss on a tough chance Jordan Millers layup just beats the final horn first time since BC won two tournament games since 2018 so big bow momentum that is carried over to 2022 theyre off to a 20 start but a dog fight with Maine under eight minutes to play and you feel like gonna get this game to two possessions at the five minute Mark yeah crucial Prime right here 750 to go end this game uh youre trailing by 10 McCay Aston length at the free throw line and I think if youre Earl Grant youre thinking to yourself well look you have not shot the ball well from the perimeter every time weve tried to get close uh Maine has had an answer but time is running out right here you see nine for 16 at the line Here Comes Your full court press Maine beats it Applause fade away he was supposed to off the line Lamar Langford over to his brother Makai Ashton Lankford a pullup yes well done by Ashton Langford second half Makai is heating up isnt he thats what leaders do 15 against Detroit Mercy the second half eighth thus far blocked by Chaz Kelly outstanding by the freshman Lamar looks for Jason Zachary Applause take by Ashton Langford flummoxed at the Baseline DC defense Chaz Kelly whered this block come from great individual effort right here I think you got him beat recover I like this though he keeps it in bounds could he easily punch that out of bounds keep possession for your team heads up play by Cass Kelly a good observation thats the fourth block of the game for BC so you get a good look at Chaz Kelly on the inbound to Langford look out put back CJ Pena 10off thing run moments ago it was a 10point lead for the black bears scoring drought two minutes and 15 seconds timeout Chris mark would not happy with his freshman point guard Jayden Clayton he sees capitalizing and you feel like it shift it a little bit doesnt it energy Earl Grant talked about it at his halftime interview he felt like his guys being out flat theyve been inconsistent with their energy right now this last three to four minutes stretch you can tell the energy has shifted towards Boston College mainly because of this guy right here but Kai Aston Langford not able to get it going but Pena on the offensive glass defensively they made it difficult for Maine and that is going to be the key for them to close out this game down four 6 36 to go in the second half and tomorrow night well have a mens basketball doubleheader right here on the AC network of the ESPN app Louisville host App State at six Eastern and Armando paid Cod number one North Carolina goes Gartner win standing basketball action on acc Network great to have you with us Johnny depurro alongside Malcolm Huckabee John every time a Boston College has been right within this distance here four to five or six points Maine has come down and answered lets see what they do coming out of this time out all the momentum in favor of Boston College uh lets see uh if Boston cross can hold uh on the defensive end and try to get down and make this a one possession game what do you think the message was for Chris Markley uh be patient ball protection do not uh give up a turnover against this very aggressive defense by Boston College the last three minutes Bane has turned it over eight times Applause waiting seconds of the shot clock and a foul foul on BCs Makai Ashton Langford thats three shots fouled them Beyond The Arc as soon as he hit his arm veteran player Makai Aston Langford we talked about it thats a beautiful defensive possession all the way up until the end and contest you have them right where you want them under three seconds left on the shot clock no need to follow him right there and thats a bailout for me thats three fouls on Ashton Lankford and he knew it right away he did unnecessary and hasnt scored a field goal in the last two and a half minutes but times at the line four for five he has 14 points give him 15 second leading scorer on the black bears behind Billy Povich who has 16 Eagles break the timeline with Chaz Kelly Applause thank you double thats the Langford to paint a nice pass tomorrow Langford you cant break the Zone any better beautiful zone offense that time uh by Boston College tomorrow a free one of three eagles in double figures with 10 Applause break down by Fleet Dierbergs missed it what a foul on BC they got tomorrow Langford for contact thats his third and this freshman continues to impress for Maine thats a beautiful dribble drive and kick but right here against the Zone this is their best possession of the night find that high spot at the free throw line and finish and were told TJ bicker staff has been cramping up on the BC bench but he should return he has not been back in this game and thats huge for Boston College not having his presence to rebound and offensively for Earl Grant maybe its the fact that hes still getting his conditioning after he missed 10 practices to begin the season with mono still figuring it out in that department they missed his rebounding as you mentioned he has 10 boards thats his season average Pena at the foul line well hes got a pretty shot CJ Payne a division two transfer and I again the patience by Boston College to break the Zone down very patient and get a high percentage shot thats how you break it down Applause times directing traffic Applause skips it out of bounds BC ball Eagles renewed pressure on the defensive end has been a trigger in the last five minutes and oh by the way Bane is missed their last shooting attempts in the last four minutes they have not scored a field goal and thats a heads up play by paying you that time Eliza the passer getting into passing lane and then getting the deflection to go off Main Kelly thought about the three but instead picked up a foul on getting you asapitis is second its the fifth on Main its a little inbound Kelly again using a nice job of the shot fake uh both him and Makai Aston Langford a ball faking and then shot faking this main defense just to move their hands Troy and Florida State will follow us in Tallahassee after this one dont go away on acc Network Tania low post pass and John Gaffney calls a foul thats on phillipovic this third yeah thats a nice little duck in that time uh by Demar Langford Ive been impressed with Pena they put him at this High post foul line area but hes made some shots and hes also made some nice passes from that high post uh foul line area Ashton Langford for the Baseline hes had a superb second half second half Makai they hit your formula Malcolm they got it to a two possession game now its a one possession game with under five to play Applause Philly Povich with t by tomorrow Langford put back Dierbergs snaps the string without a field goal four plus minutes Applause aint rebounding a big part of why they have a fivepoint lead Applause to Langford wild shot out of control Pena tries to possess but he cannot do it and that brings us to our final media timeout the cardiac kids from Boston College another comeback of the bag dont go away Music when you start with better ingredients better Pizza you also one week ago tonight DC had struggles with ivy league opponent Cornell but and still pulled it out and beautiful execution again Makai Aston Langford unselfish play a beautiful dump off pass almost a foul right there on that threepoint attempt and then against Detroit Mercy on Friday afternoon Veterans Day matchup Mason Matson key theme again Makai Ashton Langford the leader making it pass that led to a gamewinning shot theyve been living dangerously tonight it looks like its going to come down to the wire 3 47 to go theyre trailing by five and want this recipe to start off this season uh these tight games but thats the way it is right now trying to manage this lineup with all uh the injuries and now TJ Bickerstaff is leading rebounder on defense due to cramps over the final five minutes of games for the season BC outscoring opponents by plus eight connecting 56 percent for the Florida final five minutes opponent is only making 31 percent of their shots Applause and a foul called on the Eagles fourth Im a Kai Ashton Langford thats not a good one right there you dont want him picking up a foul you love his aggression they need him on the court a depleted backcourt with the injury to Donald hand Clayton the freshman comes Kellen times and thats what hes done all night hes always had an answer the Montana State transfer has 17 points thats a game high and on timeouts seems like they always come back with a counter punch disaster Lankford misses you know numbers but theyll hold and kill some clock you see has never LED foreign Applause Music Applause thats just what Boston College needed a turnover still trailing five and uh almost another steal by chess Kelly as he collides the Mason Matson on the bench but times 50 move after the pass from Clayton and we talked about bicker staff the seven footer Quentin post out of the game no shot blocker there for Boston College on the other end thats a beautiful move by Taz Kelly Applause Kelly has five or Star recruit Prince Felipe another four star some feel that the top five recruit BC history on the bench with a injury big loss as we saw his bucket moments are going against Cornell to win the game Applause the general against Damar Langford times flustered rebound by Ashton Lake for pushing the pace shaking a Defender and getting fouled by jashante Wright mcleish foul on right mcleish final two minutes of the game where are you going for the Eagles offensively well this guy right here Makai asked him Langford hes their leading scorer uh they dont have time to waste though uh the ball goes up they got to get out and try to get some easy transition buckets before this main defense gets at and then defensively they need more of that what they had on that last possession force a contested jumper 11 second half points for mikayasha Langford his parents are here theyre from Worcester Mass short ride Applause for them both both former College hoop players proud parents of Makai and Demar well well done with both these young men and this guy right here at the line uh well trying to will Boston College to another win he has 18 points to lead all scores Zachary Kelly Tomorrowland for Makai Ashley CJ Payne on the floor for the Eagles Clayton cut off on the Baseline open three right mcleish and a huge offensive rebound by Kellen times right place right time theyre killing clock Applause times past the elbow weak side rebound Zachary out of bounds Applause and looks like theyre going to review that last yep to see if the ball went out off of Jaden Zachary now the argument obviously Earl Grant could make his is was there a foul here again uh yeah it looked like he got his hand right there so I think thats going to stay with Boston College a good job of blocking out by Jaden Zachary hey hand yeah he got his hand right there so again Im not sure theres much to reverse that and make it Maines ball I think thats going to be Boston Colleges ball Bennett 18 to go down three and if it is BCs ball which we think it is what do you have to do here in a 6764 mainly plenty of time no need but to come down and jack up a three uh for the game youre really struggling shooting the ball from the threepoint line Boston College uh you look at the numbers and the numbers dont lie uh its not pretty uh for Boston College below 30 percent from the threepoint line so again minute 18 Makai Ashton Lankford has been your guy I put him in a ball screen if Maine goes to a Zone do what youve been doing again paying you to that high post area be patient try to get a high percentage shot if the three comes off a triple Drive a kick and the defense collapses youre fine with that if youre Earl Grant but you do not need a three in this situation right now Thursday night well have the womens basketball game of the night on the ACC network of the ESPN app Don stallion number one South Carolina take on Clemson at Little John Carlson both teams coming undefeated and our coverage begins at six Eastern we are getting some interpretations from John Gaffney if thats an official free many HTC games and he asked us if we saw anything different and its exactly what I said you dont see anything on the replay that would say that it would go back and reverse that call again it has to be inclusive at anything it would be a foul to review the call the floor was overturned so much for our eagle eyes yeah we didnt seem like there was some confusion and thats a big break for Maine 20 on the shot clock huge break 78 seconds left in regulation slip and a steal Zachary Applause gives it to Chaz Kelly lost the handle Applause Zachary double teamed Ashton Lankford gets fouled Easton Maine under a minute to play so the Eagles dont let the overturned call fluster them as Jaden Clayton hit the deck oh right here again Jaden Zachary thats when he I think he would probably try to go and challenge but you can see the maturity by a Makai Aston Langford youll see this next pass by Zachary dont settle for the three dude and the foul problems continued he was perfect for the line before that six out of six but BC has been State free throws their 11th for 19 Applause Here Comes Clayton Billy Povich under 10 to shoot Clayton the take in the Miss fierbergs offensive rebound another big one remain and a take and the Miss and a steal my goodness what a steal by telling times shot clock off main impressive making huge 50 50 plays high oh my Chris markwood 138 seconds away and Demar Langford down underneath the basket as you see clutching his shin but Malcolm Huckabee main somehow miraculously coming up with loose ball rebounds well again we talked about it a reminder this make a recording of it but TJ Bickerstaff your leading rebounder on the bench really pretty much to close out the second half and certainly uh you like your chances rebounding with him out on the court unable to secure the rebound and then the last one Pena has the ball in his hand just doesnt chest it uh coaches talk about chinning the ball in that situation hes leaving it out exposed and Main heads up late they just took it out of his hands so some moments of concern for the Lankford family as tomorrow Langford remains down Applause and he was out for the first couple games with an injury this is certainly a difficult situation for BC Malcolm their injury depleted to begin with one of your best players is down on the floor and thats an uneven performance by BC is timeouts one for Maine and three for BC we are going to take a 30 second timeout as they continue to work on Demar Lankford for the Eagles trailing American East opponent made by three points we cant wait forever Music cant be mad we got you nacho fries made with Mexican spices made for nacho cheese sauce only at Taco Bell so Main inbounds and a foul quickly by Mason Madsen you see with a couple of give miles chili Povich Lamar Langford helped off the floor by Nick gallato and the BC training staff foreign Applause but he knocks down a huge free throw three points for getting you asapitis one of their game is their leading scorer at 17 and a half per outing Billy Povich back in for jashante Wright mcleish Troy at Florida State coming up next on acc Network fivepoint lead for Maine 12 seconds for BC Makai asked to Langford Hoist the three off the line rebound and the deal of bowich its been a thorn in the Eagles side and made his five seconds away from pulling a huge upset this will be the first loss for BC against America East opponent in seven years when they lost to UMass Lowell and Connie Forum well at the end of the day nobodys gonna care about the injuries uh that Boston College has in this game and make no mistake about it it is a factor but take nothing away from what Maine has done end this game start to finish uh they controlled the pace Tempo and you talked about it the rebounding the three by Matson no good and there you have it the end of the story is written hey it upsets BC Chris markwood on the BC Staff last year
