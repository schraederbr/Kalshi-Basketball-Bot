loosened up on the side and well see plenty of him no Powell starting along with RJ Davis Elliot kadoo fin Allen luin and jayen Withers Carolina State going with d Tre Styles the former North Carolina player Michael okell who has the ball now Jaden Taylor Ben Middlebrooks and Marcus Hill who had a big game in the first meeting between the two well kicked into the back court over and back violation and turnover for the p and that is not something ree you see very offense from North Carolina State one of the lowest turnover teams not only in the ACC but nationally so powerwell will put it in Music play here is Kad kadoo had a big bucket against Syracuse to kind of fight off the orange but he had to fight foul trouble and that ball was tipped so we dont have dueling over and back violations in the opening minute going to see a lot of middle ball screen action from both these teams RJ Davis to beat the shot clock middle Brooks 14 as Jay mentioned in the first meeting as his first rebound tonight NC State is going to try to turn North Carolina over they have to manufacture some points off their defense in order to have a chance to win here in Chapel Hill Jaden Taylor against Boston College over the weekend scored 11 of the Packs first 13 points couldnt get a shot up on that possession shot clock headed toward five find Tre Styles the former tar here has it Rim out in his old home and Kau has it when kadoo grabs a rebound he can race it up the floor he chose not to on that possession Davis kicked to the corner Withers has been shooting it well misses the first one Powell flying in there and NC State loses it out of bounds itll stay on this end with Carolina and even though Drake poell did grab that offensive rebound cleanly just the fact that Carolina went so hard to the offensive glass is a good sign for the tar Hills they have to do a better job on the glass in order to win games down the stretch which are vitally Applause important go throws it Middlebrooks racing trying to beat Davis to it but RJ will track it down in the back court Davis being guarded by Jaden Taylor thats more size and NC States going to do a fair am a Applause Music switching W and hes got it again he wanted a foul didnt get it but he did six of his last nine threes coming in and hes one for two in the early going 19 points six rebounds and three blocks against Syracuse thats the Jaylen Withers that North Carolina expected when he transferred in for mouille and Carolinas going to finish strong Jay he has to play well because he has the size and athleticism that they need up front its been problematic and Taylor will have a chance for a threepoint play to answer what a beautiful back cut by Jaden Taylor and a fantastic pass from Ben Middlebrooks and the reason he was able to make that pass re was there was just not enough pressure on Ben Middlebrooks you have to really pressure the ball Van Allen Luben was three feet off of didnt have active hands and you could just pick a defense apart with no pressure on it Taylor cant complete the threepoint play 32 in the early Applause going Carolina going to go to the same middle ball screen action and the short roll is going to be open middle Brooks active with the rejection Tar Heels ball there is one of two coaches in the ACC who has a final four on his resume Kevin Keats in his eighth season as the wolf pack lost was a great run late last season to win the ACC tournament and continued on until they made it all the way through the final four and see States had trouble building on that this year nine game losing streak as we mentioned but theyve been close in a lot of games and Kevin telling us today that theyve maintained good attitude and continued to fight Davis again with the clock got it he does such a great job even though hes a smaller guard RJ Davis knows how to create separation hes constant movement moving without the ball but when he does have the ball hes not just going to stop and shoot over hes got to step back to create that separation he does it extraordinarily well whistle out front picked up here by Michael oconnell just took a drive oconnell couldnt put the brakes on and recover just a fantastic step back by one of the best scoring guards that the ACC has seen in a long long time J that last foul was on Elliot kadoo something that has been problematic for Davis in the Tar Heels is Young guard who really should be a freshman this year reclassified and came in hes had some trouble with turnovers and foul trouble like a season low 18 minutes in the heels last game against Syracuse almost turns it over there well theres got to be more ball movement if youre going to attack the C State Defense without making a pass youre youre leaving them in their shell youve got to move that defense around and then attack it Roger with the call out front he clar ears St Matt pot hour officials tonight foul was called on Marcus Hill its his first really what NC State wants to do is they want to run RJ Davis off the threepoint line theyre theyre probably not going to go out and guard Elliot kadoo past the threepoint line because hes not a proficient perimeter shooter and when he drives it you want to make him finish a tough two know turns it over Styles has it working on Davis D Styles misses and the putb is there as he followed his own and got it home and were tied at six it seems like its always the shooter that has the best idea of where the balls coming off and youre not often thinking about blocking out the shooter in that sort of situation power with a nice move to the cup great is such a good Defender hes strong and physical but when he can bring offense with that straight line drive hes even more valuable substitutions waiting at the scores table when we get our next break in the action for both teams cward to Middle Brooks deep position they swing it oconnell for three middle Brooks keeps it alive and a fresh 20 for the wolf pack and middle Brooks does such a good job of chasing after the ball hes not a high volume rebounder but hes been a high volume rebounder against North Carolina Hill couldnt get it to go with the left hand Davis trying to race ahead of the defense he puts it up and RJ will go to the free throw line and chance to add to this lead little intensity going in the dean Dome early some ACC Bracketology whos in whos out whos on the bubble we know where Huberts team is well talk when you come back Music Music more so than actually winning Net game outside quad one would help yeah its not necessarily A mustwin but it cant lose from a a bubble perspective and how unusual is it in this season that youve got so few quad Run games in ACC playing obviously thats a result of the we not C rare turnover by NC State September into the game and into the scorebook and Caroline has stretched the lead to six and theyre starting to put some heat on in the back court and they force another turnover as Trey Parker the youngster shuffled the feet and traveled and backto back turnovers in the back court for the pack and two possessions in a row NC State inbounds the ball to the exact place you cannot inbound it to the coffin corner where they invite the Trap and its two turnovers for North Carolina State North Carolina very intelligent out of that last timeout bringing Seth Trimble in and deciding to go full court pressure to change the tempo of the game Jaylen Washington who had a big game in the first meeing as did Ian Jackson also on the floor for Hubert Daviss team Jackson been struggling on offense had a big game against Syracuse has the ball now puts one up in the pain and tremble with another offensive rebound he couldnt get it to go and offensive rebounding is something Carolina has built its brand on for two decades theyre their lowest rate since 2002 getting only about 28 of their offensive rebounds J but pretty good job in the early going tonight and Seth Trimble is their leading rebounder and hell be the smallest leading rebounder if he continues this since 1950 for North Carolina Washington up in no eight if he can gain some confidence down the stretch Jaylen Washington can be a Difference Maker he was really good in that first game he had 11 points 12 rebounds six of them on the offensive end and three blocks against NC State in a twopoint win that Carolina had without Jaylen Washington playing that way they dont win that game andon Huntley Hadfield into the game and he misses and Washington that third block Jay was on a potential game timeing shot from Jaden Taylor game that he was won by adus 146 eight nothing Applause run Jackson little bit of lazy pass RJ Davis saved him RJ in its a 10 number is going to get a timeout hes so good off broken plays and youre right that onehanded pass was not what Hubert Davis wanted but his namesake RJ Davis makes a great play out of it terrific pass dra on two Defenders getting it into Jaylen Washington for the easy bucket then RJ getting all the way to the 10 on the broken play Arena weer for you to walk come on in have a seat ticket holders if they show up they can move you around we got everybody in the lower bowl and so far theyre enjoying what theyre seeing tar Hills on a 10 nothing run and already theyve done some work on the offensive glass and the Press is also been effective too in the opening moments and we got Marcus Hill in a little bit of trouble now but now in the front and theres Parker with the wild one and there it is but thats how you break pressure you have to break it the score and North Carolina has come out from the first five after the first five minutes theyve come out with more of a hit first mentality theyve been more Hammer than the nail and thats the way theyre going to have to play like North Carolinas going to have to to win in the trenches and be the grittier team in a game like this I set you up and left it for the neck ball and got didnt get it I left it there for you the bill RAF ni we led the nation in that Applause I dont like it when people call it a wedgie just brings back bad memories from my childhood having an older brother Atomic or otherwise shout out to Dave bis for keeping you in your place back in the day then when I got old enough to beat him up it wasnt any fun Parker hit them both and now Inc stage going to show a little pressure Applause now theyll retrieve is RJ Davis working on Marcus Hill saw Trey Parker Dennis Parker number 11s also in the game Jackson goes by him and Parker gets a hand on it changes the shot Seth tremble from Washington for the bucket most big guys would just try to go up with that offensive rebound but he didnt have a great angle and Washington was very patient waiting for tremble a cut where he could present himself as a receiver Parker lines one up its a little bit long great p is back into the game here come the heels NC State did a nice job that looked like a classic Carolina transition off a long rebound but NC State got back and set their defense that was very good in their transition Music defense Davis its 11th time in his career hes played against NC State average about 15 points per game over that time thats the kind of shot NC State wants to force him into a tough two in the Music midrange this young man Trey Parker hes going to be a really good player so athletic and Kevin ke is talking about him consistency when you do something well continue to build on it developing good habits but man the sky is the limit for him but that is NC States fourth turnover of the first half and North you knowth North Carolina can speed you up a little bit and Trey Parkers last six games hes averaging 11 points but hes 13 of 25 coming into this game from threepoint rate is Applause 52 heres good using the Washington screen Withers is already hit one and now hes another that was all set up Reese by a terrific screen by Jaylen Washington he was physical on the screen and that really put NC States defense in a tough spot but if Jaylen Withers is going to play this way then I think North Carolina is going to be a real threat down the stretch excellent job Jaden Taylor one of two returning starters from the Final 14 out in the air you used that rear end that caboost quite well and hes got four he was asking for a foul he got that rear view mirror challenge defensively good C that was just a little chin cut off of Jaylen Washington Washington if hes physical on those screens he can really free up his teammates and physicality has not been his strength turnover really havent been a problem for iny state of late but they had been tonight good work from C Washington tried to dunk it from distance hell go to the free throw line instead with Carolina with a 13point lead on ins State not quite halfway through the first half ESP sps exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Music Subaru 14 quad one wins most in division one and broom has been exceptional and I heard you say it the other day and I dont think theres much argument to it its a Twan race between he and Cooper flag for player of the year and its hard to turn away from what Janai broom has done against the level of competition that hes faced I mean there 14 quad one wins I mean that thats six more than the next best team its got eight nice soft touch from Washington Mak the lead two touchdowns there the numbers both guys had exceptional Seasons flag leading Duke in virtually every category and broom has had a remarkable ability we saw it in person on Saturday every time Alabama got close they needed a bucket or a play broom made it he did the same thing there was a game earlier this year Jay against Old Miss where the rebels continued time after time in the second half to make a run and it was broom virtually every time or somewhat on Bruce Pearls team that had the toughness to make a big play Carolina showed a lot of toughness here in the first half trembled in start set puts it up tremendous athleticism just to avoid the travel couldnt get the bucket Mar hill Oh away Jackson with a block pardon me Washington jayen Washington with the block well this has been a different North Carolina team defensively even in the half court and that that one of the turnovers Ian Jackson did a great job of making a steal coming off the ball Ian Jackson for three and Carolinas opened up a can right now theyre up by 18 everything the Tar Heels have done has been on point and NC State needs to get Marcus Hill going you know the Lefty of the transfer from Burling green he had 20 points in the first game hes our leading score but he hes got to find a way to get some points on the board Andre Styles right over Washington great contest and Styles now with four Michael oconnell stepping in and knocking it away itll stay with North Carolina lets take a look at that block from Jaylen Washington again well Jaylen Washington in the backline of that defense Ian Jackson does a good job of contesting without fouling and letting his big guy block the shotan Jackson comes over from the right side when hes allowed to catch to shoot the ball from the catch spot hes extraordinarily dangerous he hes a catch and shoot specialist he had 23 against Syracuse went five of 10 from three he also had 21 against C State the last time these two teams played and you know Jay that last one was a big one for him he had four straight games which he been in single digits and then had a talk about over games and nobody is going over for Carolina right now another three ball from Kad and Lead is 19 well you think the the way Carolina shot the ball up at Syracuse took the lid off they made 13 threes at Syracuse thats not been their M on the season but seems to be an now a lines one up and simmers down the crowd for a moment hes got seven Jackson quickly into the front court all the way in off the window and thats Carolina basketball the give up a bucket and then get a score even when they do score you score right away a tried to make it two in a row and it rimmed out on him here comes Davis Hubert Davis wanted his team to play with Pace not just in the full court but in the half court as well and so far North Carolina has done exactly that they have been really hard to guard because the pace that theyre operating under middle Brooks lines up a three three Ian Jackson with the rebound four different tarel have hit threepointers already tonight RJ might have gotten a little aggressive but vanel and Luben saves it and Davis will go to the free throw line as the foul is going to be caught on a Connell one thing that has held North Carolina back a little bit this year is theyve not been great at getting to the foul line thats something normally that Carolina does extremely well theyre 136th in the country at free throw rate and their big guys have not been drawing fouls like they have in past Seasons but in this game North Carolinas been attacking and theyre putting NC State in a position to foul and as a result getting to the line it is 12 minutes into this game as Trimble returns and also checking in for NC State is Paul mcneel youngster Carolinas hit all of it free throws you see where RG stands on the accs alltime scoring leaders but as Carolina has struggled lost some games played some close games against lesser opponents youve sort of steadfastly maintained that they are better than their playing at least for 12 minutes this has been a really good version theres another turnover Davis hoping for three Powell offensive rebound Carolina this like old school Carolina attacking on the boards putting it in theyre blowing out NC State is 37 15 aside from this one by Jaylen Withers that came at the end of a shot clock North Carolina threes have all come in Rhythm and theyve been open threes and with the 13 of 28 that North Carolina shot against Syracuse and five of nine in this game against NC State in their last two games 18 of 37 from three thats thats got to be for a a short stretch among the better shooting performances in North Carolina history as you just saw in that graphic at this moment for the season e worst in North Carolina history shooting the is around 33 RJ Davis for a number of reasons no no Bott no Ingram this year the shots have been tougher to get but he hasnt shot at the same rate that he has in the past with Jaden Taylor so difficult off that middle ball screen they were trying to weak it to send him to his left hand and he did a really nice job of pulling up in the lane got that Challenge from behind but thats just a two its a tough two and thats what North Carolina wants to pour since he stayed into it Js doing everything he can to keep him in it hes got nine shot CL didnt reset didnt hit the rim now it did and yet another offensive rebound for from North Carolina is the Stag is getting outworked theyre getting outworked and theyre getting out hustled to the ball those long rebounds are available to more players say Treno chance for a threepoint play a little something to say to his old pal Onre Styles or at least former Tarheel boy how about the strength of Seth Trimble he had Styles arms wrapped around him when he went up for the shot and still was able to finish it with a essentially a double challenge got it wrapped around him and then Styles went up from behind to try to block that shot thats just terrific strength by one of the best twofoot leapers not only in the ACC but in the country hes improved his offensive game dramatically 12 points per game didnt start tonight but now hes got seven Off the Bench and its 40 for 17 and hes so good defensively its almost like he was born in a stance five steals in his last two games heading into this one look how far out Michael Connell has to go to get the ball to start the offense middle Brooks lost it FY state has already exceeded in season average for turnovers in the first half tonight lot of the things the pack talked about in shoot around this morning have not been executed very well and Taylor can continues to fight and hell go to the free throw line and shoot a couple foul was called on kdo and its once again his second womens college basketball Thursday night 700 eastern time on ESPN 2 louisvil taking on Duke defending the proper basket will be Paramount and that one for those of you who might be familiar with the popular video clip Taylor missed the first free Applause throw and that foul by Elliot kadoo you give him credit for really working hard to challenge that shot thats just not where you want to pick up a foul and have to go to the bench hes too valuable in his passing and ball handling to be out of the game tayor has 10 of vinc States 18 points ining the first half he knocks it out of bounds pack trying to apply some pressure all right if youre in Kevin Keat situation here J down 22 not much as gone right youve got a little over 6 minutes here what margin would you like to get it to by the time you go to the locker room in terms of building a little confidence and momentum well youd like to get it around the 10 Mark but really what you want to just do is establish some sort of offensive Rhythm not much of that and Ill tell you who does have some everybody in white RJ Davis now into 11 and North Carolinas ball screens especially in the middle of the floor have netted some pretty good Applause results now Taylor working on tremble loses a handle he retrieves it and tremble is just roll over Taylor ex play and knock it out of bounds itll be Wolfpack basketball seven on the shot clock he not only moved his feet to stay in front his hands are active just an outstanding Defender its 64 he can switch off onto just about any size of player he can switch one through five and compete okono a rare turnover for him among the nations leaders and assisted turnover ratio but everybodys been generous with the all tonight States Washingtons all by himself inside and hes got a half dozen I dont know why Michael okono tried to throw a bounce pass into Brandon Huntley Hatfield throw it up he had a guard on him McNeil was Tangled Up lot of physical play Styles Fade Away wont go and those who have walked in on open seating night here in the de are just having a ball as North Carolina has pushed it to 46 to 18 Seth Trimble has nine Welly this is old school North Carolina basketball pressure everywhere in the full court getting out in transition okono cant get it to go and there to put it back in is the youngster Paul mcneel one of the few offensive rebounds North Carolinas given up in this game what was the last time Carolina hung a half a hundred on somebody in the first half it hadnt been an ACC play barring utter disaster theyre going to do it tonight RJs wide r on the shot Huntley half field with the rebound Here Comes OK really North Carolinas done this primarily with defense consecutive near missed catches for in St theres having trouble with basically passing and catching the basketball look at that block out thats thats old school you dont see it that much let it hit the floor and still get it and a little bit more responsibility on the shoulders of RJ Davis having to play point guard and also look to score with Elliot kdo on the bench Davis drives looking to score and does car another basket at will at will he just passed former NC State star Rody Monroe for good place in the alltime scoring list heres McNeil in traffic The Freshman will go to the free throw line and Seth Trimble since hes taking the floor has been putting on a show Jay well Seth Trimble has nine points in this game and thats quite a transition attack with his strength youre going to have to stop that ball but NC State couldnt do it Applause Music Applause 320 to go the crowd celebrating with Sweet Caroline theyve had a lot to cheer about Jay the Chancellor from North Carolina came out during the last stoppage during the timeout if you have a look at the stat so far and he brought the biggest cheer of the night Lee Roberts and gave it the dramatic pause when he said tomorrow Classes are cancelled this place went nice apparently they didnt know they dont have to go anywhere why are you being the fun police its fun that they cancel class we just came off Seth Greenberg being a buzz kill talking about quad three and not making the ACC tournament I figured Id join in that is that is an issue for State because of ACC expansion the addition of SMU Cal and Stanford the teams that finish at the bottom of the standings at three teams wont make it to the ACC tournament as the standings are at the moment North Carolina State the reigning champion of that event would not be in the field a Tyson into the game for Carolina from the basine NC State Washington NC State went to a two3 Zone trying to keep North Carolina out of the paint but also just change the the rhythm of this game make him stand around a little bit North Carolina obliged McNeil The Freshman showing some fire keeping the ball alive and giving State another chance and a three ball from the corner as Den as Parker with his first bucket of the night Trimble used that twoot leaping ability you mentioned earlier to save the heels from the turnover Elliot Kad has operated in the inside of his own he did it against Syracuse and was really effective a Tyson has had a struggle after transferring from Belmont but thats what he was able to do there and he gets in on the ACT and theres the half aund in the first half from the heels marker tries to answer another rebound for tremble thats five long pass ahead a little too tall for Music with okay Tyson transferred in from Belmont a good job of getting the ball into the post and then just relocating down to the corner then when the defender turns around hes not there anymore and he was ready to shoot when he caught it and to your point at Belmont he was all Missouri Valley Conference playing for Belmont in the Missouri Valley Conference freshman of the year but at times North Carolinas Pace hes not adjusted to it quite as well brother Hunter lady Clemson plays for the Denver Nuggets and he has a twin sister who is in speed vinc state theyre probably not speaking this Applause week Parker hit a three a moment agoo pulls up on Davis tough too Ian Jackson 90 seconds remaining here in the first half its been all North Carolina re Davis Jay billis with you been come as you are open seating here snowy day in the triangle area making traveling treacherous but it is apparently heated up to Tar Heels ball goes out of bounds and itll go to NC State NC State went back to manto man on that possession and RJ Davis had a lane to the basket but tried to avoid the block shot by Taking It Wide you really have to go into the body of a shot blocker there youre just giving the shot blocker a little more Applause space pack looking for anything to build some optimism going into the locker room thats a strong move when Marcus Hill scores thats his first bucket I believe he has not been as much of a threat in this game and the game in Raleigh between North Carolina NC State he had 20 points I think he scored like their first 10 thats right first 10 of the game belong to him doubled it up over the course of the game how going to try it again got it a great substitute by Hubert Davis I dont know whether he sniffed out that zone coming but Kate Tyson has been a Zone Buster out of each Corner about 6 seconds difference between a shot and game clock Taylor has it knocked away shot clock at two he gets it off did not hit the rim its a shot clock violation and hbert will use the timeout with a 5426 lead well take a 30 second break back for the last 48 after this Music Music Music this weekend an ACC mens basketball triple header starts at 200 Eastern Time Georgia Tech and Boston College Boston colle came in this building and pushed the heels to overtime then itll be Clemson nationally ranked taking on SMU and then well wrap it up Virginia Tech and the you 600 eastern time its all on the ACC Network K Tysons hit a couple of Threes NC State is down huge North Carolina will try to put the finish in touches on This brilliant first half eight different Tar Heels have scored RJ Davis Leading The Way with 13 Washington has it Pau on the Fly that way its got a pass Ty Tysons going to try it again and that is how well go to the half NC state has lost 11 conference games theyve had the lead in the second half of nine of them pass it to the first half scoring over 50 for the first time since they did it against Elon earlier this season one of those guys off the bench is Seth Trimble whos been starting he gave bit of a Lim and the only guy who played and didnt score in the first half for Carolina was vanin Allen Luben and now he has in the lead is 30 just a nice little screen slip to the basket V Allen Luben who started his career at Notre Dame playing for Mike spray then transferred to Vanderbilt and hes really been playing as an undersized fiveman throughout the course of the year four is his natural position Andre Styles the three for the pack kadoo cut off by okono now Davis is guarded by Taylor out Applause front uses the screen from Luen Davis down the boulevard over midd now lben has back to buckets and that was a really nice job by RJ Davis of snaking that pick and roll getting a defender on his hip and anytime that you go up to block a shot often times that opens up the offensive blast and Ben Allen Luben took advantage of it Styles rolls in another one his homecoming not exactly going the way he imagined but he has nine one of the things Rees what Hubert Davis wants to see he doesnt want to see his team trade baskets even though theyve got a huge lead here lets have a look at the play RJ Davis made the Luben finished he gets Jen Taylor on his backside little hostage dribble and just snakes through that pick and roll but when Ben Middlebrooks went down the lane that just opened everything up for Van Luben to get to the offensive glass and jam it through Applause there fortunately didnt turn it over tried to slip it to Luben shot clock inside 10 now kdo does turn it over here comes okon okono all the way in for the bucket he has four I dont know where Michael oconnell shot against Virginia in the ACC tournament ranks in NC State lore but its got to be near the top probably not too far behind and now and Ruben apparently wants to get on the scoring act his third field goal in the second half would you say as far as oconnell shot that banked in for those who might not remember to force overtime ultimately sparking that run Inc stayed ah to the final four probably just behind the Wittenberg pass shot to lenzo Charles yeah he claims it was a pass so he cant have it both ways he cant have that as a shot but that was a a terrific catch by VIN Allen luin on that little pocket pass off the middle screen and roll now Luben has all seven North Carolina points here in the second half after not scoring in the Applause first you can certainly say that NC State hasnt had a great year so this makes some sense but you have to give North Carolina Credit there havent been a lot of teams that have done this T State theyve been in a lot of the games that theyve lost nine game losing streak J that weve referenced a couple of times heres Luben again and now theyre going to call an offensive foul for the discard but the n game losing streak that weve referenced a couple of times at State just broke in the game against Boston College four of those games were one possession games and they you know they had opportunities late in a number of them NC state has shown a lot of fight this season it certainly hasnt gone their way not having Mike James available with that knee problem has been a a really difficult thing two hands on the ball handler there from Elliot CAU thats his third foul that means hes going to have to be subbed out and thats just there are two fouls hes picked up of his three that I would call unnecessary that was one of them it has been a bit of an issue for the young point guard he and look he made a big play late against Syracuse but a season low in minutes in their last game because of foul trouble now Taylor pulls up knocks it in hes now up to a dozen Applause go Davis got hit the shot and Roger SS call the foul on Jaden Taylor its his second North Carolina very clever little get screen to go bring RJ Davis to the ball and once he catches it then he can turn right into a ball screen and then operate out of it they have to do so many things to try to get him open because hes got to score points for North Carolina to win games Carolinas alltime leader at the free throw line 86 and their alltime leader in threepointers now up to 14 and over his last seven games hes been the RJ Davis weve come to know averaging just under 18 over that stretch and shooting over 42 from three but last year what he used 40 for the season made 113 threes and average over 21 a game to be ACC player of the year the percentage for the season is still hovering right around 32 33 wers has rebound T are going to make a push and get into the NCAA tournament theyll need him to score big RJ almost loses it that rebound by jayen Wills thats the kind of rebound he needs to grab two hands in traffic working on middle Brook but now misses this time Jaden Taylor with the rebound got away with a chicken wing there Im surprised they didnt call an offensive foul Taylor knocks in another three hes having a night hes got 15 Vincy Stage 38 Withers out of contact there no call no play on and Withers has the bucket well if he was right he got fouled Applause there and Miss Park waiting to come in for NC State Styles knocks in another three right now North Carolina not putting the same kind of pressure on the ball they did in the first half its difficult to do when youve got this kind of lead but they still need to heat up the ball against CC State they dont want to let the pack get comfortable RJ Davis rattles out Marcus Hill on the Run for the pack now look this lead is a lot bigger than some but one thing thats happened to Carolina a number of times this year as Taylor is trying to carry them offensively is that they have given up leads very quickly the game that they still talk about around here there was a first half against Pittsburgh on the road had a 10point lead about the last 90 seconds of the first half and it was down to two in what seemed like 15 seconds so RS I got away with a walk there they could get lost focus at times but moving is locked in and Laser focused here in the second half hes got 11 into double figures in the second half well after that screen he just rolled hard to the basket and the thing you like about the way ven Allen lubins playing this second half hes taking everything to Applause dunk Taylor wild shot off the backboard Davis on the Run working on okell and the foul will be called and Carolina will go to the break with a 24point lead operating out of the middle of the floor just a quick slip to the basket a simple give and go nobody picks up ven Allen Luben and he has been taking everything to dunk in this second half he had 11 but hell take nine here in the opening moments of the second half many of them on dunks hes been very aggressive and taking the ball hard to the basket whether its a screen roll situation or that give and go that led to the dunk North Carolina shooting 62 in this second half but what I think Hubert Davis is more concerned about is the tar defense in the second half NC State is shooting 70 theyre seven of 10 to start the second half three of four from three and both Jaden Taylor and Dantes styles are getting too many easy baskets I think for Hubert Daviss taste and this he has been preaching all year long to his team discipline and Def details and in the first half North Carolina played a very disciplined game and their attention to detail was excellent you know in the second half theyve done a good job offensively but I think he wants to see a little more grit on the defensive end not just trade baskets even though theyve got a big lead constant fight against human nature and complacency you seem to be winning that fight theres never been a complacent Bree Davis Im driven by the great partners that I work with wanting to make sure I dont disappoint any of you and speaking of that here is Hubert Davis during the last break he was so much nicer when he was on college game day with us you know hes he hes hes got hes got one of those Rings you know that you wear to monitor all the things and I think his wife Leslie keeps an eye on that um think Danny Hurley might have said or someone said of him the other night he was struggling with Villanova that he might have uh might have short circuited that warning a couple of times yeah Dannys ring is probably in a default position thats much different than Hubert Davis but one of the things that that you know and I think I know pretty well about Hubert is hes one of the nicest human beings youve ever met but hes a Cutthroat competitor mhm yeah dont you can mistake being polite for weakness at your own Peril middle Brooks working on Washington Ben cant quite get it to roll in and into the game and fighting for it is Tre Parker he was last to touch it itll be Carolina Applause basketball Trey Parker Dennis Parker numbers five and 11 into the game for Kevin Keats back court pressure Trimble nice right through it hes got numbers from watch it or he can just take it himself that was a basket saving block by Parker Jr took it right out of the hands of Seth Applause Trimble DAV is trying to get it in Taylor pressuring him Washington and Taylor trying to get Davis from to get the from getting the basketball and he had a hold of his jersey and got away with it heres tremble with a three not a great threepoint shooter yet that seems to be improving every year Parker all the way showing some of that explosive athleticism as he gets to the cup and draws the foul right how about that speed just to grab and go on the rebound and he shot out there like a bullet train grabs the rebound and he is gone thats big time speed talked about this a little bit in the first half Kevin ke really high on his potential you see over his last half dozen games hes averaging double figures we had a great game against Stanford at 19 against the Cardinal at 15 against Duke he went to a bunch of different high schools and Kevin Keats is trying to get him as with most most freshmen to play with high level consistency and thats not an easy thing to do people see guys like Cooper flag doing it Liam mcney from Yukon it is not easy one thing he does seem to have mastered those because of the appeal watching him play combined on Instagram and Tik Tok over 1 million followers well in this nil World valuation and the like Washington rolling off the screen and creates a little more space for RJ Davis who rolls it in and RJs got 17 and to that point when Jaylen Washington rolled to the basket he rolled right into Brandon Huntley Hatfield good Applause pass thats another issue Reese of pressure on the ball you got some pressure on the ball with high hands its a lot more difficult to see The Cutting Michael Aon what a timing play conell right on his average at six hes not a hes not a big scorer Jay but you think back to that run in the ACC tournament last year he scored in double figures in every ACC Tournament game all five of them for Inc State and after doing so only three times last year in the regular season and I hes had a run of 11 straight score of not scoring in double figures may get there n well they really needed him to shoot the ball more because when hes open he he had more a few more threats last year with DJ horn and certainly DJ Burns inside sh clock of six he and Jackson create Applause space he is a walking bucket after that stretch of struggling to shoot couple of games going offer from the floor hes found it again in the last couple of games good strong move inside from Brandon huley Hatfield the veteran big guys had a shoulder issue thats kept him in and out of the lineup though hes been back for the last couple of games after missing three it was his first bucket tonight Washington again in the ball screen kadoo drawing a lot of contact in there from Dennis Parker and well go to the Under 12 timeout with North Carolina in command of 72 49 ESPNs presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Music Music Subaru in the Big 12 what makes Houston as you have a look at Curtis Jones has had a great season this year and of course Houston with his customary great defense what makes Houston perhaps even more equipped this year to go to the final four win a National Championship and maybe some of kelvins other teams well they lead the nation again in playing hard so theyre excellent defensively as always an outstanding offensive rebounding team another turnover by Elliot Kau that has been a huge problem of late but Houston Reese shoots the ball better this year than they have in the past several years as a team they shoot 39 from three theyve got four different guys shooting over 40 from three Emanuel sharp being one of them theyre theyre a theyre a really good offensive team this season in addition to being really difficult to play against anytime you play against the Kelvin Samson team you better be prepared to have some bruises when you leave Carolina had to call a timeout couldnt get it inbounds they just had his first turnover the second half still down big Music sweaters that Roy Williams wears Mark Turon former coach at Maryland and Witchita State Jacksonville was an outstanding player of Kansas for Larry Brown his son now a freshman and his wife Ann are here at the game sons a freshman now in North Carolina Im sure did not cheer in front of his parents when the announcement was made he didnt have to go to class tomorrow another Carolina freshman his classmate Ian Jackson the strong plays into double figures with 10 Music now Hatfield as a tied up possession arrow will keep it on this end with the pack Jaylen Washington trying to be a bit more physical Bo Mark Turon played on a great Kansas team in the mid 1980s that 1986 Kansas team was in the final four and Larry Brown they wound up winning it in 19 88 but they have Ron Kellogg and Calvin Thompson Greg drying tremendous passet Danny Manning was pretty good too yes not bad at all your team fac them in the final four and 86 coach Ks first trip to the final four still hasnt sent us a check what kind of Bill would you send him for that I dont know I probably owe him a lot of money Kevin ke frustrating night for him when what has been a bit of a frustrating season as they lost a ton from his final four team a year ago mentioned the injury earlier Mike James that hurt them trying to compensate for some of the offensive Firepower that they lost a year ago lost a lot of close games tonight not particularly close down 76 to 49 that ACC tournament championship last year and then the resulting final four was one of the most amazing things Ive ever seen in basketball it it was absolutely stunning I didnt think it was possible to win five games in the ACC tournament win the championship but then to be able to come back and perform at that high a level in the NCAA tournament was incredible Applause thats what they did the five wins in five days and when you go ahead and extend it into the NCAA tournament they won nine consecutive elimination games because this is not a team that was going to the NCAA tournament without winning the ACC so they were fighting for their basketball life in every game one an overtime game one against Virginia we talked earlier about oconnell shot and people forget too in that run to the final four memory serves I think it was Oakland that they beat in overtime and so they won an overtime game along the way there too and clutch play after clutch play Bryce heard of freshman into the game for in state made a bucket a moment ago now at the free throw line missed first but going back to last year in the NCAA tournament I I thought that NC State might be out of gas when they hit the first round you know playing against Texas Tech I Ben Middlebrooks came up with 21 points and that game is just a remarkable win to spearhead that run in the NCAA 7652 you happen to just be joining us North Carolina jumped out early because of the weather here in the state of North Carolina in the triangle area they open the doors to the dean Dome tonight if you could get here and they encourage you to only get here if you could walk here ler said come find the seat and so youve got a lot of students close to the floor and even in this blowout game theyre having a time of their lives and so too are the Tar Heels been sort of hungry for a performance like the first 31 minutes of this one has been well North Carolina maintains possession on that last play because of the possession arrow but that was very close to being the fifth turnover for Elliot kdo in this game hes got four assists but also four turnovers and thats something that North Carolina needs to continue to be mindful of and clean up as they head down the stretch hes such a good player and plays with such speed but hitting a few more singles rather than going for home run plays would I think serve him serve him well Jay while we were having that conversation he did have his fourth turnover a minute ago and you tell is getting to him hes tremble well have a chance for a threepoint play he put both of his hands over his face after one of the turnovers when he threw the ball out of bounds on the other end you want to make sure that doesnt it doesnt start working against you you see tremble using the left hand nicely such great Hang Time Seth tremble is one of the more powerful athletes youre going to find hes just 63 but he plays a lot bigger than that this is not a vintage rebounding Tar Hill team as you mentioned earlier Trimble leads the team in rebounding hes averaging 12 points per game which that also is improvement over the course of his North Carolina career if he continues to develop his offensive game with that strength and toughness and athleticism hes already a terrific player but he can really be something else if he continues to add that offensive piece RJ Davis knocked it away shot clock five Trey Parker two hand strong rebound from Withers Here Comes Applause Music tremble inside eight and a half to Applause go Withers lining up a three and lefted just a hair Music short heav Keats getting heard Young a little bit of run here Taylors had a pretty good offensive night and find some friendly snowy night banking hours here in Chapel Hill what is that 19 for him now it is Applause correct hes really been the only consistent offense theyve had T hes their best threepoint shooter but North Carolinas done a good job of keeping him off the threepoint line hes had to go for twos RJ Davis use his body create the space undersiz guard and still getting in there drawing the foul 24point lead North Carolina on its way victory over its in state rival Music Music guys will look forward to that it seems as if every game is a big one in the SEC theres no no other no other game I mean every game in the Southeastern Conference has been a quad one game and uh when we were it was interesting when you were talking to Nate oats and he was talking about the ties last five games he goes every teams got a number next to its name and hes right theyre all ranked in the top 25 starting uh tonight I believe with the road game at Missouri boy Missouri is hard to play against they changed defenses Caleb Grill one of the best Shooters in the country I think hes still shooting around 50 from three on the season RJ Davis in this game I think hes drawn seven fouls hes had to play point hes played off the ball I wonder what his Fitbit says at the end of the game cuz he logs a lot of miles running all over the court trying to get open with those two free throws RJ Davis passes the great Johnny Dawkins for fourth place on the accs alltime scoring list he would have passed him a long time ago if Dawkin would have thrown the ball inside once in a Applause while Johnny Johnny wanted the shots to go in Johnny Dawkins was a great player I mean and you couldnt ask for a better teammate he was a he was a superstar but never acted like it off the court and when I first met him I was in high school I went over to his house to go to to go play pickup with him and I had never never met him before and didnt know what he looked like and when I knocked on his door he answered and I said is your brother here cuz I figured you know Johnny Dawkins got to be 65 and you know built like a truck and he was rather lean to put it and still is yeah 62 and skinny and I thought man were in trouble and we went to the playground and he was Applause Superman he was the one of the centerpieces for building the Duke Dynasty coach Ks first class which you were part Applause of time to develop back then Jay people stuck around didnt have a choice yeah talk looking for his first field goal of the night cont Styles the offensive rebound yeah theyre going to count that basket I dont know they have to that way they can take a look at it at least I dont know if they will witherss coming over to help out the block Applause he the foul is on Luben Im not sure that was a goal T honestly but Applause yeah I dont believe it was Applause one of the things Reese thats been a huge factor in this game is NC State has not received much production from their big guys M both Brandon Huntley Hatfield and Ben Middlebrooks have not really scored and they havent really been on the glass I mean Ben Middlebrooks had 14 rebounds seven of them on the offensive end in the first meeting between those two teams I think hes only got one Rebound in this game hes got one and none of them on the offensive end j so North Carol has done a much better job on the glass against CC State than they did in Raleigh Trimble finds a cutting Withers and withs lost control Styles Onre having a big night transferred here from Georgetown to NC State started his career with the tar Hills played for a couple of years he has 18 tonight seven of 10 shooting five rebounds to go with it he had a nice year at Georgetown last year Aver over 12 a game knocked in about 45 threes he played 45 games he two seasons here with the heels hes Luben inside missed the easy one got it back how goes strong against middle Brooks and theyll get Ben for the foul heck of a catch by ven Allen Luther 260 free throws on the way for North Carolina triple header on set Saturday starts the first of our Sonic Blockbuster Games Iowa State and Houston college game day will be there starting at 10 am eastern time Georgia and Auburn remember uh you know in aens Auburn gave up a lead late Georgia had a chance at the end of the game there and the Tigers were able to Prevail and then Kentucky and Alabama rematch of a game that you did earlier both teams over a 100 in that game yeah thats going to be a track me will will you be watching watching that game and wondering why they all dont play that way yeah you would like you would like everybody to play that way its just difficult everybody says they want to run yeah but running is hard I think maybe both teams werent over 100 I think I was thinking Kentucky and Florida yeah that was 100 I think it was like 10 102 95 something like that close enough yeah it was a lot to a lot Applause shot clock headed to 10 RJ Davis in the Tar Heels going to get a victory over one of their instate Rivals tonight OK Connell pulls it away and alen Luben was trying to poke it away from okell hes called for the foul thats his Applause Music third we had a fire here in the second half 11 points all of them coming after halftime not that he played poorly or anything in the first half it was just sort of upstage by everybody around him but he has gotten his I think he was the only one that didnt join the scoring party in the first half he joined it pretty quick in the second I think he got their first seven points of the second half and hes got 11 here the transfer from Vanderbilt Applause Trey Parker out to Connell WIS out Kad tremble hand back plays it in Trimble with 13 Off the Bench and what a nice pass ahead by Elliot kdo he has five assists last one as pretty as they come McNeil back into the game and youngster rattles one in PA mcneel NC state has made some difficult twos in this game but North give North Carolina Credit for running NC State off that threepoint line and forcing him into a little bit of a tougher two NC state has some young Talent now there they keep theres always a question in this era you can keep everybody together but Kevin Keats can keep these guys together future looks bright with some of this young Talent lets have a look at this play from Koo Koo really smart to just throw it ahead to Seth Trimble who he saw on the run after he got that long rebound and Trimble anytime he goes off a two feet nobodys getting near him that was a wrong footed two do leades the first of two on the front rim Applause Carolina looking for its ninth ACC win looked at their schedule earlier not a ton of opportunities in fact Duke is the only quad one game remaining prior to the ACC tournament and theyre on a lot of them at your disposal in the ACC is mcneel drains at three a couple of quick buckets here he has eight on the ninth McNeil at 12 against Louisville coming into this game he did six of his last seven field goals in the last two games working him in the rotation in practice this morning a little bit more is see him adjusting maybe down the stretch even more run one of the guys that theyll be counting on in the future RJ Davis off the window he has 21 got every shot in the book doesnt he little Runner off the glass Applause well its amazing the back court a few years ago that North Carolina had with Caleb love and RJ Davis both of them after Kaleb love transferred to Arizona both of them the same year were Player of the Year in respective conferences and Alan Luben on the follow another offensive rebound and hes got Applause 13 Neil WS with a heat check and great power the Carolina fans have came through the snow not only at Festival seating they have been treated maybe to North Carolinas best performance since the New Year Neil scores again theyre celebrate they were celebrating the snow earlier I was sitting in my hotel room this afternoon in front of the window looking out doing some work in preparation for trying to live up to your standard sitting beside you calling a game and I see these guys going down the street with a pickup truck pulling a couch with ski ropes across the Slick street that was me oh thats where I was doing my no I was on the couch where I do my best work Ive heard that for quite some time Luben with the follow it is Carolina blue tonight in this rivalry RJ Davis to Drake power love the Drake Music Applause Applause Music well look forward to that one you see Bracketology from Joey brackets a certified bracketologist three SEC teams on that one line Tennessee on the two I think maybe the most surprising of all of these teams listed not that theyre on the line but the way they play now is Wisconsin they are putting up what they put up 90 points what six times this year something crazy like that which is more than theyve done in the last several years combined and John tanji has been outstanding all season long and Wisconsin one of the best free throw shooting teams in the country as a team they shoot 84 said Trimble shot 100 on that trip to the line hes got 15 Carolina headed toward the twominute Mark in cruising these two played in Raleigh earlier this year it was a twopoint game and state had the ball had the chance to tie in the final shot any similarity between that game and this one is purely coincidental this has been all North Carolina pretty much from the jump theres Kevin Keats in his eighth year with the wolf pack great run a year ago Music and hoping you know Kevin talked me about how was you work through some of the business aspects of college sports that once the revenue sharing comes around they think thats going to be a benefit for them in terms of their roster construction the Ever Changing world of college basketball its mcneel roster construction is an interesting term I havent heard it much way to way to put together mcne goes one out of two in the line you have this kind of lead in a game like this you go deep into the film material but not too deep our friend Bubba Cunningham the athletic director here at North Carolina at a student athlete award named after him congratulations to Bubba but perhaps more importantly Bubbas mother who shares an affinity for sweets as I do she and I have spent some time with a group at Bubbas house postgame over the years and were always the ones going into the cookies and the chocolate and she brought me some Chapel Hill toffee pecan and dark chocolate with I may I dont know if you have napkins in your car but I might eat a couple of those in your car after I have had it it is excellent and also glutenfree well Im a fan of gluten that that will persuade me one way or the other 93 to 71 inside 90 seconds here to play North Carolina has Virginia coming in this weekend Virginia has really improved throughout the course of the Year under Ron Sanchez NC State have Wake Forest and other bubble team ell goes in and goes right into the cameraman Michaels a little slow to get up certainly hes okay and hes uping on his feet Connell started his career at Stanford before transferring to NC State and an outstanding lacrosse CR Applause player fans are going to get on him Applause they probably didnt love that could do tried to get out of the Applause way so on the on the subject this is the toffee and subject of cookies the reason theyre yelling as much as they are in addition to wanting an opponent to miss a free throw is if you go for two from the line here you get crumble cookies well they would have eaten well when I was playing what was your career free throw percentage you bet you right around 70 it was not very good well its not bad my teammates tried to foul Laughter me this is where a longstanding friendship requires me to point out to the people youre a thousand Point Applause score I know more if Dawkin would have passed the ball luckily my teammates missed a lot of shots there were a lot of offensive rebounds Applause only man who can stop billis from scoring Mike shefer nobody wanted to inbound the ball on our team CU theyd never see it Applause Music again heres K and its an easy bucket inside for James Brown H James Brown just a freshman first time I really saw him play was at Kansas where he had a couple of big offensive rebounds good catch and finish and to the light of the Applause crowd Huberts going to bring in the reserves and what a nights work for Seth Trimble ell Kau Ian Jackson RJ Davis come out earlier Jaylen Withers everyone Carolina blue contributing to this one round off to the left on free throw 498 until this one goes in the books doesnt it pain you that the uniforms that North Carolinas wearing tonight are called Throwbacks now they were just uniforms when I played I these are my favorite of their uniform I think theyre awesome these are these These are pretty similar if not replicas of the ones that they were when Phil Ford played right IAL yeah Phil Ford Michael Jordan this is what they were in the you know 60s 7s 80s when they got into the 90s thats when they went with the Alexander Julian uniforms but you know now you SE right over your shoulder oh is he yeah he is theyre great uniforms these are just I I think these are the classic ones now theyve got a back court of 30 and 14 which reminds you of Kenny Smith and Jeff Leo shared a back court with those numbers hey heels unlikely to make it to 100 Applause tonight Parkers going to try to get another one up step back may Parker cant get it to go Browns got the rebound and hes like nope thats the Duncan it is an impressive performance is Jay mentioned perhaps the best one in the new calendar year for Hubert Davidson Matari 9773 the final thanks for joining us tonight Jay bis Im Rees Davis our entire ESPN crew saying good night from Chapel Hill we go to the great Dave Pas and aubert Music
