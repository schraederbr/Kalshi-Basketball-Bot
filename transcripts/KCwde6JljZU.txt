Cavaliers just lost a three overtime thriller to Virginia Tech on Wednesday 95 to 85 So lets see how they roll here today We are underway Virginia wins the opening tip Will Wade wants his team to come out with a sense of urgency They did not do that against Wake Forest even though they won the game And it all starts on the defensive end applying pressure on the perimeter Keep your eyes on number 28 for the Cavaliers Tess to Ritter the 69 freshman with cheering a lot of pro experience They collapse on him and take it away immediately Theyre going to double down on that post Theyre going to make the Ritter a playmaker and not a score And Darren Williams a 66 senior wearing number one for NC State So much expected of him the preseason ACC player of the year averaging 14 points a game Theyre going to dump it downstairs for the quick shot by Van Allen Lou formerly of North Carolina And look at the Virginia starting five That includes Don Hall at the point Malik Thomas comes in averaging 12 points a game Bruno is a premier shot blocker has seven feet Virginia has size You think about especially for UVA you know they get to the offensive glass so well One of the top offensive rebounding teams in the country Its a really big thing for NC State defensive rebounding Five white jerseys getting back in the paint securing a defensive rebound NC State good shooting team trying to put that on display in front of the home crowd Theyre expecting about 15000 today Williams off the back of the iron and cant hit it Although he is averaging about 41 beyond the threepoint line Ditter a determined drive Gives it up for the corner jumper but cant hit it and a foul Itll go the other way inside the first couple of minutes here at Raleigh And a look at Ryan ODM new head coach of Virginia Basically grew up on the UVA campus in Charlottesville when his dad Dave ODM was Terry Hollands assistant coach And he admits going to work every day You got to pinch him Hes so excited Its not your fathers UVA team They play up in pace up in tempo They shoot a lot of threes and you love their defensive pressure which extends 94 ft Copeland launches way downtown but that clangs away coming to NC State after a stop at McNe State with Will Wade And thats going to roll off the iron Had a big fight for the rebound It comes free to Thomas underneath Lewis will line up a long one and hits it Got a good look Sam Lewis with the triple Hes 39 out there Gets Virginia started here this morning Blew up as a sophomore with Toledo last season really trying to find his way offensively for this team And this is what Tester Ritter is so good at doing finding people in transition Lewis stepping in the lane draws the foul Hell be headed to the line 67 junior to shoot Will Wade the head coach at NC State also in his first year got McNe State to round two of last years NCAA tournament You may remember he was fired by LSU three years ago at a 2year music show cause penalty for recruiting violations and then hired to replace Kevin Keats this year Filed here will go against Darien Williams his first cheering applause What will Wade has been able to do with programs obviously at Mink State last year getting a chance to see their run in the NCAA tournament Copeland being a player for that team You know I I think NC State has had to write higher and hes been trying to find multiple ways to bring that sense of urgency that fierceness Hes often said this team has a lot of good guys and that thats a great thing but also you want the guys who are willing to do the dirty work the grunt work and hes trying to find that next gear for this team as they kick off the ACC regular season Well you talk about you know finding a key He passionately blasted the critics of Daren Williams this year He had been held to 11 points or less in five of six games He took after the press covering the Wolfpack and he did it with no prisoners He said Im tired of answering questions about him Hes a darn good player Everybody needs to shut the hell up about him Really let him have it Yeah I love it when your coach backs a player like that What a move What a drive Lewis inside and knocks down two Just really good at utilizing that North Carolina you are not met with that same opportunity You have to start the game with the way you want to finish it You know we talked to him before the game in the locker room you and I We asked him specifically about the early start and will it make any difference He said You know what Weve started games at 930 in Hawaii 930 in the morning Were playing games at 930 at night coming up this week He said I tell my guys youre here to play and act like a professional perform like a professional And thats what he expects from them today Well be when you get paid in high six six figures nobody cares that the game starts at 11 Its a game You come out here you do your job Exactly what he told them Shot clock down to seven On the drive was Hollowman and hell draw the foul by Lewis A lot of times for NC State the way they initiate their offense it starts with either Copeland or Hollowman music Two guys that are really the only ones in the team that can get their own shot or create for others off the bounce would love to see NC State do more to try to initiate the offense for Darren Williams on the block obviously today going against the Ritter So needs to do it from the perimeter but still think his game needs to be played inside out Couple of fakes from Copeland Hell get it back and launch it and they desperately needed that finally on the board on the threepointer cheering and a whistle right here at midcourt The officials today Ron Guber Tony Henderson and Mark Schneer getting up early Foul on Paul McNeel the sophomore McNeel one of the holdovers from Kevin Keats Wolfpack team recently had a 47point game against Old Miss 11 threes Talk about a guy that just does it from the outside Also I just love watching the game of Copeland He can hit shots 54 from the threepoint line but also a creator Derritter got an open look Thomas a nice save on the rebound Zips it back out for Lewis And a second chance for Virginia Thomas Launch that one and knock it down Thomas number two scorer for the Cavaliers had a 24point game against Butler recently Also one of the main reasons why UVA got that game into triple overtime against Virginia Tech made some dagger shots down the stretch in the second overtime to extend it Matt Ael running the point and a hand off for Williams but very quiet in the very early minutes Tough shot but cant connect Big time rebound and working very hard Ben Allen Luben at 69 and he will draw the foul Virginia I think you tell him pumped up about that OB a little bit Well actually you called me like minutes after that and said this is great stuff Yes The way this is going to play in that locker room is the single most important thing cheering because you want your players to fight for you And obviously this game has not started off that way But that is an ongoing process that Wade is trying to find in order to get his troops ready for battle each and every night in one of the premier conferences in the nation Well they got off to a cold start Shot clock down to seven cheering for Virginia Valerie gives it up Tillis on the drive and a foul 13 on the drive here by Sam Lewis Very active with the ball Then Allan Luben will pick up his first with just a second to go on the shot clock and well put Lewis at the line The crowd rather bitter about that call I tell you I really love the pace and the ball movement that UVA plays with The ball doesnt stick to any one individuals hand It rotates the defense from side to side They play faster but also they play under control You know play fast think slow is the new style of UVA basketball Ryan ODM in year number one and Lewis will connect on that one Just seven points already And a 104 lead for the Cavaliers Looks a little bit different than the traditional packline defense doesnt it Sure does The offense does too Averaging 87 points a game Theyre getting it and they are going Copeland doing some banging underneath and knocked away Sundays ESPN 2 featured mens games coming your way We start with two of the top teams in the American Tain and Florida Atlantic Thats it one Two of the best in the Missouri Valley at 5 Eastern Bradley squaring off against Murray State Not waiting around indeed Once again its Sam Lewis whos the focal point of the offense Nine quick points Hes really started to find his rhythm offensively and that takes a while You know one of the things that gets harped upon a ton with negativity is guys playing for a lot of different schools I was talking to Kim Beltton last night our our producer and we were talking about how incredible it is for players to learn how to adjust to multiple systems so quickly almost as pros and thats what Sam Lewis is able to do Shout out to you Kim Kim Belton who did some things on the court Yeah he did in his days at Stanford Great player Bruno on the high post Heres Lewis again Lets see if they buckle down on him a little bit Bruno will kick it out Long one coming and thatll clang off by Mallalerie has actually been very good behind that threepoint line 41 And a shove along the baseline of Trey Hollowman the 62 senior Dont you feel like if theyre going to start to really play well Hollowmans got to be one of those guys whos a heart and soul for them Coming from Michigan State we played three years with Tomo You know he has to be that anchor He has to be the backbone of the team And a lot of teams I always wonder about NC State and identity right Obviously I think that starts with Copeland but I think Hollerman can bring that identity with the way he plays defense but also with his basketball IQ on time and situation Thats where they need him the most as a creator He was a co captain for coach so a guy really relied on Copeland again backing down draws the foul before the shot 1331 to go here in the first half and a choppy start for NC State as Don Hall will pick up the foul It just feels like you know early start to the day Both teams feel a little bit sleepy here Feels like the lead should be more for UVA but both teams trying to find the rhythm and also trying to find their lather frankly Try to find the line Thats a turnover How about these 1100 am starts Now you had starts like this I dont think Ive ever had an 1100 am start in my life had one at 1100 am at noon At noon not 11 But I you know at some point when youre kids youre playing AAOU basketball games at 930 1000 in the morning Now I get this is different but a game is a game But I I think both teams are going to settle into the game by the time we get to that under eight Williams handing off for Hollowman Got away with the carry right there He did Darren Williams in traffic and poked away Theyll keep it on this end But once again because of the size for UVA is making things very difficult for Darien Williams He cant just take you on the block but also the quickness laterally of the feet of UVA defenders doesnt allow them to beat them off the dribble either I totally agree with you I think it was the right question to ask Will Wade I think he was almost waiting for that to respond that way Yeah but Williams has had some outstanding games Banked cheering in by Ael What a sweet shot as he went to the other hand Matt Ael the freshman from Baltimore has had some really nice games You know I I think he has the highest upside of any player for NC State Hes a super talented player Was potentially not going to play today with a lower extremity challenge By the way that terminology just kills me Just tell me tell me what the injury is Ankle isnt it Exactly Just tell me Just tell me Just tell me Yeah But still he his size his length his ability to play through contact and that ability to finish with his left hand Quite a talent 78 at the line out of Baltimore and a threepoint play So the Wolfpack showing a little life here cheering All doubled up as he brought it across midcourt Its the last place you want to stop your dribble And a timeout Virginia so as not to turn it over Well take the timeout Ryan ODM ODM and UVA Well went 15 and 17 last year Now to coach Sanchez they had to make a move They had to change style update become a modern era team in many ways The follow will not go didnt touch applause and cheering anything And of course Tony had so much success playing that style for that era Yeah I mean now were in a new era Now also you have to think about what the future UVA basketball is And when you playing on a lot of players from overseas who are used to pace and space you have to make your style you music know associate with how they see the game And I I think thats where a lot of college basketball is going towards European style of basketball Got true international flavor to this roster for Virginia Players from Belgium France Germany and Nigeria Thank you Merci Danka Badunk O Different ways to say thank you in five different languages You are a talented dude Just saying its the five cups of coffee Dave Holman with a misfire from three Cant imagine what youre like with three cups laughter before 11 am Hand off for Hall Not a big scoreer but good assist man Lewis will dump it down the sevenfooter from Nigeria Shot clock down to eight All along the baseline got that pass free and once again it is Sam Lewis from the corner He has been the man already 12 points You know their last game against Virginia Tech was the first time this season he did not start Devin Tillis started instead Ryan ODM has a great way of getting the attention of some of his best players Well Hollerman did everything he wanted to do Got it to Abel in the corner but he cant connect from threepoint land cheering So the Cavaliers trying to build on a 159 lead All will find the open shooter from the corner but too strong by Gertrude and cheering it comes free to the Wolfpack and Copeland wants to push it Copeland with a NIFTY SPIN AND THE SCOOP but no It would have been a spectacular make Lewis has it knocked away Williams hitting the deck Great save Terrific hustle there Copelan And this time does connect Thats where NC State needs to get easier buckets off their defense in transition Sometimes our half court can be stagnant So getting points on the defensive end off turnovers is critical A Virginia team that likes to get the three ball in the air They average 28 attempts a game Derritter quiet so far Bowl pulling his way inside and a foul So the Wolfpack will pick up a personal That was eight on the shot clock We talked music about UVA having multiple players from all across the world Ill give it to you in English Sam Lewis saying thank you But how about Mercy Dunka Dunk OShea Oh yeah music UVA can do it a variety of different ways Bruno from Germany is 7 foot We talked about Onenso at 7T cheering Der spent the last couple of seasons playing in the top league in Spain Lia ACB and thats where youre seeing college basketball really transition to more of the feeble rules Right I I think we need to continue in that fashion and form I think it makes the game different from a spacing perspective and also from a shooting and pace perspective 1711 NC State just 11 points in the first 10 minutes four field goals and three turnovers So a choppy start for the pack and Allen Luben coming off 12 and 11 against Wake Forest Tipped out by Lewis checking with each other right now and theyre going to go and keep it on this end You know sometimes when theres a designed play instead of making the right read you try to force it Hollowman actually has a drive to the rim right there Looks like thats off Abels hand at the last second Yeah I think we have an official challenge by UVA Looks like that was off Abels hand if I saw it Well see it again music Take another look Virginia challenging Yep Off Abels hand That is UVAs ball They will get the previous call off the challenge of out of bounds against Virginia has been reversed Yep its the right call Its going to be Virginia ball inside out They will receive their they have one challenge left and receive their timeout Ron Groover explaining the new rules this year but also you know they forcing the pass Hollowman has to be a better job of actually reading the play He had a straight drive to the lane instead of trying to force the pass there Okay thank you So 1711 Virginia and exactly 10 minutes to go here in Raleigh And Devin Tillis 67 grad to put it in All trying to get out of that back court and does for Ditter Theres Lewis open again cant connect Yeah he got an excellent look too and a shove which will go against the Cavaliers NFL coming your way Panthers and Bucks at 415 and then the Seahawks and the 49ers all coming up today on ESPN Hey Tessa Ritter a guy averaging 16 and a half points six and a half rebounds only held to one field goal attempt today NC State doing a really good job of being physical with him making him catch the ball out of his comfort zones I tell you theres such a physicality in the way he plays and he is an elite passer Even that skip pass right there to Lewis goes to show you his vision Sier jumping in the lane little hook shot that wont drop for him big freshman at 610 Also played professionally in Spain Last two games 15 rebounds in 46 minutes You know energize your bunny You need that from people that come off the bench Ob people that give you that size that length defensively that second burst with that jump to get offensive rebounds and just creates energy for your team Twice declaring for the NBA draft and then withdrawing Theyll get another effort here Hollerman tried to find a seam there and a whistle Ron Guber blowing the whistle here with 916 left in the half I I love when I read in the game though So he he chose to come back to school Its like well because he wasnt going to get drafted out Thats right Thats why guys choose to come back to school Shot clock Lets see Theyre going to reset it to 27 Or actually in in todays era you can actually get drafted and still come back to school Yes Which I actually think should happen If you get drafted I do So if you get drafted in the second round and a team is going to stash you away maybe theyre going to put you in a GLeague or youre going to get your rights over to Europe you should be allowed to come back to college basketball and play So what makes our game better Now the rules need to be restricted to a way I would like to see contracts two to threeear contracts but I want the best talent in our game Love that idea McNeel will lock one up there and cant hit it the idea that you cant be just one year and then youre gone after 6 months Sign a twoyear contract You are committed unless the head coach leaves Agreed Then you have the ability to leave But I I think that solves the retention issue that a lot of college coaches are frustrated with because essentially right now youre signing players to a sixmonth contract Right Sier picking up his second foul Look at that ball pressure by Trey Holland Thats why hes on the floor He just rolled his ankle All giving it up for Tillis Knocks down a three That is a tough loss for NC State Thats the point guard Trey Hollowman limping off the court Oh hes in agony down there in the corner Yeah you just you see it right here with the left as he overextends it and just rolls it right there but an absolute pitbull on the ball defender You know he brings that pace to the way they play A lot of people think that your tone is set offensively A lot of times your tone could be set by the point of attack defensively and he is the tip of the spear Huge loss at 25 against BCU 16 against Auburn He can help that way too Thats a tough angle shot by Paul McNeel and he picks up his first basket Last year he would not have been able to make that shot after contact I think he was frail put on 20 lbs in the offseason I think that size and his upper body frame has allowed him to bounce off and absorb that contact differently than what you saw last season Bounced his way to 47 against Old Miss Long jumper swished in by Thomas but they like to shoot the threes and theyre making them He has six points and this is Virginias biggest lead Copeland tried the scoop shot Virginia to push the tempo on the jumper Thats way too strong by Mallerie Didnt touch a thing cheering Here comes the pack in transition They need to find someone to light up their offense McNeel then Allan Luben and midrange cant hit it Even though he was open that shot seemed rushed It didnt seem poised And I said I thought both teams settle into their rhythm around the under 8 minute mark Looks like NC State still trying to find that offensively Thomas on the attack will draw the foul And if youre just seeing Virginia for the first time and seeing this rapid pace you may be in a state of shock I mean just look at the music basketball IQ Pace and space What a great delivery by Maloy UVA finding their music rhythm offensively an incredible new year Can you imagine if Old Miss wins the CFP after losing Lane Keifin to LSU I just want that to happen so bad I mean I love Indiana I think Indianas the best team in the country man They just proved that Coach Signetti has done a great job Hes incredible and just amazing And you know theyve got a Heisman Trophy quarterback and everything else A foul stops the clock at 659 to go in the half Williams so far despite his head coach lighting up the media about criticism over him this week hasnt done much You talk about a guy that was a preseason ACC player of the year And over his last two games hes combined for nine points and he has not been shooting the ball well Now look I I Im a player whos been through slumps before The way you get out of a slump is by impacting the game in other ways And thats what Will Wade talked about at that post pressure you know but what you want to see is if your shot isnt falling you need to be engaged on the defensive end You need to be the first one down on the ground for a 5050 ball You need to be overindexing on how you communicate You need to be active on the floor Thats the next step in iteration of leadership for Darren Williams that we need to see Ono making the pair Meanwhile Virginia continues to pull away more and more each passing minute And the Wolfpack star has been very silent They need him badly Ben Allen Luben up top will hand off for Williams There you go Now walk him down They bring a double Look for the skit Great job splitting Splits that Went for the bank He returns that outside for Copeland Copeland Another spin move Heres the long jumper Way too strong by Breed UVA I said it earlier plays fast thinks slow Uh they are disciplined with their offense The ball whips around Its never stuck to one players hands Thomas off the window A sweet shot for two And theyre far more connected arent they They are And it it Look talent doesnt always translate into playing for each other And I think more so with European players theres a tendency to play together because of the style of play Moving off the back iron one and done And the crowd getting very restless here in Raleigh with this very early start Mallerie will give it up for Lewis whos been the star in the first half here for the Cavaliers Thomas Tillis with a rebound Hell get another opportunity Its Lewis again This one he buries from threepoint land that leads to another and three Making the right read and feeling out the game is what NC State needs to do offensively So coming up on five minutes before the break Virginia has totally taken the crowd out of it Not to mention the Wolfpack to this point Jeffrey out and a foul on the play And the act is shooting a long one here by McNeel Well it look when the ball touches everybodys hands offensively it has an energy towards it It has rhythm I think that energy also translates to the defensive end because everybody feels like theyre involved A lot of times when you music watch NC State play they go to ISO ball And when you go to iso ball offensively OB sometimes you stand around and watch other players isolate Sure And then it also doesnt make you engage as much You know Will Wayade has talked a lot about moving the ball around getting rhythm getting sets but you know Im just watching this team and youre wondering for NC State their identity What is their identity Who are they playing for What are they playing for And for a team with guys like Copeland and Darren Williams theyre veterans You want to see that You want to see them be fulfilled with that ahead of you who mentioned in Williams who is considered one of the top two or three gems in the transfer portal out of Texas Tech Had a 23point game in last years NCAA tournament against Florida Led Texas Tech to the Elite 8 So so high were the expectations for him when he plays like himself When he plays like himself Obie I mean hes a nightmare to watch right I mean he plays bully ball versatility strong has edge and poise when hes confident There arent too many players in college basketball better than Darren Williams 28 against BCU had 17 and 10 against Kansas Yeah And hes not he doesnt have a crazy burst of speed but hes very intentional and methodical with where he wants to get on the floor Thomas down the lane lost it and a tie up The possession arrow will take it to the other end Itll be Wolfpack basketball as they try and cut into this first half deficit All right heres an example Ball goes up OB if youre down by 20 how many players in a white jersey going to get on the floor for it Everyone right Two blue jerseys one white jersey It its those are the little things you look for Sense of urgency You know coaches talk a lot about chipping away at the game but it starts on the defensive end with getting stops Sounds like echoes of a Coach K huddle to me a little bit Theres a travel Yeah More of the PG version right Yeah laughter He could get after it couldnt he I often tell people dont bring your kids behind the behind that bench Its a different experience Coach K always looked so professorial didnt he You know he was down on a knee and he had the hand up to the chin Everyones like Oh hes just quietly lecturing his team Yeah I learned about that in my first ACC game I was like Oh so thats why the hand is over the mouth Right Right Jumper from the corner And they just cant miss right now Its Thomas their number two scorer He has 11 and theyre just adding on I mean theres so many questions around why he wasnt on the floor in the first OT and obviously the burst of scoring that he was able to provide in the second OT and the third OT that you know even though UVA lost that game to Virginia Tech you know they need him to be an elite scorer but also playing while not being ball dominant is an area of growth for him You know last year he had the ball in his hands a ton but playing with pace and space and the ball moving around is what youre seeing the growth level come out for Thomas in the way hes learning how to play the game with under Ryan Odum ONeal with the kick and Arsenal knocking it down The shooting guard who played for the national in a national championship game last year Houston Theyre expecting a little bit more from him They get a triple 3316 Virginia cheering Paul will launch one Arsenal showing some energy off the bench as he plucks the rebound Hes out of Bulmont Texas Terrence Arsenal gives it up for Guadier Copelan Ben Allen Luben directing traffic Shot clock to 10 Williams for Arsenal again Not this time Rebound tipped and controlled by the Cavaliers on the run On the deep side Yes Williams stepping in Williams on the attack and will back in two cheering Thats the Darian Williams you want to see The guy engaged defensively sprints down the floor gets the steal from the weak side uses that upper body strength to bully ball towards the rim cheering Tillis with the kick Bruno straight on No So a couple of misses from threepoint land for Virginia and a whistle with 247 to play in the half applause And Darian Williams may be finally starting to come to life We talked a lot around D will getting engaged in this game And like I stated it starts on the defensive end It translates to offense NC State trying to claw music their way back in the game 20 but Malik Thomas quietly an excellent first half too 117 rebounds You think about Thomas and Lewis have combined for 31 of the teams 40 points in the first half Drew Law on the back as Virginia opens up the second half and a foul here as Derritter gets hit He did not have much of a presence in the first half but they really didnt need him Ill tell you something Most players do not look to embrace and absorb the incoming contact Its almost like its like an energy suck for him Like he he wants it He he attacks it He goes towards your body and plays through contact every possession He played 45 minutes on Wednesday in that triple overtime game Had 22 and 13 Territter 69 freshman from Belgium but hes going to turn 23 this month So freshman and name only He has four points A lot of pro experience there as well for him in Spain I am so intrigued to see the level of tenacity the sense of urgency that North Carolina State tries to start the second half off with I I can only imagine what Will Wade had to say in that locker room during the break And Alan Luben wriggling three inside So good ball movement there for the Wolfpack They only had three assists in the first half but that gets it back to 20 Virginia 11 and two ranked number 21 Oh plucked away and a terrific steal here Breen will go all the way and lay it in applause More of that Right away Darren Williams with the pass And then the next sequence defensively Brie with active hands getting the turnover Copeland will commit the foul trying to tie up Don Hall Thatll be his first and Darren Williams zero assist in the first half but I said before intentional and methodical with the way he moves getting to positions on the court And hes such a gifted passer with all the attention that he continues to draw Lot of lot of skills there a lot of skills for the 66 senior from Sacramento You know people like Oh hes not athletic Im like What are you talking about Hes athletic because of his vision his dexterity and the way he moves his feet Hes an elite athlete Thomas with a miss Ritter had it knocked away but a foul will go against Virginia So Tesa Ritter in traffic there and a foul 1832 to go in this one Well see if the Wolfpack can get this crowd back in it Just look at this Five blue jerseys all advanced over the half court line Putting pressure on you trying to force you to play faster Hand off for McNeel and tipped into the back court by Virginia Williams slamming on the brakes on the drive in tough traffic and the foul applause Alan Breed the senior and itll be on Grunlow the sevenfooter picks up number two party the applause 4225 at the line Allan Breed he makes 88 he transferred from Will Wades previous school mate started his career at Providence as we so often say when reading resumes these these two or three or four schools Hollerman hobbling his way back to the bench but he is not expected to play in the second half Williams got the pass free Copelan hands it back off and a foul So NC State with some energy here in the opening minutes as you would expect Well you heard Seth Greenberg talk about it a little bit during one of the breaks in the first half There was nothing disruptive about the way NC State was playing defense And we literally just felt the body of Darren Williams banging to the scoreboard as he do to make the play sharing the rock But defensively you just feel the sense of urgency that is different than what you saw in the first half for the Wolfpack So to be breed to the line after the nice save there by Williams and that was the third foul on Sam Lewis So if youre with us in the first half he was the story for Virginia pouring in 20 points was able to knock down shots but also Dave the ball was able to move from side to side of the court And you know when youre playing defense the way NC State would like to play where they switch everything being active disruptive you shouldnt allow those balls to reverse as easily So Breed with another one coming Lewis hitting the bench So hes got a lengthy sitcom coming and thats a huge miss for the Cavaliers with the half he had His careerh high is 23 Almost had that in the first 20 minutes Will Wade said during the press conference there are other ways to measure whether a player is impactful in the game and things they do on the defensive end and off the ball Youve already seen multiple multiple possessions by Darien Williams in the second half where he has impacted this game with what hes done on the defensive end A little eight nothing run here for the Wolfpack and Breed has led that He has six points Good defense Ditter going strong had it knocked away Williams fighting for that possession arrow will take it the other way Itll be NC State ball cheering applause Just the defense fighting here You know Virginia is so good at getting offensive rebounds but your best player diving on the floor trying to get a 5050 ball Thats how you set the tone for how your team needs to play defensively Williams in for Copeland So much of how you can tell who best players are on the court OB starts with their body language being down in the stance looking hungry singing engaged It feels like were watching a different Darien Williams in the second half Breed rejected by Grunlow averages about three a game 36 blocks on the season and the freshman from Germany one of the top shot blockers in the country Got multiple sevenfooters back there to protect that front line Just love the way he goes up strictly vertical to block that shot Its seven block shots against NC Central Inbounded and a foul Thats going to go against Allen Hall of Virginia on the inbounds play 4228 Thatll be number two on the graduate out of Utah You know OB when you watch NC State play you talk about epitomizing the name Whoop There shouldnt be one game where the opponent doesnt leave the floor with scratch marks all over their arms With a three Well the Wolfpack clawing their way back into this thing cheering Tester Ritter on the baseline drive What a tough shot up and in by Malik Thomas Tremendous control of the body there He is 13 Good pass Nifty dish ono with the rejection and a whistle cheering That felt like that was a little bit of a late call NC State 83 at the line cheering and NC State with a basketball as well McNeel with another one coming cheering applause 1641 to go So a tremendous second half start here for NC State applause and cheering as they pull within 4433 Theyre going to continue to shoot And theres ODM just losing his mind As you said a very late call Lubeno had Ono had the block It looked clean from my angle of attack Late whistle Ryan ODM goes absolutely ballistic to try to get his team engaged here And you know thats what coaches fight for when youre on the road Every call matters It goes up Theres the block And thats when the call was made afterwards You know tough position on the road Yeah Ben Allen Luben And they pour him on at the line The technical and then the foul cheering So NC State opening up the second half 154 over Virginia and within 10 cheering applause Theyve been down 22 in this game applause cheering Thomas looking to answer Balls not moving side to side now as much cheering Der on the back down Spins and hits I felt like an ad one That is a big boy move That is a pro move He has not had a big day yet He has six points Came in averaging 17 up high Heres Copeland Now Darien Williams handing off for Breed Mallerie just absolutely got blasted from a screen and so not really calling the screen out Thats an offensive foul on Ben Allen Luben just tucked that shoulder and commits the personal his second K that Friday night So good luck with the You thought the broadcast was Vital and Charles Barkley It was hard Okay thanks for the heads laughter up Yeah well get a chance to see Andy Enfield and SMU and their pair of elite guards against who I consider right now Cameron Boozer Its the national player of the year with the way hes been able to play Just one of the best bigs we have in the game of college basketball Leading the country in scoring at almost 24 a game Think about that 24 points a game Leads the country in scoring Wow All straight on Got an excellent look with a shot clock winding down applause NC State with big Mo on their side right now And heres Williams There you go Welcome down Working on Hall Copeland in and outs on the endo with the rebound The sevenfooter Thomas finding his way inside but left it short Well defended applause 4635 Virginia Guadir Copeland Couple of fakes there Got it free The jumper swished in from the corner Its Paul cheering McNeel whos had a 47point game this season He has 11 today cheering And the Wolf Pack right back in it with both feet cheering Paul with the penetration scoops it up and it rolls in UVA able to score but UVA playing the same style of basketball that NC State is playing Not the same style we saw in the first half where that ball was whipping around side to side multiple passers The ball is sticking to players hands offensively and theyre becoming an ISO team Aeno getting up a clean block that time Controversial foul a couple of minutes ago Ben Allen Luben will commit the foul his third 10point game NC State just playing inside out basketball Copeland with a series of head fakes McNeel with his hands ready What an elite shooter talked about a game earlier this season 47 points Now look I was a baller Dave Ive never had a game over 40 47 points is a lot of points 11 music made threes in that A guy who just found his rhythm An elite shooter The only guy that stayed from last years team on this years teams roster 11 threes school record tied the ACC record Valerie nice pass on the baseline Tillis will finish it Devin Tillis a 67 grad out of LA with five points And Virginia built up that big lead with excellent ball movement Committing the foul 1327 to go Adaptability and your ability to do that in a quick manner will determine your success in altitude Oakland with another one coming This is extreme of course This is 12 new players and we mentioned four or five of them international players coming to Virginia So Ryan ODM a total rebuild and a complete rebuilding style yet theyre ranked 21st in the country So you want to talk about the brilliancancy of Ryan ODM as a head coach to get the players to play for something bigger than themselves He is one of the elite coaches not just in the ACC but in the country at BCU the last couple of years before hes still coming home for him in Virginia where his dad was an assistant under Terry Holland so he grew up on that campus a lot of dribbling Obie cheering shot clock to nine Lewis back in the game with the three fouls off the fake hits the deck hell draw the foul He is so patient offensively Shot clock dwindling down at 5 seconds or less and just gets breed in the air with a head fake and absorbs the contact Gets to the free throw line Veteran move Sundays ESPN 2 mens college basketball games We start in the American music two lane and Florida Atlantic at one and two of the best in the Missouri Valley Conference at 5 Eastern Bradley against Murray State So Tester Ritter at the line He has two years of college eligibility remaining As we mentioned hes turning 23 this month after playing professionally in Spains Liga ACB League And a midfire on that one Got it back and laid it in Those possessions just hurt you Doing a great job of getting that tip Nobody boxing the Ritter out Just follows the free throw and gets an easy put back So the Cavaliers back up by 13 A lot of contact but he knocks it down Breed a determined move underneath cheering Has eight points Second half hes been huge cheering cheering Mallerie gives up the dribble Heres Tillis with a shot clock to four as he got the shot up and in Now that possession felt more like Tony Bennett style Yeah And just a guy thats played a lot of basketball 24 years old made the NIT final when you see Irvine last season getting that shot clock inside five like that Heres Ael around and out with a onehander So Virginia trying to shift this momentum Heres Mallerie up top trying to use a screen Lewis looking to get back in the offensive flow Dunks it down The kick out The long one is good by Tillis cheering So Virginia took a shot to the chin and now making their own comeback Look at the 42 The Ritter just on the perimeter fighting over the top of screens at 69 Reed good swing here Great ball movement by NC State Just couldnt connect able with the miss and Virginia on the attack again Lewis stuck in his shoulder lost the ball and now the foul Johan Griml will pick up his third with 1052 to go for UVA Only two thus far in the last 10 minutes of the game The ball is definitely sticking to their players hands more but theyre finding a way even with the slow down offense to still score and attack Senior from Potter Springs Georgia Breed at the line and he is their best foul shooter percentagewise at 88 Theres a big reason they did pulled within eight He has nine points so far So State not having Trey Hollowman out with that ankle injury not able to come back and play in this game Thats a guy that accounted for 12 points a game on 50 plus percent shooting from the threepoint line and the field was a key guy for Tom Isizel for three years at Michigan State Toms got another terrific team Up top heres Thomas Shot clock to eight cheering Lewis again Shot clock at four Now Virginias got to hustle all way downtown off the back of the iron He follows the miss and he took a hit right across the forehead by Copelan Well Abel contested the shot but he contested the shot to start to leak out instead of securing the defensive music rebound And we talked about how UVA is so good at crashing the offensive glass You know a lot of those times those rebounds come inside the paint but also they come with long rebounds off threepoint shots and guards music having the ability to chase them down Hall just beat him to a 5050 ball Seeing a smile there from Ryan ODM About 8 minutes ago he wasnt smiling He was not a happy man at all Out of body experience Yes And some of the stuff that left his mouth I think probably led to that technical more than anything All with the fake Shot clock again a factor here for Virginia Theyre going to have to heave one up here deep from the corner WELL SHORT DITTER BEAT THEM TO THE BASKETBALL and laid it in well shy of the rim but he makes the catch and lays it in He has 11 So back up to 16 under 10 minutes to play Once again from the corner Breed Not this time Sier back up No And Lewis who was the star of the first half with 20 points gives it up to Don Hall to run the point They lost him in the third overtime the other day Swished in by Derritter from threepoint land 14 for him Hes been a much bigger presence in the second half Yeah Now youre seeing the full offensive repertoire by Tess Ritter He can play inside out has great passing ability and I will tell you this defensively he is extremely disciplined and assertive Lewis got it Another triple and another timeout for the Look I I know the game against Virginia Tech went to triple overtime and shout out to Virginia Tech and Abdulas you know is a very special player Neil reminds me very much of the college basketball version of Luca Donic with the way he plays a star player But UVA stayed in that game all the way through They fought their way back This team is the real deal They have a chance to contend for an ACC title And they lost that game in triple overtime in Blackburg So to come back with this kind of performance today for coach ODM Very impressive Not done yet with about 8 minutes to go Williams now with seven points in another quiet game for him Ditter has 12 points to lead the way in the second half for Virginia Bank shot wont drop here for Thomas One and done for the Cavaliers there Williams with a midrange and Tillis with the rebound They just cant seem to find his rhythm offensively Just really struggling on that side of the ball Valerie tied up in a foul against NC State Less than eight minutes to go have the footwork to get over the top of screens and has great lateral quickness and thats what Ditter brings to the table The night hes a pro 40 from threepoint land at 69 As mentioned hes going to be 23 years old this month It felt like the Knight didnt really get any type of retort from you Did it make you feel any way No I I liked how you you weaved your way in there Youve been working on several different languages today Yes cuz Im willing to go back to the lab and continue to do the work Youre well youre you know youre a dookie Yeah Dona Is this the way its going to go all season Pretty much This is it Okay I mean weve only been working together since 2009 Thats right You would think you would know the scatter report by now would you I really ought to I should have done my own homework Long one coming and swished in right on the money by Chance Mallerie 41 out there I really like this Virginia team Even a guy like Chance Mallerie 15th in the nation and steel rate a guy at 510 rebounds the ball exceptionally well This team has a great security of who they are McNeel launches and the rebound tipped right to the big man 7147 and Virginia with a lot of good role guys and they really do stick to their roles and a guy like that cheering Don Hall on the money absolute clinic Played three years at BYU 163 run now for Virginia Well on their way to putting this thing on ice Banked in by Copelan NC States typically really good at gobbling up the paint and getting a ton of points in the paint but not today with the backbone defense of Aninso and also Green Low and Ta Ritter that have been met with physicality every possession A lot of their shots have been contested Now hes slapped away by Copeland and Virginia will keep it music and all three of those guys coming back on Sam Lewis along with Derritter and Grunlow music and theyre headed for the exits here in Raleigh They have seen enough with under 6 minutes to go Look Im Im a believer in Will music Wade It whenever you spend time with them you know getting your team to compete each and every night is difficult in todays age And once again Im not making any excuses Neither is Will Wade Hes not an excuse type of coach But theyre going to have to have some real soulsearching here at NC State because when youre met towards the upper echelon of the ACC each and every night there are battles in this league not just the Dukes the Louisvilles the North Carolina the UVAs but even when you get to the Virginia Techs the Wake Forest I mean each night you got to bring the best of yourself to compete to finish in the upper echelon which is what he expects of this team with the talent that they have You saw in the corner of that shot Darren Williams the star out of the portal now on the bench with about six minutes to go Copeland at the line And thats a difficulty that comes along with being a pro in college You know when youre a guy that is the guy everybody in the world knows that you were paid to be the guy and thats fine You deserve that Uh this is a world of capitalism but what comes along with that is a lot of critique and a lot of judgment and criticism and you have to be able to wear that and own it Boy Ditter again beating everybody but slapped away from him on the run out Reed and its going to go the other way He just lost it So its Virginia basketball leading by 24 This is Derritter on the other end as Copeland knocked it away Great hands by Copeland Leads this team in steals per game The Ritter had that look in his eye like he was going to bang that one huh Did Ive seen that look in your eyes multiple times OB Today Yes laughter Outside heres Lewis whos had a great day but in and out and Hall beat everyone to the basketball So youre just seeing the effort all day from Virginia Well typically you want your guards to get back for transition defense Not UVA Their guards crash their offensive glass McNeel with the rejection So Virginia well on their way to their 12th win of the year Copeland reigns a triple 15 for Cadier Copeland Hes had a nice day Senior from Philly But they needed two or three more of him today Yeah Give me your top three teams in the ACC Ill tell you we just saw North Carolina the other night and saw Caleb Wilson I dont know if theres a better player in the league Traveling violation here Youre going to get a lot of arguments about that but the night he had against Florida State well see if he continues to play at that level But first of all hes a great kid Hes a spectacular player He might be music my favorite right now to be the player of the year in the league Well see Yeah you think about that That is a traditional North Carolina front line now that they did not have last year They were smaller last year played a lot more on the perimeter but Henry Bessar another guy that can stretch the floor play inside out Caleb Wilson and them getting Seth Trimble back I think its a really hit huge pickup defensively with the way he plays and the way he attacks the rim Youre so right He can help him offensively a great deal but its the defense They talk about the toughness and the grit Then Alan Luben continues to work formerly of North Carolina Give him seven I think Louisville is in that top tier even though they suffered a tough defeat the other day on the road on their Cal trip to Stanford Kell Brown Jr hasnt been able to play the last four games I think Clemsons in the upper echelon Duke is in the upon UVA is there as well But youre saying top three Duke North Carolina have in the game of college basketball Look at those numbers 21 points 106 rebounds seven double doubles already And to think about that front court last year was JT Thompson JT Topic and Darien Williams together Whistle and a foul at 316 on the clock here and Virginia very comfortably ahead It did get a little bit tense for a couple of moments when a 22point lead was sawed down to eight points NC State got to it in 4638 And this building was alive but then Virginia kind of woke back up again McNeel at the line 83 You know over the last couple of days therell be there have been a lot of viral clips of John Caliperry speaking about the frustrations of the overall system and the way that it is structured currently And I agree with him on a lot of points You know I I really do This whole concept of players being at four different schools in four years doesnt really teach any accountability or learning how to fight through adversity And Im all for players being paid as much money as possible I do think we need regulations on that and better structure around that with player contracts and year service But you should get one time to transfer And if you transfer after that you have to sit out a year There has to be some types of repercussions in order to figure it out And just saying you can go anywhere wherever you want anytime You cant really coach young players as much anymore Going to be a turnover here for Virginia Totally agree with that and with coach Cal on so much of that Its just so weird to be breaking down rosters and youre like Oh wait a minute I saw this kid a year ago at this school and then two years ago at this school and as you say three or four different schools Its just bizarre And Im all about capitalism I want players to get paid Um but also there is a ton of credibility and also confidence I have with being known as a Duke guy with the Duke alumni with the way that helps me in society And a lot of guys when you graduate or when you go to a school for a period of time you get so much more than just the on the court experience You get the community experience and its something that were losing in the game of college basketball Yeah a lot of these players I mean theyre not invested for five minutes in their community or in the school I get it Make some money if you can but there have to be more restrictions on that Swished in by Mallalerie as hell drop in two Virginia continues to add on Theyve had such a find They average 87 points per game So again if youre seeing the Cavaliers for the first time this year its not the Virginia team youre used to watching They flat get after it offensively By the way theyre number four in the country in block shots So they play defense too And theyve done it today Think about this This team is up 19 points Everybody is still down in the stance defensively Everybody is communicating Theyre playing as if theyre down 19 And that speaks about the consistency and the methodology of the head coach Ryan Odum and what he expects from them daytoday with their behavioral patterns And these are elite behavioral patterns Well its going to be a very challenging month Theyve acquitted themselves beautifully today Theyll also travel to top 25 Louisville and host North Carolina here in the month of January So big tests to come in the ACC They pass this one with flying colors on the road today And that is after losing in triple overtime earlier this week A onehander by Breed Good Think about UVA Got Cal and Stanford at home Then they go on the road at Louisville cheering It will be an incredible game to watch Minute 18 to go The coach looks really young Its skin looks vibrant Yeah Well hes got that Tony Bennett skin Yeah definitely does Hes got that mean Well break that down for me Im not going to do that Like a George Clooney type of skin What I always refer to Tony as the George Clooney of college basketball He certainly was that And I think Ryan ODM is stepping into those shoes I love the pocket square too too Yeah And most guys when they have gray hair they look stressed but not so much with coach OD Isnt that something Yeah Looks rejuvenated Like he used oils and berries in his hair Its like well you took me down this path though dude Kind of did And I regret it very very deeply Virginia with the inbound Its been a big day for the Cavaliers Got out to a hot start Really never stopped and Hall will run a little bit of clock here for the Cavs This is a terrific win for them as the number 21 team in the country Itll be their first victory in the ACC They will improve to one and one in the conference A lot of times when you suffer a three overtime defeat on your first row game of backtoback road games its easy to come into the next contest on the early game and have a lot of excuses at an 1100 am game But UVA right from the beginning play with a sense of urgency They found their rhythm and defensively theres still room for improvement especially on the ball defensively and defensive rebounds but they came out here with a spectacular performance today NC State rang in the new year with a 70 to 57 victory over Wake Forest But they came home and they slipped and fell today Virginia with four players in double figures Lewis with 23 Da 14 Thomas 13 Tillis with 10 So they really spread it around You were lauding their passing game and just how effective that was how they share the sugar so well Well even though Ta Ritter had a hard game you just saw how elite he is A relentless pursuit of the basketball He stays engaged in each and every play Defensively hes active He is the bonafide leader of the Cavaliers Thats a sweet win for Ryan ODM as well really coming home to Virginia where his dad was a coach for a long time and he picks up a win for the Cavaliers as the head coach
