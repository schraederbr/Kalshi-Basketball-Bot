well mints and Edwards uh gentlemen since Jesse Edwards have been pretty consistent but that youve even seen the losses they dont get Jesse Edwards the ball enough or he doesnt demand enough but Joe Girard finding him some clean clean looks people are gonna get up at his chest they have to find a way to get him open your officials tonight Lee Cassell Tim clockerty and Isaac Barnett Syracuse and their home whites and its the roadblocks for Oakland and Judah Mintz controls the opening tip gives it up to jg3 number 11 in white your Syracuse starters its a little bit of a younger team and its one of the youngest teams that Jim boeheims had in quite a while led by The Freshman mints well Oaklands going to come out in their zone defense theyre going to stay with it pretty much all night long and Syracuse going to do that go inside as expected inside to Jesse Edwards and he has his first two of the game Syracuse doesnt shoot the ball that well from the threepoint line so theyre gonna have to establish the paint first against this Zone speaking of zones we see a traditional 23 from Jimmy its only right that the two longest tenured coaches at their school are mimicking each other as Oakland zone is a little bit of a 113 kind of a amoeba set Syracuse of course and the extended tooth race heres one of the best allaround Players Number Four Trey Townsend it goes out of bounds itll stay Oakland basketball as we mentioned Syracuse coming off a win at Notre Dame 6261 that snaps a threegame losing streak and unfortunately its been more losing than winning for great campy and the Oakland Golden Grizzlies Losers of five straight and six of their last seven off to a two and eight start this year one of the weaknesses Oakland is they do not rebound the ball well not minus nine on the season theyve got to try to find some way to get some Second Chance opportunities Chris Bell just short and its rebounded by Keaton hervey who had himself a doubledouble their last game against Purdue Fort Wayne rocket walks the transfer from Michigan State and Mississippi State and this is his first shot Watts has really struggled this season to get comfortable in his role with Oakland foreign but only four for his last 23 from three that one goes around and out itll stay Syracuse basketball a nice job by Judah Mintz just running the point against his Zone splitting the scene drawing that second Defender kicking it out for the open shot by Bell 14 and white gives it up to Gerard one thing they want Joe Gerard to do more is play off of two feet and he did it there got his first bucket excellent ball control excellent organization against his own Syracuse very patient early is hard making his 100th consecutive start for the Syracuse Orange good job down on the Baseline Oakland went right into the post from the top and Benny Williams came over from the backside forward position and did a good job of closing out building a wall this player on the floor Jalen Moore number I think Grizzlies team was second in the nation and assists a year ago two years ago he led the nation in assists but hes playing on a bad ankle playing on a bad ankle they Brett cant be told theyre going to shut him down actually for two weeks after this game tonight hes got his first time there inside to trade Towson to get the scoring started for Oakland thats one thing Syracuse must do is they have to control more from the outside if he strikes dribble penetrating into the gaps youll see him he can do that hell find the open man and theres a turnover Force the steal by Watts and the twohand Slam by Keaton hervey and weve got a tie Ball Game Chris Bells probably going to come out of the game he just let her be just take the ball right out of his mitts hes got to be a lot tougher so what is the difference between a 23 similar to what Syracuse plays and this amoeba type Zone that youre talking about it will extend out itll match up more with Shooters on the perimeter but once the ball starts going down to the wing in the Baseline it really morphs into a 23 but they start out into a 113 shot clock is still running as is the game clock the ball went out of bounds a couple of seconds ago so play stops as they reset the shot clock and the game clock and number five in white another freshman for Coach Bay High checks in Justin Taylor freshman out of Charlottesville Virginia spent a year at IMG before heading up to Central New York Justin Taylor has played well as of late and Jim bam is starting to use him more both in the backside forward which hell play now and also hell slide him up to the guard spot on special situations when he needs a bigger Defender at the top of the zone well we talked about these two head coaches who have as much tenure as any head coach at their current School in all of college basketball Greg campy is second and will remain second because Jim boeheims number one 47 years but coach Camp hes been with this Oakland program for 39 years now well a real coaches coach always enjoyed talking to Greg campy about basketball and the state of the game and life hell talk hell talk anything golf hes a lifer and uh very very well respected all around the country and despite the two eight starts him he gets you know we are a onebid lead we have to win our conference games and play our best in the conference tournament and he still thinks this team has a chance once they get hole and they get more right and bring lantman back whos not playing tonight hes a very good player I think they will be a contender in their conference theres a pocket three by Justin Taylor and thats a good side for the Syracuse offense that struggles to score the basketball wow good job by Taylor because he was ready to shoot he had his feet set the delivery was right into the pocket and perfect for him Taylor had that Breakout game against Bryant 25 points for the Freshman but theres a jump shot by Trey Townsend and hell have a chance at a threepoint play Barbers this was a little bit late on the closeout must have got him right on the elbow see early Oaklands trying to attack the zone two different ways with more Drupal pending into the gaps on ball reversal and also the flash to the foul the chance to cap off that threepoint play only 61 percent from the freethrow line this season and theres another twohand slam Jesse Edwards has two buckets both from close range a good ball movement very good spacing and nice high low from Williams to Edwards Jesse Edwards in some rarefied air right now averaging 12 points and 14 rebounds on the season theres a layin underneath by Trey Townsend and he has an early six well theyre going into the high posts and then theyre diving from the low box and when that ball goes into the high post the five Nicks has to step up that means the forwards have to drop and cover the paint true on his first shot of the game Music so well talk about both offenses struggling and of course at the upcoming tip both offenses seem to be doing quite all right well what cant be said told us today Rich he said you have not shot the ball well but I think were going to at some point hes confident in his team as an offensive team but the problem has been on the glass and that you see the size of Edwards really giving them difficulty in the past too easy for 14 in white averaging close to 15 points a game and 12 rebounds one of just four players in division one who have those kind of numbers coming into tonight just a little loose with the ball trying to pitch it up to go out get out and transition and Oaklands coming here pretty feisty tonight Gerard G3 too strong and Benny Williams looking for the rebound it goes out of bounds and we have our first stoppage of play Jim Boeheim at Greg camping talk about staying power at your job job security abounds in this one tonight well tell you more when we come back turning them from D2 to D1 and both have had tremendous success at their programs and Greg was a trendsetter believe it or not he was wearing the allblack Zippys warmup look before anybody else even before Bob Hawkins Bob hug is wearing suits and Greg canffy was wearing that black outfit over there the old Jerry Glanville I dont think anybody would ever accuse Greg Cathy of being a fashion player thank you weve got an offensive foul called on Oakland itll be Syracuse fall with that threepoint lead Jim turning 78 years young just a couple of weeks ago got his 1 000th win for the second time against Northeastern and you talk about someone who bleeds orange he was the eighth head coach named to Syracuse Universitys basketball program and 47 years later there has not been a night oh okay I called for an offensive foul in that last visit what theyre trying to do theyre trying to run an exact set theyre trying to screen the back of the zone to get an inside look in and out for Benny Williams chance to tie with a triple for Oakland in the early going and they go to the nail and inside out thats how you coach it against the zone and Chris Conway just checking into the game his first shot is good well you can see how well coached Oakland is and obviously the record is what it is because they have some other deficiencies but they can really move the ball theyre they have a good scheme theyre moving it quickly its not sticky and theyre trying to go right into the foul line and then go inside yeah when healthy and at full strength Greg Camp he wants to run you out of the gym thats always been his style really good fast athletes and shes doing a great job of moving the ball tonight open look knocked down and Oakland has the lead thats rocket Watson with his first bucket of the night well when the ball moves faster than the Zone thats what youre going to get youre going to get some open looks and then you just have to knock him down right now Syracuse has got their hands down at times allowing Oakland good passing Lanes on the perimeter judamin slept alone heres Jalen Moore 34 in Black he can be a blur when hes at first strength Watts tries it again not this time in the rebound by Taylor on the weak side thats why Taylor is in there for Bell because Bell does not rebound and Justin Taylor will put his face in the mix Gerard smooth stroke from jg3 his first triple of the night gives him five so just do a good job on the offensive and themselves not settling against this Zone good job sharing moving the ball side to side they just got to make sure they still keep looking inside the Edwards they go inside to Townsend on this end and Trey Townsend is having a field day double digits already for number four in Black its been a curious season so far for Joe Gerard the third first four games pretty good but ever since then hes really struggled despite a good game against Notre Dame theres Jesse Edwards uncontested well thats there all night long theyre going to just make sure they dont get go away from that and start settling for threes and then down on this end Oaklands doing a good job they got five out theyre cutting theyre always moving the ball well theyre cutting into Open Spaces against the zone once again Trey Townsend hes got a game high 12 Syracuse has the ball down one coming up on 11 minutes to go short jump shot due to Mintz good job by mints Now Syracuse in this possession theyve got to match up a little better in the back too hes getting way too open down on that Baseline and no ones no ones putting a body on him the backside of Syracuse is defense back right now are not matched up properly Trey Townsend had 14 points in his last game against Purdue Fort Wayne took him 42 minutes to get that hes got 14 tonight already Watts short on the three by one both teams starting out fairly hot on offense and that continues for the orange with a jump shot from Penny Williams whos in the scoring count if anyway hes doing a nice job presenting himself hes flashing from the weak side right into that foul line area and Oaklands giving him that easy look in the middle already five orange have scored theyre up one 2221 halfway through this first half Trey Townsend why not but too strong on that elbow jump shot better contest that time by Syracuse not allowing Townsend that open look at the fouling and slept wide open from three around and out Syracuse two for five from the aviarc so far thats the one part of minss game thats lacking right now but you see his forms pretty good where once he starts getting in the gym more with Jerry McNamara and Adrian Audrey and Alan Griffin and Company he will become a good solid threepoint shooter yeah hes only two for 15 on the season Watts that shot was bothered by Edwards Williams for three Music Jalen Moore senior out of Cloverdale Indiana directing traffic six on the shot clock heres more pervys going to have to hoist it and its way off the mark good defensive stand by the orange very good you know what they did in that possession which is they did not allow dribble or passing penetration pullup jump shot from Joe Gerard another positive sign Gerard has seven Edwards has eight and Syracuse is up three with 829 number 21 over Oakland 8 29 to go and as you probably know if youve watched ESPN over the course of the last week it is V week and we are raising awareness for cancer research and someone who knows a little bit about that and how valuable it is is Joe Gerard III the starting guard for the Syracuse Orange his grandfather Joseph Gerard senior passed away from cancer when Joe was a freshman in high school at Glens Falls and he said to this day he still thinks of his grandfather called him poppy still thinks a poppy every time he takes the court he said he was his hero and he was as tough as anyone he knows he battled cancer for five years before losing that battle you know theres not so many stories and I certainly Joe Gerards a great young guy who thinks of his family and of course but how about what ESPN has done with the V foundation and just year after year after year and stick by towel and his Gala and tonight the great night at the Garden with the doubleheader well it is vweek at ESPN with the V Foundation to highlight the urgent need for cancer research this is gamechanging research that helps save lives you can join the fight against cancer by visiting feedorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research coming up on 30 years since Jim Valvano made that speech came back in the lineup theyve moved Justin Taylor up to the top of the Zone Syracuse is really long right now and this time Oakland did not get out on Bell thats what he does best step and shoot from the three and Sharon is caring how about the orange offense eight assists on 12made field goals football very well against this Zone in the zone but now though is not extending now leaving some guys open Bell was wide open again on that possession inside Townsend thought better of it with Edwards looming 10 to shoot Jaylen Moore couldnt thread the needle on that one to Townsend come the orange looking to build on a sixpoint advantage and they cant do it there Townsend sure and Taylor comes away with it for Syracuse when youre playing such so many young players thats like Syracuse thank you is and has all season long it takes time not only to build chemistry on offense but the zone as well you have to understand how to play with each other left hand layup attempt and thats going to be a foul sending Jalen Moore to the freethrow line when we come back a sixpoint lead matches the largest of the night for Syracuse 2721 over Oakland were back right now Im on the campus of Syracuse University we have a full day of basketball Saturday that starts at one Eastern but were featuring this game at 5 30 Kyle filipowski and the number 15 Duke Blue Devils hosting the University of Maryland Eastern Shore at Cameron Indoor right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app and of course as part of the week the Jimmy V classic going on at Madison Square Garden as we speak right now up in New York City and Dukes taking on Iowa later tonight Duke in Iowa either Duke is uh shown some really good progress this year I think thats the best way to put it with their young basketball team and the new coach John Shire theyre going to be there all season long its just too much talent Virginia clearly as a elite team in this conference the conference a little more though its hard to tell whos for real and who isnt aint Miami is another team thats going to be there all season long and then a lot of teams could be good he and hervey and easy two after playing up the line on defense thats just loose passing with Tabasco thats just Music major size in this match with John Bull and Jacques in the game and he started by a seldom you sophomore Brody Parker number 14 in Black Scramble for the loose ball and theres a jump ball itll be Oakland basketball Jesse Edwards half caught the ball then tried to put it on the floor and the problem with that is that Oakland when he catches it down to that little box area if he doesnt have good position where he can just drop step and score theyre going to send the guard down and double him every time I saw Brody Parker going to the bench good effort for him a couple of minutes to give some of the regulars a blow four Dudes for Oakland played over 40 minutes in their overtime loss this past weekend at Purdue Fort Wayne thank you this is a team that is as Fleet afoot as anybody but if youre locking that many minutes youre going to start slowing down a little bit well especially without Lantern out of the court and then more playing a little banged up although he looks pretty good tonight more Jalen Moore who you just mentioned only has one point he went one for two from the freethrow line but his deal is getting others involved he already has seven assists tonight something to keep an eye on weve done an excellent job running a team against the zone and playing with he plays with his head up and no wasted motion the ball never sticks with him he finds the open man in the gaps they go inside to bowl big to Big passing Jesse Edwards in double digits with 10 John boyega is an excellent passive purpose and he really has a good feel for the game and were a little too strong on that however you protect oh Chris Bell posterizes will Shepherd and well have a threepoint play attempt well Chris Bell has been a little bit of a Jim behinds not wanted the house uh because of his lack of rebounding but this shows you what a physical specimen is but Jim will show them that tomorrow and said wait a minute if you can do this you can get three or four rebounds so I know thats been a point of contention in the Syracuse team that the lack of rebounding from the forward spot first free throw of the Season just now from Chris Bell doesnt do a lot of his work on the interior thats the threepoint line but hes learning Townsend its had a great first half so far off the mark on that one leagues all scores with 14 but its a seven point Syracuse lead their largest of the night jg3 off the mark on that too heres a fresh 20 for Syracuse and Bell threw it away and its saved by Oakland its going strong to the cup he gets fouled and well go to the line Jesse Edwards tried to keep this play alive and then the loose ball thats allowing Oakland just to get out and thats when theyre really really good foreign but I dont see this too often with 419 in the first half all four other Golden Grizzlies are back on defense already with rocket Watts shooting free throws well with Edwards and a jockey on the inside the ball would have to come out pretty funny for any of Oaklands forwards to get a rebound on the inside Conways in now and lets send a group of bigs at Edwards should they have some playing with Josh for a long period of time against Notre Dame and Edwards together but theyve played pretty well together they dont get any chose Ray a jock as we said before good understanding of the high Logan theres a three on three matchup due to Mintz rocket Watts now a mismatch with Watts guarding Edwards and committing the foul well Greg Camp he didnt like that call but theres no reason for Rocket watts to be out there bumping Jesse Edwards 35 feet in the basket just get set in your Zone theres Miss Bell thought about the three takes it and doesnt hit thank you he came into Syracuse he was bold and said I want to set the alltime threepoint shooting record at Syracuse his coach Jerry McNamara might have something to say about that oh Watts takes it strong and were going the other way thats an offensive foul on Rocket Watts his second of the game with Syracuse up seven Chris Bell made a couple shots on the perimeter but he elevated on this one over the top because Im not sure anybody in the program knew what they had except the promising young big man from the Amsterdam and turned himself into a good solid player sophomore junior year and had the injury a year ago really hurt Syracuse down the stretch and now he has turned himself into an elite big man he is one of the best twoway players in the country meaning you can score and he can get up on the glass and he is becoming a force and you can see his confidence growing and growing even during this season hes demanding the ball out there on the court tonight and he never comes out of the game and as a former coach Tim you look at his progression from freshman year on and its a fairly typical progression that you would want from the big man sometimes the biggest jump comes between freshman and sophomore year his came from sophomore year to last year its funny you never know with big man rich and our good friend Mick Cronin the coach at UCLA he likes to say big men are like a baseball hitter you want to get one one for three you know theyre not youre not going to hit on all of them because you never know because usually theyre underdeveloped when they get there but Edwards has really improved this game from top to bottom since he showed up on this campus speaking about him it was bottoms for Joe Gerard the third his second triple of the night hes in double digits with 10 so 10 for Joe Gerard 10 for Jesse Edwards and a 10 point Syracuse wow theyre getting it because theyre sharing the basketball and they have really good spacing against this Zone oh side Trey Townsend has been neutralized to some extent anything different youre seeing from the Syracuse defense well theyre matching up with him better at times this tonight when when Towson has been free its because the Syracuse forwards are kind of guarding air in the back instead of matching up body to body stolen away look out Love play for Judah Mintz a little bit too high for his outstretched arm and it goes out about thats a bad decision by George Gerard I mean Mintz was not hoping in any sense stretch of the imagination at all and you do that that place for the summer not a real game nevertheless 11 assists on 15 made field goals for a Syracuse team shooting 52 percent so far tonight thats a cure for what Elsia if youre Jim Beijing oh theyre getting good shots theyre getting good clean open looks theyre being patient were sharing the ball theyve got good spacing now approaching four minutes since Greg campeys clock has scored their last bucket for time for the Golden Grizzlies another E for jg3 Applause well I guess that makes up for the bad pass on the previous possession but they are very comfortable against this Zone theyre coming down and you know they practice against this Zone every day so you can see how comfortable they are with their offense I was a block by Justin Taylor from a team thats first in the ACC and blocks per game Edwards finishes the thing about Jesse Edwards and the note is hes improved confidence as an offensive players that he keeps the ball up high above his shoulders so the little guys cant even get near him and he just has a nice soft touch with great footwork for the third straight possession good hands by The Juice Defense Applause that one off the mark and John bolajaki gets his first bucket now you can see where Oaklands weakness is its front and center minus nine per game on the Glass Syracuse really dominating with their length and aggression on the backboards a 140 Syracuse run has them up 4124 under a minute to go Parker Way Off the Mark and Syracuse looks to add to the lead Music Gerard the fade away hes got it all working tonight 15 a game high for Joe Gerard III well that shows you a lot about a player Rich when you have a game like he had scoreless on the road against Illinois and we just couldnt find anything to go down and then you have a game right out of the gate right three days later against Notre Dame like that just shows you that he has a lot of confidence in himself as a player he had 20 points in that game against Notre Dame but still hasnt found the stroke from threepoint Ranch in his last four games he was three for 23 coming into tonight he said three triples already this evening well its an adjustment for him as well this year I mean he doesnt have buddy bayheim next to him he doesnt have Cole swider out there on the corridor Jimmy behind guys that the other the other team had to pay attention to out on the out on the threepoint line now everybodys focus is on Joe Girard so hes going to find where he can get his shots and they have to help him get some open looks as well five on the shot clock eight to go in the half Jalen Moore Way Off the Mark last shot time for Judah Mintz driving in and the bucket will count that puts the exclamation point on a stellar first half offensively for the Syracuse Orange this does not look like a freshman this is a polished bedroom not just taking his time at his head up didnt rush the situation knew the clock body control and completing it at the rift were at the half here at Syracuse now we sent things to the studio Kelsey Dallas and boom and he was three of six from Beyond The Ark an area where he struggled the last half right and everyones going to look at the offense but I thought their Zone was very good as well or they got back they set their Zone they were long they were moving on the pass not on the catch and when the ball did go down to the Baseline they tightened up with their length with the forwards Syracuse in their home whites will start the opening possession of the second half up by 21 courtesy of an 180 run to end the first half starting five as the start of the game with Judah Mintz handling the Rock and at the line shooting two for the first time tonight its a highly decorated recruit coming to Syracuse via Maryland went to Oak Hill if that sounds familiar we all remember that Carmelo Anthony followed a similar path well think about Judah mints and weve seen it today because its continued tonight but I really wasnt impressed with him in the Notre Dame game down the stretch with his decision making and at times thats what freshmen struggle with especially when youre a point guard youre starting at a high level you know when to go when to slow because thats all he did in high school you just went he blew by people but his decision making is really improved Shepard was double teamed and gave it up to Townsend and then Townsend will have an and one opportunity well the ball comes down to the short Baseline when that happens in the zone the centers got to come over first of all theyve got to present a better trap down there if theyre going to trap they might as well trap hard so you cant have any Vision out of that trap and what happens then is then the backside forwards got to come over and cover the middle and thats what Chris Bell did not do so Townsend pays off the threepoint play he has 17 already to lead all scorers averaging 16 a game coming in is Williams from the elbow looking for Edwards couldnt get it 10 on the shot clock for Syracuse not ball deflected Williams gets fouled on the floor that possession opens looked like they were playing kind of a gimmicky type defense rocket Watts on Justin Taylor its kind of a 13 and a chaser now theyre in straight man to man Edwards slip is on the way to the basket working on Shepard and another fouls call this time on will Shepherd Shepherds second foul as red Camp hes telling Shepard he dont need to play Jesse Edwards that tight 15 feet from the basket they leave him alone that time and he knocks it down so thats the problem though when you tell clay or something you dont have to play him as tight but then you still have to contest shots because Edwards can make that with a baseline shot Jesse Edwards with 14 hes got a careerhigh 22 his last time out against the Fighting Irish Oakland desperately needing to get some points and get them quickly but theyre one for 13 from threepoint range tonight heres Mintz in transition well we saw at the end of the half just taking his time with his head up tremendous body control at The Rim specs from Bob oh my God end to end for Jesse Edwards I know Oaklands 28 but you can build a lot with your young basketball team and you go on the road and get a key win like they did on Saturday against Notre Dame and then just build on him thats what Syracuse is doing tonight and a timeout is called on the floor well Tim weve seen a couple of highlight dunks courtesy of the Syracuse Orange already its been a complete effort it started with their defense good ball movement in the half court but the big fella Edwards resisting at the rim and then having a little fun on a Tuesday night at the dump Memphis of Syracuse University where the home standing orange have a 5329 lead over the Oakland Golden Grizzlies two minutes gone by in the second half in Syracuse with a comfortable lead and we are joined by Syracuse University royalty the athletic director John Wilde I dont know about that Richard yes uh here at Center Court and and John this game is a really good game if youre a Syracuse basketball fan but Saturday coming up with Georgetown in town is going to be a special day for a number of reasons not the least of which the Ring of Honor ceremony with Jim Boeheim and Dwayne Pearl Washington governor youre right Rich itll be a really special day and theres no better game to do it than Georgetown to honor coach Diamond pearl and you know the classic games weve had with Georgetown over the years the battles we had when Pearl was here its the right time to do it uh yeah we wanted to originally do it 2020 but the pandemic interrupted all that so to be able to honor Pearl and Coach Boeheim do it against Georgetown its all its the right way to do it and it will be a very very special event well I think John and youve done a lot of this over the last few years under your leadership is retiring numbers and its really a well thought out a few numbers youve retired and now coming up the schools announced Jerry McNamara and our team Warwick what was the thinking behind that and uh hows all that going to pursue Tim I think its just part of the 20th anniversary right in the championship team and I talked to Coach bayheim about it I think we first broached this like six months ago and I said look they should go in together his teammates I mean Jerry hit six threes in the first half of that game right the team made probably most famous play in the history of the program with the block so to do it and uh to do it in our last record he sees the game and to have those guys going together as part of our anniversary the 20th National Championship again it just feels right by John wildhack who is the athletic director here at Syracuse University and its a good time to be a Syracuse sports fan in General John the football teams going to the Pinstripe Bowl and the soccer team is in what soccers version is of the final four coming up the final four we play Creighton on Friday uh six oclock on on ESPNU and if we win that well go to the championship game Monday night but theyve had an unbelievable season a great run the two bosses they had the regular season theyve Avenged those losses in the NCAA Championship in a tournament in football seven and five twelfth toughest schedule in the country going in to wind up to play Minnesota in the Pinstripe Bowl we couldnt ask for anything better so its exciting theres a lot of energy around the community a lot of energy with our alumni and its its a good time to be orange guys you know its funny John you know as a college football fan I sit back and just relax on Saturdays during the fall and I watched a lot of Syracuse football this year and speak to the job that Dino babers did this season with all the injuries I dont think anybody had as many injuries to key players as they had this season yeah Timmy we had I looked at we were playing Wake Forest we had nine of the 22 guys who started week one against Louisville were not available for that game and I just think Dino and the staff our Sports Medicine staff did an unbelievable job trying to get guys back the team played hard every single game and the cap the way we did we probably played our best quarter of the year in the fourth quarter against Boston College and its I was so happy in that Locker Room Post game BC youve been in it I mean it was just just to see the joy of the players and the staff was really special Im just Im so happy and proud and thrilled for them and now along with soccer and football we get to focus on basketball things looking good tonight as they usually do with the Syracuse Orange John wild hack we thank you so much for joining us thanks guys we appreciate it Go orange thanks John thanks coach that was John wildtack athletic director at Syracuse University since 2016 and a lot of good things going on here with this athletic department the Mello Center where the basketball team trains getting a little bit of an upgrade as well all the sports are going to benefit from that theres a lay up and in by number 10 in white side near Torrance well they continue to share the basketball the ball is hardly hitting the ground and on some nights when theyve struggled offensively its kind of the spacing isnt right too much dribbling in one spot not going inside out first but this team you can see it you saw it on Saturday in South Bend theyre starting to grow and understand their roles day by day and now Torrance getting a little extra burn with the lead well in half 29 is the advantage for Syracuse 10 on the shot clock Torrance had it taken away 55 Moon near Kemah the big man is on for Jim behind for the first time tonight as well Jalen Moore gives it up to Shepherd the foul and will Shepard will go to the line well another Timeout on the floor the under 16 media timeout with Syracuse up on Oakland by 29 the game well in hand if you could go alongside Tim Welsh Im rich Hollenberg heres tomorrows womens basketball game right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Elizabeth kitley at number seven Virginia Tech are in Chestnut Hill to take on a very balanced Boston College team its the ACC opener for both clubs our coverage begins at six Eastern well its him 60 points for Syracuse and theres still 15 40 to go in this game theyre shooting 62 percent from the field I think youd be hardpressed to find a better offensive output from a Jim Boeheim team in quite some time oh Jim beiheim has been losing his bench pretty freely tonight from the getgo and a good opportunity for some of these young players to step up and see where they are within the program the Malik Browns of the world Justin Taylors played well tonight at times Chris Bells played better theres Malik Brown with his first two right on cue coming out of Culpepper Virginia s just under nine minutes a game getting some extra time on the floor with younger teams that Jim Boeheim has brought into ACC play in his tank Hema tracks it down and you know that the cloud of Jim behind retiring and when thats going to happen has been talked about for years and the one thing you hear consistently from Jim is I want to leave the program in good standing whenever I do decide to step away and with this influx of young talent that certainly seems to be the case right sure and you know its a question and the discussion is out there obviously because youve been here so long but Jim is knowing him as I do and everyone around him will say is just still as energetic as ever on top of it I mean you cant bring in a freshman class like this if youre not on top of the recruiting gang he and his staff have done a good job of reloading and an even better job being patient with these young guys if you go and lose by 29 Points on the road and then a few days later got to go on the road again and play a tough ACC team and come out with a win that shows you a lot about the character of your young players and the coaching as well its funny when we were talking with Greg campti earlier this morning and we said how come youre playing Jim gate bayheim again with your tough nonconference schedule and they said well weve played four times before and I looked at him and I looked at me and I called him up and I said Jim how about one more time for these two old guys getting together and Jim was like you know what its the right thing to do lets do it sometimes its as easy as that well its great campy one thing he usually does is Win 20 plus games every year and he still thinks that his team can compete in conference and once they get home obviously tonight hes just trying to get through this game tonight and get into conference season and get themselves healthy and man oh man it does not get any easier for Oakland this begins a threegame stretch where theyre here at Syracuse they go all the way out to Boise Idaho to take on a good Leon rice Boise Broncos team and then they wrap it up on the road at Michigan State against his former head coach Tom isnt well Greg campy uh no one has ever accused him of being afraid of anything theyll take him on and his theory is kind of like Tom is a series well play Whoever Whenever early and then hopefully benefit from that in February March quadir Copeland number 24 in white on the floor Aaron pass out of bounds thats a rare Syracuse Turner just number eight tonight for the cues we talked about playing on two feet like Joe Gerard has been attempting to do more of lately thats where Copeland what Copeland didnt do kind of got up in the air with nowhere to go curvy no Conway no no and Torrance comes away with it the local product gives it up Malik Brown finishes nice job by Torrance to that his head up under control knew what he wanted to do waiting for the defense to commit then made the extra pass its been more than five minutes since Oaklands got their last bucket as much as we want to talk about this Syracuse offense the defense has shown up tonight theres another easy two at The Rim this time its Benny Williams on Benny Williams turns up the heat you can get pretty much where he wants to go to on the offensive end play a little bit High harder and a little tougher Syracuse closed the first half on an 180 run theyre in the midst of an 80 run now over the last two and a half minutes theyve built their lead up to 35 against Oakland we talked about how tough Oaklands schedule is in the next couple of weeks a little home cooking for the juice this is the first with six straight games that theyre playing inside the JMA Wireless Dome its Jalen Moore usually a blur on both ends of the floor but hobbled by an ankle injury and you can see by his output that its really affected Copeland forced it up into traffic Oakland is a little bit out of control the last few possessions just kind of put his head down and shoot over the top when theres guys defending him in the lane he needs to slow down a little bit make the extra pass more for two and believe it or not that is his first field goal of the night just three points for Jalen Moore coming in averaging 13 a game please now Copeland trying to make the most of his time on the floor and I dont think its quitting himself that well now Copeland with the foul on the other end and more goes hard to the deck Timeout on the floor 1117 to go all orange tonight from inside the Dome is out as we went to break before the last time out Jalen Moore driving hard to the whole got fouled hard by quadir Copeland and how to be helped to the bench by a couple of assistants and now it doesnt look like well see much more of Jalen Moore one of the top scorers on this Oakland team well hes been fighting that ankle situation and I know Greg Canby told us they were going to shut him down for a couple weeks after but he is a tough tough kid he is back out on the court yeah I should learn the lesson never underestimate the toughness of these college athletes as Jalen Moore will shoot those two free throws it will be interesting to see if he stays on the floor after the two free throws a shot well Greg Camp he just raved about Jalen Moore understanding how important he is for their basketball team you know anytime you have a guy thats that unselfish and talented and just a leader youve got to get him right and he is just fighting through it tonight playing his tail off 13 points eight rebounds and five assists in 42 minutes blade in their previous game against Purdue Fort Wayne foreign Townsend blocked by hema in transition copelando Brown yes and Mike Brown you can see his athletic ability and I think hes going to be another guy down the road thats uh that will be in the rotation maybe not this year but at times this year hes giving him some nice minutes on the backside playing that forward position theres more going into traffic again now the middleman in the zone is so important you got to have that rim protector and thats what Hema can do coming in off the bench when he plays for Edwards and then the followup over the top more back at the line shooting two 80 free throw shooter knocks that one down a testament to his toughness all you have to do is flash back to last year he was having a terrific year tore ligaments in his shooting rest against Northern Kentucky he made the three that sent that game to overtime even though he tore those ligaments and they went on to lose six of their last 10 games without him hard to play Without Your Leader out there on the floor actually the opponents not what youre going to be facing down the road but the important thing is build confidence off that win on Saturday and Syracuse coaches must have to be happy where they lose the ball tonight Parker almost threw it away and a heads up play by Jalen Moore again throwing it off a Syracuse body out of bounds itll stay open basketball oh another play with intelligence Greg Camp he said when Jalen Moore is healthy hes as good as any guard in college basketball and On Cue he Nails the three more aggressive after he went down with the little ball he had been looking for a shot you see how good he is hes smooth from the outside but also balanced on the inside nine points seven dimes for number 34 with the ball Jalen Moore tries it again got it again back to back triples for Jalen Moore 66 out on the perimeter hes got to get a lot closer to more inside Williams took the contact and well go to the line and shoot too well you mentioned this at the top of the telecast with that bad ankle Jalen Moore knows because Greg cant be told him hes going to be set down for the next couple of weeks to rest up for Horizon league play and Jalen Moore is sensing that and trying to make most of the moments sure hes gonna fight this no doubt about it listen to the coaches today talk about who he is and what he is and what he means to this team hes not going to take to that very well not practicing not playing now Keaton hervey checks back up shell dang to the bench as does oh say price head to the Oklahoma 30 points Syracuse lead a shot around 60 percent for most of this game theyre at 59 now foreign Music did a good job of just driving the ball straight down the lane and Jay demo the pump fake and he bit on it he heard the transfer from Missouri State another young man that Greg Camp is very high on and they played that Missouri State team earlier on in the season and hervey went for 24 points and five three pointers against this former Club cant knock down either the two free throws there Copeland almost turned it over 10 to shoot for Syracuse and Torrance pays it off well thats what theyve done all night long theyve really been patient against this Zone spacing the court and making the extra pass with their head up rocket Watts had a couple of buckets in the first half been silent in the second half foreign trying to take on the entire Syracuse defense and turned it over selfish play by the orange thats contagious and everyone starts sharing the ball everybody wants to join the party if that started with Torrance in his excellent on ball defense down in this end against Moore thats a new season high for the Freshman Malik Brown with eight and uh foul by Benny Williams on Trey Townsend when we come back Townsend will have a chance at a threepoint play defense and aggressive play all night long and Jalen Moore has tried to answer but Syracuse Sharon all night the Oakland Golden Grizzlies the score is 7946 but regardless of the outcome these two go way back from the beginning of their coaching days and when I say way back I mean way back 47 years for the man on the left the Hall of Famer Jim behind 39 years at Oakland for Greg camping both have had more than their fair share of success as the two longest tenured coaches at their schools currently and it brings to mind a young hot flashy assistant coach for Syracuse and Jim behind back in the late 80s early 90s one Timothy Welsh look at that riding shotgun next to Jim Bay High during some of the Glory Days I was there to make sure he did if you ever sidestepped got a trip that would catch him were you the getback coach the getback coach and uh his golfing partner that was the only reason he hired me yeah he had one guy on the staff that played golf with him yeah Greg campy is quite the golfer as well yeah as a matter of fact you know we were talking about its V week and we were talking to Greg for a while not only about his team but also about his involvement in raising funds to fight cancer and he has something that he started back in 2015 called coaches beat cancer Jim behinds been involved with it a lot of Alist coaches have been involved from John Calipari to Roy Williams Tom Izzo Jim beeline Bob Huggins and he started something after one of his dear friends passed away from cancer and he said I want to do something so he brings a collection of coaches every other year out to Detroit area they go to the Motor City Casino for a night and then they play Golf the next day and they invite people with their donation to come spend time and its quality time with some of the best college coaches in not only currently but in history and theyve raised two hundred thousand dollars every single time they do this a great way to raise funds for cancer awareness and a great job by Greg camping setting that up but I cant say enough about the college basketball coaches that have been involved with coaches versus cancer through the years that canopy the Philadelphia coaches have been fabulous Mark Few Ive been out to his event spoken uh John calipar we know what hes done Jim and Julie Boeheim in this community here and its just when you think of these guys as basketball coaches but theres so much more theyll give back to their communities and the Charities and Greg camping is a great example towns are now with 24 he leads all scorers but the game well in half by the Syracuse Orange looking to build on their last win at Notre Dame and make it a twogame win streak Samir Torrance from three his first triple of the night gives him nine these games are always good to have coming off a win now youre getting everybody some playing time and youve got Georgetown coming in here this weekend and we all know its not the Georgetown of the old days but still its Georgetown especially theyre playing hard tonight Pat Ewing will be back in the building Townsend continues to do yeomans work for Oakland Syracuse sitting on 90 points thats their season high right now next bucket will break that tie Torrance why not now the Syracuse fans want a hunt well youre starting to feel it when everybodys making shots out there the one thing you dont want your team to do when you get up this big is to develop some bad habits and just were gonna fool around with the game and Syracuse has not done that theyve stayed true to their game plan even with the guys coming off the bench and now with 4 444 on the clock at a 9351 lead Jim behinds activity is bench ACC PM with Mark Packer Trey Boston and Taylor tatabaum theyre talking football but theyll also have the latest from around the conference in general its weekdays at four Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app whats happening a lot of people around Syracuse program excited about the Pinstripe Bowl I think you know a lot of times in sports most of the time its how you finish and they struggle a little bit down the stretch but I had a really good season so they could build on that as well because football has not been good here in a few years so its a prestigious bowl like the Pittsburgh bowling get down to New York playing the Bronx its always good Music Nico Russell had his pocket picked by Brody Parker but he missed the bunny the put back is good by Watts so on the floor now Anthony Clayton number 12 in white Nico Ruffin 21 Arthur Cordes number 33 alongside Malik Brown whos had a good game in the second half getting some playing time number five Justin Taylor with the ball yeah Taylor step back nice stroke well they have been comfortable offensively all night long and its not been just one or two guys its everybodys been doing a nice job on Syracuse side sharing the basketball making that extra pass Townsend continues to go to work he has 26 hell go to the line trying for two more with 346 to go our final media timeout Syracuse up by 40 the crowd inside the JMA Wireless Dome wants a cnote from Jim Bay Hyman company but you know Jim doesnt care too much about that what he does care about is how well his team has played on both ends of the floor hes got to be very pleased with this and you know at this juncture of the Season you just want to play well it doesnt matter who your opponent is and you know weve seen it with Syracuse that they have those nights where they can play with people and and beat people as we saw against Notre Dame so Jims got to be thinking that this team is going to be a week to week just keep getting better week to week build some confidence with his freshman keep that Judah mints keep working with him to make better decisions find ways to get Joe Gerard open and know that you have an elite player in the middle of Jesse Edwards I know its comparing apples and oranges but the absurdity of the college basketball season back on November 29th not even two weeks ago they lost by 29 Points to a ranked Illinois team it was the lowest point total since 2019 and one of the worst margins of defeat for a Jim Boeheim era Syracuse team and here they are up 39 points Laughter so once this ones put to bed the Syracuse Orange will set their sights on an old Big East foe from back in the day the Georgetown Hoyas come to town as we saw and heard from AD John wildhack theyll be celebrating not only the late great Pearl Washington but also Jim behind both going into the Ring of Honor only six members of that Ring of Honor before them Jim Brown Ernie Davis Floyd little and Roy Simmons Jr so Jim and pearl are the first two representatives from the basketball program to have their names painted on the Dome wall hear the ring of honors Jims name is already on the court so that was you knew that was coming next but also just a really good job by John wildhack and the athletic Administration in the school the retiring numbers they started doing it a few years ago they hadnt done it for a while and then now theyre starting to really catch up to all the greatness theyve had here both in the mens and womens program third Hustle by Parker oh Townsend no Shepard cant finish because it would be easy to ignore Jerry McNamara and Hakeem Warwick because you think of the 2003 team you think of one thing Carmelo Anthony sure as Roy Williams once said at a golf outing youre at in Pinehurst where Jim was there with Jerry McNamara he said everyone thinks I dont like Jim Boeheim because they beat us when I was at Kansas he goes Id like Jim bam I just dont like Jerry McNamara those six threes Im sure he wakes up in the middle of the night and sees those 400 for his career Jerry McNamara number one alltime Im on Syracuse Orange and his number three will be permanent on this court inside the Dome coming up at the end of the season thatll be March 4th when they close out the regular season against Wake Forest now joining the elite Derrick Coleman Sherman Douglas Billy Owens amongst others theres another two for Townsend Townsend now with 29 one shot of his career high accuse is stuck on 95 a Ruffins getting his shot so theres no doubt about it hes going to hear about this in the film session tomorrow unless he knocks one down a good Hustle by Cortez but itll stay Oakland basketball much to the Chagrin of the Syracuse faithful Music Music and three by Watts and immediately Isaac Barnett the referee steps in between Justin Taylor and Rocket Watts after a collision near midcourt and a flagrant one is called on Rocket Watts the Watts just kind of pushed him shoved him thats good call Applause that is the definition of a frustration foul by rocket Watts and Anthony Clayton trying to pay it off missed the first of the two Ts Applause I think all three of those pertain to that call Music and Clayton want those bad and the bench wanted it for him would have been the first points of the season for 12 in white Anthony Clayton sophomore out of Albany but theyll have to settle for possession of the basketball and Clayton will bring it up under a minute to go Syracuse will improve to 54 on the season snapping a threegame losing streak in that win in South Bend theyll now try to build on a twogame winning streak when they welcome in the Georgetown Hoyas Saturday heres Clayton again no go and his teammates are begging him to get one theyre making a force in the passes you might get one yet oh oh and he hits the deck at midport again not for lack of effort Anthony Clayton well he got tripped over there but I thought they might send him to the line and rarely do you see Jim Boeheim in full grin on the sidelines but when your teams up 39 youre allowed to let one out you know coaching all these young guys at times can be frustrating and it tries your patience but its also fun to watch a young team develop and you go through the if you have the mindset that listen we have some Talent were going to get better the kids are listening the players are listening theyre going to try theyre going to get in the gym extra theyre working to get better and I think thats Jims mindset with this club so far this season where do you see Syracuse now that youve seen them win the last couple of games as far as the ACC season I think theyre right there in that next tier off off the top they can they can be in that next year I think theyre going to be in a lot of close games you know the Pittsburgh Miami Wake Forest Clemson Virginia Tech theyre right in that group which theyre all pretty even its going to come down to the close games well the best overall performance of the season for the Syracuse Orange 9566 your final score from the Dome as Jim behot Notchs career win number 1003 and Syracuse improves to five and four on the year for everybody here at the ACC Network including my broadcast partner Tim Welsh Im rich Hollenberg saying so long happy holidays well see you next time as Syracuse moves on they face Georgetown coming up Saturday
