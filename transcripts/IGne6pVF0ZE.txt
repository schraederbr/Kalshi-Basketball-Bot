both categories for a full season so last Saturday Syracuse won 7263 in the final game of the regular season essentially to force a tie with these two teams at 10 and 10 and because of that game Syracuse is the eighth wake is the nine and here they are again Andrew Carr and Jesse Edwards get us started Tommy Morrissey Mark schner and Ted Valentine on the whistle and just as we expected Syracuse dropping back into the patented we cant even call it a 23 Zone its just the Syracuse zone is what its known for nationally and they stopped from the first possession Betty Williams and cam Hildreth getting involved in a little extra curriculars and we can see right now a lot on the line here to start off day two second round of the ACC tournament Ted Valentine Applause talks them down and away come the orange with the hell ball here is the Freshman Metz who has been just terrific for coach baham trying to go to Edwards Carr was there Bobby Clinton getting the start deflected in heres Appleby Applause is he fun to watch Applause held with caught again in the zone and look at the flexing car lay up good Jesse Edwards had five steals in the game on Saturday as you get opportunity to look at the Syracuse starting lineup Edwards who was spectacular in that game our our third member Andrea Carters going to talk to us a little more about that here is Mintz spins out the foul line jumper Bobby Clinton who started now the last four ball games this freshman from Southern Sweden and Malmo averaging less than five points about four rebounds through the regular season but you mentioned Clinton in that starting lineup a smaller starting lineup when you can take it off the Big Fellas up front when you take out Matthew Mark Hildreth right there at the foul line the ACC every coach you talk to says thats where you got to be able to make a catch and score against this Zone and oftentimes theyre playing oneonone against Jesse Edwards is one of the better defenders in the ACC led the league in block shot so a great start off with Wake Forest early and we get a whistle and a foul off the ball and its going to be on Gerard Joseph Gerard 61 senior Glenns Falls New York his first and the first on the orange and there is the 77 year old Syracuse alum Hall of Famer Jim Bay hunt Apple being Wake Forest into the four Court we know about the player at the foul line always appears to me the wings are also the triggers against some of this well the reason theyre the triggers is because you have to make threes this young man David raises threepoint shooter unable to knock that one down but Wake Forest made 10 threes against Syracuse in that game on Saturday the problem was they shot 39 Carl took it up went back down possession second Hill ball and what three trips the nearest Steve Forbes a native of Lone Tree Iowa 57 years of age and 49 wins in his third season in Winston Salem Applause deacons are 18 and 13 lost two straight and four of five coming to Greensboro foul off the ball no Benny Williams 13 not 14 his first second on the orange before Im interested the adjustments can be pretty quick when you just play both Saturday yeah exactly especially when you you know got good looks just unable to knock him down we mentioned 10 of 39 and we talked about Jesse Edwards who had five steals in that game on Saturday comes up with the offensive rebound another one of the areas where Syracuse was spectacular Edwards blocked Away by Carr 12 to shoot for the orange wait pretty stingy at the rack but you talk about really a smaller lineup which pushes Andrew Carr to the Five Spot he hasnt played much there throughout this year with of course Bradford and Marsh taking up majority of the center minutes away four seven to shoot Gerard a standing three the whistling foul underneath and pildreth is uh his first and it is the first on the Wake Forest Joe Gerard and Cameron Hilda nothing will be given away in that matchup it absolutely will not be you talking about two guys with some toughness speaking of tough yeah two Dimension getting into the painted area deserved to be the ACC rookie of the year but this guy was tracking him he absolutely was and Midway through the season I felt like Judah Mitch was actually ahead had a stretch where he won three out of four ACC rookies of the week heres Williamson Appleby pulls the trigger and away with it comes Gerard and the orange skip into the corner Bell of three got it Chris bells 373 of the year he only had three on Saturday against the Dukes but hes dangerous from Beyond that Arc and one thing I Love About Chris Bell he doesnt turn down any shots he gets an opportunity hes going to get it up Gilbert had a bounce out nice rebound by Williams Benny Williams showing off his athletic ability I think he jumped and just waited around in the air for a little while to make sure it was off Gerard a deep three one and done the orange at the offensive end wake trying to turn up the volume a little bit Applause Music Appleby tried to scoop and theres a foul on mints thatll be his first and itll be three on Wake Forest so were underway four minutes in day two in Greensboro ESPN thank you so much Wes and Corey and it is great for me to present todays import the watch which is brought to you by principal and that is the performance of Syracuse Center Jesse Edwards for Corey touched on it Ill be happy to expand Jesse had a monster game last time out against wake 27 points 20 rebounds it was the first 20 and 20 performance in regulation for Syracuse since Derrick Coleman did it twice in 1990 head coach for Wake Forest Steve Fork said we did not have an answer for Edwards he dominated the game Corey how does Jesse Edwards get his second 2020 game against Wake Forest today hes had great energy early but one of the things that youve seen is Wake Forest putting an extra body on him on the offensive glass making you mentioned those 20 rebounds eight of those were offensive rebounds for Jesse Edwards on Saturday and Corey you know that our producer Kim beltons always got to throw some quizzes out there so get your 20 and 20 Vision ready were gonna have some quizzes for you see if you know your 20 and 20 history in a little bit Im looking forward to it Drake I am so glad Im here to miss dropping dimes like that once again the beautiful fine record the interesting wrinkle here early is it feels like wakes trying to Tempo Syracuse but Syracuse doing a good job holding it off with what theyre doing right there deflections especially from it but again another steal from Edwards on that possession but just using his length to cover up that middle we talked about how important that ACC area is and on the other end of the floor of course Judah Mintz who loves to attack the pain getting into that ACC area and the nice cut by Bell along the Baseline Defender not looking and we normally see Bell doing his damage from Beyond the threepoint Arc nice fine for Drew dements for the assist so heres Mintz at the line hes 76 percent Applause out of Fort Washington Maryland Oak Hill uh I was waiting I mean again I wont call him as good as one of the other magnificent freshman to you know ever in college basketball history by the way cut the Nets down they honored that team last Saturday by the way Hildreth in traffic car fighting for it stripped out of there boy Williams has been a interesting guy around the rim defensively here in this opening after coach been very active only played eight minutes in that game on Saturday over two from the field so I believe he got the memo from coach behind to be a little more aggressive here tonight thats Lucas Taylor wearing zero for the Deeks Appleby Baseline Clinton sets it down Bobby Clinton averaged eight points nine rebounds shot 33 percent from the floor in his last three ball games and if youre the way for us Demon Deacons you better enjoy playing with Tyree Appleby you may not ever play with a point guard like this again youre talking about great vision as he showed in that last possession Applause Edwards jump pass down low catch lay up Benny Williams that was such an intelligent play by Jesse Edwards he pretty much looked off Tyree Appleby going out for the steal the easy bucket inside to Williams because of it orange back in front heres Hildreth at the foul line Lucas Taylor is this young man whos picked up some of the minutes after monsantos injury forward against NC State in February look at Hildreth fight inside slapped out second chance look at Appleby one pass and the ball got kicked 20 to shoot on the reset and Appleby like Mintz eyes up looking for the outlet attacking the basket once again Tyree Appleby and just the hesitation to get Jesse Edwards in the air means that Edwards the accs leading shot blocker cant try to block that but Judah mess on the other other end finding Chris Bellum a nice back cut combined six assists on eight field goals here early in the corner Clinton sets Edwards the rebound WD you mentioned the injury to damari Monsanto was huge Monsanto was averaging 32 made threepoint field goals which led to ACC and that shooting that Wake Forest is lacking right now without him has heard this team Williams had it rattle out look at Bell fight through young freshman from California back to Williams Benny Williams got five just his 173 of the year and a time out here and you can see Steve Forbes not happy about the second chance opportunities for Syracuse getting day two underway at the New York Life HCC tournament its just the second meeting in ACC tournament Play Between the orange and the deacons the other one occurred five years ago at Barclay Center in Brooklyn its a first round matchup Mark doleja had 20 ties battle 18 Brian Crawford had 22 beat chill had 11 but Syracuse won 7364 beat chili and Brandon Childers I know yes you know I absolutely thats my nephew Ill make sure youre true I know youve got a couple I also like Mark dollar getting a shout outs out by the way for Syracuse yeah fivepoint lead for the orange kind of getting contributions from everybody but 14 right there Jesse Edwards who had the 27 and 20 on Saturday that Dre just talked about heres Bell at the foul line but you see Jesse Edwards has developed so much as a player during his time in Syracuse simply for the weight he handles the double team handles that trap is able to get the basketball out oftentimes getting his teammates open shots feels like wakes got to get some perimeter Firepower going her Court they absolutely do and when you consider the fact that theres no Monsanto thats a great retraction there by Benny Williams getting back to block that shot he and Bill both attempting to take that away from Marshall comes in shooting about 90 from the field Williams knocks down another three eight for Benny Williams hes got the last eight for Syracuse remember we talked about that memo I believe he got it only eight minutes for him the demon Deacon cheerleaders here and of course wait for us right now on spring break so it doesnt have you know the students here in the building that you would expect but actually ball with a Wake Forest Legend a number of times one Chris Paul who uh is an Abbott bowling hes big time right there he with a ball to strike especially with the cameras on I got you Dukes need to strike here because Syracuse is on a 164 run since wakelet four nothing theres Clinton Williamson sliding Baseline the scoop and score David Williamson Williams started East Tennessee State for Forbes transferred when the coach came over via the portal and now the Deeks only Trail six here once again the double team nice fine for Edwards when he talked about Chris Bell he aint gonna wait his second threepointer of the game and now you think about Bell and Williams combining for four threepoint field goals made already I told you Syracuse had four threes in their first seven field goals and none for Joe Gerard would you be surprised I mean think about it youre getting it from Bell youre getting it from Benny Williams and Joe Gerard has yet to dial one in from long distance and Orange playing strong up nine again Williams left it on the front Appleby races watch this all the way to the rim got it blocked from behind by Bell WD you talk about threepoint shooting for Syracuse this is a team that only shot two of 14 in the game with Saturday so they brought their shooting with them to Greensboro they were able to get that win without shooting Ralph around the yard Corey I think one of the most surprising stats for bayhams team is they only average six threes a game theres Gerard he got fouled three fouls coming or three free throws coming on the foul against Camp Hilbert we talked about Jesse Edwards in his Bachelor as you see Jesse and you get an opportunity to look at his eyes hes seeing the Trap coming and understands exactly where the opening is going to be and has the length to be able to deliver a strike to Bell whos able to knock down the three ball Chris Bell doesnt need much time but Jesse Edwards puts it right on the spot in his shooting pocket making it easy for his teammates tell you what the Improvement year to year for him unbelievable heres the best thing about it he can come back oh yeah theres an option hit for Jesse Edwards to come back and be a part of his program next year and Im hoping that he decides to do that can I just tell you Andre something I think everybody ought to try and come back for one I just think whether they tell you youre up or not I think you just ought to throw it out there and say you know what Id like to try can I come back for one minute why not Corey listen if there was nil when you played oh definitely would come back Applause Dre let me tell you when when I left I had a year of Eligibility remaining at the University of Virginia but my nio package with the San Antonio with Spurs was much better than anybody was going to offer at that time so the answer would have been no and had I not broken my ankle I was taking that in a nio package much earlier oh my goodness what Corys trying to say is he just freedom in his he was ready centers but I I really do appreciate the fact that these young people are able to get name image and like this money sure I love the way that they can and again you know they put in a lot of time theres a lot of work to be a college athlete and again Im glad theyre able to be rewarded for it at this point I would uh I would tell you that I think its the paperwork on the eligibility has been the tricky part thats no question about the backside for the student athlete the paperwork on whos got years left and so forth is the I think thats the tough part and the recruiting piece of developing programs too forward theres Gerard now fell orange up nine look at this Chris Bell nope I like the thought process when all those fails shoot it make sure you get a look at the rim dont turn the basketball over and at the end of the day you allow your defense to get back and get set Wake Forest got five from Clinton the dunk and the foul a moment ago and Bobby Clinton who had eight points and nine rebounds in the last three starts looking again wow he had three double figure games against the ACC hes got eight to lead wake hes got half the Deep points and hes stepping it up and of course part of that trap against Jesse Edwards an aggressive trap on this possession but Edward still is able to get it out Judah Mintz missing Chris Bell on that one ends up being a turnover for Jesse Edwards trying to set that screen second foul on Edwards five on the orange Music substitutions Edwards going to get a seat Penny Williams well check into the ball game so now Gerard and we see Malik Brown too Corey yeah last time the Freshman from Culpepper Virginias taking the floor but I like this lineup from for Coach behind hes got really three forwards in there now inside in that back line of the zone and Malik Brown can cover a lot of ground and be a menace defensively in there as well Appleby sliding through kick out for Taylors three hierarchy trickle Lucas Taylors 83 of the year and his first points in the ACC tournament its a nine nothing run for Forbes his deacons to pull to within three foreign Applause still without a point Applause all right so a break in the action Syracuse by a Woolworth store which is now an international civil rights Center and museum West and Dre is somebody that was born here and grew up uh at least till I was what 12 I think Corey before we moved to the Raleigh area uh its something you learned about in this Marketplace in in the 1970s I was an elementary school student here Dr Pauline Foster was our principal at the elementary school and it was part of the North Carolina history you learned as an elementary school student the actions of you know people like Joseph McNeil and Franklin McCain and Ezell Blair and David Richmond and it went from February 1960 into July nonviolent protests into the whites only lunch counter at the Woolworth store in Downtown Greensboro and thats you know a lot of respect one from the fact that you were taught that in elementary school here because of course black history is US history fell the rebound of the Miss its a onepoint Syracuse lead and heres the trick with forbess team theyve kind of knocked off little bits here not necessarily solving theyre solving the Zone chord but it feels like Syracuse for all that they did early now finds themselves in a one possession run here with six and chains to go when Syracuse hasnt taken care of the basketball tough shot right there from Joe Shaws April to knock that down his first bucket on the afternoon but if youre Steve Forbes youll live with Joe Gerard having to make shots like that to beat you Bobby Clinton has got a doubledouble and getting up tried to go for more and the lob was offline and that was on Lucas Taylor who tried to hit Clinton on the backside long so Girardi gets his first field goal got six the hard way three free throws and a triple and now a hell ball a third of the first half and thatll bring Edwards into the ball game and Kadir Copeland great Hands by Wake Forest multiple players when you think about Lucas Taylor as well as Andrew Carr getting in there getting their hands on the basketball not allowing Gerard to get that look but also not picking up the foul Baseline Gerard heres mints the hanging two oh look at Copeland The Freshman from Philly try to fight for a second chance Appleby at his best in transition and Williamson cant find the three Carr recovers against Edwards rolled out look at Clinton I think hes going to get called for the foul in pursuit of the uh Second Chance oh no its on Syracuse Applause quick reminder to you are nothing but neck crew comes back tonight on acc Network 11 30 Eastern time theyll break down all four second round games of this New York Life ACC tournament postgame interviews look ahead to tomorrows quarterfinals and usually a surprise or two stops by late at night when its nothing but that after dark absolutely and again of course youve got Kelsey Riggs Luke Hancock Joel bearing the great Carlos Boozer yep on the set oh oh I thought Oakland was going to get up on me but he found the right guy great Look for Benny Williams whos locked down one last spot already rolled out for Williams and Tommy Morris he is and Judah minstrels the foul the collision with Tyree Appleby itll be the second on this six now on the orange now you look at this Syracuse lineup although they hold their fourpoint lead youve got Jesse Edwards and Judah Mintz both on the bench with the two fouls most likely wont see them again and they look at the game runs that weve seen Syracuse open the game with a 2210 run but just like that Wake Forest gets right back into it with the 113 Run of their own Hildreth on the drive Edwards slapped it away well I didnt think we would see Edwards but hes back on the floor with the two fouls so Jim behan not scared to use Jesse Edwards he got some mileage out of the two forwards though didnt he he really did got great minutes out of those guys and of course Vinnie Williams off to a good start and this one offensively Sonia Torrance is also on the floor Corey first time weve seen Torrance transfer from Marquette whos a Syracuse native Gerard four to shoot in traffic forced it up and were going to travel on Joe Gerard Whistle by Ted Valentine four and a half to go wake has done this Corey 130 Bobby Clinton and look at this the pass was in the right spot and Clinton is going to pick up the foul chasing the offensive rebound Clintons got to be careful on that one though a little demonstrative I understand you dont agree with the call but make sure you dont add any insult to it Applause Trey Applause just had to appreciate the defense Corey I know youre more of an offensive guy but the defense from Cameron Hildreth the denial first and then the slides like this isnt an easy thing to do hand up because you dont want to go hand down man down then you cut the driver off a little defense when the offense is struggling you know Dre just because you were a great defender yes and I was a scoring point guard doesnt mean I didnt play defense straight I didnt say you didnt play it I just dont know if you appreciate it I dont know if you appreciate it I would go as far as to say Drake I probably dont appreciate it as much as you do however I can respect the defensive effort by cam Hilder for that position can I reemphasize how happy I am to be here today Dre I am so happy to be with you because somebody is firing right at CA thats the way it works man she comes at me constantly you know but again she she was a Defender Defender shes a pass first point guard so its not much I can say when she comes at me like that well the question is Corey who comes to mind when you think of somebody trying to defend you that way who tried to try I can tell you right now a guy at Wake Forest and it would not be Randolph no its not it would be a gentleman by the name of Derek McQueen oh wait a minute David Williamson knocking down the three balls and by the way McQueen and wears number four just like Derek McQueen but he put me in jail at Lawrence Jones lets go Ace ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketballs brought to you by principle when you take care of your team they take care of business CBC had Pros I dont mean one pro but multiple Pros speak on itself Greenberg I can tell you right now when you talk about ACC point guards when I was playing you go back Wake Forest of course head Randolph Jones even though he won the point guard we had Randolph Childers Rusty LaRue then you think about Travis best at Georgia Tech you go to Sam Sam cassette and Charlie Ward at Florida State Chris Whitney at Clemson Bobby Hurley and Duke ACC was point guard you the entire conference was and were not even talking about the big guys up front yeah no youre right thats Appleby and Gerard and Jude immense along with Davion Williamson theyre kind of set a little bit of a tone here today but its The Bigs like Benny Williams and Bobby Clement for Wake Forest that are kind of running this first half and thats the first time that Jesse Edwards has handled the Trap poorly forcing a shot but even still with the two Defenders on him Benny Williams had the opportunity to pick up the offensive rebound Benny Williams leads Syracuse now hes got 10 in this first half Clinton on the bench with the two fouls he leads Wake Forest theres Morris Boyd did he give away a free shot no he saw the accs leading shot blocker and decided otherwise Carr working through traffic theres a penny Williams fight and ultimately Pride out of there Samir Torrance in the orange in the front court with the fourpoint lead and under three to go in the opening half Copeland went for Torrance stolen Appleby here goes the Leagues leading scorer second field goal for Tyree Appleby from Jacksonville Arkansas Tyree Appleby is quick as Lightning he can be in one place at one time and before you even throw the basketball hes already there to take it away which you saw in the defensive possession Gerard and the Dukes now a chance to Tire lead as we work toward two to play in the first half this Tommy Morrissey and the foul on siberator but you talk about quickness just watch how quickly Tyree Appleby steals the basketball and then of course turns his defense into offense to change the pace to go right by Gerard and get the easy layup only four points for the accs leading scorer earlier but getting to the freethrow line where WD hes set an ACC record single game 23 for 28 free throws against North Carolina front end of the one and one good for Appleby heres a look at our day two bracket from Greensboro Jeff cable the coach of the year the Pitt Panthers theyre next against Georgia Tech at 2 30 Josh pastors team beat Florida State yesterday behind Miles Kelly and then the night session North Carolina makes their debut here at the Coliseum with Boston College and then of course The nightcap features Virginia Tech and NC State who have not played since early January they had only one game in the regular season six for Appleby tied at 29 wake on a 197 run since they were down 12 but Jesse Edward was getting a much deeper post position before the track could even get there he was able to go to his jump hook and score right over the top of March inside two now Vince and Gerard kind of play the front here Applause Williamson a shot fake on a three feeds Carl for the dunk soccer field goal for the Delaware transfer Andrew Carr Wake Forest is handle once theyve had that back into trouble penetration getting inside the lane theyve hit a number of nice interior passes but due to miss answering on the other end five first half points now from Mintz on his second field going orange back in front Marsh trying to help with that screen on Gerard they skip it for Williamson flashes by Mintz this is who you want the rock to be with right absolutely Lucas Taylor getting another look at it unable to knock that one down beats crashed the glass and last touched by Syracuse says Mark schner Tommy Morrissey I think Mark sure looked for a Little Help from Tommy Morrissey but he will stay with the original call that Awards it to the Deeks despite the pleas of the Hall of Fame head coach across the way at the orange bench Wake Forest done a great job as a way getting inside the painted area once again Taylor gets into the paint unable to finish it but Lake will keep the basketball once again when youre ever able to bring Jesse Edwards up to the ACC whether you shoot it or drop it down for one of those passes it eliminates a shot blocking ability getting him away from the rims yeah look at the lot for Carr and that time Benny Williams knocked it out heres Matts free wheeling four in a row for Jude immense Applause and the orange lead is four with under a minute to go first half Taylor with Appleby and Williamson on the perimeter here once again inside the painted area Appleby can get to his spots oftentimes you have to have two Defenders there to take him away and that time going around Jesse Edwards once again eliminating the shot blocker with this quickness quiet start for Appleby but Coreys got eight now as we close this half and Syracuse going to take the user lose it time out with about a two second differential as we wind down this first half talking about the pool game with Judah Mintz The Freshman Phenom for Syracuse going point A to point B with his quickness and then showing off his quickness Tyree Appleby the great ball handling ability to freeze the accs leading shot blocker Jesse Edwards the Finish WD yeah these two great point guards youre watching which one is me which one is Drake Music Mitch maybe defends a little harder than Appleby so I would say that so always got to go back to defense my offense was my best defense heres minutes five to shoot Applause foul on jumper air ball and shot clock violation so one and a half to play Applause s going to take their time going to get a fivesecond call he better be careful with that close didnt he Appleby picks it up half Music way spins out and the Orange is going to take a 3533 lead to the locker room here Cory entertaining first half for both these teams and we saw them showing off their strength Tyree Appleby and the Demon Deacons attacking that paint getting in a number of nice interior passes and finishes heres Dre with Coach Mahon coach mayheim you keep Judah part of this first half the double double for Clinton and Jesse Edwards who had 27 points and 20 rebounds in the ball game on Saturday limited here in just this first half just one solitary field goal for the big man hilderth in the Deeks cam stuck a little Up and Under and Cameron Hilda starts the second half I will be 100 transparent I did not think that that was legal in Cotton mens college basketball the repivot yes I did not think that was legal so Im sure it is because Teddy Valentine was right there on the Baseline and did not call it yeah we got a we got an a crew now Tommy Morris he said Valentine mark schner on the whistle speaking of Ted Valentine calls the turnovers great saw there the double team against Jesse Edwards I talked to Coach Forbes he said he said hes in that first half he said they have to be conscientious because if he shoots it early everyone else is crashing so theyve got a box out if Edward shoots it and theyve got to get out to Shooters when he passes out of the double team but he feels good about his team offensively he likes the ball confidence as well theres Carr at the ACC logo Sweet Spot against the zones third field goal for Andrew Cohen four in a row for the Deeks to start the second half wake leading for the first time Corey since it was 65 early in the game Bell trying to put the orange back in front and does but you notice Wake Forest defensively even though theyre trapping their face guarding Joe Gerard not giving him opportunities not recognizing the fact that Chris Bell can be a knock down shooter from three as well Chris Bells got three threes and his fifth double figure game against the ACC Clinton took his eye off of it turned over to Bell and the orange Mets a pullup Edwards crashed the glass and is Andrew Carr going to get called for this thats what makes Jesse Edwards so dangerous he can always go get a basketball at his highest points and out jump everyone of course already at seven feet eight offensive rebounds that match up on Saturday right and he continues to be dominant on the glass here as well theres a Gerard for Bell over the top of Bobby Clinton and look at Carl and Edwards just kind of hold their spot on the floor but a great piece of officiating not to blow the whistle on that both guys with guilty which means that no one gets in charge Appleby had it pop in pop out Wake Forest ball movements been pretty good here Corey it has been Syracuse has as well nice fun oh Vinnie Williams unable to bring that one in but a great look and started a transition chance that Appleby cant finish Vince has numbers they waited for Appleby to get back into it heres Edwards the dunk on Carr and the foul Applause Jesse Edwards running down the floor but staying behind the play making sure he made himself available to Joe Gerard to find and highlight that I think were going to see on SportsCenter later on tonight Jesse Edwards to the line 73 percent after wake got the first four of the half Syracuse has now put six in a row on the board so the Run game continues here early in the second 20 minutes back to a fourpoint lead for the cues Williamson knocks down a triple its going to be necessary to wait for us to be able to pull Syracuse wings out on that Zone opening up things on that interior theyre gonna have to make some threes be interesting to see how they played the repost if Benny Williams cuts down the lane he would have got a dunk on that possession heres mentz trying to work on Williamson along the Baseline and grazed off the side of the glass and here comes Appleby ahead for Hildreth and Maria good in front of the uh defensive Chris Bell Wake Forest taking the lead playing in transition not and beating the Zone down the floor its always going to be important when you play against Syracuse Gerard and the rebound for Carr Hildreth again hes going to be Hildreth against everybody in white there for a second I thought yeah Syracuse did a great job getting back with that transition defense on that possession Applause and I think Belle is going to get the foul here not Jesse Edwards Mark schner for us and we talked earlier about Syracuse Center Jesse Edwards having 27 and 20 last time out against Wake Forest so my question Guys West Corey this is for both of you how many players can you name that averaged 20 and 20 in division one college basketball so before we start Dre you know I know one answer already so Im gonna give my God the historian the first shot at this and then I will give the one answer I know I dont know any more than one I will go uh Lou Alcindor or Kareem AbdulJabbar at UCLA okay dont know if thats right or not we got to go to our super producer Kim Belton to find out if that is correct I would also throw Wilt Chamberlain to Kansas in there which was my first guess and Im not sure if thats correct or not either but I can tell you one that I know for certain would be the doctor Julius Erving thats what everybody at Music UMass and the reason why the Julius Irving award is named of course after one of the greatest and you mentioned a couple of the other greats in that and Julius Irving I was correct however you were wrong on both of your answers my guys well let me emphasize we lost Paul Silas back during the fall a terrific NBA player Dre College numbers and Creighton are absurd for Paul Silas artist Gilmore played for a national championship for Joe Williams in the Jacksonville dolphins with the great Pembroke Burrows by the way let me just explain to you when you say the name artist Gilmore I need you to say it quieter because I still have a traumatic experience from when I shook artist Gilmores hand and I think my fingers are still broken I hear you I hear you three ball out of the corner by Hildreth was missed threepoint lead for Wake Forest deacons have kind of been a run stop and I mean from a scoring perspective theyd score a lot then stop and score again and Syracuse is also counterpunched a little bit especially in the early stages of the second half and now foul on Mike Marsh or Matthew Marsh rather the sophomore from Cornwall in Southwest England it is his second team of the half fourth on Wake Forest and almost five minutes gone here in the second half a threepoint lead for the deacons and a reset the marsh foul and once again the double team on Jesse Edwards whos handled it very well throughout this game but Bell had it knocked out Clinton I think dug it out of there and hell get the feed from Williamson and Bobby Clinton cannot finish it and Ted Valentine a whistle in the transition chance on Judah Mintz second on the orange here in the second half couple of free throws coming for the freshman at 6 10 Bobby Clinton 10 points and the DoubleDouble in the first half for the clintons no points though since seven minutes to go in the first half board will give free throw good theres a lot of credit for adjusting as we see the ACC coach of the year who also happens to be my little brother coming through Jeff cable well who is put on in this building as a player opportunity now along with John Shire as well as Huber Davis to be one of the coaches who have been able to be a participant as a winning team theyre on the ACC tournament so go along with being a winning coach Edwards on the second chance and the foul and well get free throws here at the moment for Jesse Edwards dont forget to check out our alternate angle of todays game the New York Life Above the Rim Camp is streaming live for you on the ESPN app always good to have a second screen going when youre watching March Madness basketball postseason especially here at the New York Life ACC tournament as a look as Edwards goes to the line he is hit his only free throw here in the second half got two now we talk about the history of this event think about the Capel family in their history in the ACC Tournament of course Jeffs mom Jerry is here their late father Jeff was just a terrific Ambassador for basketball courts you know all levels in this state absolutely and as at one point an assistant coach at Wakefield Edwards got the back end and there comes Jason Capel who has worked this tournament and everything yes he has in fact he was sitting at the inline last night I sent him a Texaco wheres your mic oh goal Bobby Clinton tell you this the young man from Swedens having a bit of a coming out party in his first ACC Tournament game when thats been a significant adjustment for Steve Forbes and his staff they have filmed that lob a number of times throughout this game hasnt always executed perfectly but they werent able to pull this off on Saturday but theyre pulling it off to Perfection here in the second round of the ACC tournament kibal is brought to you by principal when you take care of your team they take care of business and we welcome you back to the coliseum in Greensboro theres the Freshman from Malmo in southern Sweden Bobby Clinton Jesse Edwards from Amsterdam in the Netherlands as we continue to make basketball more of a smaller world dont we a very small world when you think about where all the basketball players come from and where this game has become so popular after being played globally heres Appleby a look ahead for Hildreth and swiped out of the air Penny Williams is playing free safety now thats one thing that you will find with Tyree Appleby he does have the tendency to turn the basketball in at seven turnovers in the game on Saturday of course youd love to see him do a little more of this when he gets the opportunity knocking down the three and transition to build a Wake Forest lead tonight 11 for Appleby 141 on the run and the missed layup by mitz here goes Appleby again Williamson standing three backtoback triples from the Deeks not happy as the Hall of Fame he is not WD we talked about the fact that Florida deacons to win this game they were going to have to be strong from Beyond a threepoint off with 10 for 39 in the matchup on Saturday at 256 percent tonight they are much better Tyree app will be finding David Williamson for the second a backtoback threepoint field goals and of course his teammates along the sideline love what theyre seeing the lead for Wake its largest now of eight and we keep talking about the the way the ball games unfolded today oh we absolutely have we talked about the fact that weve got the runs happening right now Wake Forest is open this second half on a 217 run after seeing Syracuse open the first half on a 2210 run so these teams getting after here 12point lead here for Wake Forest 14 today from Greensboro and Pittsburgh who had maybe the toughest Saturday in all of college basketball last week they had a twopoint loss at Miami keep them from winning the share of the regular season title and end up being the fifth seed they take the floor next year at the Coliseum against Georgia Tech but I can tell you what I got a chance to hang out with the Panthers yesterday and they are inspired they are lose they are ready to go here this afternoon Syracuse a miss out of the timeout heres Wake Forest on this run 171 over about the last four minutes foul line for Hildreth back out Clinton tees one up that one did everything but go down for Clinton but you like that look if you Wake Forest and youre going to get those opportunities Torrance wow look at Williams go get it and a foul on Bobby Clinton is going to be his third we talk about the pit Panthers coming in playing the next game and one of the reasons why this game is so important for Pittsburgh Music did everything but go down for you Corey did everything but go down on that one we talk about the pit Panthers and the importance of this agency tournament for them right now theyre on the cusp according to Joe Leonardi even though they had a great season yeah dont take me there right now Im not but theyve had a great season but yet theyre on the cuff right now still in the field down low Copeland could not finish March clears the rebound Appleby filled with hesitated now Williamson he will not oh and Edward slapped it but right back at Williamson and somehow he kept it for Appleby Carr put it on the floor and Mark snow whistle Sandra Torrance his second third on the orange and we see the Bracketology with Joe linardi the projected ACC teams right now Pittsburgh at 11 seed and so an important time here throughout this ACC tournament for the Panthers to continue their strong season get a couple wins here in Greensboro Builder 11 to shoot Williams is going down Marsh also will tumble and I think thats going to cost Jesse Edwards his third as long as its only a third foul we can appreciate that enough theres nothing worse as far as a injury standpoint as you see the nice pump fake by Marsh Jesse Edwards able to clear Marsh pretty much Embrace himself for that fall fortunate one of the things that you never like to see from basketball players especially falling from those Heights is putting those wrists down its oftentimes the way that you break your wrist fortunately Edwards able to walk away from Dominos game Williamson missed the three from the corner that was 14 feet of human falling right there under that basket theres a lot a lot of man down there kick out three Williams boy the orange are getting good looks and just not able to buy one now for the perimeter but those are the same shots that went in for Syracuse early now theyre missed their last 11 shots as theyve struggled to find a way to score here trailing by 12 with 12 remaining Tim Duncan was the 96 MVP he had a 2020 game in the championship Victory against Bobby crimens Stefan Marberry and Georgia Tech absolutely youre talking about two of my former teammates of course Randolph and I played together in high school Tim Duncan now played together with the San Antonio Spurs so special to see both those guys and the way that they were able to get the job done in the ACC tournament of course you know the caveat to Randolph as always if I werent hurt it would have never happened 12 point 12 point lead whistle and a foul and lets go to Dre W but when you talk about the history of this of the tournament and the history of mens college who was a referee he is a staple when it comes to this game and you see the referees theyre using pink whistles today in support of Lakin Ayers who is the daughter of Roger Ayers shes been diagnosed with cancer shell have surgery in April she is surrounded by support gear I do have the pink whistle that the referees are wearing Corey she is a Virginia graduate graduated in three years so shes like family you know she absolutely is family she graduated in three years so her father could actually come back and officiate games at Virginia because he couldnt do it while she was there at the undergrad but prayers out to Lakin we know that you have a great support system around you and the ACC family is praying for you absolutely our pass to Lincoln and of course one of the finest officials in all the college basketball theres Roger Ayers this layup by Edwards lead 11 for the deacons and Appleby in fifth gear had it deflected he was trying to hook pass in the corner to tee up Davey and Williams so itll stay at the weight gain to the floor as you see Samir Torrance take a break and Joe Gerard comes back for Coach behind important stretch right now for Syracuse one to be able to find a way to get some stops wake Force has built some Rhythm on the offensive end of the floor and more importantly to try to find a way to put some points on the board arms have gone six minutes without a fear going forward yeah only one point from the free throw so its been a struggle for the orange offensively during the second half wrap around the car tough shot and he got the roll and we started off the second half talking about the interior passes and weve seen a number of nice ones but cam hildren may have had the nicest one of the game thus far with the left hand car and double figures hes got 10 lead is jumped to 13 its a 192 run that Miss cuts into with a triple much needed bucket there by two to miss to be able to knock down the three ball to get the lead back to 10 okay Syracuse going to need some stops here soon coach behind going to that patented pressure theres Carr hes going to fire a three nope so a 10point game it is and Gerard in the orange theres Williams a lot with Edwards could not catch it on the back end and I think coach baham liked the pass selection there since you love the passing from Wake Forest right now moving the basketball around the perimeter Clement unable to knock that down but still a great look well theres a lot to like about Bobby Clinton in there heres Mets over the backboard and were covered underneath by Williams 17 to shoot ball never hit the rim Applause Edwards a little fake in score with the right hand pretty moved by the big man Jesse Edwards whos got eight here this afternoon thats the second time weve seen that from Edwards but it has to do it quick before the double team can get there and a foul on the orange as Appleby attacks that would be did he lose his shoe and that possession does look like he lost his shoe and speaking of nice passes Canfield youre finding Andrew Carr under the basket that left hand wrap around dime on that possession putting it to where only his teammate can gather it and score it over top of the accs Top Shot block fourth foul on Jesse Edwards by the way Corey comes with 9 22 to play it is the fifth on the orange and Monir Hema The Freshman from Niger and a transfer from Duquesne I say freshman sophomore transfer first year with the orange Hema Waits at the table meanwhile Mark Schnur is over alternate official AJ Desai and theyre going through something here on the monitor gotta look at our guy Gary Strickland over there behind the possession arrow there there is that is Gary Strickland who is uh a legend at the book as they say in these parts free throw by Applebee is good Gary Strickland is the official score for the ACC this is his 21st tournament long time official scorekeeper at Wake Forest in WinstonSalem Saturday night will be his 17th championship game and then hell work the first and second round here at the coliseum in Greensboro next week and then shut it down but our thanks to the long work of Gary Strickland WD early in my career Gary Strickland walked up to me and he said Corey you said something that really ticked me off the other night but I cant remember what it was and when I think of it Im going to let you know here we are 15 years later and Im still waiting for Gary to tell me what I said but he has been great to me for the past 15 seasons and I truly appreciate it 10point lead for the Deacons and heres a quick check of what we got coming up for you and I would caution you to look at today but also look at the carryover to tomorrow right Corey absolutely tomorrow the double buys come in Miami Duke Virginia and Clemson but theres going to be great basketball here in the Greensboro Coliseum this afternoon this evening and youve got some Heavy Hitters coming in you think about the nice session alone with the Tar Heels and the Wolf Pack its going to be jumping here well there is Josh pastner hes talking to Miami assistant Bill Courtney who is taking in the ball game here today the Keynes of course are the top seed after the twopoint Victory against Pittsburgh who plays next year in Greensboro against Pastor in the jackets Williams at two soft jump shot and Benny Williams got a dozen in the ball game now an eightpoint game and oftentimes Jim behind will use this pressure to see if they get a couple turnovers and find a way to get some rhythm going just like this and do the Miss with the easy opportunities finishing it off now youve got a sixpoint game the pressure has worked thus far for the orange 13 now for Mintz Applause and the scoreboard here in the Coliseum is wrong the scoreboard on our screen is correct as Corey told you its a sixpoint game but the scoreboard here in the Coliseum is incorrect well they just gave the two points to wake him in Syracuse they got to fix the scoreboard right now is letting them know this is wrong and to get that correct yep for a sixpoint game and now they fixed it here in the building straight away three and Williamson will track it down for Clinton seven threes today for Syracuse six for Wake Forest important possession right here for Syracuse to make sure they get a good look on the offensive end of the floor no need to be in a rush Copeland and Baseline the block on Appleby will be his first and that is the seventh on the deacons eighth Downs of Defense Corey with a12 to go always loved looking at the sidelines especially in moments like this a good opportunity to see Jim behind and Judah Mintz having a conversation but also Jerry McNamara jumping up encouraging Judah mention of course Judah Mitch has got the greatest education you can imagine not only from coach behan but also Jerry McNamara and Adrian archery the two guards who played the point for Jim behind they understand exactly what hes going through both these guys had an opportunity to be able to play the point guard position for Jim baham as freshmen yep and both are incredible resources for not only Mets but for those of us that cover these games so is Alan Griffin by the way to say I cant I cant leave Allen out but a great play by copen right there to knock the basketball off of Appleby and I believe Syracuse will maintain yeah they get it back and thats just hustle right there knocks it down off Appleby out of bounds Jim behind right on top of his fourpoint game now an opportunity to make it a one possession game for the orange Copeland playing like a boundary Corner breaking it out of there Applause Hema on the floor to replace Edwards Gerard spotting for three here they come Corey the Press combined with a little backcourt pressure and the foul will be in the backcourt on Copeland challenging the inbounds pass and although you dont want to foul 94 feet away from the basket Copeland is playing with the energy and effort necessary for Jim behan and copen also delivered the pass that allowed Gerard knocking down the three to make it a hand on only basketball on that possession knocks it off of Applebee but the bench the appreciation by his teammates and his coaches love that type of effort especially when youre you know bailing all in 94 feet pressure and making plays like that Tyree Appleby to the line where hes a perfect four for four 13 points nine assists today for Appleby and the front end good the WD you know Im not an analytics guy but I would have to say that no one in the ACC has a higher usage rate than would be Tyree Apple it would be hard to touch so much to Wake Forest and of course any type of positive effects victories they have he plays a large part in each one in town I think thats where you mentioned the the component of his impact and thats where we spoke about the Monsanto loss earlier in the broadcast today from the perimeter perspective thats where theyve had to try and recover to Davison other things as you see Williams tap follow and a foul on the Deeks now let me speak to this young man who has been a complete roller coaster all season long for the orange weve mentioned on Saturday he only plays eight minutes in that game over two from the field right but Benny Williams has been nothing short of spectacular this afternoon for the orange and this is exactly the type of performance that Jim behan needed to see from him 14 and 10 15 in points 10 rebounds the double double for Benny Williams Corey he was on Ice in early February he wasnt playing period right no he was not he was not in good graces with Coach behan but the patience of a man thats been in Syracuse for 47 years continuing to stick with Benny Williams and it has shown up here this afternoon heres Carr pivoting through the lane now Williamson looking for one alley three to shoot in Appleby in the corner Clinton three that is the response right in front of your own bench you gotta love that if youre Steve Forbes Gerard trying to answer cannot Deacon lead is three on the triple by the Swedish freshman thats a little bit of a hero shot in my opinion again I think if youre Syracuse you could have got a better look than that one from Gerard and we got another tie up and boy Williams and Damian Williamson came locked up the balls gonna Ballard to the orange down three and raring to go look at here now here come the Panthers the five seed begrudgingly the five seed I think the uh I think the boys in the royal blue and yellow will be ready to arrive dont you I do think they will be ready to go but I am not sleeping on the rambling wreck four straight wins for Josh pastner hes seen magic in Greensboro before yes he has yes he has Williamson a third and the rebound to Copeland jackets have now won three straight in this building you count the twogame win they got him the 21 Crown Corey and then of course the win yesterday three straight here in the Coliseum when you think about the fact that they trailed the majority of that game yesterday and end up winning it on a free throw we talked about Jesse Edwards and his work is all got knocked away Hildreth stripped it out of there now another hell ball thats going to go away far four or five Health balls I think five weve had tied up today including two in the first four possessions and give Cam Hildreth a lot of credit for the way that he has defended Joe Girard throughout this game beating him to the spot cutting him off there and again once I love the great point about the fact that there was no calm on that play right threepoint game you see the look Joe Gerard knows they pointed that out earlier but she recognizes defense before me so maybe thats every time every time she does and it would be appropriate that she does heres Williamson well Clintons been story here today and Stripped by Copeland and a foul on Clinton and thats going to be his fourth Applause dont forget we got you covered on selection Sunday all starts at High Noon on ESPN college football college basketball live to prep the day six oclock now recent the guys look at the mens field of 68 brackets are announced Bracketology with breakdowns of each region and at eight oclock the ladies take over field of 68

Ill be there selfless Shameless promo here at the eight oclock well youre welcome McCoy so its okay I think hes rubbing off on me a little bit hey Dre just so you know thats not just a good thing its a great thing yeah it is speaking of a great thing but here Copeland has been a great thing for Syracuse here in the second half his energy his effort stepping up to the freethrow line knocking down the two free throws and hes given Jim behind everything they could have asked for coming off the bench hes got six points all at the freethrow line and five rebounds today Applause gotta have some guys do the dirty work if youre going to advance here especially in a tight game and weve got a good one one point heres Hildreth Wake Forest looking for something in the lane and the sophomore from schwarfing in West Sussex of England so hes got his eighth Point speaking of little things hes been the guy doing all the little things for Wake Forest is Edwards is able to get the easy bucket running Hilda to get called for the Flop on that possession but there was contact he absolutely got hit by a screen theres no flopping on that wake fans wanted the charge Gerard wants a flop weight fans wont charges heres Carr trying to get away from the double team Hildreth foul line area to Carr Williamson four to shoot pilgrim Applause Music 10 for Hildreth Georges has one of the three triple doubles in ACC basketball this year but hes showing his versatility it hasnt even been about his offense todays been about his defense but hes throwing in a couple big buckets on the last couple possessions sure has catch by Edwards in the quick time but thats it when he catches it turns over that left shoulder before the track can even get there this zero Wake Forest can do about 12 points for Jesse Edwards Hes five of eight from the floor and hes got eight rebounds but is playing with four as we work toward four minutes Williamson heres Appleby trying to find that crease in the zone theres the flash for Carl s had the hot hand and he scoops and gets two more wow Cameron Hildreth now starting to carry Forbes his team 13 for Hildreth and a 70 run for Hildreth as well and an answer for the orange wow shoot a miss thats the second time Judah Mitchell stepped up and made a big three when his team was behind one to run gets him back to one point you go to Hilder Corey how about Williamson half will be back for Damian Williamson rebound picked up Williams at the foul line if youre Syracuse right now this is a time to get the basketball in the hands of Jesse Edwards allow him to be able to operate through the post get something open for one of his teammates next dead ball is going to give him a timeout see if the orange can grab the lead before the break Gerard to work flash thrown away Williams tried to feed it to Copeland heres Williamson ahead with Williams and Damien lays it in Wake Forest building the lead that one was because of the long pass ahead however its been great offensive possessions for the Demon Deacons everyone touching the basketball sharing the sugar as my Mana notorious dob would say and it ends up with a beautiful find from cam Hill ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by New York Life 12 000 agents there to help you go through lifes happiest and most difficult times and we welcome you back to the Greensboro Coliseum with Corey Alexander Andrea Carter West Durham Kim Belton our producer Adam Bryant our director wonderful college basketball crew here today for you and were grateful to be Courtside watching Syracuse and Wake Forest in their second meeting all time at the ACC tournament threepoint lead for the deacons orange with the ball and mints on the attack what a scoop thought he had a chance to get it to go down Carr in the full scramble mode on the floor on a knee Ted Valentine to whistle and Andrew Carr got a timeout called in that mess and what rightfully so because one of the things that weve seen on the last couple of offensive possessions for Syracuse they havent gotten the looks that I think that they were born Wake Forest has been executing much better on the offensive end both these last couple possessions after Syracuse got it to one point the game and you see Judah Mintz attacking the basket but at this point this has this ball has to go to a shooter in the corner that is a tough shot to try to take especially over a guy with 610 trying to block your shot and Miss unable to really get any lift on that shot keep it dribble alive well kick it to the corner if youve got a guy there Music so now with 224 to go remember the timeout was awarded to Wake Forest deacons are out of it Corey orange have one to go the rest of the way and Steve Forbes Wake Forest and you unless you went back and looked at this this is a hard number to believe wake has lost six straight games at the ACC tournament nine of their last 10 16 of their last 18 Cory at this event well and its hard to Fathom especially when you consider that the tournaments that are played here in Greensboro that has been quite a few of those if you go back to the last 16 events Wake Forest is the closest school to proximity to this Arena yeah and so if you would think that you have a great following but one of the issues for the Demon Deacons spring break normally Falls during the same week as ACC tournament they dont have as many of their students here supporting Wake Forest by the way has seen Syracuse win two straight in the series six of the last seven now the deacons would be looking for just their third win in Series history over Syracuse and meanwhile their third year head coach the very personal Steve Forbes trying to get the Deacons to a game tomorrow against the top seed Miami out of a nine seed Appleby attacks oh the Loopers fell off the line and were covered Inside by Edwards but regardless it was still a good look away for us now we have to see can Syracuse execute and get what they want on this offensive possession drive and a score and thats true to mens again attacking and the answer is yes but its Vegeta Benson playing off two feet in the painted area taking a shot that hes comfortable with 18 from Mets on his seventh field goal hes got six assists today Appleby its got 11 assists 15 points today for the Deacons right now if youll Wake Forest you want this guy having the ball in his hands or Appleby Helm hildrifts has been able to find his teammates and of course have to be with four seconds remaining is trustworthy fall away three banged around rattles out for Edwards gives Syracuse a lot of credit for the defensive stop on that possession forcing a tough shot for Appleby at the end of the shot clock to change anything here Corey nope he gonna go do the mix getting the ball inside to Jesse Edwards we want those two guys instead punches the orange to the front with the triple or that Orange in front two under a minute wakes out of timeouts Applause 10 on the shot clock Hildreth weaving through spins and scores what a shot Im still trying to figure out how he could toward his body to get that shot off so awkward that Jesse Edwards the leading shot Blocker in the AGC couldnt even jump tied at 74 and a Jim behind timeout we got about a six second differential shot clock to game clock thats the whirling dervish I need to see this shot in slow motion jumps as a 360 just completely throws Jesse Edwards off balance Jesse Edwards looks back at his bench like wait a minute did that just happen everyone in utter disbelief on the Wake Forest bench that Cameron hildren just did that and crunch time to tie the game as said before unbelievable what a second half for Cameron Hildreth to tie it at 74 Steve Forbes who is been on the roller coaster this year and then Jim Boeheim Lets Play Zone and look how calm the Huddle is Corey I mean again 47 years on the sideline hes been at Syracuse I believe for 62 years so when you think about that I mean theres nothing that this man has not seen on the basketball court well maybe he hadnt seen the 360 the time again hell just just made that shot but its very little gym behind hasnt seen at this point all right so now weve talked about it a moment ago you said mints and Edwards and Benny Williams threw in the three and then cam Hildreth went with this well again not only the Finish but the nice move that Sports Center top player today I dont care what else happens today okay to do this down two yeah to tie the basketball game cam Hilder should find himself on SportsCenter tonight top Play Wake Forest is out of timeouts important to remember we got a six second differential and a tie game 22 to shoot for the orange whatever you do if youre Syracuse you do not want to rush any opportunity get the basketball into the hands of Judah Mintz and get something late in the shot clock preferably going to the rim Applause Denny Williams working against Clinton now heres Gerard five to shoot against Williamson fall away three is short Williamson runs the rebound heres Appleby 43 back for Williamson for the win David Williamson pumps in a three with two tents left winstonsalems own Damien Williamson playing close to home did not want to see his ACC career in here tonight not a great shot for Syracuse Tyree Appleby with patience finds his running mate David Williamson who calmly steps up and knocks down the game winner for the Demon Deacons five tenths of a second so three tents put back on the clock so with five tenths more than enough time to catch and shoot but its going to have to be quick dude immense has ripped his jersey into the ball game will come Chris Bell Applause you have enough time to be able to catch and shoot but its going to have to leave your hands quickly gonna have to be in Long pass Williams will throw and Wake Forest wins Vivian Williamson who knew about Steve Fords Vision when he played for him at East Tennessee State wanted in on a chance to come to his hometown and play for Forbes at Wake Forest now has carried Forbes to his first
