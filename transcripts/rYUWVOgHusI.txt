coming to Berkeley Well hes excited You know 100 wins as a a coach in your career thats a big accomplishment But Dedric Taylor also a veteran coach with a lot of wins under his belt Opening tip controlled by Cal wearing the home whites Navy blue for Cal State Fullerton The Titans so far had a huge win against Caltech to open the season in Titan Gym and then lost a heartbreaker played really well at Wyoming on Saturday losing to the Cowboys 9282 was a three right off the bat from John Camden Not afraid to take that shot and for good reason He drains threepoint shots Great range for the big fellas Leads Cal six made threes already on the season for Camden Bailey Nun hes cut off Here is Dale Cruz at the top He answers with a three for the Titans Well thats a good sign for the Titans for him to knock that shot down No jitters and come back and answer the three that Cal just knocked down He had 21 in the loss at Wyoming in Laram on Saturday Day aims from D and both teams feeling it early You know Roxy I asked for Manson whats going to happen when his team finally starts knocking down threes and looks like theyre on their way tonight Back the other way quickly the floater from Joshua Ward the senior from Memphis Well the Titans are showing you something by stepping up and answering every charge from the Cal Bears But this is a good start by Cal Theyve really stepped up and shot the ball Chris Bell rims out the three and the rebound Kendrick Deluna the lone returner for the Titans and a turnover Here comes Bell back the other way Looks to attack Day Ames screaming three We talked about his ability to get to the basket but dont go to sleep on his threepoint capability Just bottom Three threes for Cal Here is Deluna down low Feeds the cutter and slashing in the layin from Joshua Ward Nice move Great move to avoid the defense and slipping to the basket DAY AMES THIRD THREE for Ames I think this heat is doing pretty well for both teams They like shooting in this hot humid climate in the Bay Area It is unseasonably warm and it is warm inside House Pavilion tonight And both teams responding The roll wouldnt go for Davis White An offensive rebound on the reload Here is White again Rattles out the three Lee Dort the rebound Cal looking to push it The lob over the top and the lane John cheering Camden at one as he is fouled How about the look from Lee Dor This has been a staple for Cal Bears Not much pressure on the pass and Lee Dor finds John Cam who gets the basket and the foul Great high low situation already 14 points for Cal Were not 3 minutes in No but this is execution Roxy This is just really highlevel execution from Cal Theyre scoring from the perimeter Theyre scoring on inside looks And thats something you know Mark Matson said Look I have a good shooting team You wouldnt know it by our percentages but uh hes hes really happy to see his team finally knock down some shots which now opens up driving Heres a one two that theyve really employed all year long Theyve opened up and extended the floor Spinning in the lane and it left short by Jefferson de la Cruz Monro Cal the rebound Ames with nine Camden with six Theyve combined for the 15 Camden straight on and too long on the three and Da Ames cant get to it Out of bounds and it belongs to Cal State Fullerton Well again youre talking about Cal that just hasnt really theres been a lid on from the threepoint line but theyve got guys that can shoot it Their career threepoint percentages will tell you otherwise that they can they can knock out shots Cals got five assists on their fiveman basket so far Slipping to the bucket up and under Nice move by Landon Seaman a grad transfer from Menllo College Yeah you mentioned assists Roxy Thats significant Why Because last year they only averaged nine or 10 assists So to get these assists early and theyve done it in both games thats a big big improvement for the Bears And you and I through the first two plus games now as Day Ames hitting the pullup have talked about the movement of the basketball and the rhythm theyre playing with offensively Now theyre playing with pace Theres no doubt And Dedric Taylor talked to us today at two round about hes worried about the pace of Cal Landed Seaman and the rebound Chris Bell for the Golden Bears Here is Bell inside to Dorts Nice drop off out of the double team and the finish cheering John Camden John Camden knows how to play without the basketball and Lee Dor a much improved passer from a year ago James and Candid have combined for all 19 now for town The Golden Bears are seven of nine from the field cheering and four for six from three Tough fall away shot Jaden Henderson the miss And here come the Bears again Justin Pippen drives splits the double team and will get to the line What an impressive offensive start from California so far tonight Great job You can see the Bears are theyre playing on high octane Theyre getting to the basket Theyre knocking down shots Theyre distributing the basketball The balls not sticking Its just Day Ames is on fire Hes been that way the first two games and hes continuing They only missed two shots So the Bear is on fire but Day Ames has been a big part of that story Already 11 of Cals 19 John Camden by the way has the other eight as Justin Pippen to the line after the foul called on Landon Seaman of Cal State Fullerton And Pippen misses the first Justin Pippen has already now shot 17 free throws this season Well two plus games And Im going to say hes a good free throw shooter And Im glad I didnt say it early cuz I have got blamed for that But he he can shoot free throws I think he was he didnt miss a shot the last game from the line but hes hes a good free throw shooter And more importantly he knows how to get to the line I think all of Cals team and well talk about that some more has shown you their ability to get to the line Last season Cal led the ACC in free throws made per game Almost 18 a game They were one of the top teams in the country 11th in the country in free throws made per game Heres a three from the corner And thats too strong Launched by Christian Williams the freshman And back the other way Chris Bell off balance And the rebound tipped free and out of the pack Here comes Bryce Koffield a good looking freshman for Cal State Fullerton KJ cheering Garris on the drive Jaden Henderson missing a three Garris keeps it alive and the Titans get a fresh 20 Launching is Christian Williams and the rebound there is Justin Pippen and Cal looking to run but a foul prevents the breakout Its on Christian Williams of Cal State Fullerton Well Roxy teams that like to play aggressively you know have to be be beware because if you try to attack the glass either by the drive or the offensive glass you know Cals going to run on you This last year they didnt do that This year theyre are pushing on makes and mates and they and you talked Dedric Taylor talked about that in the staff today at shootaround Theyve got to get back in transition and Cal State Fullerton Dedric Taylor reimagining this group They want to shoot a lot of threes and were seeing it early in this game Half of their shots have come outside the arc Well thats what they do I mean theyve had a lot of success doing it Theyre in a zone now Theyre in a match up zone Chris Bell missing on the baseline Landon Seaman the rebound And here comes Bryce Koffield He had 21 against Wyoming on Saturday Up and under Koffield draws the foul Comes from a very good high school program Hes a Southern California native He went to Sierra Canyon which has become one of the basketball powers in the state Its an outstanding program in in California So uh good pedigree And if youre you know if youre Dedra Taylor you know hes got to be creative Roxy Hes got to do a lot of things to get his program and get programs here You got to take he told us today hey division two players uh getting some guys in under the radar Thats what hes done and and hes built his program cheering One more for Bryce Koffield All new ESPN app has arrived Its all of ESPN all in one place Its your home for the most and best music

Dorsy The rebound landed Seaman for the Titans KJ Carris had a good look Seaman the offensive rebound for the Titans Nice Koffield Heres a three Christian Williams Hes not bashful And the tip it almost went in Landon Seaman down there for Cal State Fullerton Cal controls Well Cal Mark Madson say All right now lets settle down Lets get a good one I think he wants to play fast but he also wants to take advantage of some mismatches on the floor Day Ames too strong And the rebound run down by Reus Petritus off the bench for the Bears Heres Petritus launching a three and the rebound grabbed by Jaden Henderson Here comes Cal State Fullerton trail three too strong from Landon Steam applause and Cal controls the rebound So after the hot start both teams have gone a little cold I like Mark Madson last time he said I push it I we set it up once turned it didnt get a good one Push the ball Lets go back to what we did Cals missed their last five The Titans have missed their last seven for the field And loose ball knocked free Landon Seaman dives Kept alive by Cal Petritus cheering capitalizes underneath A great look by Day Ames What a fine two right to the rim and a whistle against Cal Yeah look at the hustle play But look at D as he saw Rita Petritus just in the corner of his eye Didnt hesitate Got it to the rim I mean the assist total Roxy is just its amazing how much theyve improved that from a year ago There was games for Cal was in single single digits in assists a number of games Balon Milos Elich Here is Jaden Henderson way off and the rebound pull down Justin Pippen attacks feeds a cutting Elich and he lost the handle and Cal State Fullerton counters Jaden Henderson and the hustling Petritus knocked it away right to KJ Garris for the Titans spinning in the lane and the floater from Christian Williams That was a good move to keep things close here but Cal really is doing well offensively They love the pace Theyre continuing to play with pace and fast breaks every opportunity Williams a threetime state champ in Missouri the freshman Kick out to Elich lines up a three and it goes out of bounds Didnt draw anything and it goes to Cal State Fullerton The Titans trying to hang in there Theyre doing their best Roxy but Cal Fuego Cals got got some points on the board because theyve been pushing the ball But the Titans are going to hang But the trend with this series look this is only the third meeting between the Bears and the Titans But each of the previous two has gone to overtime The last time they played was December of 2017 That was why King Jones first season as the Cal head coach and the Bears won 9589 Darius McNeel had 30 points in that game and a block is called Rita Petritis with KJ Garris moving in for the Titans So I remember that game to be frank and and uh you know its been exciting in this series But you know look at Cal now theyre theyre finally cooling off Roxy Theyre shooting a temp 50 Uh but they were at 77 So you know the the folks in uh theyre going to do a good job defensively Theyre going to theyre going to iron this out But Cals got to do theyre falling in love with the three just a little much Reus Petritus snatches the inbound pass Call steals a year ago Justin Pippet launches three cheering and applause Well you cant go underneath screens with these Cal these Cal guards and Cal shooters Theyre too good If you cheat the screen theyre going to theyre going to bury you Five threes for Cal Deflected out Stays with applause the Titans Over Yeah Over half of Cals shots have been freezed But watch Petritus He just does this all the time He finds a way Hey just a a a really a big time seal maker And then you got Justin Pippen that knocks down the three with ease Joshua Ward who leads the Titans with four corner three and the rebound knocked free in the hands of Garris tipping it and the layin for Cal State Fullerton and Kendrick Delun Oh a heads up play by Fullerton Big time play free and a steal for the Titans Picked up by Duna Here is Dea Cruz Monro finds Garris in the corner and the rebound pulled down by Nolan Dorsy Titans just one for 10 from three HERE is Pippen cheering and knocked away and diving court Kept in bounds Terrific hustle by Christristen Williams for Cal State Fullerton Well Fullertons got some great hands Roxy Theyre getting their hands on a lot of balls And a travel on Kendrick Duna That travel was called by Nolan Dorsy who was playing outstanding defense Dorsy is probably their best defender But talk about defense Watch Fullerton coming from the blind side I mean thats just tough to see You dont see the defense and theyre coming there and theyre quick So you got to really The ball cant stick and you cant dribble without having vision In their opener against Caltech Cal State Fuller had 13 steals They have 37 assists in that game Thats unheard of I dont care who youre playing against Ripped down by Davis White Here comes Cal State Fullerton pushing attacking Tough fall away Missed by Jefferson de la Cruz Monro He was trying to draw the foul Didnt get it Right back Justin Pippen for Cal GETS THE BUCKET HAD A good look Missed the layup Then he fouls Joshua Ward Oh he cant believe he left that one short He did everything on that move Saw the the gates open Got to the rim and just left it short and Justin Pippen could do that He got fouled actually Didnt get the foul called and then just as he got to the basket just relax Kind of broad jumped instead of high jumping Always tell players you get to the basket high jump Dont dont broad jump And he kind of come came up short Cal a little bit shorthanded in the back court again No Dewan Campbell missing his third straight game to start the dealing with a groin issue Hes dayto day as is TT Carr who was injured in the opener against Bakersfield Cals really extending their defense Theyre pushing Origin way out on the floor Tough fall away in the baseline by Jaden Henderson I dont know if you can play defense any better than Cal did until the end of the shot clock Thats just a tough shot Roxy 2516 California 820 to go in the half John Camden launches three screaming cheering Hes got 11 Aims with 11 The lead is 12 I love John Camden He just releases the ball the same way every time Well talk about that later but he works at that Jayen Henderson to the bucket and he blew the layup Reus Petritus the rebound Dana Ames pushes two on three Attacks anyways and lost the handle right to Joshua Ward Here come the Titans counter Jaden Henderson fumbles it away Ripped back by Henderson for Cal State Fullerton Here is Seaman down low with a jump hook by Landon Seaman I love that move inside He just took close position Thorp was behind and he scored it Look at the Titans just hanging in Roxy I mean Cal was on fire early but Titan the Tigers doing a good job staying tight Tough Seaman was a first team all league performer at Medley And now raising up a level to D1 as Reus Petritus with the layup cheering Up and under Too strong from Jefferson Gay la Cruz Monro Ames weaves his way in Floater high off the window Too strong for Petritus Running as Joshua Ward to the basket Ward leans in and lays it in Yeah good looking basket there Obviously Ward Joshua Ward big laying cheering veteran Last year played at Palm Beach Atlantic College where he led the Sailfish Did you know that was their nickname No but I know that he can play I can tell you that the senior from Memphis showed you something ON THAT LAST PLAY John Camden launching too strong Lee Dort on the weak side and a foul and a push on Dort going for the offensive rebound his first Thats a thats a good call But meanwhile whats going on Fullerton back in this game Theyre giving you the step back They could really knock that shot down And not to be outdone theyre in transition and Joshua Ward staff the other night Roxy and the other day dur during the day at practice and they thought that trip did them some good to go out to uh France and and come back with some experience under their belt help their team grow Theyve got a tough Vanderbilt team over there as Landon Seaman cuts to the basket Thats twice He has six off the bench Thats twice Hes just gotten loose at the basket Good find Good play coming out of that timeout Justin Pippen finds John Camden Too strong on the three and the rebound pulled down Joshua Ward for the Titans Seaman launches and didnt draw iron Here come the Bears back the other way Day aims drives Chris Bell moves in and has the height advantage and took advantage of it over the much smaller Bailey none Well I like that Roxy Just take what the defense gives you That was there First points for Chris Bell the Syracuse transfer cheering And thats an offensive foul Bryce Koffield called for his first The freshman Yeah With a turnover Now he knew it too Great position by Day Ames But lets look at the fine here Thats Look at Bell gets his man up in the air He knows hes got a height advantage Gets into better territory and scores But look at the score Look at the charge on the other end You know you just you got to hold your ground And its just a lean in Theyre going to look at it to see if it warrants an upgrade to the common foul Tommy Morrisy is our lead official working withoul Trace Dian Kits here tonight And the ruling on the floor was a common offensive foul on Bryce Koffield of Cal State Fullerton Yeah I I I dont know I I mean he led with his body kind of incidental contact I dont think he led with the elbow or through the elbow Its just going up for his shot Not sure theyre going to upgrade this but Im sitting over there and theyre sitting over there at the monitor Yes there was contact with the elbow to the chin of Ames but that was a basketball play It wasnt an an orthodox play He was making the swipe through as he was squaring up to the basket and his elbow made contact with Aim Yeah And you could argue that D Ames was in the cylinder a little bit too So I So you know I I I personally think its a play on but um you know theyre theyre trying to eliminate blows to the head whether intentional directed or not So they have to look at it Um I just didnt see it as you know I just didnt see it Heres one more look at it But its clearly a basketball play by Koffield He wasnt swinging with intent No but he didnt go up for a shot either So he was trying to clear space So well see I mean that was not in the act of shooting That was actually on the floor where he swung his elbow So they they officials could be discussing that If youre taking it up to score thats one thing If youre clearing space out thats another And thats very well could be the point the topic of discussion Theyre discussing the potential of upgrading it to a flagrant one And they did go to the monitor that is under the jurisdiction of the officiating crew that is not challenged by Mark Madson which weve talked about it already this year And if you watched any college basketball the new rules implemented a lot like the NBA where you get the challenge This is not a challenge This is an initiated crew review Initiating review Yeah Uh but theres three So theres not going to be any ties They got to break it here The call on the floor has been upgraded to a flagrant one foul Cal will get two shots and the basketball So it has been upgraded Yeah I think it does come back down to to that I I think Roxy because it wasnt in the act of shooting and that he cleared some space here He Well he never went up for a shot but he just cleared space There was contact there I I think the play one means two shots for Ames and Cal will have possession Yeah So its a big play I mean its you get you pick up the ball possession of the ball and you got shots Thats a big momentum changer One more for Ames who already has 12 points in the ball game He is now five for six from the line this year Well significant Roxy is Cals got 18 points from the threepoint line And how did they get those Kels got 10 assists Now you and I both know there were games last year where they had one two and maybe three assists at half Theyve got 10 and weve got 5 minutes left to play 12 made field goals Yeah And and so thats a big change from a year ago Mark Madson staff really made a concerted effort to improve that And in the first two games the bulk of their scoring came from either in the lane or at the foul line Completely different tonight No And uh I think you welcome the shot You want to see your shot start to fall because they have some good shooters Justin Pippen in and out on the three Lee Dort up over everybody and slams it home First points for Dort Now Fton has no answer for Lee Dor when he goes up like that Hes big strong and hes aggressive Largest lead for Cal and its Seaman inside and a quick move to the basket Hes got eight to lead the Tit I love that move against Cal because Cal gets out hide hard on their hedges and he slipped that He didnt set the ball screen He slipped it and was wide open at the basket Shot clock approaching 10 Heres Ames The pull up jumper and kept alive by Candon on the back tap Justin Pippen Good defense by Bryce Koffield right there Dat surveys the floor He likes this matchup up top He drives Pippen along the baseline and a foul as Dort is grabbed underneath by Bailey Nun Now you like Lee Dort Roxy Hes tough He can go up and keep the ball alive Hes big Hes strong Hard to keep him off But if youre Fullerton I love the big fella See Henry Basar the former Arizona Wildcat at Trans North Carolina in A BIG GAME JOHN Camden a tough step back and for the weak side Kept alive on the glass by Pippen And Lee Dort is mug going back up Thats Cals strength on the glass Roxy They got a couple of looks and kept the ball alive You know its interesting though You talk about paint scores and paint touches Its actually Cal State Fullerton whos got 18 points in the paint Almost doubling up Cal inside whos only got 10 Usually its been the other way around for opponents this year Foul on KJ Garris of Cal State Fullerton Lee Dort at the line Transfer from Vanderbilt the senior Seven of 10 for the strike so far this year One more for Dort But you mentioned the presence inside that the Titans have had and what Cal has done the last two games Each of the first two games Cal made a total of five threes Theyve made six here in the first half tonight Well when that happens sometimes your inside game kind of goes away because youre knocking down shots but itll be interesting to see how things progress as the game goes on Darus too strong on the three and the rebound pulled down by Nolan Dorsey for the Bears And a push as Chris Bell went into Joshua Ward but a push is called on Bryce Koffield of Cal State Fullerton And Chris Bell kind of sold that one a little bit I think so I I like what he did Second foul on Koffield And its Chris Bell at the line for California in the 17 foul A one and one now for the Bears One guys You know selling is really important If youre going to take a charge fall and and and and act like you really got mugged And uh I think thats important One more for Bell Three points for Bell whos now nine for 10 from the line this year Actually I remember Leon Poe I could never get him to fall down when he took the charge He was so strong So just fall one time and he wouldnt So he never got the charge Was it a pride thing with Leo I dont know But he if he usually was going to block a shot anyways but I finally got him to take a charge but he wouldnt fall Never could fall Did other things Well Ill give you that Largest lead for Cal And the rebound lead took it away from his teammate John Camden Cals done a good job if you know one and done If you take a three on them they go out and they secure the defensive glass They got guys that are really pulling down rebounds Camden steps back and the rebound grabbed by KJ Garris Pass deflected right back to the Titans Joshua Ward Here is Carris Leans in left it short and the rebound Day Ames for Calons trying to get to the rim Not easy to do against Cal Jay Ames finds Chris Bell short on the three and the rebound Joshua Ward Final 145 at the half A nice move in the open floor again to the basket and a foul as Josh Ward was decked Well you see what Thorson can do in transition I mean they really come down with numbers They felt they could exploit Cal here Roxy And theyre getting down the floor and scoring Transition defense really important early in the year Your job is to get down with numbers You got to get down with more And easier said than done because the ball is either getting pushed by the pass or the or the dri cheering foul on Lee Dort as the free throw rattles out for Joshua Ward applause and cheering and Dort will sit with the two fouls as Milos Elage comes back for California Yeah good news for Cal You know Dort gets two You dont have to leave him in to get a third Theyve got some guys that can cheering step up and relieve him and play big down low Ward goes one for two He leads rather Landon Seaman leads Cal State Fullerton with eight Ward has seven and Day Ames leads all scorers for Cal with 13 Well if youre Fullerton youd love to get this thing down to single digits before half or at least trim it and theyve got to do a better job defensively Cals been really good Theyre in a little bit of a matchup zone right now Theyre going to switch out Now theyre going back Forcing the pass Deflected a steal Threeon two for the Titans Jaden Henderson attacks Picked up by Landon Seaman inside COUNT IT AND ONE OH how did he find that I mean that ball was bouncing around Watch the hands I mean the hands of Seaman on this play He just goes out and keeps it alive gathers it scores it and draws a foul Great play by Landon Seaman to finish that Heres that drive we were talking about They can cut this thing almost to to single digits here with a with another stop cheering first on day a one free throw and seaman left it short and the hustle from KJ Garris keeps it alive for the Titans Heres a three and missing everything was Jefferson Da Cruz Monro and it goes out of bounds to California Well Kales fortunate because thats usually a pretty good look from three Hes hes trying to measure his shot now go through the motions but that would have knocked this thing down to single digits with a miss Now you see uh Figen going back now matching up in the zone again They this defense caused a turnover against Cal Offensive rebound Milos Elich underneath powers his way back up plus one Yeah nothing fancy there Roxy you just simply get the ball to the rim and you just use your size and strength Shot by Bell Look at the offensive rebound and put back here draws the foul and the finish First on Jaden Henderson and the first trip to the foul line as a Cal Bear for Milos Elich Nice luxury if youre Mark Matson be able to go to your bench and bring this big fella off the bench to expel Lee Dort Transfer from Lyola Maryland gets the roll the native of Serbia And the lead back out to 15 matching the largest in the lane across the key and a wild shot for Jefferson De La Cruz Mongro can play for the last shot of the half Mark Madsons jumped up on that last play One shot fellas One shot and they can really get some momentum going to halftime Theyve already built this 15point lead up Another basket would be a little bit of a back breaker Day Ames out top Tough fall away shot and the rebound KJ Garris And thatll take us to halftime 4227 Cal at the half as the Golden Bears led by 13 from Ames John Candon with 11 And then Cal defensively holding Fullerton to one for 14 from three Now great defense You know when you play defense like that Roxy they can overcome some mistakes or maybe a cold shooting night And so the Bears are showing you their ability to get that lead They lead by 15 going to half 4227 California coming up our halftime report But a strong first half for the Golden Bears in Berkeley tonight against Cal State Fullerton Well Leon Wood be a champion Leon Wood went on to be a pretty darn good official Yeah In the NBA So so uh you know really its its great to see Theres been some tradition there and the schools still thriving So its its nice to see And they have a great coach in in Dedric Taylor I Look Im biased because hes been a friend for a long time and Ive known Dedric a huge fan of his Played at UC Davis then spent a lot of years as an assistant number of stops Arizona State with Herb Sync Nevada Davis and now in his 13th season the alltime winningest coach in Fullerton history And a good play coming out of halftime And it is a three for Davis White cheering Big time basket You know I you mentioned how good a friend of Dedrick Now Im wondering how Arizona State got all their plays You got to watch out here Rox I mean now Dedricks a good guy And I remember coaching against Arizona State He was a big part of their success Played for Bob Williams at UC Davis And the rebound pulled out Joshua Ward and a good start to the second half for Cal State Fullerton Ward cant get the roll in the three And here comes Justin Pippen back the other way Countering attacks Pippen to the basket Play it And thats what Justin Pippen does He gets by you and can finish at the basket Joshua Ward heel the rim Rebound John Camden Cal running Heres Pippen again in laughter transition Falling down and Cal State Fullerton brings it back Jefferson de la Cruz Mongro and a goend against Lee Dorf Give the hoop to Jefferson de la Cruz Monro Well heres a call Uh got Lee Dor thats just hovering around the basket Shot goes up and he goes he goes way above the rim but Justin Pivven got all the way to the basket Hes trying to draw the foul Used his right hand maybe uses his left or he might get the foul call I dont know But uh hes so good to the basket Hes quick Hes agile And hes pretty strong John Camden fires short on the three Joshua Ward the rebound for the Titans Transition Davis White at the arc Had a good look and the rebound Chris Bell for Cal Fullertons pretty cold from the perimeter now They could came out hit their first one Not now Missed three straight Two for 18 from three cheering tonight and not characteristic of the way they can shoot the ball and thats an improved aspect for Cal is defending the three which was a nightmare for Mark Madson last year Dort and a reaching foul committed by Cal State Fullerton but last year theres just over 360 division 1 college basketball teams Cal ranked 356th in the country defending the three last year the opponents hit 376 6 from threepoint range against Cal as Chris Bell missing a three and Bailey Nun brings it up for the Titans The first two games the opposition shooting 23 from three against Cal and Fullertons just two for 18 tonight Nice move on the reverse and the baseline Jefferson de la Cruz Monro Well you mentioned something Roxy and Mark Masterson spoke to this I mean he said Look we overheld last year We didnt stay home We didnt really play and then we you know we wed leave the ball help upstream which youre not supposed to do and they gave up some threes So theyre not doing that this year Theyre getting a lot of pressure on the ball out top but theyre then helping not from up Day Ames three Well he didnt get the memo about he he must think its now back to his time cuz hes shooting the ball with confidence The block Lee Dort Cal running Here comes Pippen Camden at the arc Backto back threes Yeah theyre going to need a timeout Roxy Fullerton because Cals on fire right now Largest lead of the night And Kendrick Deluna answers for Cal State Fullerton Well Cals playing very confidently from three Mark Madson said this team can shoot He was right Justin Pippen throws it away Here comes Davis White Duna down the lane right to the bucket Kendrick Duna Yeah Mark Matson not happy They had a nice lead Hit some big time threes and they just gave up two quick baskets Mark Mass the quick timeout to settle his team down But how about Cal How do they get that lead back Roxy Theyre knocking down shots with confidence I mean theyre blocking shots Theyre getting it off the glass And theyre very unselfish in transition They find people ESPN now app 12point lead for Cal Mark Matson taking a timeout to try to get his guys regrouped He didnt wait for that TV timeout Roxing as a coach youve got to do that Didnt like what he was seeing from his team on defensive transition Chris Bell in the corner and a step back three Its the side of the backboard and the rebound pulled down Here come the Titans Foul line jumper short from Landon Seaman He had a good look in the rebound count Thatll cut it to 10 if he knocks that shot Its pretty easy shot for him on the drive Day Ames Chris Bell gets this one to go Thats confidence Roxy He didnt like this last shot And what did he do He regrouped and shot it again Thats what good shooters do Thats shooters Next ones going down Yeah you got to believe that Ball fumbled away by the Titans recovered by Landon Seaman Up and under and a pretty move by Landon Seaman who leads Cal State Fullerton with 12 And thats twice hes just come up with loose balls The scramble and the finish Big time finish by Landon Seaman Better in play He was first team all pack west at Menllo College playing for the Oaks last year DNS has the crossover and the pullup jumper blocked by Joshua Ward Ward to the basket Ward lays it in Now wont look now button hanging around Roxy theyre just really doing what they can to get in this game hoping to get a a single digit lead maybe a two or three possession game back Down to 11 Day day a spinning off balance lead door to the offensive glass Thats a luxury when you can miss a shot and you got Lee Dor cleaning it up for you Landon Seaman Bakavville native A lot of family and friends here as a three missed but a foul as Seaman got knocked down and will stay at this He knows how to drain it Great job by Cal Mark Madson really opening up the floor for his team this year Thats great defense Way into the back court Run down by Jaden Henderson The Titans though are seven of 13 from the floor since halftime They got a short clock They got to get some pick something up before the clock goes out Jaden Henderson I dont think thats what he intended to do Well they only had 4 seconds left but I I agree Roxy Uh you know sometimes that clock you got a Novette coming out of the timeout and coming out really this way and uh they just didnt recognize it and by the time they did too late Now heres Fullerton back in the zone They had some success with this earlier Knocked away from Chris Bell And its off of Bell Yeah I thought he knocked it out Other one right through his legs his hand off his hands through his legs Uh the zones given Cal a little bit of a problem the last two or three possessions Just a little bit of a wrinkle Roxy And its you know its counterintuitive You think well why do you want to zone a team thats shooting it But makes other guys handle it Cals a team that really shoots well off of the rhythm bounce Jaden Henderson spinning in the key and kept alive by Fullerton KEEP MOVING GOOD DEFENSE BY CAL AND thats an offensive foul off the ball as Davis White knocked Reus Petritus to the deck Well not no surprise if you know Reus Petritus He finds ways to get possessions back for his team And he got hit He sold it Were going the other way Reus Petritus Nice pass by Petritus Reverse Nolan Dorseys first points of the night again Reus Petritus making plays for his team to find Dorsy for the two transfer from Campbell They got a mismatch if they can find it on top Shot clock at 10 Jaden Henderson the finger roll off the window Yeah they scored that late on the clock Thats a big time take playing pretty good defense Henderson who had 25 in the opener against Caltech who played last year at Concordia University Division 2 down in Irvine Day Ames in the corner Three Roxy hes lethal I mean hes showing you his ability to to carve up defenses whether by the dribble or by the dagger I mean thats thats from deep coffin corner 10 threes for Cal They had a combined 10 in the first two games and the largest lead of the night equals by Cal and a foul as Led Seaman on the offensive glass And the question is will they call it a controlled tip or is it just a common foul against Cal Meanwhile you got Dayday Ames Roxy Hes a man of the hour Cals doing a good job Theyre finding their sharpshooter in the corner and he knows gone before us Anoir McQueen Roxy talking about alums What a illustrious alumni in Anoir McQueen A winner two NCAA tournament sweet 16 cheering Got to love that Anoir is here and uh you know hes just one of the alltime greats at Cal He was on your first team here at Cal that went to the 316 Tough kid Roxy Played great defense just did a lot of things Smart player Reus Petritus down the lane to the bucket and couldnt get the shot to go And here come the Titans Davis White deflected diving for the loose ball NOLAN DORSY OUT OF BOUNDS OFF THE TITANS I think Nolan Dorsys fired up and well he hes a great great player Buck Manson loves this action I mean thats what Nolan Dorsey does Roxy he may be that toughest player on the Cal team and they got a lot of tough guys I mean but he Rita Petritis take your pick You got those guys playing on your team You got to love it Gets the possession for the Bears Theres Ames Justin Pippen fouled Well get two shots as he got Davis White in the air Thats just a smart play Heads up play by Justin Pippen Hes you know youre the son of an NBA player and legend He knows how to play He probably had to do that to get shots off against his dad because youre not going to score much on Scotty Pippen But Justin show or his brother and and Justin showing you the ability Roxy He can get to the line But you I want to go back just for a second I really like that Mark Matson has done and and made it open for the their alumni to come back I agree with with him Its so important to bring your alumni back and he understands that whether and hes a former alumni at at Stanford and I think Mike Montgomery his former alumni or just an alumni but hes a former player at Stanford Yeah Well you know hes hes been a nightmare for me through my coaching career but I I love that he recognizes that you go back and you bring your players back Landon Seaman the miss and the rebound Milos Ilich Yeah you cant be a former alumni And you are you are Pippen Well he got a block and hell get to the line Yeah he got the third on Davis White And the officials did a good job They kind of wanted to see if that was going to go down If it did maybe dont call a foul Thats an NBA kind of call But that was contact Theres no question that was contact And thats what Justin Pippen does I mean hes so heady He and Days give you the ability when your shot clock is winding down or when youre in the open floor they can get shots for themselves And if you guard two guys on them theyre going to find somebody One more for Pippen who had a good allaround game last Thursday against Wright State Was a tough opponent for Cal Yeah Pippen had 14 points nine rebounds four assists in that game Well hes very unselfish He could do a lot more scoring if he needed to but what he does he just gets his team in the flow I admire players that do that When they need him to score he will 10 points five rebounds five assists tonight for Pippen And Cal has ballooned the lead to 20 And its fumbled out of bounds by Cal State Fullerton Yeah Cal is speeding up Cal State for now Theyre saying it stays at this end And Mark Matsons going to challenge it So we have our first Mark Matson challenge Well this was out of the NBA Roxy because the NBA does this The players on the court who are closer to the action will dictate to the coach and the staff Hey coach you need to challenge us Were right here We saw this and you better be right By the way you know Dorsy knew he never touched it The previous play has been challenged by Cal Yeah So the new rule in college basketball you must have a timeout Yes And youre allowed one challenge per game If you get it right you keep the challenge If youre wrong you lose it but youre charged a timeout Well so youre 20 points up It might be a good time to to to gamble on something but I dont think this was a gamble Rox It looked pretty serious but music thats the new rule And so you do get penalized if if if you dont get it But I I think the Cal Bears were right there There is the play Theres he was nowhere near the ball I mean so yeah Jefferson de la Cruz Mongro just lost it out of bounds No And even Fullerton knew that they lost it cuz they were going the other way They just he knew it He put his head down and the ball on the floor has been overturned Yeah they got five judges on the team there Thats a correct challenge for Cal and they will retain their timeout and have one challenge remaining No NBAs got the monitors on the bench They can replay it and find out You dont have that luxury here and your challenge has to be instantane Yeah But they had all five guys saying Hey with the circling of the hand lets challenge that coach And Mark Madson trusted his players and he was rewarded It goes over to Cal Successful challenge Mark Madson now one for one Yeah And Cals had a good second half Theyve stepped it up now in the last few minutes Theyve really turned it up And by the way theyve done that since Mark Manson called that emotional angry timeout Coaches getting can get angry sometime He was hot Milos Elish slides into the basket and one for Elish Roxy Theres the assists going again Cal finding each other I mean they do such a good job Look at that left hand wheel pass by Ames I mean he just wrapped it around his defender inside to Elich who just finishes waits poise gets the foul and the call I mean their assist total is exploding so far compared to a year ago 10 nothing run for Milo Elich with six and hes got a fan club right behind him He could score at Lyola Maryland He put up 28 in the game playing for Loyola Mary Loyal Maryland I should say the second team all patriot performer there and a foul on Cal Well lets be honest Proxy Cals brought in a ton of newcomers Nine or 10 but guess what they have They may be newcomers but they have guys that have played college ball Virginia Delaware Vanderbilt Campbell Lyola Maryland I mean Air Force Those guys arent strangers to this game They are veterans He is approaching veterans Yeah I shot that Oh I knew that Dedra Taylor also has brought in seven transfers at seven freshman 14 new players on his roster And the transfer Landon Seaman leads them with 14 Yeah I love Landon Seaman and what he can do Hes Hes alone Hes tough And now an offensive foul on Cal And its a push off on Justin Pippen his third Yeah thats the right call No argument Justin you used it off hand but Landon Seaman has done some really good things this game And if youre Fullerton you can build on what hes done I mean hes just gone over the top of people Hes secured about two or three loose balls scrambles Hes very heavy He hasnt knocked down the shot which he can do but hes a guy that you can run offense through He is second in Menllo College history in scoring after a successful run down there The three way off from Christian Williams Lee Dort fouled by Landon Seaman Well Lee Dort didnt hesitate Roxy He said Im getting to the rim Youre not stopping me And they had to with the foul Actually they called a foul on Jefferson de la Cruz Monro and a second on the native of Lasal Quebec Well heres the two shots for Dort and heres the good news about Cal You know they were shooting just a blistering pace to start the game Cooled off a little bit but if their shots not falling Roxy Pals shown you their ability to do two things One post up get it on the block and score or take it off the dribble and draw fouls to the basket Theyve done that every game this year Lets get what we got Leads or hits both Cal knocking down their free throws tonight They are 15 of 17 from the line Have made all seven here in the second half Yeah its one thing to get there its another to knock them down Theyre doing it Too strong to the three from Jefferson and de la Cruz Monro Tippen step back day a threey Roxy stop it stop it thats just really a a filthy step back drain it in your face shot by day 152 run for Cal the block shot Petritis Dorsy had a good look at the three Reus Petrus in the offensive glass Pippen down the lane and a foul will get Justin Pippen to the line Well Day Roxy I mean hes a problem if youre playing on the opposing team He gets you on skates He pulls it back and says Where are you going Im about to put three right here Look at this step back Allah hard Thats a hard J Thats a hard move right there Somebody we know about that used to come in here and put some points up on the board Dra Taylor coached him Absolutely And thats why I mentioned it I mean holy smoke did he have a game even back in college But data AMS is showing us something Roxy And Im impressed with his game because he plays at different speeds He doesnt play the same speed Getting a muchdeserved rest right now Uh Cals depth has been impressive thus far this season And they again were talking about theyre still missing guys applause If it goes one for two hes got 11 There still no Dewan Campbell Yeah Simitri Carr is still out Hoping to get them back any day now And they could use some depth in the back court heading to Manhattan Kansas taking on Kansas State later this weekend A little apple Well first on Nolan Dorsy Yeah thats going to be a test But you dont worry about that game Rox You get these games under your belt You build some momentum Three games under your belt Thats going to help you And Jerome Tang has a very talented team at Kansas State Well theres no question But you want to bring your habits and your confidence in And I think Cal has done done that Theyve built up confidence They built their defense up and theyre a team thats not going to depend on one guy as they did a little bit last year with some really solid scores Mark Manson has said this in his preseason media day Hes talked to us at practice He just likes in his coaching staff their balance One more for Bryce Koffield Won a state title last year at Sierra Canyon and it rattles out Lee Dort pulls it down Its been a rough second half and a rough run recently for the Titans 162 run for Cal Fouled and Pippen will head back to the free throw line How about the presence of mind by Justin Pippen That was again a pro move as soon as he anticipates contact He makes no mistake Hes up Look at that He takes the dribble and starts going up music knowing that now the new rule is that youre youre gathering in motion Theyre giving you that shot So he takes advantage of it Fourth on Bryce Koffield Petty move and it rolls in for Justin Pippen Im down here Two Two Excuse me Two Two Three Bears in double figures Ames 22 Camden 14 And Pippen will have one more shot Hes got 13 now Very comfortable with the line Not only Justin Dippers theyre really feeling it there Just shooting with great conditions And a 30point lead for California Yeah that happened fast Roxy it was only a 15point lead just a while ago Actually almost a 10 point 11point lead not nine straight and a 192 run to open this 30point lead Last touch by John Camden and hell stay with Cal State Fullerton 745 to go and Cal running away for the Titans You like Day Ames Roxy You got to like what hes done I mean he gets you there Wait music now you see me now you dont Im going to step back Held off Lon Krueger is fighting Ali You saw the line 34 for Kan Garris who went 17 for 17 from the line Ed Gray at 30 and truly just a phenomenal night of basketball at Harman Yeah I think whoever had the ball last was No in that game Roxy it was a tremendous tremendous game Shot clock violation But I do remember that game I I said I dont know how were going to stop Garris And he was that No And we talked to his son who said I I dont know I dont know if I should believe this I said It happened I was here And I gave him the box score from that game as you look at the game summary for our game tonight Yeah And right now Cal on a 192 run to push the lead out to 30 Well now that was an alltime one of the alltime great gyms played in those gyms And that was a team that you guided to the Sweet 16 And that Illinois team went to the second round of the NCA tournament They beat USC in the first round before the Ali were stunned by Chattanooga Deep three from Pippen and the rebound and Bailey Nun watched it sail into the bench No they they that was an outstanding team but Lon Krueger great coach but uh Jerry Hester was on No they were they were talented Ed Dre I remember Shawn Marx had a tremendous game for us Michael Stewart had a good game Yeah we we needed everybody cuz that thing was going down to the wire and went into two overtimes 8988 as a foul off the ball on Fullerton Well you know its interesting Roxy Its so great now to see some of the players that we coach against and I coach against and there and now their sons who are playing and great young man by the way Kiwans watching us play I mean your sons a great kid but you got to you got to sell him now He doesnt believe that hell He didnt believe it Were telling him No I said listening about believe was the real deal And his moms the real deal also Shes a tremendous singer Absolutely RB is alive over the top ofen who has 16 KJ Garriss mom Selena Johnson Yeah theyre from I think Thornton back in Illinois We used to play some of their teams back when I went to high school I mean just a great area Great great story Kendrick Deluna up and under missed at the rim Last touch by Cal And well stay at this end with Titans basketball Well lets lets talk about Justin Pippen Roxy and what hes been able to do I mean hes so good with the basketball but he finds guys Hes really unselfish He could have drove drove the ball and scored Instead he feel he he feeds John Canman for an easy one And thats a foul on Chris Bell And and thats the kind of play theyre going to have to have Roxy youre going to get on the road in a minute Youre going to go play a tough team hostile environment uh you know really well coached team with talent and now youre going to have to rely on your unselfishness and your team play Come back with a W Off the inbound Welldesigned play and a three for Joshua Ward A big time play Joshua Ward showing you some things today Hes you know you get the feeling that if Fton can shoot the ball a little better which they will as year goes on theyre going to be tough Tough team to play against John Camden launching too strong on the three And here come the Titans and Ward That was a good challenge Carris down the lane Had it stripped and saved by Pippen Cal controls Chris Bell on the baseline A pretty move applause but his ability to shoot the three set that drive up cuz you have to guard him at the threepoint line And he just blew by his defender 80 to 49 Stripped by Justin cheering Pippen Knocked away from behind but Dames recovers Camden and Bell on the weak side and the rebound falls to the shortest guy on the floor Bailey Nun for the Titans who run and Lee Dort takes a hard fall and its cleaned up by Kendrick Deluna And Dort awkwardly went down but appears to be okay Now that was a good block Im glad the big fella is up and around cuz he smacked that ball back Its a long way to fall Got to love Justin Pippen and what hes been able to do But look at that Here it is Theres that hands for Pippen Keep keeping the ball alive giving Cal Bears yet another possession in transition But look he just got quick hands I mean thats just thats tough to play against arena in that town Its its not an easy trip So Cals going to have to you know continue their winning ways their winning attitude their chemistry but their unselfishness has really been a trademark of this team And and theyre a much improved defensive team as well Heres Chris Bell up one foot Got his own miss and put it back in Double figures for Bell now with 11 Yeah hes mad at himself for missing the first one but you know what Then then he just goes out and he plays But heres a the lineup is coming up for the Cal Bears Cal State Fullerton goes inside Atlanta and Landon Seaman with 16 Yeah have some teams on their schedule coming up Pippet throws up a wild shot looking for a call And here comes Bailey Nun for the Titans Heres Seaman at the top and he rattles in a three Well you knew he could hit that shot He had not knocked that shot down but he can do that And when he starts doing that for his team he gives his team a lift Makes it a lot tougher to defend Day Ames with the weave out top Had it stripped and its off of Bailey Nun and it belongs to California Final 332 and Cal with a terrific offensive performance tonight with Virginia He had 27 against pit in the second half Cal led by as many as 31 or rather 32 tonight and right now the lead 26 Well theyre going to keep their starters in just a little bit longer I think they dont they want to you know keep that rhythm They you know they want guys to play together because theyre going to need to be able to keep that chemistry going So I you know but youll end up seeing the bench emptied in a minute but theyre going to continue to play for for short period and a timeout in danger of a 5second call and a 30 taken by Cal 30sec timeout and keep the possession Mark Madson and Cal and Golden Bears went handily against Bakersfield were tested in game two by Wright State pesky team out of the Horizon League The Raiders hung in there with Cal before finally Cal put him away And tonight a Fullerton team Look Keith Taylors trying to figure out what hes got Hes got 14 new players only one player back from the year ago And they won handily against an overmatched team in their opener at Caltech But then they went to Laramie Wyoming and they played well against a solid team in Wyoming and maybe hit a wall at the end when youre playing at over 7000 ft altitude Yeah And you know again hes got some new guys His system will take over Uh but lets be honest theyre playing against Cal now And Cals playing well They you know this is a good Cal team thats playing improved defense Theyve got balance Theyve got theyve got parody on their team where theyve got different scores and theyve got size and so uh this is a different level Its a step up for Fullerton to play here Cal in their home gym where theyve had success and against this group These are veteran players Rock we talk about Cals newcomers Theyre not freshman These are these are veteran guys One more for Chris Bell And Cal who has knocked him down from the line again tonight And the Golden Bears 21 of 24 for the strike Yeah every player on the four count now has previous college for thats pretty impressive Corner three strong from Joshua Ward and kept alive Here is Jefferson de la Cruz Monro and hes off on the three and it just will not fall for the Titans tonight They are four for 26 from three Day Ames up the floor Ames foul will shoot two And again thats part of the new rule the continuation the freedom of movement in college basketball where last year that may have been a foul on the floor where no opportunity for an and one He missed the shot Hell still get two free throws but one of the changes to the rules in college basketball Well and thats going to help Cal because theyve got a couple of guys that can take that rule and and really uh Im going to say abuse it if they have to Theyre theyre going to make take advantage of it and theyre going to get there uh to the line pretty much at will Its hard to contain hardest thing in college basketball contain the ball oneonone If you give these guards to Cal oneonone capabilities with no help these guys will get to the rim and draw fouls One more for Ames and a young sees it high for Days And theres Ames called for the foul That is the seventh and a one and one for Bailey Nun None a transfer from Sacramento State Played two years there Last year he led the Hornets in assists and the Aussie as Dedra Taylor brought him in to cheering be a leader on the floor for Cal State Fullerton And one more for none Well this game will help Fullerton Roxy Youre playing against a Cal and I say a veteran team because they are and this game will end up helping you cheering You got to get tested early find out a little bit about your team and you know what did they do well and what are the things they need to improve on So I think you play these games and and you dont look at the score you look at your experience They had a rough year last year at Cal State Fullerton But Dedric Taylor won 20 plus in two of the previous three years and again two NCA tournaments for Dedric at Cal State Fullerton which is not an easy place these days because of the way the landscape is set up in college sports to have some success and Dedra Taylor has had some success Yeah And you know what I commend is that you stay with coaches that have done that You dont wait till theyve had one year bad year maybe and now are we going to make a change I I think coaches dont get dumb overnight Roxy I mean hes got hes a guy thats smart Hes shown you the ability to build his team and hell do it again Chris Bell Shot clock winding down and Bell will get to the line And theres another guy Ro we havent talked enough about Chris Bell Youre 67 and you can knock down threes proficiently So you got to get out to Chris Bell but hes got the ability to sweep you and drive I mean hes quick Look at the step Hes gathers He goes through and he draws a foul I mean hes rangy Hes very clever player Local product right down the road Three years at Dasal Finished up high school ball at Wasach Academy in Utah Then three years at Syracuse for Chris Bell is back home Conquered native One more as first appearance tonight for Montas Kachanis a sophomore from Lithuania the transfer from FAU another veteran and it rolls in for Bell back to a 30point game Nice pass inside Reverse and cheering Landon Seaman will go to the free throw line Here we go Here we go Cal State Full theyll be at home Saturday Pacific And one of your former players Shante Leg the head coach of Portland Theyre involved in a tournament Also play St Thomas at Northern Colorado And Pepperdine Orange and Blue against Orange and Blue Yeah thats somebodys got to go down No its its you know you look around Roxy and you look at the WCC and the Big West theres some Santa Clara had a huge failure today Im just going to say I mean these leagues are getting tougher and tougher I mean they really are We had Big Sky the other day Two two teams there I mean theyre getting better and better Every team every league one of those secret closed door scrimmages Cal played Santa Clar and won down at Santa CL Secret not anymore Yeah the block by Pippet and he was out of bounds It goes right back to the Titans Yeah here it is I mean gets to the rim and wow So a minute 47 to go and Mark Matson hasnt emptied the bench No its a little concerning because I always worried late game Roxy youre up 30 and you dont want anything to happen to your starters I think maybe in this Here they come He must have heard you Uh I think they there the whispers somebody was called and uh they might even take a timeout here Lets see And delay in the first points tonight for Montas coaches Yeah they might take the time out the other way Lets see And Pip in the rebound Jerry says Slow it down And theyre going to just walk it cheering Goes left it behind Drop step and the lay in applause and cheering 9259 and then coach miss the rebound Yeah heres a timeout Heres a timeout Thats smart play Get these guys in because they wouldnt get in But Mark Matson will get some subs Dak Muel Duke checking in PJ Fischer coming in And the same Luke Butler coaches makes the appearance inside Well they still got some guys on the floor Roxy that that are still formidable players And a foul And Davis White is fouled out And Cal will go back to the line and its Reus Petritus Well I just got word not that its a surprise Roxy that Day Ames will be joining us for a postgame interview Great to talk to him after a tremendous another tremendous performance The first one knocked down by Petritus who has five tonight I always thought you announce that players are coming over because I think people want to hear from players too Not just you and me A rebound grabbed by cheering Ben Winker in the game The freshman from St Louis Here is Garris open and a three for KJ Garris Oh Garris hitting a shot in this gym Weve seen that You didnt defend him either No Wait a minute Im at the booth here Put this one on me and I
