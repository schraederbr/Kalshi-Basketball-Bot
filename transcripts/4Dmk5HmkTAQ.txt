season of course low was fantastic in the final closing moments of the win on Saturday for pit down in blackburg at Virginia Tech and after 22 days between home games for the pit Panthers they are back in front of the zoo and ready to continue their season starting off with an eight and2 record through 10 games here in the 20242 campaign and Zack Austin hoists a three to start things off for the Panthers he makes his second start of the Season here tonight hes been big Off the Bench providing a spark for the Panthers but injury to Damen Dunn moves Austin into the starting five over the last couple games and a threepoint Miss on the other side as we introduce you to the rest of the panther starting five low legged Corin and guo Diaz Graham have been regulars all year in the starting Applause Music five so right away we get a look at that good point guard match up between low and Kimble low crafty pass to the corner Diaz Graham not there and for the colonels mentioned Kimble joined by Jordan Crawford and Meer wall those two both came from College of Charleston to EKU this season Devonte Blandon is their leading scorer and kol martinov hes down low the sevenfooter were the Eastern Kentucky Colonels led by aw Hamilton in his seventh season at the Helm of the EKU program and AR ason Coach of the Year honors last year they won the regular season in the conference and you know down in Kentucky Churchill Downs they have the most exciting two minutes in sports of course a Kentucky Derby but aw Hamilton when he got to EKU he said that program needed some new energy so their Mantra is that they are the most exciting 40 minutes in sportsy their goal is to lead the country in scoring threepointers assist steals Force some turnovers and make the game exciting yeah man its going to be an exciting game if theyre able to do what theyre knowing to do so lets see how it goes and by the way the colonels are second in the country in offensive boards this season still waiting for our first bucket here tonight y Modz Graham throws it away and quickly the other way now its Music Crawford he takes a pull up hits it to start the scoring we know theyre an exciting team so we have to make sure that you know monitoring that Crawford the red shirt sophomore from Charlotte North Carolina hes averaging 93 on the Applause season and offensive foul here goes against the Panthers its Jaylen low Jeff cable leading a pit team thats currently number 16 in the net rankings seventh year for him as head coach and Nelly Ive told you before that Jeff cable looks at the turnaround of this program and points to your season in 2022 and 23 when you guys made the tournament 100 I think we had a a big part to do with setting the foundation for the program and the culture here and Im just glad to be a part of that and Im hoping these guys can continue it and its fun when you make the One Shining Moment video too lovely its amazing man for sure and you were watching that live I was watching it live when it happened I was acting it and hoping it for it for sure well it was overdue you should have gotten it in your time at Co 100 theres Jaylen low who picked up two early fouls but two and a half minutes in Panthers are without their star point guard and Jeff cable goes to a guy named Brandon Cummings Off the Bench to fill a spot you know him uh I may know him Im not sure but yeah jayen low picking up two fouls early is not ideal for pit but its something that we have to learn to when the game flows you have to sometimes just continue to make it work Panthers still looking for their first points of the night and theyll have to do it without Jaylen low but Brandon Cummings of course youre younger brother and while you didnt get to play with him at pit how cool is it for you to watch what hes done in the blue and gold yeah man its amazing man its really a surreal experience to watch your younger brother do what you just did you know so Im hoping he can take it even further than I did you probably cant even count the amount of games you two came here as kids huh oh couldnt count it was a regular occurrence for us Austin drives and cant hit on the runner rebound hauled in by Applause martinov Kimble drives and kicks Crawford he had the first bucket of the night this time stops on a dime and misses the short jump for Rebound goes to GE Modz Graham he leads the Panthers in board on the Applause season Cummings nice take on the reverse he draws the foul and hes been doing a good job throughout this season of getting to the basket now hes got a chance to score the first Panther points of the night yeah man you seeing his patience in the ball screen right there is what allowed him to turn the corner and able to get to the free throw line so now he has to convert them to take the lead off the basket now coach capable has said you and him even though your brothers very different type of players what differences do you see uh one hes a little taller than me so hes able to go dunk on you thats something that if you watch me play you know Im not going to dunk the ball on you so besides that I would say were not too much different you know thats my little brother and I think he would say pretty much the same thing do you ever have to sneakily lower the hoop in the driveway on get some duns off of Applause course very athletic Brandon Cummings and just a freshman only 10 games into his col career Panther fans excited to see what hes going to bring throughout his career heres a drive from Blandon draws a foul hits the bucket and the leading scorer for the colonels has his first field goal and blon in the post right here working this is what he does so we have to contain him in order to stop him G the free throw line every time thats what he does hes averaging 16 points this year has spent all five of his college Seasons at Eastern Kentucky has the fifth most points in his career in eastern Kentuckys program history and aw Hamilton talked about how they believed in him out of high school and not a ton of programs did and its paid off and because of that Blandon has felt the loyalty to stay at Eastern Kentucky dont always see that in college hoops these days players sticking around with their program for 5 years as Brandon Cummings heating up and quick five points for him to even things up at 5 and he must know that his brothers in the commentary seat tonight because hes off to a hot start H hes trying to give me something to talk about I see he doesnt want any part of you giving him a hard time about this he knows I Music will All Right Nelly you said you used to commentate his plays in the driveway Ill let you do it right here Brandon Cummings here with the ball clock going down one dribble boom thats what he does man see the celebration he knows whats going in got to continue to do this Music man well we told you about Eastern kys motto the most exciting 40 minutes in sports theyve got it on their warmup shirts here tonight Nelly and already you can start to see that straty start to take effect they forced two turnovers against the Panthers so far and you see the numbers of what theyve done on the Year aw Hamiltons team likes to spice things up and make it interesting out there and as you can see now theyre pressured all the way up the court so as guards you have to be protecting the ball in this game this is a game where guards have to be guards and you have to make sure you protect the ball and the colonels a 54 record on the season but they havent lost any games by more than 13 points that includes a road game at Clemson when they were up four by about 12 minutes to go against the Tigers so this is a team that knows how to battle even against tough opponents and they are familiar because of that Clemson game playing in an ACC venue they get the tip in and the colonels have a twopoint lead we got to settle down now let the pressure get to us there Brandon Cummings so far the only nonstarter in the game for the Panthers and he has been making things happen since he entered for Jaylen low just about a minute and a half in as Cummings is going to head to the line again and now he hes the only guy that has scored for the Panthers so far yeah like you said man I think he knows Im over here and he must be playing to that because hes definitely playing solid right now hes attacking and hes very aggressive thats what hes going to have to do with JLo with two fouls and cmings one of the few bright spots obviously that game a week ago at Mississippi state was not one that Panther fans want to remember lost by 33 in that game but Brandon Cummings had 12 points and so you can already start to see him coming along getting comfortable with the col for sure I think hes just a fighter you know hes going to continue to get better every single game every year hes going to continue to grow and thats what he has to continue focusing on Cummings goes one of two from the line there just over five minutes in Colonels with the onepoint advantage Turner butry into the game for Eastern Kentucky hes number zero defended by Cummings now heres a handoff this is Blandon working on Austin Corin switches on good defense here by the Panthers pull up jumper off Target and a good offensive rebounding team but but that time the Panthers come up with it its going to have to be an emphasis all game leot spins and has it taken away by Kimo Cummings hustles back on D they dump it out to wall no numbers for EKU Kimo loses a handle drives hangs and Music hits this is the way they like to play Up Up Tempo causing turnovers is what they want full court press here from Eastern Kentucky Kimble gets his first points of the night and a really good twoway player yeah really athletic finish there not much you can do about that thats this is what these guys do when we asked aw Hamilton about him at shoot around today he started by talking about his defense Kimble averaging 27 steals per game thats 12th in the country Hamilton said he sits down with Kimble and they watch film of all of his Steals and the discipline that he has defens ly when hes able to get each of those steals but hes been great on offense this year as well showcasing that early in now enel delich into the game quickly draws a foul for pit Kimbell has started all nine games this year for Eastern Kentucky also leads the team with 41 assist per game on the year and he takes a rest here just about seven minutes into the first half now Cummings a three got another one Brandon Cummings with all nine to start the night for the Panthers hes really playing really really well right now he got to continue it because he needs to ride bring the energy of everybody else up with him as you can Applause see great pass by is Leed thats a difficult shot right there Cummings averaging 52 per game on the season his career high was the 12 he got at Mississippi State hes already got nine for the Panthers tonight Blandon on the wing missfires Austin jumps up and gets the Applause rebound I thought he was going to pull up there and try and get another one you should have Austin kicks out Cummings is hot step back three hes hot man look out huh oh man quickly turning into the Brandon Cummings game huh ell yeah were getting a chance to see what Brandon can bring to the table man of course this isnt anything new for you huh you seen this many a time Im just glad everybody else getting a chance to see it man it is 129 pit in all 12 points if youre just joining us have been scored by my partners younger brother Brandon Cummings and leg is on the board as well he gets the end Applause Music one its an 80 Run for the pit Panthers propelled by The Freshman Brandon Cummings 12 early points hasnt missed a shot from the floor to lead the Panthers and dad is loving in in the feet all Music right promise this isnt a Hollywood script though it sure feels like one because in Nelly Cummings debut at the TV table Brandon Cummings has 12 points in 8 minutes its amazing for him to be doing this for sure it makes my job a lot easier on my first day to have my brother having a performance like this I mean 8 minutes in to have your career high is pretty spectacular but as if you know my brother if you know us hes not done yet so guys get your popcorn ready Jaylen low picked up two early fouls and Brandon Cummings has been his backup at the point guard spot all season long so naturally he comes in Off the Bench and by the way his career high has already been matched we talked during the break that was in that game at Mississippi State a week ago and good to see your mom Nelly on here to experience it as well great to see shes happy thats what we both do it for Eastern Kentucky ends a N9 nothing pit run there delich nice cross over to shake banon and a finish with the left nice left hand finish there off of the contact weve seen him do that before that was a really nice Applause take whats been impressive about him Nelly you knew he was a good threepoint shooter but lately hes showing that he can take it to the basket as well I think a lot of guys in that threepoint but shooting roll have to show versatility and hes showing Applause that Crawford gets another one Maks its 17713 hes got five on the night early for the colonels leg it breezes by the defender and finishes thats what is does really well when hes downhill hes a threat everybody in the ACC must be ready for him when hes downhill now after a bit of a cold start from the floor the Panthers have now made their last six and getting this sixpoint lead and drive there and a bump by delich Andrews drew the foul for Eastern Kentucky ish putting the speed on display here and hes so strong So Physical once he gets downhill theres nothing you can do two points going other way every time they get Five Points two for three from the floor through 10 minutes here and jayen low has reentered but Cummings stays on the floor off to a great start leit and Corin check out for the moment offensive Rebound in the put back there for the colonels this is a team who priz themselves in offensive rebounding so thats what they looking to do so low comes back in he takes over the point guard duties but one of the great things about Brandon incomings hes a combo guy can play the one or the two back door cut Austin oh what a reverse slam from Za what a dunk right there man thats something you cant teach right there man you cant teach that he dunked on him backwards that dude can get up huh you just cant teach that you cant work on that you wont find many more athletic guys in college oops and Zack Austin definitely wont five on the timer Kimble Hoy from three KN it hes averaging 14 points coming to this game shooting 35 from the three so they have to be aware of him for sure yeah its hard to believe that guy was at the D2 level last year hes a really really talented player nice Pass Austin bullseye on the three another good shot from Zach great pass from JLo there he got downhill and was able to draw the whole defense thats why Zach got that open shot Jeff kaful talking early with us in the season about how he wanted to see Zack Austins offense on display a little bit more have seen spurts of it last season that pit but over the last few games really starting to turn it on of course there was the buzzer beater in overtime in Columbus to give the Panthers a huge Road win at Ohio State and across the last few games now the Austins offense has been a factor in addition to his great defense 100 when someone goes down as important as Damen done other guys around him must step up and Zacks been doing that the last few games and we need him to do that low deep three swirls out and rebound hauled in by Applause Myck Crawford from way downtown off the heel delich trans transition no numbers for the Panthers hell slow things Applause down low drives and kicks delich thought about it drives and he draws the foul at the 743 Mark in the first half 2421 is the Panther Lee Brandon cmings leading all scores with 12 but the offense has come alive Zack Austin with the reverse Jam Jaylen low getting involved as well on the feed to Austin for the Triple the Panthers lead by three but George Kimbell thei has eight for the Music colonels now Zach Austin youve heard about his defense he had 15 blocks through the first five games of the season but the offense really starting to pick up thats continued into tonight here in Nelly and hes really proven that he can obviously get to the rim he has some athleticism but he can shoot the three ball as well oh yeah hes shooting 46 from three when other team Scout us he has to be at the top of their Scout for threepoint shooting so hes a very very big threat and he has to continue to do that for us to be to be a good team now you were in Columbus when he hit that shot oh its crazy shot man what was going through your head when he put it up I knew once he released it it was going in did you so I was just excited that the time was on o00 and I knew that we were going to win the game then well you were a point guard so youve got that extra level of vision that not everybody has yeah I see it from a different perspective for Applause sure thanks for joining us Peterson EV Center Jason a row with Nelly Cummings threepoint game here in the first half Brandon Cummings scored the first 12 points of the night for the Panthers and well now he gets a much deserved rest Eastern Kentucky has been pressuring full court for just about the entirety of the Applause game and martinov travel you saw it right away yeah I was a Trav right away man good call by the refs there great crew here tonight Bert Smith Ted Valentine Clare Aubrey Music and you said you had a good relationship with t Valentine huh yeah man hes hes refed me a lot of games and I always try to have a good relationship with the people reing me because I know he can Tech you up really fast so you know I dont want to be on that end of you got to stay on his good side got to and Corin not both going up in the paint for it finds Cummings floater is good 14 for the freshman Clips his career high before the first half and what a day you have that on the bingo card for tonight must have man have yourself a day Cummings knocked to the ground on his way up for the rebound as well and the three is good for Kimble he is leading all scores for the colonels with 11 so a great guard matchup developing with two excellent displays on the offensive side Kimo with 11 for Eastern Kentucky and cummings with 14 for Kimo is playing really well man hes keeping these guys in the game ring at the alley to Coran they have a really good connection we see that a lot often times in these games offense looking really good on both sides Panthers shooting 59 44 from three Eastern Kentucky is 50 from three wall working on Diaz Graham into the lane looking for a feed but couldnt find one and hes up and Applause Music down George Kimbell II hes trying to match what your brothers doing tonight yeah hes definitely having a amazing performance so far hes making a lot of Applause shots Corin provides a great offensive element for this team Nelly and it seems like low and Leed have developed a fast chemistry within 100 when you have a big man whos willing to dunk the ball for you and give you some easy assists you must pay him back by throwing the ball to Applause him foren averaging just over ten a game on the season Florida State transfer low hesitates drives kicks three in the air too strong from Diaz Graham its a good look for him hes going to have to start making some of those its a good Applause look Diaz Graham 0 for three from the floor early and Miss on the other end for EKU leg it behind the back razzled Dazzle and couldnt complete the good hustle its a good shot as well nice move there foot was on the line yeah would have been two he didnt want that anyway so a fourpoint gain just under 5 minutes in and Nelly This is not too surprising for you and I we were talking before the game Eastern kys a good basketball team and with that most exciting 40 minutes kind of Mantra that they take on you knew they were going to battle in this game and not make things easy for for sure theyre a really good team a very well coached team as well you know so you have teams like that theyre not going to be easy team to just walk through but the Panthers with an exciting brand here as well they just moved real quickly down the court to respond low on the feed to Le it 3026 is the Panther lead with about 4 and 1 half to play in the first half two coaches tonight each in their seventh season at their respective schools and they both want this game here in December well most exciting 40 minutes in sports that has to apply on the offensive and the defensive sides for Eastern Kentucky cuz take a look here they get the basket thats fantastic but look at the Panthers capitalizing inbound to low low quickly the other way to leg it with what 5 Seconds off the shot clock thats as you can see its clearly unacceptable for head coach Hamilton and hes fired up about this this play because a team who prides himself on defense you cannot allow something like that to happen so I love his passion and feels like a good time to note that Hamilton played at hardgrave Military Academy thats one of the top prep programs in the country and he played for Kevin Keats he has a great relationship with Coach Keats who of course went NC State all the way to the final four a season ago took a team that wasnt going to make the NCAA tournament and then gave him an automatic bid a run to the final four as Corin gets the denial but Hamilton is a tough coach and so he was certainly not going to accept the transition basket there from the Panthers but how about the athleticism from Corin here now Big Time block right there man Big Time block you need your big man to be protecting the hoop like that Ste oh oh yeah they get going up for it battling against Crawford and oh thats theyre going to call the foul on Ley Jeff cable is outraged he thinks it should have gone against Crawford Claire Aubrey made the call on that far side as you can see the crowd doesnt like that call much lets get one more look here so seems like one of those where the player who hits the deck gets the call it didnt necessarily look like legot got much body there but what do you think I think like you just said whoever hit the floor first was going to get that call so uh its just happen to be on the bad side of it and Crawford responds with a three Crawford is up to 10 points and now something to watch here ishma leg in jayen low each with two fouls which once again makes it even bigger that the Panthers have gotten such great production from Brandon Cummings early with his 14 points leg it the turnaround jumper yes that was a very good patience right there by Applause Ish nine points for legot him and cummings have been extra efficient here tonight 8 for 11 from the field combined for the Panther guards leit in cmings Ste delich the interception transition game for pit delich spins tries to hand it off to leot but lost control this is Eastern kuy type of game right here scramble on the floor for it and it ends up with Crawford this is what they like right here want be surprised we see a three wall too strong offensive Rebound martinov in the put back and you are exactly right this is their type of game they love whats going on right now offensive rebounds and turnovers thats what they do six offensive boards tonight for the colonels in 14 Second Chance points Corin spinning on martinov looking for an option cant get it to go and the rebound hauled in by Applause butre Eastern Kentucky a chance to take the lead for the first time since it was 9 to6 about 6 minutes into the Music Applause contest delich guarding wall seven on the timer screen from martinov Crawford uses it step back three bench it home tough shot like we were saying this this is their type of game we have to slow the ball down and control the game Jordan Crawford and George Kimble with a combined 24 for EKU theyve got a twopoint lead late first half Austin short Corner J rles out rebound collected by wall its an important stop here for Applause pit tight defense from Cummings poked it away gets on the floor and a foul called against Eastern Kentucky Brandon Cummings hes doing a little bit of everything tonight Big Time play right Music there great deflection there by Brandon and thats the Pittsburgh toughness theres a coin thing here in Pittsburgh if youre not tough you cannot play for Pittsburgh thats what we do here and as you can see thats going to help change the game pick Nelly you and your brother grew up watching this program during its greatest years and you told me when you came back you were on a mission to bring this program back to the NCAA tournament make it great again and you see the same mentality in your brother on plays like that he is out there with a mission to make pit basketball great and get to the NCA tournament 100 like like you just said that was a mission of both of ours I mean I was able to get us back to the tournament but last year we didnt get there so the same opportunity now presents itself and they have to have full control over this their Destiny this year leave no doubt its been their slogan all year so they have to continue to do that and a very fitting slogan for the Panthers after they were revealed as one of the first four teams out of the field a season ago declined the NIT invitation use the off season to build up that roster and its paid off with a great start here year seven for Jeff cable but down one to Eastern Kentucky here at home Applause good athletic rebound by Austin and a foul called against the colonels its myar wall and thats going to be the second on the Eastern Kentucky forward wall one one opportunity here for Zack Austin I believe he has to convert these lets get get the lead back Zack Austin impacting the game in a variety of ways so far give him six points now one for two from threepoint range Ishmael leet and Jaylen low on the bench Jeff Cel does not want them to pick up a third foul with under a minute to go first half as the Panthers regain the lead this is a big finish for the pit Panthers here they must get some stops and Kimble out of bounds Brandon cumins making sure Ted Valentine knows and now pit forces the turnover and gets possession back this is another important possession here for pit full court press stays on for the colonels and why not its worked forcing seven pit turnovers in the first half shakes the defender and gets a bucket to drop Brandon Cummings with 17 first half points and hes doing everything he can for this pit team a career high for Cummings achieved just about 10 minutes into the Ball Applause Game 4 second difference shot and game clock its Cummings defending Kimble now Blandon gets past Austin and gets the floater to go one last run for Pit Austin foul puts the shot up and draws the foul coach Hamilton wont be happy about that play for sure got to be more disciplined than the foul with one second left now the question is if Hamilton is mad at his player or at the official because I think he was saying that was not a foul on Kimble you see the reaction from Kimble in that replay he did not think it was a foul but nonetheless Austins at the free throw line and hes got a chance to extend the Panther lead to three here with 1 second left in the first half so Bert Smith Ted Valentine going to have one more look not quite sure if could be checking time could be checking who the foul was on here and were hearing from our producer Tristan Russell that theyre taking a look as to whether it was a two or a three seemed pretty clear to me that it was a two but lets take one more look maybe something we didnt see there and yeah see that left foot inside the perimeter there and gets twisted around and upon review I think we can see Zachs Jersey pretty muffed up so it appeared to be a foul as well yeah okay so now were hearing that they were looking at whether it was on the floor or a shooting foul so Eastern Kentucky has nine fouls in the half so an important distinction there if it was on the floor it be a one and one for Austin but because he was taking the shot itll be two for Austin at the line and he makes the first Zach Austin 82 from the line on the season has done a really nice job and he is up to eight points in this first Music Applause half one last heave for the colonels and Kimo got the three off but didnt get it to go 3936 is the pit lead at the half and Nelly theres no other way to say this is the Brandon Cummings game so far this is the Brandon Cummings game so far we finally have gotten what the fans have asked for you know Brandon has come out here on the season started every game averaging 143 points on the year and this is his sixth consecutive game into double figures really impressive showing through the first 20 minutes for George Kimbell theii here tonight the sophomore from Tampa Florida and of course we showed you the guard matchup in the open between low and Kimble low shut out so far that might change in a second and it sure does first basket of the night for the Panther sophomore guard Jaylen must have seen that uh thing you guys just put up man he got to score immediately what you havent learned about TV yet Nelly is that we put stuff up like that and it always pans out as we expected to always nice defense there you can see JLo was locked in on number 10 because he knew how much of a threat he is thats why he was in position for best Ste good start to the half for pit Jaylen low one for three hasnt taken many shots three assists of course we mentioned he had two fouls in that first half so has only played nine minutes to this point Crawford and Kimble have been the goto guys for the colonels got to grab the rebound Diaz Graham hands off to his point guard low Diaz Graham leading all Panther rebounders on the night with five and he misfires on the three Blandon secures it for Eastern Kentucky fivepoint margin here minute into the second half Blandon the leading score on the season for Eastern Kentucky hes got the ball here has been held in check for most of the night six points for him on three of nine shooting in that first half Bron working on gdg pull up jumper too strong and you said it good defense by yo there low drives off the window wont go wall collects the board high percentage shot there for Jaylen though he makes those often that is his goto shot isnt it that runner in the lane hes got such good touch in there Kimbell feet down low martinov working on Diaz gr couldnt get the shot to fall now its leged Corin on the roll crosscourt Diaz Graham a three in and out guerro Diaz Graham struggling from Beyond The Arc he was so efficient in his threepoint shooting a season ago at 41 not having the same efficiency this year trying to get that shot working yeah and the one thing thats good you see here is his teammates have not lost trust in him that goes a long way for a guy to get his confidence back nice kick out here on the wing walls three of Target Eastern Kentucky starting to go cold a little bit from the field theyve missed their first four in this second half leg at the spin move and a strong take that will get him to the free throw line its just so strong when he drives man he creates contact every single time he remind you if jamarius buron at all toughness just the toughness element of it you know he has that that Relentless pursuit of the basket course leot the ACC Sixth Man of the Year a season ago Panthers made the lineup change putting jayen low in the starting five leot started coming off the bench and this year been a staple in the starting lineup and has certainly welcomed that role leg averaging 17 points a game on the season hes always been an excellent rebounder as well averaging 62 rebounds per game here in his senior season the transfer from Rhode Island good defense there by Corin to make things hard for Blandon but Panther forward does get called for the foul thats just the first on Cory as you can see right here cam is playing very good defense until the last second right here he has to be disciplined there not to use his body and just keep his hands up Applause there this is Devonte Blandon seven points now on the knife for him just a 62 free throw shooter on the season when a guy struggling to score the free throw line is his favorite place to be so I expect him to make these oh there we go Jinx and Mark that down as your first announcer Jinx first of many I always wonder if it was R I see it is Leed athletic move gets it to roll in off the front rim this is where pit has to continue to enforce their will they cant let up here eastn Kentucky is a dangerous team Kimble responds again with the triple thats his fourth three of the game and the full court press works again with wall shot doesnt fall Leed all the way ahead to Corin battling the defender and draws the contact there was a lot of stuff going on in that there was a lot going on right there Kimo hits the three hes up to 14 on the night and then Zach Austin might not have seen it in your frame but you see it in the replay there a little bit Zack Austin fell on the hardwood right in front of us meanwhile leg gets throwing the full court pass to Corin so to your point very fanatic sequence there but it all ends with Corin at the free throw line 100 its good that it ended good for pit because Eastern Kentucky plays that version of basketball thats feeding to their type of game and should not two Eastern Kentucky number 152 in the net right now and its been interesting of course weve had that conversation about nonconference strength of schedule a lot and even Eastern Kentucky is a team that would be a quad three game for pit here tonight you look at a lot of these home games in nonconference and maybe a season ago these were all quad fours thats not the case Eastern Kentucky has had a very good start to the season and picked to finish second by the medi in the Atlantic Sun pole so this is a team that Jeff Capel knew was going to provide a test here tonight and so Panthers up five here early in the second half against a team that won their conferences regular season a year ago and should compete again in the Atlantic Sun nice low off the window count the bucket nice finish there from J llo using his off hand Jing low picked up two early fouls tonight but he is back on the floor in the second half with a couple big time buckets as the Panthers are up by seven largest lead of the night for Music Music B all right so Jaylen low got the last basket but you think it was a play here from Cameron Cor in the made it happen huh yeah so as you can see here cam when he seen JLo have this matchup he sealed his man early which allowed jayen to see that and attack that space which is the reason why the guy was late and jayen was able to get that n one right there so thats a play where your big man and your guard are connected and thats what you have to have to have a good team like we were talking about earlier just seems to be such a quick chemistry that low has formed with Corin and even on a night like tonight where Corin has only taken two shots hes impacting the game in other ways and thats a big time play there down low Big Time play for sure so low completes the oldfashioned five quick points in the second half for him Panthers with their largest lead of the night here at eight points 4840 out of the under 16 timeout screen from Myrick Crawford to pull up three Austin think got a piece of it and Kimble Scoops it up Myrick an offensive rebound again good strip two onone here leget Austin cant get the finish and Myrick grabs it leged another rebound off the Miss from Andrews low goes High Austin great job getting out the transition there by pit biggest lead of the Applause game Jaylen low looking comfortable again for the Panthers four assists for him on the night in just 13 minutes what a point guard he Applause is big basket for them yeah my quiets the crowd a little bit here at the peak well this is a nice tandem NY when youve got a precise passer in low and an athletic forward in Austin you cannot go wrong with that combination especially on a fast Applause break Zack Austin up to 11 points hes the third Panther in double figures joining Brandon Cummings and ishmail lean low split squeezes through Austin ball movement here and Leed has it taken Kimbell Dives on the floor and tosses to Myrick Bandon spinning through Austin the defensive effort thats what they do the offensive rebound got to continue to fight Austin is everywhere Nell I thought he was still over here to our left from the offensive play he made and then he some now zooms back in for the Applause block 12 on the timer Corin kicks out Cummings Leed over to low thought about the three drives instead and a block called thatll go on Tyler Andrews and that should be the fourth on Andrew so little bit of foul trouble for Eastern Kentucky because Andrews and myar wall now each have four nobody else on Eastern Kentucky has more than one foul but Andrews and wall each have four and Andrews is still going to stay in the game and the Panthers capitalize off a little mishap by Eastern Kentucky on the inbound and Le gets the quick two veteran play there by Ish caught the defense sleeping good steal gets the takeway and a foul against butre Applause Music frustration from butry better move there got him with the Quick onew Applause Step that may be a clear path I dont know no no referee but that looked like a push to me you can definitely see the frustration setting in from butry and I think that was one where he was not mad about the foul called on him I think he was was upset that there was no foul called on ishma Leed on the takeaway and so then you see the anger from butry and gets the foul called second against Turner butry for EKU low Corin on the roll couldnt gather now its Blandon in a twoonone to Andrews got it away and out of bounds good steal bad execution on that fast break there had a two on one theyre still causing chaos out there Nelly but they just dont quite look as sharp as they did in the first half I agree they still a hard team to play against because of their style but they have to get some uh sharp good possessions Colonels are three for 13 from the floor in this half thats 23 they had things going in the first crosscourt pass comings a triple good pass there by Jaylen loan another great shot by Brandon Applause full timeout called by Jeff Cel 1244 to play Panthers up Music 11 Jeff Cel in year seven at pit aw Hamilton year seven at Eastern Kentucky and this was a really tight game at the break it was 3936 hit had the lead but the Panthers Nelly have been much more efficient on the offensive side this second half 100 agree and thats what we talked about before this I think second half you know you fill the team off for the first half second half you kind of have to impose your will on them so I see a pick and continue to do so George Kimbell the third leading scorer for Eastern Kentucky 14 points on the night for him but the Panthers have held control in the second half Zach Austin has been great on the defensive side now its a three on two coming spot up three drills in oh man oh man Im trying to keep my composure man its unbelievable come on man your moms here shes loving Music it seven for eight from the field and five of six from three is ridiculous efficiency ridiculous efficiency man hes feeling it as you can see hes knocking him down hes doing what he does to the best of his ability man I love it and meanwhile weve got fans here at the Peterson Event Center who are shouting to you you Tau him well Nelly you take any credit for this I give him all the credit right now but he knows proud older brother huh of course you seen him do this at Lincoln Park man Ive seen him do this in our backyard yeah so I know what hes capable Applause Music of and Eastern Kentucky meanwhile just struggling to find the basket its an eight nothing Run for the Panthers over the last couple of minutes and Jaylen low draws the foul called against Devonte Blandon 14point lead for pit as aw Hamilton looks for Music answers 5844 pit lead over Eastern Kentucky they have been led by The Freshman Brandon Cummings with 23 points seven of eight from the floor five for six from downtown Nelly this is your debut on the broadcast team and your younger brother has 23 a career high this is turning into a memorable night for the Cummings family very quickly very quickly like you just said man its a very memorable night already him doing this my first day doing this its beautiful yeah get this vantage point of it I usually would see this from up there and see it on the court its special moment man I know my parents are proud its been fun for me too and it was fun to hear you say before the game you obviously love the game of basketball and you told me this was your first time here tonight doing anything basketball related that wasnt playing the game so this is your first time doing a job related to the sport what do you think so far I love it so far its nice its definitely like I like you were alluding to its a different perspective so its definitely different usually Im used to sweating and running up and down the court but its nice to be able to describe the game and be that connection from the the game to the fans I love it now I transition from my high school recreational League to this which is a little bit different from what uh youve experienced Applause now thats good defense great defense by Corin the colonels end up with it and the shot off the window from Holk wont go Corin secures it low the drive take jayen low and the finish with the foul that was a really nice move there by J L downhill Up and Under and Applause one pit is definitely rolling now this is about what is expected this point in the Applause game Nelly I dont know if you caught it but your brother another staming around mid court and he just looked over at you and I think he was trying to get your attention to say you see what Im doing out here Im glad I didnt see it I want throw his game off man Im glad I didnt see him he is feeling himself tonight its a 130 run for pit meanwhile myar wall fouls out of the game for Eastern Kentucky good defense strip from Corin delich and it ends up with Ley threads the needle on the pass to Corin and out of bounds last off the colonels to your point earlier about low obviously 10 points here in the second half for him after a scoreless first half I think you get the sign of an offensively efficient guard when their slumps dont last long right of course he gets the two fouls only plays 9 Minutes in the first half but hes come alive here in the second half and you saw it on Saturday in blackburg as well Jaylen low had about four points until late stages of the game and then he takes matters into his own hands Jaylen low had 11 points in the final 304 of the game at Virginia Texas put the team on his back and they needed him to and they came away with the win definitely and I think that speaks to his maturity as well you know hes a sophomore guard he learned a lot through his season last year and hes a playing those lessons this year in a game that you must win youre the starting point guard youre youre our star guy you must take over those situations and hes been doing that consistently All Season turn things on in the second half Jaylen low with those 10 points three of four from the floor and now a big Roar from the Oakland Zoo as Papa con checks into the game for the first time tonight Nelly you mentioned you were at the game in Columbus at Ohio State kante was huge in that game for that was the papa con game right there man 12 points for kante in that game four offensive rebounds gets his first bucket of tonight and Nelly right when it started to look like they were out of that game in Columbus is when he came on the floor and he gave them a massive lift yeah he gave him a big boost of energy because when you have a situation where Cam was in foul trouble and G was in foul trouble you he was needed it was almost required if he didnt do that we werent going to win and he knew that missed last year with a knee but slowly starting to come along this season and G o Diaz Graham took a shot to the face in that game and hes a starter for the Panthers they didnt have him for virtually the entire second half so they relied on K he came in and helped to get the job done here he is again off the feed from delich grabs his own Miss puts it back up strongly off the window Strong finish right there big time offensive rebound thats what Papa can bring to your team energy effort and he can finish this is now an 18 nothing run over the last four minutes for the Panthers and theyre doing it with three starters on the bench Diaz Graham Corin and Austin rebound legged fast break game its a two on two drives had to be foul draws contact ishmail Leed will head to the foul line kante with four quick points Nelly very strong uh aggressive right there on the the rebound you see hes head faking hes making sure he gets his space and hes going up strong finishing thats what you want from a guy like that kante one of the top recruits out of his high school class in 2023 and once again this is what Jeff capable wants to see he knows this point in the season ACC play right around the corner mentioned Diaz Graham Corin Austin all on the bench and thats because you need that depth in your roster because pretty soon youre going to be playing the Dukes and the cleansin and the North Carolinas in college basketball and you need options like Cummings delich and con Off the Bench to help your team compete definitely if you dont have it it will show in moments where you have weakness and you cant rely on your bench foul trouble whatever the reason low Dives on the floor trying to get it from Crawford now its martinov five to Crawford Baseline pass all the way over to Holt and Eastern Kentucky is just one for nine from three in this second half pull up three denied there by Andrews this is now a 20 run over the last five minutes for Music p h you and I were talking today shot around about how today needed to be a Get Right game for the Panthers they got blown out by Mississippi State they were very close to dropping a road game at Virginia Tech to start ACC play as coming strains another three he is up to 26 points he decided not to miss today I Applause see were out of words now this is unbelievable not much to say when a guy is what eight for nine hes having a game tonight Panthers as a team have seven threes six of them belong to Brandon Cummings if I can tell you guys anything I know my brother well enough to tell you he has one more at least well theres still what about 8 minutes left in this game I mean he could have time for multiple more Panthers in full control in the second half they are out scoring Eastern Kentucky 3410 and your younger bro is on fire hes having his game today man a lot of people have wanted him to have the the bber game heres the bber game you guys looking for look hes not even looking at the shot Music well were in the midst of a 232 run for the fit Panthers and Brandon Cummings has led the way 26 points now for the Freshman on eight of nine shooting from the floor in Nelly that ties the highest point total in a single game by any ACC freshman this season and he is now in the company of Cooper flag pretty big name to do that PR yeah pretty Elite company man hes playing really well and like I was saying to you I dont know if Cooper flag did on nine shots man so Im not being biased here yeah we got to add a note to that fewest shots get to 26 by ACC freshman this season thats whats been really impressive about it Nelly is it started right out of the gate he just was not going to miss tonight yeah very efficient showing eight for nine you know its funny Nelly you and I werere talking before the game as everybody take a moment to witness what we just saw Brandon Cummings missed a three so it is possible here tonight uh but you and I were talking before the game about the off seon you had an opportunity to come back and play in a game against the current team so it was an alumni game some of the alumni going up against the current guys and I told you that all the buzz I heard out of that game was about Brandon cumins and the way he played in that game over the summer and now were seeing what he can do when hes on offensiv Im going to be 100 honest with you everything youre seeing tonight he did it against me it was one of the first and the worst times I ever had with just pure domination like hes doing tonight well that says a lot about you you know most older brothers cant admit that stuff all listen I keep it real man I got I dont like lying so he did exactly what hes doing tonight against us and we were TBT team so glad to see him able to do it in actual uh the actual game Austin gets in on the action as well he hits the three Zack Austin up to 14 now tonight and mentioned Austin picking things up offensively as well now mention this is your first game at the table here Nelly but youve been watching Brandon what hes doing this season this is the season opener so Brandon cummings first game as a college player Shifty take to the hole you were loving it loving it look at that reaction if only he can see the smile I have on my face right now well I told you hes been trying to get your attention out there hes looking over just a subtle little smirk saying Nelly you seeing this omeni into the game for the Panthers hes wearing number zero Applause nice Austin take to the hole he has now tied his season High Austins up to 16 very good game for him today hes definitely came to play and hes doing what a veteran guy should do its a nelly Brandon Cummings story of the night 26 points 8 for 10 from the floor and you said that he pretty much all along knew he wanted to come to pit yeah yeah he has this was a dream of his like it was dream of mine and Im just happy to see him come out here and do what hes known hes capable of doing and its beautiful to see you know he just got a massive Ovation from the Oakland Zoo the Moms here sporting the Brandon Cummings tshirt love to see it 5 doesnt get much better than Applause that well see if that ends his night and if it is the end of the night for Brandon Cummings what a performance it was by the Freshman just the 11th game of his college career yeah man its its very exciting for him to have this type of game I mean with Damen Dunns injury pits looking for a next scorer you know so for him to come in and be able to have this type of game is big for the team going forward all smiles from Brandon Cummings n of Midland PA Lincoln Park High School showing out in the arena that he grew up coming to to watch the Panthers play thats a good one do you remember the best game you ever came to in this Arena most exciting not counting your playing days here most exciting game I came to actually was I think Kate was coaching and there was Jabari Parker I want to say and JayZ here and it was like a big deal I was here at that game and that game was crazy the only time I felt that excitement was senior night my once again JayZ came out sitting Courtside for the pit Duke game that year that game was crazy just seeing JayZ in the PE was crazy but you mentioned your senior day as well of course that was game against Syracuse what some people remember as the Aiden Fish game mhm that was a huge huge moment in pit basketball right there man for all of us it was just Aiden fish scoring that shot was such a culmination of all the good weve done all season what was special I remember that game Nelly seeing some of the locker room video afterwards and Jeff cable you could see the emotion on his face after that game it was at a point as low with a beautiful feed to Corin there that was at a point in the year where you had a good feeling that you guys were going to make the tournament and it was after a tough first four years for Jeff gel and hes opened up about how difficult those first four years were you win at home on Senior Day against Jim baheim a coach that pit has been playing against forever you grew up watching Pick go up against Jim beheim having some epic battles and Aiden fish a HomeTown kid scores the basket as we get another High play cor into Austin there on the slam but there was so much that was important about that senior day and of course you guys went on later that year to win a couple NCAA tournament games yeah man I think that senior day like you were talking about it kind of was the foundation piece the foundation brick that you know coach capable always talks about the bricks that they lay and it was a foundational brick that we had that day and the arena was sold out it was everything we wanted and by the way this is not the end of the night for Brandon Cummings because he is sitting down at the scores table once again so we will see him back down there but Jor Diaz Graham will connect on a three he is on the score sheet as well but the Panthers showing off a little trickery here late in the second half having some fun low on the dish to Corin and the big fella finishing again this time he throws the alleyoop to Zack Austin for the slam lead for the pit Panthers 329 to play second half they are outscoring Eastern Kentucky 476 since the break theyve been led by these guys right here four in double figures for the Panthers two of them have season highs thats Cummings and Zach Austin and Nelly got to be refreshing for Coach cable too to have a game like this where its not legged or low leading the way he has other options providing offensively in comington Austin yeah thats huge for a team because going forward you wont play in a game where you can just have one option you have to have multiple ways to beat teams and we talked about it earlier you have to be able to win the ugly game so this is not that type of game but you gotta have other guys whos bringing stuff to the table to win those games thats just what theyve gotten here tonight and one of the great feelings as a coach in games like this three minutes left to go get to empty your bench all five starters now sitting out for the Panthers and they will go home tonight knowing that they are 2 almost certainly will maintain a top 20 ranking in the net rankings which is such a big factor in NCAA tournament selection when March comes around and pit is going to head into an ACC play in which they already have a tremendous resume and they havent been here at the Pete since mid November in a Monday night game against VMI but since that point they have a neutral site win against LSU they have a road win at Ohio State and starting to put together a really impressive resume you see the record Nelly is not too different but its those quad one and two wins that theyve been able to get so far this year that have really separated them in those rankings yeah for sure and uh coach cable and the teams Mantra has been leave no doubt this season and I think it shows with their net ranking this year that they have understood the process a little bit better and I went about it differently in scheduling the season how about they beat West Virginia by 24 and then the MERS going and beat Gonzaga big just about a week later those are the types of things that the net allows you to have some type of luck involved sometimes you need that to be able to get as highly ranked as we are right now I think this will be a year where Panther fans of course dont typically support West Virginia but any win for West Virginia from here on out benefits the Panthers so well see if we can get a pit in West Virginia tand one I dont know man good luck of course theres all the hatred from the Backyard Brawl Brandon Cummings cruises past the defender and scores the two hes up to Applause 28 but yes some huge wins on the year for the Panthers been an exciting start to the season good defense Cummings with 28 and the ball in his hands score it yes sir 30 piece yeah and he is looking right at you my friend as he should man congratulations man 30 points on 13 shots very very impressive very Applause impressive its poetic it is cant ask for a much better way to make my debut on TV Applause Music man bench is going nuts Brandon Cummings gets the curtain call what a moment this freshman has a bright future ahead I wish I can go over there and get excited with him but I got to you know do my job today got to wait what about 80 more seconds that might be too long Applause here we go three on one delich trying to find Barnes 37point lead CLE couldnt take him off before he got 30 huh Im glad he allowed him to do that man thats a special moment for him as a freshman to come out and have 30 points in a game and you see hes yelling at me I dont know what I did to him but Applause you sure you didnt do anything I man that was little stare there thats just his passion man that didnt scream thank you for all your years of mentorship to me hes a gritty player though huh very you know hes as you can see he came out and had a really good game today man Im Im really proud of him Im proud of the team this is how you you recover from a game that you get blown out and you barely win a game thats how you recover from Applause that well its going to go down as a 96 56 win for the pit Panthers stumbled a little bit during the road trip but a Get Right game by all stretches here tonight a 40point win over Eastern Kentucky the Panthers improved to 92 and Brandon Cummings with 30 points the most by an ACC freshman this year spectacular game from him today man
