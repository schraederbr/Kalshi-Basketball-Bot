time in program history they face Duke and we are ready to go Ryan sanos got the ball in hand Kyle filipowski wins the tip back to Jared McCain and off we go with a new Applause season Ryan young gets the start today no Mark Mitchell hes out with a sprained ankle suffered a couple of days ago so young into the starting lineup and a jump ball is called on the way up and it belongs to Dartmouth well we saw earlier the advantage of young being inside Philip psk versatility now he slashed to the four tried to get young going inside great defensive possession by dman to start the game Duke extends pressure out and the point guard for Dartmouth is Ryan Cornish hes one of the top two scorers back from last years group 12 a game for 10 in black and his head coach Dave mlin said to his pregame hes going to be hounded for 94 ft yes hes got to accept the challenge hes got to initiate offense and hes got to score as well Dukes pressure extending the defense this is Brandon Mitchell day matched up with filipowski late shot clock in now Cornish filipowski with the head shot clock winding down and Cornish comes up empty something sh wants to pay attention to early aggressive defense by Duke see the starting five for the Blue Devils with Philip psky back and scoring the first points theres no match up for him no one on the dartman team has the size or the strength to guard him too small goes inside turns over the right should and Banks it in and you think bigger teams even its going to be a matchup nightmare against it doesnt matter because if you put a bigger guy on him he can stretch the floor take you out good back cut there by duchan neskovic the other returning top scorer from last year also at 12 a game like Cornish but this is the way they want to play they play five out theyre going to force Duke to guard them on the perimeter and theyre going to make a lot of cuts put pressure on a rim Duke is going to have to contain the dribble and then sag off on the weak side to help and those back door Cuts heres the number 10 recruit in our ESPN 100 Jared McCain pivoting tried to go up with it young to the loose ball and he draws a foul on Jackson Monroe all right so we told you mark Mitchell unavailable tonight John sh told us at shoot around that Mitchell was 5050 to play today after spraining the ankle on Saturday they worked him out after shoot around he did participate somewhat in shoot around as well and theyre going to be cautious and they should be I mean hes a vital part to this team and you know things does get any easier for Duke with Arizona and Michigan State coming up next great out of bounds play there what you like about it good sign coming off the Stagger Jeremy roach is senior Le senior guarden this team had a strong finish to the year last year you want him getting off to an early Applause start nothing like knocking down your first shot of the Season either got to feel good good ball pressure on the perimeter and we get a foul on Duke away from the ball Dave mcgloins in his eighth year in Hover New Hampshire guy who played at kobby College in Maine and now leading this group for Dartmouth they were picked seventh of eight in the ivy league but we told you theres a lot back from last years group it is seven returning seven of their nine players top players from a year ago so this team has high expectations again theres another back door cut didnt finish it that time but theyre going to put a lot of pressure on Duke and Rim McCain was a pass extra pass Proctor for roach wide right and the rebound downed to jayen Williams good unselfish basketball there by Duke finding an open guy be interesting to see too we got to watch Duke and watch that threepoint shooting wasnt his strength a year ago but I think theyre much improved this year tough turnaround there on the Baseline jumper for the sophomore forward Brandon Mitchell day yeah that bear is watching for Duke as we already alluded to 335 from three last year they expect better from Tyrese Proctor but back iron and now to Williams Cornish no look neskovic couldnt haul it in and a Dartmouth turnover Dukes pressure is speeding Dartmouth up is what you want to see doesnt matter whos in the lineup if its Mitchell Ryan young Christian Rees it doesnt matter any of theyre big the pressure is going to continue so far theyve been able to keep Darth Im getting consistent looks at The Rim right now the back door cuts are bothering him though some space for McCain and a foul goes against Duke on rot young we enjoyed chatting with John shy earlier today excited for this group and he said its not a finished product you got a lot of pieces to sort through because theres a ton of depth with all the players that came back from a great season last year its not often you get NBA talent to return to school he did that with the second r class coming in so hes got a good problem to have hes got guys hes got to force to play him filipowski went up on neskovic for the block Duke runs Bain triggers yes great crit skip pass up the floor from Proctor to McCain knocking down a three biggest adjustment youre going to see is that guy right there his ability to knock down shots hes coming in proven Shooters showing you that why hes a number 10th ranked recruit in the country before trying to see his development and growth over the year boy hes not shy either that is one assertive rookie freshman from Sacramento Cornish got stripped but drew a foul on the way in on Jared McCain excited about making that shot he comes down on the defensive end freshman mistake there just stay in front of the basketball got a little too excited gave his offensive player an angle to the rim and drill a foul and The Crazies adjudicate on the ruling I dont think the craziest has ever likeed the foul called on the Duke Blue Devil so 57th consecutive sellout here at Cameron indor offensive foul away from the ball on Duan neskovic who shoves Proctor Duke by five in the first four minutes of the new season ACC mens college basketball is brought to you by Ally whatever youre saving for were all better off with an ally Conference tournament remember the top four teams in the ivy league go to Whats called Ivy Madness the conference tournament Dartmouth was sixth one game out of that and they were in it until the penultimate weekend of the regular season and Dave mlin said last year took them a while to figure out who they were they feel like they know who they are going into this year well he knows what his team is capable of that they not the best threepoint shooting team he has size he has versatility in his group itd be interesting to see what his sophomores do hes another another group of guys hes relying on three sophomores to make a jump helped his team climb to the top four and in Ivy leag theres tyres Proctor tumbling kicks it out for Caleb Foster freshman in his Collegiate debut couldnt connect out of the corner Foster and Christian Reeves 21 in white check in the first two Off the Bench again with Mark Mitchell unavailable with a sprained ankle foul away from the ball so were already seeing what the management is like of the rotation for John shy well its going to be without Mark Mitchell hes such a versatile piece so it changes things now now you have to play with more intentional five filipowski will spend more time at the four because youll play with Ryan young and Christian Reeves there Reeves at 7 foot one and filipowski of course a sevenfooter heres Jackson Monroe one of those talented sophomores for Dartmouth who even as a big they can play through him cuz hes an elite passer and he finds Mitchell day and this is what were talking about about five out in multiple in Cuts like that it forces Duke to pay attention to their guy and not look at the ball as much on the weak side and when you do that gives you a chance to more oneonone opportunities but it forces you to guard your man and away from the ball and younger teams as this Duke team is struggle with that Dave mlin said to us today I dont care who you are constant cutting is a pain constant aggressive cuts and one of the most underrated skill is a big as you see right there from Jackson Monroe hes a great passer and its something you got to have you want play five off from your roach back iron rebound pulled down by Jaren Johnson Senior backup point guard at 65 theyre going to get it to Monroe to middle or the floor Corners playing off ball here trying to work on Proctor doubled and nearly turned it over Monroe on the drive trying to wiggle through on a reverse that wouldnt go tipped around and secured by Williams pull up short rebound Foster thats what coach shy wants to see from his guards the first time the guards were leaking out didnt get a rebound they were able to fortunate enough to get it back that time Foster grabs a rebound big jump from last years team with this smaller starting lineup and smaller rotation that Duke is playing is that the guards must rebound John CH was adamant about that with us today good shot in the midrange for Tyrese Proctor great job by Proctor getting in the paint shooting a one leg pull up I thought Duke got a little happy settling for jump shots and re Proctor settling him down getting the feet in the paint pulling up hitting the midrange Runner Monroe at the elbow again he can orchestrate classmate Mitchell day and hes blocked by Reeves thats what you want to see from Reeves if you come in give you some Durk Lively approach Foster gets the roll Duke is coming at you in waves Fosters coming from the bench not many teams have McDonald all americ coming off the bench Foster comes in no one stops the ball pushes and finishes at The Rim Proctor whistled for a foul just a great job not the way Dartmouth wants to attack Duke inside oneonone in the post Foster pushes it no one stops the basketball gets to the rim finishes inside great start by The Applause Freshman good to see Christian reads out there after he tweaked his knee last Wednesday before Dukes exhibition game was held out as a precaution so hes good to go its great to see because hes forced hes forcing coach sh to play him his ability to block shots and rebound he can kind of fill in in that dur Lively role for this Duke team which is a critical part for this group neskovic got blocked by Jaylen Blakes just into the game Off the Bench was Proctor second hes out filipowski sits as well and Blakes in along with McCain as Cornish picks it went up trying to flush and was fouled by Blakes just a careless pass there by Blakes he was I dont think anyone stopped him he could have turned the corner went to the rim was trying to reverse it no one stopped him great job by Cornish getting in the passing Lane there I thought he was going to flush one he had bad intentions going up there he a fun guy to chat with Junior from pomac Maryland we told you their leading returning score he grew up a Duke fan he told us earlier today and for his 11th birthday father Trent whos here tonight by the way surprised Ryan with tickets to a Duke game he remembers it against Elon and then this year on his birthday found out that they were playing Duke this year in this game the season opener happy birthday you get the D number two second rank team in the country splits at the stripe corners from sitwell Friends great program up in Washington DC are you coach single Eric singers done a great job there with Josh Hart Alum yeah sadique Bay couple NBA guys and took a grand total of 7 minutes and 9 seconds of game action for a DMV reference from Rand shoulders hey you got to represent its a lot of them out here Jeremy roach you know they were we were everywhere a guy who Cornish by the way is familiar with Dukes up by six five buckets from five different players and heres Foster little too strong neskovic clears it frost a little bit out of control there jumped into some contact Nikola dimitrievich gave it up for Williams moves it to one of the captains Rob McCrae Baseline cut neskovic finishes n are do a really good job of back cutting there got the Freshman on and McCain fell asleep a little bit weak side theyre going to put a ton of pressure on the rim and theyre cutting and theyre looking for the cut late so its difficult to guard this will be a good test for Duke younger guys McCain summons a ball screen drills another cant give him that hes an outstanding shooter off the dribble or off the catch its why hes earned the right to start for this second ranked team and hes going to be a handful when this group is Applause healthy Caleb Foster calls him a sniper that exactly what he is and tipped Away by Blakes and itll stay with Dartmouth when we come back well a couple of Threes for the sniper himself Jared McCain early on in his Collegiate Music debut numbers from duke last season I know a lot of these Randolph jumped out to you break it down what stood out well it it just shows you for this this team was the second ranked team in ACC and in country and defensive end to the floor offensive end they struggled threepoint shooting you see their bottom half of the league middle of the pack and field goal percentage and to win a championship and reach the heights as this team want to reach got to shoot the ball better got off to a slow start a little bit tonight but they got a few guys knocking down shots dri yavich left it short filipowski the rebound yeah we said 335 from three that was the worst for Duke since the 1819 season and the second worse since the NCAA universally adopted the threepoint line back in the mid 80s now this is a unique lineup with Duke on the floor they got four guards and Philip palsky at the five this is the first time in the game hes played at the five John CH teased this to us at shoot around today he said you might see a very small ball lineup with Jaylen Blakes at the four I think thats going to be the the most difficult part for Duke here early in the season to figure out which lineup they want to go with do they want to play really big or they can even go small like this well that was Blakes matched up with the 68 neskovic who bullied right through him neskovic posting up the smaller guards to Duke was a concerned they spoke about today in shoot around and he makes him pay right there but again its you would think jayen Jaylen Blakes is the guy they need to get on the floor he has the experience to guard him and the physical strength I think hes too big for some of the other guards on the floor McCain going behind the back Philip palski swirls one out good look you can live with that first three of the game first threepoint attempt for him tonight coming off a season in which he was 28 from three expected to be better in that regard dmitrievich missed it at the rim and now Foster pushes and attacks at fetishes the outlet passes and kicking the ball up in transition for Duke is really working theyre turning quick shots and turnovers in the offense and Caya Foster with the sudden change of pace got the angle in the Finish finish was the turn over here here is Blakes with the left hand Duke doing what they do best turning quick shots and turnovers in the offense there Blake easy Ste easy Deuce extending their pressure here he can be a bulldog is what his teammates have long said defensively hes the best perimeter defender on his team I think the most versatile one hes able to guard bigger guys see him being active sticks his hand in gets a deflection hey coming up next we will wrap up the night with a nothing but net crew right here in Durham and look asking you shall receive also on the ESPN app what do we got on Lukes jacket you like it I dont know not for you I dont know he can I like it for him yeah I like it for him let thats youre thats all I mean thats all I mean good save heres M up top my guy Lukes the best Cornish skips it Williams hoist it and knocks it down a contested three for jayen Williams first points great find there by Cornish and now with Ryan young in they cant switch defensively that time he tried to hedge and recover weak side they tried to tag great job by cornner skipping it over to his shooter for three filipowski posting up hes got Brandon Mitchell day on him on the face up filipowski drew a double and walked with it I dont think filipowski like to call this a great job comes off Ryan Youngs hedging trying to recover Blakes has the tags get there too late hand down man down knocks down a three tag means what just on the weak side you want to give him time to recover he shows you want to tag so Ryan young can show on the ball get back to his guy just a good just a good job he got there just hit a contested three you can live with that if youre Duke now look at this pressure from McCain up on Cornish with the shot clock winding down tough shot Cornish through the bump and spun it out second foul on McCain hes going to have to go out just a little bit of excitement over aggressive on the defensive end hell settle down Cornish just using his experience getting the angle on him forc the contact Jered McCains going to have to sit for the half Applause now thats going to be expected of Riot Cornish this year we told you about his scoring Dave mlin said to us hes also got to be the guy to get us into our offense we need the production in terms of points but got to be able to initiate and set up others as well as we saw in the Williams three well hes expecting that from him hes got to handle the pressure tonight hes the one guy that can dribble through the pressure handle the pressure get them in the offense but he cant just do that he has to pick his moments like he did just there taking advantage of the Freshman drawing fouls and using his experience so he knocks down both and trims the Duke lead to four coming up on eight to go in this first half you see a little bit of full court pressure there theyll theyll after free throws Dartmouth will extend pressure fall back to this zone right now theyre in the 32 Zone on a skip for foster now Duke you want to get that ball right in the high post you dont want to settle for jump shots against the Zone thats what the Zone wants you to do and Dartmouth runs off the Miss neskovic wraps it around for Applause Williams Corner Mitchell day no dice Blakes the rebound when Ryan young Z he changes things now what he is is really effective there on the post turn it over that left shoulder right like and he gets bumped on the pivot so young fouled we step aside 7 and 1 half to go at Music Cameron so much back for Duke this season lets focus on line number three players with 30 plus starts four of them most since 2000 that was a pretty good year 2001 yeah Boozer B Bader Nate James and Jay Williams those guys won a national championship so Id say it was a heck of a year then and this team is chasing the same goals and enough talent to pull it off they in a fourpoint game right now and they drop a beauty of a baseline out of bounds for Kyle filipowski out of that same lineup last time they ran a stagger this time they ran a back door cut young might have got a piece of that on Cornish and now Duke Applause runs now for Duke to have the advantage with Brian Young in playing in this game and at his size they got a pound it inside they they hadnt shot in a free throw yet in this half have despite their size Advantage you expect young to get it like now oh here he is Drew the double scored over Williams great job by Ryan young moving his feet they fronted him on the first side he reversed it kept his feet moving so the guard couldnt get back in front great job by Ryan young Silling the small guard year two for one of the captains here in Durham Ryan young the most vocal guy on the team according to John shy neskovic long two thats a sweet looking jump shot there every time he shoots it it looks like its going in he was one of the best threepoint Shooters in the IV League last year at 42 for Duan neskovic hes got eight Foster answers Duke didnt do a lot that time against the Zone I expect him at some point to let the ball touch the paint they just reversed it around of perimeter thats just Talent there Foster just raising up pulling shooting a three neskovic was feeling it through some contact he comes up empty and he will hear that for the next hour and a half thats my kind of guy he hits one shot then he does a heat check Ryan young just working just keeping his feet moving corish cant get back Cornish cant get back in front helps too late easy two for him Daris in that two three that three2 zone thats where you want the ball to get and you get open looks from there Foster short you can live with that three because the ball goes inside then it goes back out you dont want just to work around the perimeter and shoot threes you want it to go inside the paint Cornish wraps it around for Monroe who sticks it its a great great find right there by the junior point guard cor Cornish just turns the corner and thats what youre going to do to attack this group now with Ryan young inside hes not going to switch you got to hes going to hedge you got to hold him with this dribble penetration on Rose ability to knock down shot bror a deep one we talked about the Improvement we know the confidence there he made five in the exhibition game John sh said to us today he didnt even take five in a game last year he wants him in attack mode cuz he knows how unselfish he is Williams no young the board Duke by nine with the basketball with 445 to go until halftime Duke can play at a control Pace they get whatever they want turn down shots for better shots just like that wide open Jeremy roach could have shot that three turned around threw it back to his sevenfooter his All American big scary thing to see when hes at the five knocking those shots Music Applause Music down me Music Applause Darman coming out of the time out trying to resurrect to find out whats going on with the defensive ENT the floor this time theres a confusion coming down Jeremy roach and a stagger and theres some confusion on Switching and you dont leave the first team allamerican wide open for three coach had to call a timeout get that rectified and we can leave a lot of guys open but you dont leave that guy open seven for Kyle filipowski ACC preseason Player of the Year and a preseason first team AllAmerican Dukes now hit three of its last four triples getting late in this first half jiren Johnson shot clock winding down he attacks finds monoe bunny was short tipped around and it stays with Dartmouth when all else breaks down with Dartmouth theyre going to put Ryan young in a ball screen because they know hes going to hitge Monro can pop that shots gonna be there whether he takes it or not but if he takes it and dribble hand off with someone else Ryan young is stopping the penetration and cant help by getting him into a hedge you know the pops going to be there you know its going to be there like now set the screen he comes 15 hedging Cornish split it and then Philip palowski broke up the passing Lane it belongs to Duke its a really good job by Cornish there I know its a turnover but great job by splitting the ball screen defense thr a no look P teammates wasnt ready for it Applause Tyrese Proctor back into the game with two fouls here John CH last year in his first year is the head coach pretty lenient with guys with two fouls in the first half roach he doesnt he doesnt have to be this year because he has so much Deb with that guy a senior realizing his team needs a moment basket comes off doesnt stop the ball against the angle he played so well the end of last year and its gotten off to a good start here tonight this team starts three of point guards essentially with he Proctor and McCain and they take turns playing with the ball and when you got not many teams have three quality point guards starting the game Jeremy roach 16 points from a th in his career why do you think off ball fit him so well down the stretch like you said I I just think this just it just you get easier shots when youre playing with other quality guards you get a lot of catch and shoot opportunities you dont have to create everything Applause and I dont think its just off the ball cuz I think hes equally effective with the ball in his hand but they feeding off each other cornis will get three at the line got roach in the Music air Corners with a head up play even on the experienced senior roach just shot fakes gets this other DMV guy in the air those two guys if you had one and a half as the over we have hit the over well they got these two guys got a lot Inc Comon they both share the same trainer back home and you can believe this is a little friendly rivaly going on here tonight and Cornish has F fairly well hes been hes been a handful for the Duke GS tonight hey the ACC Fall Championships continue Wednesday night with the semifinals all matches are right here on accn and the ESPN app the home of ACC championships so two fouls on Jeremy roach as well joining Jared McCain and Tyrese Applause Proctor and now you can coach sh has can easily leave hes leaving roach in a game right now he has so much depth and versatility he can just let it play out pick his matchups now hes moving roach off the ball putting proc ball in Proctors hand two out of three for cornish and Proctor will stare down some extended pressure again from Dave mlin and Dartmouth theyre just using this to slow Duke down theyre mixing up their defenses usually they full court pressure back to a Zone this time they fall back to a man great job by Monroe there he didnt get that that was an easy basket proor did a ready good job turning the corner looking to find uh Ryan young for the lck Proctor to the corner good look on a quick Baseline out of bounds Dukes done a great job of scoring on Baseline out of bound plays theyve gotten two baskets out of and almost a third one there you told me today theyve been running the same stuff for a very long time theyre just bugging play just just different guys which NBA guy which Pro Prospect is running into plays is the only difference Brandon Mitchell down the face up was shut off by filipowski now five to shoot for Johnson off the cross roach with him tough Fall Away no dice this is where Duke so dangerous turning quick shots in the transition baskets Foster attacks and got stripped on the way up it stays with the Blue Devils You like to see Frost to take one more kick it to the corner I think he had roach there hell see that on film and make that that one more pass I know theyve worked on quite a Applause bit so Road shits with his two Proctor still out there hell key it in filipowski thought about it and clear out for Kyle filipowski carving out space and finishing they worked on their defense when he gets the ball and theyre not in front they want to dig but filipowski is just too big too strong steps through draws the fouling the chance at an n one saw the Dig there to come down try to make a pick up his dribble he did but he just elevates and shoot just so many he just hurt you in so many different ways decided to come back the video announcing it its got 5 million views on Twitter folks here were excited about that you dont expect many first round draft picks and he was a surey first round draft picks when we return to school I think some of that too was he loves Duke he wants to do something special here Blakes off the turnover Blakes goes up and scores Dukes turning up the pressure another steal no one is better in the country at turning defense in the offense and dman got to get this thing under control if they want to stick around on this one Blake just turns the corner comes down takes the contact from corners and just finishes so strong like I said the best perimeter defender of the guards on this team and hes one of those guys that we talked about Duke has 13 guys that can play but its whos going to force coach Shard to make them play him Jaylen Blakes one of those guys because hes defensive into the floor and everybody brings something different Ryan young is their best low post scoring guy when we get to the end of January 13 will be how many in a rotation every single night I would say hes comfortable with seven now well see at the end of the year if that numberers 8 n or 10 I dont see them going much more than 10 guys but I do think everybody brings something different to the table largest lead of the night for Duke and dartmouths in a bind here with 90 ticks to go until intermission Dukes pressure is extended and you dont want to be out 30 ft from the basket initiating your offense Demitri aich around the corner got a good good look and missed it down the floor so quick they looking it look Ryan young inside poting up going to work kicking it out and Blakes knocking it down Duke started out two of seven since then theyre 4 five theyre heating up from the behind the line and theyre building a 21point lead here in the first half 172 run over the last four plus Applause minutes Johnson off the bounce gave it up now Rob McCrae shot clock at five Demitri AIC neskovic shorten the shot clock violation its great job about it Duke even Ryan young great communication on the switch under 7 Seconds you want to switch containing the dribble thats what you want to see early in with the team with just many young guys playing couple of freshman out there on the Music floor but when that guy right there knows his role hes heating up the ball you love it when a guy forces his coach to play him John shy takes a timeout with 27 seconds to go until halftime me I speak to you to the other top teams in the nation coming into this year what do you like most about them compared to some of the others I think they have the versatility to play with a bigger lineup with Mitchell at the three which they did a year ago filipowski at the four which they done tonight now if Mark Mitchells there then you know the original lineup they want to start with is filipowski at the five that we hadnt seen a lot of tonight that well see at some point during the year so they can play with four guards they can play with three guards I just think they have so much depth and versatility that not a lot of teams have and then with that it takes an adjustment because you got to see whats effective they can effectively hold for the final shot of this half its about a second difference between game clock and shot clock headed to halftime yeah theyre going to hold it down Id say hes going to go at about 8 second Mark dartman does a great job going to the Zone filipowski gives it up and now Proctor behind the back and draws a foul out of Rob pre with 46 to go Jamie lucky with the quick call he still got it baby Jamie lucky still got it another year and good to see old Jamie lucky and the one in one coming for Tyrese Proctor you know John sh said to us today tyres Proctor is different we asked him how he said up here and pointed to his head he said mentally the Swagger the maturity of Tyrese Proctor are the first things that stood out to his head coach coach well its great to see and I think hes earned that with being named a captain and you know it be interesting to see how that translates hes given him a ton of confidence this year and he has all the tools all the physical tools so if he gets it mentally itll be great and he better do we saw him in his Ugg slippers and shoot around today so if you got ug slippers on you got some swag hes got the fresh hair this year too McCain roach Proctor young stepping in for Mitchell and Philip powski Jeremy Kane swirls one out and a onearmed rebound draws a foul from Brandon Mitchell day a little bit of how Duke started the game that shot just coming off a pin down jerman Kane knocked down a couple of Threes in the first half he got a good look you want him taking those but you also want to see the ball go inside they have a distinct advantage of size and side D got themselves in trouble earlier by settling for those threes and not getting the ball inside all right Dartmouth at their best in the first half what do you like most I like that play just we just saw putting Ryan young in ball screens and making plays off that got the shot they wanted it was just an air ball there heres Philip palowski being hounded by Mitchell day filipowski spinning and scoring just a handful cut him off going middle he spins Basel line help is late its too easy of a play there youre going to have to dig or come trapped you got to get the ball out of his hand you cant allow him to play oneonone he had 15 and nine per game last year hes got a dozen in this one extra pass to Brandon Mitchell day who can step out and shoot it at 68 we talked about the Duke sophomores this Dart sophomore group of Jaden Williams Brandon Mitchell day and Monroe pretty good players themselves foul on the filipowski drive thats going to be a big part of them taking a step this year yeah I mean this is a big part they spread you out theyre difficult to guard because they play five out so anytime anyone dribble penetration gets in extra pass there knocks down a shot theyll get those opportunities all year long McCain off the shot fake into the midrange great shot fake Rhythm shot who says the midrange game is Dead just a sweet jump shot there l a freshman from Sacramento Scouts are really excited about it its an elite work ethic its a guy whos changed his body as well over his high school years in Jared McCain and hes got a great feel for the game as Mitchell day misses this time well hes physically ready to play right now hes nearly a 200lb guard coming as a freshman great find by Brock hello how do you lose that guy inside it wont get any easier than that too there by filipowski Proctor Just Whipped it in there to Kyle filipowski whos up to 14 theres Monroe straight on offensive rebound neskovic but he missed it Duke runs Proctor pick by Cornish something to keep your eyes on there its not the turnover that coach sh is upset about as Jared McCain picks up his third foul not the turnover but what but its the play they talked about again on the defensive end of the floor just staying sound staying solid boxing out of finishing possessions by rebounder but here proor showing you why he has such a high assisted turn turnover ratio last year so great at that finding a big man you definitely got to find him but he also didnt block out on the other end and we talked about it before with this small lineup the key to those guards its again he gets beat on the back door is rebounding the basketball the guards for Duke has the rebound even when you got Ryan young and filipowski on the floor because Philip psk is at the four now hes going to be drawn away from the basket hes out Highs Young post up and gets it from roach filipowski on the cut great job by Ryan young catching it good cut by filipowski 16 now for Kyle filipowski John shy told his pregame hes healthy hes in a good place coming off that double hip surgery as neskovic drives in for two more great drive by nesk just pressing the screen McCain left alone in the corner defensive rebound young filipowski Ryan young playing a point Center Spot from the mid post there another back door cut and dunk by Philip Applause palski Williams no and then it deflects off of filipowski and will stay with the big Applause green if it first time try it again Brian Young with the back door cut to filipowski there and hes a sophomore now he knows where the camera is yeah he knows where the ladies are he knows whats going on around hes got Duke up by 24 first three and A2 minutes out of halftime and a foul called on McCain filipowski has got eight of the 10 for Duke thats his four out half time thats McCains fourth foul again and you can tell sh wanted to trust him and leave him in a game and this is where as a Young play here you you your coach is trying to trust you and you got to prove him and let him know when youre a head guy like Jer McCain you got your third foul got to be smart there and not pick up the fourth and theyre going to need him in bigger games in the next two games to be exact the 12th rank Arizona and fourth rank Michigan State coming up good drive again by Duan neskovic known for his shooting but he attacks and hes got 14 but he shoots the ball so well you have to get up and press him on his shot and when you shoot it that great it makes it a lot easier to drive by guys B mofin said hes not going to get easy looks in this game good drive by roach Roose just catches it on reversal and Jab step left drives right down the middle finish him with that strong hand right hand Williams tough one from long range contested by Foster so Duke by 24 first 4 and A2 minutes of the second half and heres filipowski going to work and hes fouled by McCrae thats just what you want to see out of filipowski there just driving from the F from Five Five Spot just put so much pressure on your defense Duke up 24 here early in the second Music half flip and its kind of crazy to think that he played and was so successful last year as a freshman knowing that he would probably need what he ended up having in the off season surgery on both his hips to basically shave down the hipbones and adjust what were as he describes it football shaped hipbones into something a little more oval and as he says I feel like a regular human with hips and hes noticed the difference in terms of what hes capable of lifting and how free he is movement wise all I can say to that is ouch that sounds so painful I couldnt imagine playing even though I can relate I know how it feels to walk around in pain with these knees of mine but he looks great right now and for a reigning ACC Rookie of the Year in ACC tournament MVP with bad hips and now hes healthy look out college basketball what do you think of the nickname bestowed upon Him by associate head coach Jay Lucas of twoip Laughter flip thats good thats pretty good thats pretty good flip sits with 20 on eight of nine shooting so Reeves is in at the five for Duke Proctor saw an offensive foul on a screen set by Christian Reeds yeah but I as a guard play i want to see guard slow down Proctor kept going didnt slow down give Reed enough time to set it set the screen and thats one of those as a point guard Proctor will look at film and tell a big fell I got to slow down and wait on you to get your Fe set Tys Proctor so lethal in the pick and roll game on road drives attacking Reeves kicking out neskovic Shaylen Blakes was reaching that time and he cannot leave neskovic hes shot 42 from three on a year last year you dont want to give a guy like that open looks 23yearold senior who last year had that breakout season got 12 a game hes got the rebound here off the Proctor Miss and Dartmouth can slow it down still a long way to go in this second half yeah Duke you dont want to lose your defensive intensity right here Philip pasy is out of the game and this will be a concern all year long how does team looks when hes not on the floor Cornish in the midrange you dont expect it to be often that filipowski is going to be out but when forced into those situations its going to happen and even just the course of a game he as we say that hes getting up coach sh seen enough hes putting them back in the game but its going to happen at some point foul troubl or not needing the rest and with the guards they have you can see ball screens and turning a corner like this with Reeves out there its going to be impactful because you got to honor the live tag rotation with the four guards they have in the floor its a good look for this group Jeremy roach is up to eight for your starter now here with the Blue Devils now what the four guards doke can switch a lot and Reed will just stay between his man and the basket when Rose steps out but he left it short all right so here are the four guards with Reeves planted down on the right block youll see them revers it and theyll try to drive Lanes but ultimately Reed will come up roach was feeling it no Johnson on the accelerator tipped around by McCrae and off the top of the backboard did McCrae tip that in or did Reed tip that in both guys are going for the lose ball its going to go to McCrae lets give it to McCrae Captain who brings a vocal and Leadership presence to this team a lot of physicality and toughness as well out of Englewood California heres Proctor off the ball screen theres the lob Reeves The Fetish thats what hes in its great to see that hes earned the right to play as a sophomore we talked so much about the other sophomores this is the other guy that fourth sophomore that take thats taking a jump and he has the ability to defend and rebound and thats what you want to see the off a total of 41 minutes last year scored a total of 20 points as neskovic is up to 19 and thats going to be his contribution to this Duke team hes going to catch it off lives theyre not going to throw it to him in the poster PL factor for three early and often you want him in attack mode at all times and scary sight to see that guy knocking down threes with his size and playmaking ability hes got eight points to go with seven assists for CRA navigating the screen on a reverse no followed up by Johnson and he will get two free throws on the other side Dukes got a 6339 lead with Under 12 to go in the second half in the opener at Music Cameron basketball assister turnover ratio was great what were seeing tonight is the Improvement of what he worked on and an improvement in his field goal percentages from the field and from three shooting 50 from the floor and 50 from three right now and I dont expect him to have those numbers from three all year long but again if he can get the round 40s and high 30s with his high IQ and playmaking makes him you know that sky is a limit for him you were having an interesting discussion about that shooting with the coaching staff today for Duke its different being able to shoot the three and being ready to shoot the three I thought that was the the is with him a year ago fundamentally hes clean his shots looks great its good there thats not the concern thats not the concern some guys you got to make mechanical adjustments to their shot with him he just wasnt ready to shoot and he just would catch it and wait and hesitant and he just didnt have a rhythm and I think now hes more aggressive more assertive and when you know when coaches is giving you the confidence to take that shot it just makes things that much easier and I think hes the benefit of that and well see that his game take off this year because of it hes listed 8 lbs heavier as well this year Tyres has said his upper body is a lot stronger and he thinks hes gotten more explosive and quicker just watching him tonight having seen a lot of him last year I would agree looks more explosive well I thought he was always really good with that I think it really helps him as on a defensive end but he was already a really good Defender I think it helped him finish in the paint when he attacks the rim follow away for filipowski with the shot clock winding down and then young got Stripped by Jaren Applause Johnson coming up on 11 to go duke by 22 good back cut again and neskovic is up to 21 points great cut back door cutting again this five out and the cutting and the pressure theyre doing a great job of looking and finding it their teammates late at the rim and when you got back doors you got to turn and run you cant just look your head and throw your hands in the passing lane Foster finishes and then Stars down neskovic kale FS has done a really good job of putting pressure in the rim when hes been in the game in transition and in the half court Nicola dimitrievich with the dribble hand off and then the pop got it back off the shot fake couldnt finish got his own Miss and that was bumped underneath by Ryan young so 21 for Duan neskovic look at his got to have a big when youre playing Five that can pass like this great cut by neskovic catching filipowski sleeping on the defensive end and Caleb Foster just really does a great job of changing speeds drives there hesitates defense rotates back to the defender closes drives to the rim and finishes hes doing a really good job of mixing up speeds thats something that takes time to to adjust for young guards to do and hes got it early asovic lost it on the way up and Dukes got it back Midway through the second half roach pulls up its great to see Jeremy roach just one of those guys hes a senior fatle tested played in all the bit games and its great to see him confident knocking down shots good off ball defense from Foster roach accelerates the leowski and a foul defense to offense no one does a better that time great stop Jeremy R pushes it unselfish play finds filipowski chance for an and one great defense there by Foster Coast to Coast by roach finding the big fella rewarding him for running the floor somewhere durman Clint Applause smiling well that was interesting right before KY filipowski was about to shoot a free throw Romeo Myrtle 20 in Black for darmouth kind of bumped him at the free throw line and they got locked up for a moment here right here Myrtle still with a little something hey hey hes a competitor hes down 20 hes down 26 hes like I aint taking this thats what you want to see a little fight theyre not intimidated theyre still competing captain from Sweden and off the bench for Dave mcgloins group you often tell your group when when theres a talent discrepancy like this you tell you guys we may lose the game but we sure as heck cant lose the fight and theyre still out here fighting tonight theres myrtle back out now Brandon Mitchell day on the drive no cleared by Applause Foster roach navigating the ball screen great stretch here by Jeremy roach just putting so much pressure on the rim comes off the ball screen under control no one stops the ball change of speeds gets to the rim easy layup for a pvi pro uh product hes got a dozen hey Saturday morning the ACC hotle crew will kick off today in Chapel Hill at 1100 am eastern pregame show leads into Boston College Virginia Tech at noon theyll have your halftime coverage their pre and postgame shows as well back at 630 to wrap up the afternoon and get you set for Carolina and Duke at 800 Duke 6 and3 they had that walkoff field goal on Thursday against wake Proctor gets into the lane and backs it out and now mve to Foster Proctor for Philipi too easy you can tell they didnt communicate on the switch by the big no help comes easy two by the big man Music its 15 mens basketball players this group unanimously signed a petition to pursue unionization they wrote an oped in the student newspaper back in Hover New Hampshire about their motivation for it and they said in part that theyre unionizing to be compensated like other student employees Dartmouth meanwhile in a 4day hearing that concluded a few weeks ago they say the players are not employees and well see how it all shakes out a decision is expected to be written and handed down in the coming weeks and then the process who knows could play out a lot longer than that afterward its the age of College athletics we are in well see how it shakes out meanwhile here at camer we got 734 to go and Duke is in control theyve been very efficient offensively in the second half yeah Duke Blue Devils are shooting 70 second half and a lot of thats been theyve been done a great job of turning turnovers and quick shots into into baskets and just got caught that time Caleb Foster got stuck behind Mitchell day there in the post and just got buried too deep young fellas got to get around in front when he switches on to a bigger guy like that split at the line from the sophomore from St Louis Brandon Mitchell day and now tyres Proctor at the controls TJ Powers into the game as well 12 and one another one of those very talented freshmen and his Collegiate debut misses from deep and a push off is called on Monroe hey what a week 11 ACC Network football lineup weve got for you on Saturday starts at noon Eastern Boston College and Virginia Tech couple of three and2 teams in the ACC then its to Yankee Stadium pit and Syracuse and we cap the day with Duke and Carolina at 8 all three games also available on the ESPN app think Ryan Leonard to play that game Riley lonard play that game a man its its been one of the the real disappointments you feel for him that teams gotten off to such a hot start and he tweaked that Music ankle and off for Duan neskovic got the bump and Monroe couldnt clean it up tipped around underneath and last Touch by Jackson Monroe you got the young group out there now you got Four Freshman out there so they get a chance to see and particularly for P for Stewart they didnt they werent in the early rotation and Sh said to us early hes going to these guys are going to have to force him to make you know for him to play them and be interesting to keep an eye on those guys development as the season continues and John sh went eight deep in the first half and remember without Mark Mitchell you can basically say all right so they theres your top nine the guys you expect to be the starting five at least at the outset with McCain in that group and then young Foster Reeves and Blakes apparently the first four who come off the bench and then it was Stewart as the 10th guy into this game and then power at number 11 I mean youre talking about top 30 National recruits being 10 and 11 but its what happens when youre you have the class ahead of you and usually Ty the Tyrese Proctor and the filipowski they dont come back so these guys come in and theyre learning to jump and how hard it is and sometimes you come to situations and youre just forced the play I think jerem McCaine is another fresman just fouled out got his fifth foul and shot the ball well early but hes been in foul trouble throughout the day and thats his fifth it is H McCain and it is his fifth so his Collegiate debut ends with 610 left to go five fouls and 15 manes some of that is can control you want to have a controlled aggression when youre a freshman coming in its the first game of the year youve been practicing against your teammates youre ready to play against someone new and opening night and theyre definitely going to need him in the next couple of games so hes got to settle down shake this one off get ready for Arizona coming in on Friday but so back to the discussion about the depth and the rotation right I mean that thats how deep youre getting into the bench and we havent even talked about Jaden Chu a guy whos got a defined skill set yes he hes probably the best catch and shoot guy on a roster so again he he has the luxury of just forcing guys to say this is the standard this is what I expect out of you in the defensive end and all those things and if they dont do it they just come out of the game and hes going to be able to do that but with this freshman group they got to earn the right to play and I think thats a great thing and for the team team that have the goals that this team has of winning a national championship with the talent that they have its a great message to send Foster slices for two he just done that all night got to his spots put so much pressure on the rim stop shot his floater there this is what you want to see on the defensive end he got a hand around but trying to deny that high post pass you think theres a chance Caleb Foster ends up being in the starting five at some point this year I think everything well learn about this team early you know they they coming out of the gate this is you know they theyre up 30 now but they got Arizona with Caleb love coming back who understands what this that robbery is and its comfortable playing in this building they got Michigan State right after that so when we get through those two games well realize and well see what coach shs going to do with this team because hes trying to figure this group out he doesnt know yet do we want to play big do we want to play small we saw when Mitchell went out he immediately went back to his comfort zone of last year sliding p filipowski to the floor they have that depth they have that versatility what they lock in on as the season goes on well find out because its up to these young guys to show him you know force him to play him if not hes showing us hes comfortable with seven or eight guys already with Duke in control with 539 to go Jackson Monroe makes both for Dartmouth right now its power roach Foster Blakes and Stewart the five for John shy and thats part of the adjustment too right you got some of these guys with this perimeter Le group their offense is better the question with Duke when they play with these three guards the threepoint shooting is going to be better as we see its scaleb fost to get in the paint finishes right there their offenses will be better lets just see if they can sustain the defensive intensity that they had last year I mean hes just getting to the paint ready to shoot attack him its a great drive and finish there and hes a big guard hes a 65 guard has size hes defending thats why I asked the question of at some point could he be someone who steps into that group anyone could right in terms of talent but its a smaller backourt right now than than maybe is optimal its its its Jeremy roach experience and then you got this talented freshman coming in they they all of those guys will play but Kane brings in the the sharp shooting we didnt see a lot of it tonight but his ability to shoot and then you got Tyrese Pro that great problems to have but well see what happens as we move forward I mean it can go either way he could go big you know Char likes this bigger lineup it seems like it looks like it looks like from practice McCain has forced him to play small y hes earned the right roach has earned the right to start but he likes the bigger lineup and well see if one of the other freshman maybe pow takes a step maybe Stewart takes a step and we know filipowski vers utility allows him to play anywhere we still get to watch re is taking a step Brian Young is is consistent hes been named the captain as we see roach get to his spot there so its great problems to have within a game theyre going to be able to do that and thats why I think theyre so different watch out watch oh oh Im glad hes okay thats just scary to see just the guy with the standing vertical record now in Duke history breaking Zion mark from a few years back was ready to detonate yeah and instead it turned into to a Mike Monaco vertical moment a bump in the open floor and Stewart cleared for liftoff after the whistle this time going to pretend you didnt say that dont worry I mean but yes the still getting the passing Lane there and O youre right I mean thank goodness that than hes okay yeah just catches it finishes it he was ready he was ready to go through the roof of Cameron Indoor Stadium 406 to go duke rolling in the opener finals all matches right here on accn and on the ESPN app the home of ACC championships alongside Randolph chis Im Mike Monaco our entire crew behind the scenes led by producer will black and director Chad Lampman good atmosphere inside Cameron Cam and crazy is the night are as cool as you all Pig with your with your little fan blown on you lets be very clear one of the two announcers tonight brought a fan it was not me yeah and its only you though here steart up top from Blakes there you go great play coming out of the timeout to get your best athlete of dunk to get him going touth with 345 left in its first ever meeting with Duke Myrtle skips it and off the bounce Conor Christensen gives it up and now jiren Johnson drives dmitrievich Cann KN it down out of the corner good battle on the boards there and Johnson cant finish it up but Demitri Avic can everything is going well for Duke tonight they played great but this is just the concerns the shires had and gives him coaching moments coaches are always looking for something to teach and talk about no matter how well their team is playing but so youd say rebounding rebounding the basketball is something that and particularly from his guards because when hes gone with the smaller lineup theyve struggled with that Foster drops a foul yeah total rebounds right now even at 28 a piece yeah and they hadnt missed a ton of shots but its something that sh knows that this group is going to have to get better at and in a hurry because theyre playing older and physical teams over the next week back to back in Arizona Michigan State foster knocks down the first Fosters earned his way in the rotation we know hes quite hes already in 15 points tonight and kosha Raves about his work ethic and shot making ability as well off the Miss Christensen goes scrapping for it and and wrangles possession for Dartmouth inside a three to go as Dartmouth team we told you a lap back from last year seven of the top nine scorers as Christensen cuts and its going to be competitive as it always is in the ancient eight in the ivy Applause league team that lost Dame adelin after he graduated he goes to lyola and how about a cool story tonight with Dave mlin head coach has his own college teammates here seven of them from the Colby College mules he told us they come to four or five games a year they got their tickets on their own and they came here to Durham from as far as California and Main and theyre here supporting his team and they a and made sure they came in with the team right there as you see on the screen at the end of shoot around today yeah its great when your teammates come back and support you that way and such an iconic environment here at Duke its this is a memory that all the players and coaches have and regardless of the score you just know the history thats been made in this building and you dont know how many times youll be able to come in and no matter youre visiting team or not you just want to soak those moments in flakes knocks him down an opportunity that Dartmouth got when athletic director Mike her got announced a couple of summers ago as the fulltime athletic director he got a congratulator text from duke executive John Jackson who said if you want to come down Ill hold the first game for you and the Big Green here in Durham crowd loves it because Spencer hubard the senior who got a scholarship before this year the former walkon is into the game 55 and white shoot Applause it Stewart post entry for Reeves on a hook that doesnt go cleared by Kade H Haskins hubber trying to stick with Isaiah Robinson who steps Applause back John sh makes a substitution timeout with 144 to go calls on Neil begovic Stanford transfer yeah one of these guys got to get a shot go beovich or Hub somebodys got to get one up here H is on the practice squad as freshman year walked on a couple of seasons ago here it is here we go

work as hard as anybody they its great when those guys get a chance to get out there and play Amen to that and wons at the end of blowout wins its like catnip for a student section theyre all over all right double up shoot it theres Stewart final minute here in Durham almost blew a tire again yeah Stewarts got to change his shoes slipped the bunch tonight power stripped Robinson whisks it away and hub takes a charge hes doing it on both ends of the floor Jamie lucky on the call rewarding him sacrificing his body steps in front of the ball ball draws the charge Jaylen Blakes cant wipe that smile off his face and now listen to The Applause Crazies it is so good to have you back college basketball we missed you it is great to be here the opening night as well in color season second ring team

Blue Devils number two in the country start out one and0 we saw we wanted to see start out a little suck sluggish I think they sett up for too many jump shots they got going three started falling guys coming in the game stepping up so many weapons so many ways they can hurt you but one thing thats remained consistent tonight was the def
