continue whats been a good start pH two contrasting Styles in UAB and Davidson last weekend and winning the tournament in Asheville first game for both teams since last Sunday and off the opening tip itll head toward boy e state so Jack Clark excuse me will get the start today for the Tigers in place of chony Wiggins a little bit more size at the three spot only D1 opponent so far for the Broncos San Francisco team they knocked off last Sunday at home 63 58 did a nice job defensively against the highsc scoring Dons team back door pass Max rice sixyear player from right there in Boise because his dad is the head coach talk more about that in a bit on the intended pass down low but it was wide of Rody Anderson Paul joined in the lineup by the aforementioned Jack Clark as well as Joe Gerard Ian sheflin and Chase Hunter tiger team coming into this ball game averaging 74 points a contest giving up about 67 sheflin from the outside first points of the game for the Junior from just outside of Atlanta so much of the tiger offense has been their bigs being able to stretch it out shoot it from three Clemsons making over 10 threes a game Boise state is one of the best threepoint field goal defensive teams in the country Rody Anderson and a second turnover that hes involved in here in the early going big shoes to fill a point guard for Boise State picks up the first personal foul on either side and we saw Boise State go to a back door action in the first possession try to take advantage of Clemsons aggressiveness but taking care of the basketball is a big part as we talked to Coach rice before the game tigers having played all that many Mountain West Conference teams over the years Gerard kicks it to Hunter Chase Hunter feeling it from the outside itll go as a long two the tiger senior from Atlanta second on the team at 11 points a contest Ive been very impressed by Joe Gerards assists 35 assists per game so far this year hes done a great job moving the basketball rice one of their good outside Shooters cam Martin one of three transfers who will be vital to this team giving it away to Rice try to get it back to Martin out of bounds it goes three possessions three turnovers for a Broncos club that comes in averaging 13 over the first two games and its been a little bit of an issue for the Broncos uh were going to see Jace whitting getting here quickly uh see if they can calm the Broncos down a little bit Clark looking low Hall defended by Martin 69 on 610 and PJ Hall couldnt get the right rle boyy stayed a year ago at that second straight NCAA toury trip 51 wins in the past two seasons with a team based in Idahos state capital first bucket of the game cam Martin seven and a half playing his third game for Boise State Hunter emphatically wow welcomes the Broncos South Chase Hunter does a great job of pushing the basketball for the Tigers that was off of a made basket drove it all the way to the rim and got that Applause dunk Whiting backup point guard into the game rice spins and forces good defense by Gerard boy Chase not only the strong move but the elevation and the Tigers want to attack the RIM today Boise State does a great job staying home with Shooters on the perimeter to take away threes Tigers want to play at The Rim Hunter had the size Advantage Martin able to save it Whiting from a basketball family out of Burley Idaho Martin plated Kansas among his college stops shuzo began his career at Texas Tech second year in their program a guy whos really picked his game up scoring wise they did a summer trip to Canada and he blossomed while they were on their Journey no for Gerard battle inside going to get an over the back foul against Boise State and is off to a great start this season watching him on film hes got a great physical body he can make threes hes outstanding at The Rim his twopoint field goal percentage is excellent but hes a high level Defender his size and his strength he can guard anybody on the floor one through five fourstar recruit out of San Diego guy they were in on when he was in high school elected to go to the big 12 with Texas Tech but here he is now guy his role will increase this season with Boise State Dylan Hunter into the game for Clemson Gerard now hunter from the wing he might follow the pathway of his older brother Chase who slowly but surely in his Clemson career in years two and three three got more of a roll in his second season thats a nice looking shot we didnt see last year he sparked the Tigers in the second half against Davidson he made the first three of the second half and really kind of got them going to get back in the game on the left wing Tyson denh Hart guy we talked about in our open two years ago 44 Beyond The Arc last year had to play on the low block they needed his 68 size down low hes a very difficult matchup for sheflin when he stretches the floor that far shefin couldnt get it to go Tigers ran out to a 5 nothing Advantage Broncos a chance to tie or take the lead before the under 16 timeout yeah the Broncos have settled down after those first three turnovers foul inside going to go against Clark and thatll be the first on the tiger team got to break in the action early on in Little John Coliseum a team from the West a team from the southeast a twopoint game all right Ill see youre not just another policy holder to us we

thanks honey you suck at folding oh I know do three times the laundry and get a tide clean its got to be tied twoo game early on Clemson against Boise State out of the Mountain West Conference welcome back into Little John Coliseum with JD pal Pete yanity will give me the 10000ft view of these first four minutes or so that youve seen on each CH so the Tigers want to play at The Rim youa Chase Hunter off of a made field goal Drive the basketball get to the rim and finish and then Boise State when they dont turn the basketball over theyre outstanding offensively turn it over the first three possessions have settled down now theyre doing very well interesting that both these teams last game was last Sunday and maybe a little bit of game rust but obviously a lot of intensity in the practices and keep in mind visiting team coming from as far away as any opponent ever has to play a regular season game against the Tigers here in little JN its a really neat 10 days for Boise State you and I visited with Coach rice before the game they came out here Thursday they will leave and go here and play in the Orlando Invitational uh the ESPN event theyll play Virginia Tech so another ACC team but these are great times in the preseason as a team you know you get 10 days together youre going to go to an outstanding event in Orlando uh its really special time for those guys and again I think youd agree anyone sitting in this Arena watching the first few minutes of this game if you know something about Boise State some ACC caliber Talent all across their roster and in a league that had a team play for a national title a year ago San Diego State Broncos picked just behind them in the preseason Mountain West Pole Anderson one of their newcomers came to them from UC San Diego huge shoes he has to fill we noted earlier Marcus shaver Jr really good point guard for them who graduated after last years NCAA run inside Dean hard no and shefflin pulls it down here come the Tigers a big part of the game within the game is going to be which team can get the ball inside and draw some fouls against a big weve seen the ball going inside a couple times no foul so far hemway took it right at D Hart itll stay in the Clemson how much you think its helped the Tigers game against winter they took control early on to open up but UAB and Davidson from each end of the Spectrum in terms of styles how much does that help a team JD early in the season when youre seeing a diversity of of styles of play I think its huge especially in the preseason like this youre having to prepare for so many different things Davidson is a very tough cover and Davidson and UAB could not be more different and so a oneday prep to guard Davidson is really ch alling so down the road it will really pay off for the Tigers hemway stepped out of bounds first turnover in the game for THS Paul defending out high its another one of their newcomers Omar Stanley of St Johns transfer from the right corner this time the first lead for Boise State couple long range bombs for a guy who came in hitting just 20 but mind you they played a lower division School Vanguard which sounds more like an insurance or a security company to open up and then they played USF knocked away good defense inside Anderson gets it back from rice here come the Broncos Anderson tried to scoop not happening against RJ Godfrey his fifth block so far Leon Rices teams have always been outstanding shooting teams they havent shot at great so far for the two first two games this season RJ Godfrey has done a great job early in the season for the Tigers as a protector great job blocking that shot without fouling he state in a league thats pretty physical and there is a lot of talent in the Mountain West as youve come to know they had multiple NCAA turny teams last year so I dont think they ever want to have the term mid major associated with them no I was fortunate to to be involved in a few games at the Mountain West schools New Mexico in particular one of the great homec Court atmospheres that Ive ever been a part of unable to clean up inside RJ Keane 67 senior out of the Woodlands Texas been with their program for a number of years and theyre going to get Stanley for the reach in foul on Hall two very similar offensive styles from Boise State in Clemson both teams are going to spread the floor theyre going to bring a big to the top of the key want to create some angles for driving for back Cuts but also to drive the basketball from the top that we see PJ Hall Drive it to his left and draw Music foul three team fouls on the Broncos Boise state has played on an ACC floor before at NC State a few years back hall gets that one to go down and the Tigers top scorer is first bucket of the game outstanding job catching it PJ gets to his left shoulder able to knock down the jump hook nice reverse inside in traffic Omar Stanley 12 and a half points per game over his first couple bring some scoring in and a good shooter from the outside as well and a great drive by Rody Anderson to get in the paint right there dump it down to Stanley for an easy layup hem andway to Wiggins Tigers feeling it from Long Range three for four on threepointers much needed for Chanty Wiggins hes gotten off to a little bit of a slow start this year came off the bench today but he able to get in there get an early three for Coach Brownell didnt score against Davidson so thats got to feel good had to go a week with that thought in his mind Stanley tried to get it down low first turnover in a while by the Broncos its their fourth Alex eming way driving the basketball finding Chanty Wiggins on the perimeter as we said you know much needed from chony Wiggins to be able to get that confidence going again big three right there Hamond way and the Tigers looking to build the lead back up but Stanley knocks it away and a strong move around Wiggins try Wiggins committing his first personal foul be the second on the Clemson team soar Stanley originally from just outside of Kansas City was at St Johns and case youre not familiar with college hoops it uh was a bit of a uh house cleaning when Rick patino got to the flushing Queen campus and hes one of those who moved on and they love having him out of toison he gives them athleticism at the he can really score the basketball he played very well on the Canadian trip that they took this summer averag 15 points per game but he gives him a little bit of a counter punch to cam Martin with his athleticism and his Rim finishing ability hes a very good shot blocker very nice player for the Broncos seven of eight on free throws coming in she just his second miss wearing a Boise State Applause uniform hits one out of two the Broncos so far for him yeah Broncos love to go to a one two two after most free throws they they do it right there just try to change it up a little bit show the tiger something different think we Brad Brown L pregame talk about how they may see some 131 boss lighted just on the floor gave it to Hunter who gives to Wiggins nice work off the bench for Chanty Wiggins the tiger sophomore out of Grayson Georgia very good Post Feed by Chase Hunter was able to get chy on his uh that angle turn to his left shoulder and knock it Music down 24 wins a year ago a loss to Northwestern in which they had some injury issues some po troubles in that NCAA Atty game that was one of those ball games in their brackets a lot of folks probably had Boise State on the next line coming out of that game you can call an upset Big 10 team knocking off one of the favorites in the Mountain West and the Broncos have won 20 games in eight of the last 10 seasons an amazing stat for Coach rice Hunter hit the dunk earlier couldnt get the runner to fall Martin 69 light at offend Anderson shot clock at 15 Martin looking Baseline strong move with the Lefty hook over Lia no the rebound pulled down by Keane and theres Gerard Boise state has done a great job early in the season on the glass plus 18 so far the tigers are at minus two and a half thats a big key to the game today Godfrey cant find success rice one of two sons of the head coach on the team now Stanley backing in and Lio will pick up the personal be a third team foul on the Tigers first on BOS Lia the UNCG transfer how about chy wiggin so far Chanty Wiggins off to a great start right here knocks down the open three tigers are up by three going into the break we love our house the outdoor space is great but we do have invasive weeds where is hes up here at least

prizes this year they already have a trophy in hand wins against UAB and Davidson nail biters each last weekend in Asheville for the Asheville championship at the US Cellular Center came from behind in both games came from behind from 18 against Davidson the fifth largest comeback in Clemson basketball history but a great start to the season for the Tigers those are the types of games sometimes as a coaching staff its almost more of a relief than an excitement um but obviously huge thrill for the Tigers and as you said seven days off in between games Stanley now two or four from the line taken hard back after a brief rest with that face mask team with much more depth just like Clemson boisey State this year sheflin and Hall usually finishes that shot boy PJ would like to have that one back chance to once again tie or retake the lead for the Broncos thats the guy they want to have the ball in the hands of offensive foul on D heartt and thatll be the first on the 6A junor out of Spokane Washington out of the timeout coach rice goes to a pick and pop Deen Hart drives it downhill Joe Gerard puts his feet in front Ive been impressed by Joe Gerards defense so far this year the coaching staff in the summer talked a lot about coming from the zone at Syracuse the adjustments to playing manto man hes worked hard defensively and there thats a big charge against a uh very large young man all we heard about was 16 points a game returning leading score in the ACC can shoot and obviously all that on his resume but he takes pride in the D as well also trying to attack the basket and he does working inside on the 65 in Max rice outstanding drive right there the Tigers continue to get the rim test the Broncos shot blocking ability Tigers open up the game with a 50 run rice Martin leads them in rebounds scored about eight points in his first two games a piece that time Hall with a nice defense PJ came in leading the team with six blocks Josh Beetle on the floor Hunter another burst of speed to the basket finger roll goes andll head of the line you see the Tigers continue to attack the rim Chase Hunter comes downhill off that handoff from Josh Beetle and Josh Beetle gave the Tigers a huge lift on Sunday off the bench against Davidson great job right there by PJ Hall defending cam Martin in the post plays without fouling and then as we mentioned the Tigers want to play at the basket right there Chase hunter gets downhill able to get the uh Rim finish now go to the line for one 88 unlimited attempts of course over his first three games seven points last Sunday against Davidson 16 in that big win against UAB and he clch down the stretch the two free throws with just over 4 seconds to go against UAB to put the Tigers back ahead and eventually win the basketball game Tigers just like that build the lead out to Music seven Chase Hunter with seven points to lead the way and you see the tiger big stepping out trying to extend some of these catches from the Broncos try to push their offense out just a little bit rice drives on Gerard cant hit the pullup Clemson looking to build in its largest lead so far in transition Beetle Stanley defends Beetle reverses and you see the tigers with a three guard lineup right now Gerard Josh Beetle Chase Hunter great pitch ahead Josh Beetle attacking the rim getting a layup for the Tigers right here driving it to his left takes it to the other side of the rim against the shot blocker lays it Music in Geo makes car insurance his easiest loving parmesan say when say when say when when with 247 emergency roadside service its easy to Geico fresh CL pepper yes please o my cable internet bill exploded thats some yada yada but Metro has 5G home internet for 20 if youre eligible with no exploding bills and not a yada yada good Im tired of rearranging these 5G home internet for 20 only at Metro Josh Beetle showing you the kind of moves that made him a three star coming coming out of Cardinal Newman in Columbia tiger sophomore guard red shirk sophomore from Columbia outstanding player probably the Tigers most athletic perimeter player great job attacking the rim right there to his left hand another player whose scoring role could increase this season Martin thought otherwise about a three tries for two on Hall and you know The Scouting Report says if youre going to go at PJ call thats the way to do it with a pump fake the Broncos do an outstanding job of using shot fakes at The Rim Martin uh D Hart even rice theyll go down there they use their body very well get PJ Hall off his feet right there out of the timeout and draw the foul first on Hall tigers with four opening half fouls five so far for Boise State so Hall will get a rest until they under eight and thats been a point of emphasis by the Clemson coach coaching staff they want PJ to stay on his feet rice and it go to the line I know you studying the Broncos early in the season I was very impressed not just with Max Rices shooting ability but his craftiness at The Rim you know hell get down there hell give you some shot fakes step through just as he did right there hes going to get to the free throw line outstanding score for the Broncos sixyear guard his dad is over his left shoulder the head coach of this team well talk to you more about Leon rice in a moment middle of Three Brothers all have played college basketball older brother Brock whos now involved with the Boise State athletic program was at a lower division school and then younger brother Kade a freshman on the team Max has had a nice career second Team all Mountain West a season ago and he brings the Broncos back within seven coach rice talked about how proud he was of how his son Blends in and how hard he works outstanding player the second team Mountain West Conference guard in the preseason is going to have an outstanding year Beetle nice move over Whiting but couldnt get it to go Whiting a sophomore did a Mormon mission to Finland after his high school career a little bit older than your typical sophomore thats going to go down from the outside for and a chance to make it even bigger than it is already outstanding driving kick right here knocks down his third three fouling has been a bit of an issue for Clemson so far in the early season since that timeout tigers have fouled in three straight possessions now averaged 11 a half a season ago in his first year with Boise after transferring from Texas Tech opportunity to become the first player on the court in double figures and with all the preseason accolades for the Bronco players quietly leads the Broncos in scoring right now hes got 10 so far today three made threes outstanding player very difficult match match up well you got to think Brad Brownell and the staff said number two on boisey state as the steal by Max rice in a good one ahead to Hunter back to defend traveling is the call six turnover for the Broncos you figur the tiger Scout was all about stopping number two Den Hart and then figuring out the rest from there absolutely um though has been so impressive in the way they play together Max rice talked about it after the San Francisco game how good of a passer heart is and that makes everyone else on the roster a better score sheflin and Hunter couldnt find the handle Tigers led by nine moments ago trying to build on this threepoint lead Gerard off the pump fake inside Godfrey and right back up with it RJ Godfrey 12 points against winr was outstanding in Asheville against Davidson gave the Tigers a huge Lift Off the Bench Music Tigers actually coming into the game negative in rebounds about three rebounds fewer than the opposition but RJ Godfrey doesnt realize that the sophomore from Georgia getting it done on the glass a huge offensive rebound puts it back in tigers are up Geo makes car insurance easy enjoy your flight you too as easy as saying the wrong thing dad why would you say that why would you

coach for nearly a decade and a half a former Mark F assistant at Gonzaga JD the sky has come in and made Boise a basketball school theyre theyre in their Golden Era of Hoops its safe to say its amazing when you start studying the Broncos being on the East Coast like we are you dont know they have eight 20 win seasons in the last 10 years which is more than UCLA Arizona its really remarkable and hes done an outstanding job we played him when I was at the College of Charleston in an exempt event really really solid program playing in a conference thats quietly become some kind of basketball league the Mountain West and a fourpoint play chibuzo actually they said it was a two that he made in the wing I think they checked I think they actually checked and revised that during the timeout couldnt get it to go and up and in on the putb though by Omar Stanley 2624 game I think theyre saying the foul happened after the shot wow before the timeout so that was crazy and now the Broncos are in the bonus with over seven minutes to play in the first half Tigers led by nine just moments ago Clark on the perimeter with Gerard but thats not necessarily the game plan Gerard tries to go underneath rice and he does very impressive Joe Gerard weve seen him now twice use that shot fake get into the pain and score Jace Whiting mom is the head coach at our alma mater BYU his sister is a star player there as well so talk about from the basketball family dad was a really good player played professionally over in Italy so very impressive Boise State roster when you talk about the basketball background of so many of these players de Hart has a Clemson background well detail for you as we go on today heres Stanley from the right wing and look at Godfrey flying in pulls down another rebound and I believe that thats number two on the guy whos number two on your scorecard their star player Den Hart thats a uh thats a very big foul RJ gy comes flying in grabs the rebound um highle basketball game like today those are the calls that as head coaches we could live with uh without that one just let them play on its not going to change the game in terms of if you dont call that foul but thats a big foul on the first team all Mountain West Conference for Bert Smith Jeffrey Clark Brian schner are officiating crew today so he heads to the bench and a half to go probably wont see him to the second half Martin on his place defending the ball with Stanley Gerard pump fake on Rice now the pullup boy that would have been spectacular had Clark gotten that one to fall and we see the Broncos bring a double on PJ hall for the first time today Martin 69 likes to shoot now two of four in his brief time with the Broncos team from long range highly decorated Ford threetime All American as a D2 player has had an outstanding career and Dylan Hunter poked in the eye and the foul is called cam Martin year seven in college basketball one of the most decorated players probably in the country this year when you consider seventh year of college basketball threetime AllAmerican as a division two player won a national championship at Kansas and was a three time academic AllAmerican during his time as a D2 player outstanding career for cam Martin Grace just picked up his first foul just outside of Oklahoma City cam Martin Yukon Oklahomas his hometown had his D1 career high in their first game this year when he had 12 against Vanguard and played at Missouri Southern State one of the best division 2 programs in the country so many of the division 2os in the midwest outstanding basketball and so you see cam go from there to Kansas to Boise State after starting his career at Jacksonville State but an outstanding player Dylan Hunter just knocked down his first career his first free throw attempt of the season for the Clemson team and I thought Dylan really impacted the game Sunday for the Tigers against Davidson he started the second half the Tigers went three guards hit a big three early in the half it was the first three he had made of the Year bra the spark for the Tigers youre starting to see that confidence you compared him to his brother Chase and how hes settling in were seeing a jump from The Young sophomore from Atlanta the younger brother now with five points and the Clemson lead back out to three tigers are led by as many as nine in this opening half first ever meeting between Boise State and the Clemson Tigers in mens Music Hoops a Whiting the sophomore and again older than your average toomore after doing a mission trip right after high school a lot of experience really on both sides trying to spin on Godfrey couldnt get the fade away nice defense by the tiger sophomore forward and well get a double dribble called I dont know the last time Ive seen a double dribble called in a college game and so weve seen two calls one was the travel after the pitch ahead and transition which coach rice did not like and now that transition double dribble uh interesting early early in the year this is a blended crew part ACCC part Mountain West but obviously a very high level game very high level officiating crew Tigers averaging 10 turnovers a game have six so far to match Boise State Martin with d Hart on the bench trying to take on the scoring duties and Hunter the last to touch it just two seconds on the shot clock lets see what they do here shut up coach Music Whiting in rice and a shot clock violation first weve had in the game the seventh turnover for the Broncos right now early in the game thats been a little bit of an issue so far uh coach rice talked about it you know obviously uh not young guards experienced guards Rody Anderson but the loss of Marcus shaver from this past season who had 111 assists to 64 turnovers an outstanding guard for the Broncos theyre figuring it out a little bit on the perimeter right now taking care of the basketball Wiggins defended by The Freshman Andrew Meadow and he goes right over top of the Californian stands at 67 gives you a uh and youll see it closer on some close shots gives you a the look of some famous characters both inside of uh basketball and uh and of film lore over the years absolutely the staff said they even joked about it during recruiting and that that its been a point of conversation thats us back to us well talk more about it when we get a closeup of meadow and the reach in foul on rice and thatll be his second after he turned it over each team has put the other in the bonus well this is one that if youre rice to get number two that way youre just kicking yourself yeah both of those fouls DH Hart rice those are tough ones but were seeing a lot of the game within the game so these two head coaches know each other well theyve worked on the Nike circuit together as theyve traveled some but we were starting to see some changes out of timeouts Boise has started to double PJ Hall out of the last media timeout in the post now the Tigers come with a double that forces a turn over kind of that coaching matchup within the game Alex hemway on the free throw line tiger so far perfect on three attempts hemway just like the guy who was just there Dylan Hunter first free throw here in the fourth game of the season knocks it down to shoot the bonus so we mentioned the Freshman Andrew Meadow I mean Im sorry you look right at him youre thinking Hansen Brothers right off the bat I mean youre missing the story and then a little bit of Kurt rambus in there too and hes a guy from Santa Clarita California so I love the goggles brother movie Slap Shot if thats a dated reference lost on some younger viewers I wish I had that hair and a three star recruit they thinks really going to help them and and going to grow his game he his aaou team he played on bronny James aaou team so hes been around some high level Hoops in his day and he averaged over 13 points per game for the Broncos on their Canadian tour this summer so will be a very good player for Coach rice and the staff for years to come Tigers back out to a sevenpoint lead Bois state had shaved a ninepoint deficit down to two and hell go to the Music line hall picks up his second and thats going to be the second foul on PJ as you were saying thats a big call right there all right you you when you order a Big Mac in the McDonalds app today youll earn points you

on the bench with three personal fouls theres his dad Yukon denhard a unique first name and a very special connection to Clemson he was a student here competed on the track team as a dist runner at Clemson from 1991 to 93 he was from Spokane Washington but Bob Pollock the trck and field coach the Elder DH Hart tells us recruited him came here for a couple of years and he moved back out west and finished up his college career at Eastern Washington son Tyson grew up in the Spokane area where his mom and dad are teachers and he was recruited away from schools like Gonzaga to come to Boise State but how do you like that you schedule a game with Boise and well you know that their star players dad actually attended school so its been a really special weekend for Yukon deard the Elder came back got to see old friends they went to the football game yesterday so the first time hed seen a game in Death Valley since what the Ken Hatfield era and uh a lot of his friends from Clemson come to games regularly so they got to meet up and really a neat Side Story to this ball game the star boisey States dad attended the school his sons going against but the Sun not being able to play in this game for the final 6 and a half minutes of the first half CU a trouble big story Tigers up by five looking to add to that Hunter hung up and its knocked away good job by Martin to already his eighth double figure scoring game since he arrived at Boise State from Texas Tech last year Martin the Throwdown and one Godfrey picks up the foul RJ Godfrey got a little too close right there to cam Martin started to lean on that left shoulder the Scout was dont let him get to his left he turns the other way finishes at The Rim an outstanding play by cam Martin terrific finish going back to the free throw line again cam Martin just by the early returns looks like he has found a very good home to close out his long college basketball career and he knocks down the free throw he was just two of five coming into the game but of course its early and again boisey stay back within two after trailing by as many as nine during the opening half Wiggins and Godfrey out High Music hunter gets it back behind a screen from shefin outstanding shot by Chase Hunter he got off to such a good start shooting the ball from three last season a little bit slower so far this year but it started to heat up since the Davidson game knocks down his first three attempt 33 on the year Anderson drives past sheflin nice move Rody Anderson the UC San Diego Transfer at 63 went right past and then finished against a 68 chefin Anderson the quick guard the transfer from San Diego as you said LED all freshman in that League at 158 points per game last season Wiggins thought about it goes around and Godfrey there to finish RJ Godfrey does a great job for the Tigers his energy level his activity around the rim one of Coach bros favorites because of his activity you know you got bigs and Hall and shefflin who can kind of low block you then youve got guys who can play at The Rim like Wiggins and Godfrey and some real versatility with being able to attack and then you add in the guards like Hunter whos already thrown one down I think they complement each other very well Martin and theyll get him for the travel and thatll be a ninth turnover on boisey state here in the opening half of play 13 per game over their first two outstanding uh drive right here chony Wiggins get down gets downhill would like to be able to finish that but again RJ Godfrey coming in tipping it in led the team last year in field goal percentage uh outstanding sophomore from Georgia Chase Hunter experienced tiger senior Hamond way Anderson flying in for the rebound on their way to 24 wins in another NCAA trip last year boisey State knocked off the likes of Washington state Colorado and Texas AM and trying to get a win on acc floor theyre six and one since 2022 2023 against P5 schools the Broncos will play anyone anywhere tell you one thing guy came to them from Texas Tech playing any League thats a good looking jump shot off the dribble when you watch on his points total hes got 13 to lead all scores and when you watch him he reminds you of what in the NBA what they would call a three and D type guy can make an open three obviously can play at The Rim but an outstanding Defender got a hand on it from behind and was lobbying his case but itll stay in the Clemson end with 12 on the shot clock tough guy to defend because he can square up he can attack but also can shoot off the dribble strong move by sheflin just ran into trouble he did to finish the point on coach branell talked about it in his pregame its a very difficult matchup for the Tigers because he can play some four he can slide up as a three the Tigers have had success with a three guard lineup since the Davidson game so the matchup becomes very important and D Hart three fouls has picked up the load he kept the Broncos in the game right now already three double figure scoring games in their first three give them 15 so Music far tiger shooting 54 from the field 57 Beyond The Arc the lead though just a mere three off the inbound Gerard such a soft touch outstanding finisher around the rim very impressive what hes been able to do inside the threepoint line so far this season little pressure in the back court and can handle it as well as Clark defends that one of the reasons why Clark was in the starting lineup today because of their size on the perimeter I think so chony Wiggins theyre just trying to figure out that you know that third guard um I think the Tigers would like to be able to play a smaller guard there from time to time but as coach brunau has talked about their depth has been very effective this year but a lot of it is just trying to figure out which combination worked Jack Clark was hurt in the preseason uh Alex hway was hurt in the preseason so theyre still trying to figure themselves out first on Chase Hunter Anderson knocking down the free throw and thats his first of the season so Boise state is taken this will be the 14th free throw now and so its really when Boise state has not turned the basketball over theyve been very efficient offensively and theyre 11 of 14 tigers are five of five but based on Clemsons strategy coming in youd think it be Clemson whod gotten to the line 14 times as often as theyve tried to attack the basket Gerard again going strong Keane defended Tigers wanted the whistle threepoint game Broncos a chance to get back within one maybe time Anderson behind a screen from Stanley you see the differential as we wind down here in the opening half looks like coach bro is going to let him go right here looks like the Tigers will lead for a second time over the course of their first four games in this three and0 start coming up on five Gerard Clark couldnt handle it 4 seconds to go and itll head the other way Coach Brown Els disappointed in that possession ran a fade screen out action for Joe Gerard to get him downhill Gerard continues to attack off the bounce got to the rim but tried to kick it to Jack clar CL couldnt quite redirect to the corner eighth turnover the Tigers remember Leon rice used a timeout earlier to break momentum after they fell behind by nine so he doesnt have the use it or lose it in it comes Keane back to Martin what a counted had it gone for Stanley but thats how we arrive at halftime entertaining first 20 minutes of Hoops seeing really for Syracuse against the Tigers Joe Gerard just a small stat and if you follow Clemson you probably can get an idea as to where that little nugget was dropped in from to our boot Paul foul trouble put him on the bench for the stretch run of the first half he cant get his first attempt here out of the break and Coach Leon rice is going to start Omar Stanley here in the second half bring Tyson dehart Off the Bench Martin feeding drive to the basket Stanley the St John transfer has a chance to tie us up Omar Stanleys been very good for Coach rice so far off the bench today as we said he had a great summer coming over from St Johns there you see the cut catches it right there on the rim cam Martin is an outstanding passer for the Broncos both of these teams are very similar offensively their bigs can shoot but theyre both very good passers they werent a very deep team last year despite their 24 wins and at large bid to the NCAA attorney thats something that really has Leon rice their head coach excited the depth on this ball club and your seeing it from a lot of guys and Stanley one of those keys to the game Lets revisit those JD the big one for the Boise State Broncos was to take care of the basketball nine turnovers in the first half they have not been able to do that and then for the Tigers it was their shooting against the Boise State threepoint field goal defense so far the Tigers have shot the ball well how about the offensive rebound by sheflin for boards in the game hell try to add to his point total Clark flying in and theyre going to get the f now against and thatll be number one on the senior out of San Diego so the first two trips offensively for the Tigers theyve gone down low first to PJ hall now to Ian shefflin havent been able to finish but Jack Clark there with some activity on the offensive class and foul was on the floor initially it looked like they were setting up for free throws a team foul on each side early in this second half PJ Hall just two points so far of course came in averaging over 21 a game Clark losing knocks Down The Long two again another player that the Tigers want to get more involved offensively nine points per game last year at NC State outstanding shot fake into that pull up by Jack Clark Anderson tries to step through off balance boy that would have been a fabulous finish of course he wanted the whistle didnt get it Clark Hunter in transition Hall down low Stanley defending and from the wing the whistle and PJ Halls fortunate right now he that that very easily could have been a block on the other end Coach rice and the Broncos staff also and then PJs gotten a couple finishes at The Rim where he felt like he got hit that didnt go in uh felt like he could have gotten fouled the tiger senior take a deep breath right now settle back in 80 this year knocks down his first free throw attempt of the afternoon call the 20point games to start out the season against winr UAB then he had 17 against Davidson the fact that he started with backtoback 20po games was somewhat rare hadnt happened in the program in over 20 years yeah it was a team that I was on will Solomon 1999 2000 first two games of the Season came out uh 20point games has not happened very often in Clemson basketball back in 5455 star of the Clemson team back then established the record with 16 straight of 20 or more to begin that campaign from the corner Clark closed late probably impacted the shot Hunter tiger trying to build in a fourpoint lead after we were tied at Music 41 Gerard rice who picked up a couple of fouls in the first half defending Clark cant finish shefflin scrapping Tigers keep the ball Hall and itll go back to the line the Tigers have continued to get the basketball to the rim they have not been able to finish here early in the second half but have been able to get to the offensive glass PJ Hall drives it right here tries to get to the other side they get the whistle and the foul but go back to Jack Clark for just a second the NC State transfer has done an outstanding job here early in the second half creating second opportunities for the Tigers on the offensive glass Martin second foul tigers have 21 rebounds nine on the offensive glass andall extends the lead to five and that was something that Boise state has done an outstanding job of so far this season one of those games was a nondivision one game but coach rice and his staff take great pride in their defensive rebounding the Tigers actually have not rebounded it well this year as good as they were last year plus three theyre minus almost three this year thats something that the coaching staff feels like theyve got to get better at and granted against only one D1 opponent in their first two games Boise State coming in nearly plus 20 and thatll obviously come down but theyre a team that looks to be Plus in rebounding on both kns its very got to a sixpoint lead its very interesting when you read the notes Boise States size is actually just slightly bigger than Clemsons which tells you something about the Mountain West Martin hit a three in the first half misses everything that Applause time Clark got screen Hall cant knock down the threepoint trve PJ 40 Beyond The Arc so far rice second Team all Mountain West performer able to drain the tray and Max rice can heat up very quickly he made two threes and 19 seconds against San Francisco to push the Bronco lead out coach rice wants to get him going come out of the halftime his first field goal now the steel rice in transition thought about it too long a little bit of hesitation now the Tigers push the pace Godfrey down low and called for a personal thatll be his second great Pace right there by Chase Hunter he had the transition push off the max rice missed three decided to pull it back allow RJ Godfrey to settle down at The Rim right there very good possession by the senior tiger point guard boy had 43 Beyond The Arc Tigers 50 four of eight for Clemson 6 and 14 for Boise which was shooting just 24 on threepointers over the first couple of games BOS Lia back on the floor Clark and itll be a kick ball by King Tyson DH Hart makes his first appearance of the second half right here just a few minutes into the second half three personals when he went to the bench with about 6 and 1 half to play in the opening half I thought hed only picked up his second and I have a feeling they modified that in the Box Score afterward Gerard his kind of shot from the wing outstanding Shot by Joe Gerard he had a possession against Davidson where he took back to back threes in the same Possession It was one of those moments where you could see him Step Up knocks down his first tray in three attempts Thomson back up by six Gerard defending rice Anderson will set things up shot clock coming up on five Anderson doesnt have the size on Godfrey Baseline and Kean couldnt save it for his Applause team great defensive possession there by RJ gy to switch that ball screen looking at to pass in said Gerard cant get the shot to go and a foul inside look like Omar Stanley just picked up his third and thats the case Joe Gerard the Clemson Tiger Sharp Shooters getting it going from late for the Tigers really a feared weapon in the ACCC for the past several seasons he is and he made his 300th career three this past Sunday against Davidson I think youve really saw saw him start to settle into his role here for the Tigers hes starting to feel very comfortable now were talking during the timeout a lot of really great developmental opportunities even for a guy with his resume since he arrived in Brad brownells program one of the big reasons why he chose Clemson was because of PJ Hall and Chase Hunter he knew he was going to get open looks because of the space they would require turnover inside Godfrey was trying to go strong to the hole Tigers led by as many as nine in the opening half dardt has not been a factor for Boise State and thats going to change going to have to change if they W have a chance but they give it up again great off ball defense by Lia there to rotate over on that back cut Hunter now Godfrey down low Gerard trying to lose the defender rice finishing as Rice hit the deck great pass by RJ Godfrey youre starting to see Godfrey become very confident offensively you saw him drive it pivot then take his time find Gerard hes playing with good Pace right now back out to an eightpoint lead Martin light of offend soft touch gets the roll outstanding possession for the Broncos the Tigers have pushed it to eight or nine a couple of times much needed basket from cam Martin there Broncos second player in double figures Martin now has 10 hes four of six from the field Clark difficult shot with a hand in his face from denart Boise he stayed on the Run Clark repays the debt wonderful job by the NCC transfer his second steal as a tiger heres Gerard outstanding drive by Joe Gerard there this game has quickly became very physical every drive to the basket theres a lot of contact look like that Clemson back in front eightpoint margin back door play knocked out of bounds by Joe Gerard Tigers trying to knock off another Mountain West team Joe Gerards ability off the dribble has been outstanding so far for the Tigers this year showing that hes much more than just a catch and shoot guy the 35 assists per game the ability to score in the paint and then the denial right there in that back cut was outstanding thats not Music easy and itll stay in this end Clemson onespeed Air Force out of the Mountain West in an nit semifinal game and Clemson has a couple of Mountain West connections on their bench Special Assistant Jeff Reynolds was a longtime head coach uh at for the Air Force Falcons so he knows Leon rice in the program very well for the Applause Broncos jacee Whiting ni point guard for them the sophomore now Mart backing in on Hall cant get the hook to go dardt offensive glass witing out front that would have been big for the Broncos psyche if nothing else t a chance for a 10point lead Hunter delivered Chase Hunter continues to push the ball in transition for the Tigers is able to get out on the open four right there do what Chase Hunter does best push the basketball finishing at the rim for the absolutely the Tigers were very good defensively last year leading the ACC an opponent field goal percentage coming out of Asheville this past weekend they felt like that was something that they could do better uh and theyve done that today Boise state is an outstanding offensive team they wanted to clean up the the fouling at halftime 14 free throws for the Broncos Brad brenell places a huge emphasis in practice of playing without fouling but Boise state is very hard to guard youre seeing a moving a ton right now a lot of back cuts a lot of cutting to the rim really testing the Tigers rebounding big story and the pantic Clemson is five of nine Beyond The Arc against a team that was holding opponents to 24 in the early going also a big part of this game biggest lead for the Tigers so far out of the timeout called by Leon rice the Boise State head coach and well get a foul down low what do you know out of a timeout PJ Hall so thatll be his third number three on Hall hell go to the bench Ian shefflin will come in so now both of the first team all League guys for Boise State and Clemson with three fouls DH Hart stays on the floor at the bottom of your screen having picked up three in the opening half Martin has been a goto guy for them today already 10 points hell spin around Ian sheins defense and he matches his best effort so far he had 12 in their opening game against Vanguard and cam Martin is showing you he can turn to either shoulder the Tigers have played his left shoulder thats the second time hes turned to the right Keane defending Gerard Gerard 13 points to lead Clemson looking to add on couldnt get it to fall but Godfrey could RJ Godfrey continues to be active on the offensive glass for the Applause Tigers Godfreys that kind of player because he can get so high up you got to stop based on the clock issue but he can he can get so high up with a leaping ability hes really the perfect player to try to follow up on the offensive glass cuz he he leaps so straight so vertically if you know what I mean well he comes from a great athletic family his dad was in the NFL for over 10 years a linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys but I think the best thing Godfrey does hes obviously a tremendous athlete but he knows who he is you know hes Relentless to the offensive glass hes hes going to go try to get every single one of them and hes done an outstanding job for the Tigers early in the season hes their third leading scorer right now this year almost a travel by Stanley and now away from the ball a foul shefflin and he picks up his second personal foul so as we mentioned this game has become very physical very much like an ACC game foul count was 5 to one coming out of that last media timeout two quick ons on the Music Tigers getting a lot of attention after the big first half Stanley on the low block couldnt get it a fall strong rebound Down Low by Dylan Hunter hemway godre out High defends the hunter Brothers on the floor at the same time Chase exploring penetrates on Whiting knocked it away Godfrey fouled on the Music floor RJ Godfrey getting it done in a lot of ways for Clemson the highly athletic energetic AC transfer portal hes made the most of his sevenyear career started at Jacksonville State University and then transferred to Missouri Southern state three time AllAmerican three time academic AllAmerican wins a national championship at Kansas and now gets to complete his career at a really good Boise State thats an outstanding story and hes going to have an outstanding season outstanding set play out of the timeout hemway adding to the Tigers threepoint barrage first one made for him in two attempts lead grows to a 13 bigest so far thats a big plus for the Tigers Alex has been hurt early in the preseason hes starting to get into a rhythm now D Hart has been contained once again Godfrey and sheflin doing good work near the basket that part of the game where Boise State in this second half has yet to get any kind of offensive flow going and time starting to run out on him Tigers LED 4138 at the break and can see the differential in points since halftime shefin forcing late in the shot clock Stanley the rebound and youre seeing a possession where coach branell wanted the Tigers to move the basketball side to side he felt like in the first three games they had gotten a little eager from time to time Tigers worked it late into the shot clock there tigers doing a good job denying good looks out on the wing in this second half Abu tries to defy that missing badly Stanley battles Godfrey coming away with it more Scrappy play by Ian shefflin to go with it the Tigers have been outstanding defensively in the first 10 minutes of this second half that was a great B uh Baseline Rotation by RJ Godfrey Hunter pretty move to set it up Godfrey right there for the bouns trying to get it to his teammate Dylan Hunter and he does shefflin and the foul will be called picking up another personal you cant say enough about RJ Gods activity on the basketball court and what that does for the Tigers he has become an outstanding Defender without the basketball he rotated over blocked the shot and now he comes up with the loose ball on the floor right there the way that the tiger post players compliment each other is outstanding RJ Godfrey is not a guy thats hunting shots or trying to shoot threes just really active on the offensive glass and outstanding offall all defense three now on who leads all scores with 15 but its been quiet in the second half s now in the bonus seven fouls against Boise State shein this does a lot of things really well well so far in the game from the free throw line had not gone to the line until then so early on in his junior year hes seven of seven on free throws 15point Advantage very important possession right here for Boise State they want to try to get a basket get a couple of stops together try to get this back under 10 rice shot clock at 10 Stanley looks low for d har heads to the basket change hands in the air kind of threw it down toward the hoop outstanding finish there by Omar Stanley the tigers are going to stay at home on the perimeter with other guys Oppo in particular Omar Stanley one1 in the post that ended a better than three minute scoring drought for the Broncos off the dribble Gerard pretty stuff I would say that Joe Gerard feels pretty comfortable in this other shade of orange now very da the Michael Jordan uh hands up look to the folks sitting on the Music Baseline Stanley rice as Gerard Hit the Floor wont go down though a tough go of it from the field in the second half for the Broncos and you see another possession here coach brell slowing in the Tigers down just a little bit he wants to get a good possession here wants to see him execute Gerard for Applause two Jo yeah Joe Gerard is playing really well came off that Baseline Pinn down he settled in very nicely for coach brenell and the Tigers 17 points five assists against Davidson last Sunday 18point deficit for denhard in Boise State and theyre all Mountain West player will head to the free throw line and the tigers are doing this right now with Chase Hunter on the bench PJ Hall on the bench so seeing Joe Gerard be what coach Bren Allen the Tigers thought that he could be when he made the decision to transfer to Clemson just an instant scoring kind of guy and once again a threat from threepoint range and also free throw line jumper right there he you can hit him three throw line extended I mean hes really got a lot of interesting aspects to his game Deen Hart likewise although he hasnt shown it today but fell that his coach will tell you pretty much is perfect in everything he does hes a 40 student as well as being really good on the course he has a great podcast too Pete I had a chance this week to uh check out his podcast he he interviewed the boy State quarterback he has his teammates on there coach rice has gotten on there a few times he is a very popular guy in Boise Idaho theyre going to get him to the bench with those three personal fouls give him five in the game just one of five though from the field Music Tigers extending a threepoint Advantage at the break now to as many as 18 here in the second half Gerard the guy you want to have the ball Hall back in the game says he and another Joe Gerard assist came off that pin down knew exactly where PJ Hall was going to be dumped it down got another assist Tigers havent needed all that much out of P J hall give him eight in the contest nice turnout on a Sunday afternoon getting back into it after that Anderson doged by Dylan Hunter Martin driving on Hall trying to get him a fourth personal call Godfrey helping Applause out rice off one foot Max rice is a very good scorer can put the ball on the deck drive it to the rim gets inside the free throw line right there and puts it off the glass seven for eight he averages 11 ERS though maintain a 16point lead coming up on seven to play Hall inside over Martin and one I think one of the biggest takeaways so far from this game has been the Tigers ability to execute offensively in the second half Coach Brown Al wanted them to slow down just a little bit be able to get the shot that he wanted theyre able to get it right there inside play that coach brell wants to draw it up hes done a great job in drive it kicks spaces gets threes but his ability to t attack off the dribble has probably been the biggest surprise uh hes very effective hes very efficient offensively been outstanding early in the season for the Tigers got off to a little bit of a slow start but it has really come alive in the last two games Paul unable to hit the free throw 18point Advantage with JD pal Pete yanity with you here in Little John first of the mens womens double header tiger women play after this contest against Longwood tough day for Den Hart but that was part of the Tiger game plan thats worked out so far Gerard again 15 attempts 11 inside of the arc so you think of this guy as one whos going to live out there and just try to hit threes but hes got a lot of game he does hes very crafty with the basketball hes an outstanding passer and theres some game twoo and hes size same Effectiveness yeah PJ Hall is very effective hes really come into His very comfortable with that little turnaround jump jumper where he can Elevate over defenders Stanley in the corner for Anderson cant get the bounce sheflin another rebound and this is the type of November basketball game thats going to help both of these teams Boise state is going to go on to play Virginia Tech in Orlando uh Clemson will play Alabama after alorn state but this is a very physical basketball game right now both teams will get better because of it Hall 0 for two beyond the orc and a foul on the other end is uh pretty nice for show but he wont get credit for the block and you know interestingly Clemson will return the game to Boise next year they did a home at home and Leon rice during his 14 years guiding Boise state has never had an ACC team come out there its got to be one of the few a tiger team has played in Boise before in the NCAA attorney back in the late 80s this is only the fifth game that Boise state has ever played against an ACC team but its a great home and Home Series its coaches that have gotten to know each other very well uh two teams that are very similar to Great early uh season match up for both of them Music Anderson go CLK picked up his second foul by the way just a fifth in the Tigers here was coming up on five and a half to go in the second half Miss on the fource by Anderson Rody Anderson is going to be an outstanding point guard for the Broncos got it going early in the second half but going to be very good for Coach rice throughout the season tigers have broken this game open on five of their last six pretty move Hunter and just as nice of a finish outstanding job by Chase Hunter being able to attack the rim that was a big part of the game plan for the Tigers their guards have been able to do just that the lead grows to Music 22 Martin drives on Applause Hall little contact and Hall with a glance to the closest official and thats one of those calls PJs not going to get that call right now after getting upset earlier in the second half I I believe officials remember those types of things um but PJ wants to play without fouling stay vertical right there which he did stay on his feet dont try to block it every single time you and everyone else whos ever coached college basketball with that thought I would suppose Chase Hunter has been outstanding on the bounce for the Tigers he can continues to attack the rim gets there to the basket able to finish there for the Tigers the senior guard is having a great season so far 17 on the shot clock as hunter gets it into Clark lot of weapons for the Tigers not that time for Gerard now two of five on threepoint attempts Boise stay trying for a late run Denard past Hall then sheflin and you see his versatility there able to drive the basketball make a change of Direction move and finish there at The Rim just his second field goal in the game hes two for seven from the field him seven in a contest closest thing to a run that Broncos have had here in the second half cutting what was a 22o deficit down to 18 Hall and skying for the rebound The 63 Whiting rice in transition hillfire backside rebound trow try and sheflin able to knock it away outstanding block out right there by Jack Clark he did not hit the rebound but he led to the rebound nasty spill for Gerard foul was on the floor so have a one andone opportunity on the line the the Tigers continue to execute offensively Joe Gerard great Pace tiger guards continue to play at the rim for couple of free throws upcoming played at Syracuse you probably know from just east of there in Glenns Falls New York so hes in store for the best winner of his life if uh the factor in snow and he hits the front end of the one and one outstanding player from the upstate of New York played for a very good Nike ebl team the Albany City rocks coached by the legendary Jimmy Hicks does an outstanding job they travel Jimmy yeah comes down to Augusta George every year for the peach jam outstanding program up there and indeed a 20point game for Gerard great free throw shooter tiger team has many weapons as I can remember them having in quite a while Martin strong move and thatll be a fourth on Hall even the sweet 16 team of 2017 and 18 which had guys who could score both inside and out and the lost story Ive always thought on that is that Dante Grantham got hurt in January and wasnt a factor as part of that run and how good would they have been and he stayed healthy but this team has as much resourcefulness maybe as Ive seen in in quite a while and so I think talking to the coaching staff this week this is a really talented team and so at times because they were so talented players felt like they werent being selfish they felt like hey I can go score and they could and so what ended up happening was they were playing at a little bit faster I dont want to say pace but just they were moving a step too quick and so Coach Brown L and the staff this week wanted them to slow down a little bit lets execute when we need to execute and youve seen that today is that what led to the big deficit you think in the opening half against Davidson I do yes you know they they they shoot the ball very well from three its going to be Clemsons best threepoint shooting team in Clemson history but they dont want to just rely on the first one lets move it side the side a little bit and find a better one and when you got a guy like that Hall who can do things like that didnt fall that time youve got to keep defenses honest youre going to keep defenses honest cuz theyve got to make sure theyve got someone to help on him Martin trying to build on a real good scoring game for him Hunter another rebound and I think an indirect part of that is the way the Tigers wanted to attack the paint with their guards today when the ball touches the paint and then it comes back out to three those threes become much more uh efficient Hunter cant get it to fall fou down low Whiting trying to box out Hall second on Whiting and now with 10 on Boise State two free throw shot opportunity upcoming for Hall who despite his foul trouble a fourth consecutive double figure scoring game with 12 told you boys he stayed on a 10day Eastern swing during this break up coming from for them with Thanksgiving heading on down to play three games at Disney theyll see Mike young of Virginia Tech on Thanksgiving Day Tigers return to action right here in Little John against alorn State out of the swack coming up Friday night 800 pm and Coach rice talked a little bit about you know Boise state has done this several years now they came to the Charleston classic a few years ago theyll go to Orlando for the ESPN Invitational loves to bring his team back East for those events he says the weathers a lot better than it is right now in BO folks here in the arena can say they saw a game with a team that traveled the farthest as king cant get it to go rebound Martin traveled the farthest of any regular season opponent going to go down from the outside for but his first points of the second half after 15 in the opening half of play boys he stayed roughly 2300 miles to come play this game its the farthest any regular season opponent has come to play Clemson on the mens side I believe the Oregon women who came here during the Great sabrino ncu freshman year when she had her first ever triple double on this court pretty sure thats the furthest uh regular season opponent to travel for a any game here in Little John Coliseum and this is the future obviously the ACC expanding Stanford cal um you know talking to coach brownill back in August right after it happened you know we talked a little bit of scheduling whats it going to be like those types of things and they really dont know yet you know they confirmed the threepointer by the way for so give them 18 and has had an outstanding day you know whenever you talk about guys Boise state has had an outstanding group of guys that have been able to go on to play professionally both in the NBA and overseas yeah this will be a game that IO will be able to go back and look at against a very good Clemson defensive team you know just because in an 18point game we have time to discuss it I would suppose the basketball model is scheduling and of course with all the flurry of reports and talk that theres been about what the ACC actually looks like moving forward with the three new schools coming in how many of the teams currently in the league may still be here Hunter looking to add to his day and the foul will be caught on Whiting youve got to figure now that they schedule early season pre January conference games if indeed a Clemson with Cal Stanford and SMU also includes those currently in the league got to think a lot of those games against K and Stanford theyll try to schedule a Clemson to go out there during the December break when theyre theyre not in class and play those two and then that might be an opportunity to add another game on that trip just to get value out of the trip boy Keane went for the slam Hunter rejecting out of bounds for Boise State no whistle clean block by Chase Hunter and you can continue to see Chase Hunters athleticism today he had the big block in the first half now hes going to rotate over right here and block this dunk at The Rim Chase Hunter has been very very good today showing his athleticism and his length at The Rim he dunked it in that basket in the first half that time he rejects right in front of its Rim Whiting lobs to the wrong Applause team they cleaned up an early flurry of turnovers they now match Clemson with 11 but the story of this game is when the Tigers half court defense in the second half another for Gerard outstanding job by Joe Gerard the Tigers have really executed well in the second half its not just the turnovers its the possessions theyve had theyve made Boise State guard laid into the shot clock PJ Hall playing from the top of the key uh Joe Gerard moving without the basketball thats been the biggest growth that weve seen from the Tigers today has been their ability to execute in the half court when they needed to that timeout called to get guys like Gerard and others off the the floor Joe Gerards day will end with 23 points scored on nine of 17 from the field 50 Beyond The Arc getting half his six attempts there two of two at the line added four rebounds and three assists pretty good day against a very good team really good day really good day when you look at what PJ Hall did in the first week and a half those first three games and now you back that up with what Joe Gerard has done in the last two uh the Tigers will get a couple of days to prepare for alorn State on Friday then now the schedule really gets hard you know now its Alabama and and the teams like that theyll have to go to Pittsburgh for the first ACC game the Tigers will enjoy this a little bit and then uh its back to Music work Tigers about to improve to 4 and0 back door pass executed beautifully and the foul is called so RJ Keane will have a chance to go to the line gets his first point of the game the RJ whos made the most impact in the contest one RJ Godfrey a career high in blocks for the tigers with four in the contest and his defense part of the story here in the second half for Keane guy who missed last year because of an injury player theyre going to count on for some valuable minutes and hoping he can add some scoring touch the woodlands native out of Houston Texas Boise State and Coach Leon rice the staff has always done a very good job recruiting the state of Texas theyll play North Texas here in a couple of weeks but the Broncos do an outstanding job recruiting in Texas and RJ Keem going to be
