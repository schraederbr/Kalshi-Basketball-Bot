West North Carolina state has the top scoring bass backcourt in the ACC and Syracuse is number three so can have a lot of points up on the board tonight orange have not played since last Wednesday night and a nine point win at Tallahassee NC State beat Boston College by 30 on the road at Chestnut Hill Saturday afternoon and they have stayed in the Northeast and enjoyed themselves including a beautiful Bay here in Syracuse here is the Freshman Mets against sharkell Joyner Phil Covington Jr Bert Smith and AJ Desai on the whistle opening shot no good it got scrambled around and rolling into the corner was Greg Gantt to try and pick it up you see Gantt draws the start with Burns Marcel Joyner and turquoivion Smith it will stay with the orange I dont think Joyner could quite grab it here is Gerard weaving off an Edward string commits heres the rookie from California Bell knocking down the jump shot now Wes you notice that Mintz passed up that threepoint shot hes not a good threepoint shooter Bell who also passed up a threepoint shot is thats a really nice job to step inside and take the short Junction Dan what do we need to look for from NC State against this zone Im really curious to see what DJ Burns is going to do in the middle of that zone because hes a very good pass offensive rebound off the Joyner Miss by Marcel foul line area heres Burns a little Runner with the left hand thats what burns is at his most effective West if he catches the ball there and tries to dribble through the Zone the zone is going to have to collapse and make him give it up or take the ball tied at two on the soft Hook by Burns and Bert Smith with a whistle and thats on Casey Marcel trying to stay with Joe Gerard itll be the first on the senior from Fort Washington Maryland who plays tonight against his childhood buddy Judah Mintz they grew up on the same street in Fort Washington commence on the drive against Burns at the rebound and a foul will be tagged to Malik Brown itll be his first and the first on the Hall of Famers team Jim Boeheim you know a thousand thirteen wins and now 47 Seasons at his album Nagant is going to take over in the middle of that zone one of the things you hope to accomplish in the zone is prevent the dribble penetration of Smith and Joyner they are both very dangerous with the basketball Joiner with Gerard eight to shoot Burns turns and it rimmed out Edwards collects a rebound for the cuse now its not that burns cant make that shot he can Wes but I think hes much better when hes bumping his body on the inside and making those little spin moves Gerard missed everything and the ball last touched by the wolf pack says AJ decides uh one of the things weve seen early West is Malik Brown has been very active on the offensive boards North Carolina States going to have to find him and block him out Gerard off the Edwards screen knocks down the triple 73rd three of the year for Joe Gerard Applause Joe Gerard is a guy who can really score Wes and about half of his field goal attempts her threes but his twopoint game has been outstanding all year foreign by three Burns tried to fire one into the corner off the hands of Joyner and NC State gives one away in the half court now Burns is a good passer West but sometimes hes an adventurous passer and you dont want to do that against Syracuse that Syracuse Zone really effective at forcing turnovers in North Carolina State a team that does not turn the ball over very much here is Gerard off the Edwards screen again a little Up and Under on Marcel fell off the rim Casey morsel the rebound and I think the foul will be on Gerard itll be his first itll be the second on the orange Gerard is trying to claim that it wasnt really him who committed to follow as one of the NC State guys who ran into Marcel but thats a good argument but the video replay does not support it Smith wants some help here and burns doesnt quite get the angle for the screen so Gantt for joining for Syracuse doing a nice job extending in the zone Dan when not only extending In the Zone West but the wolf pack is standing yeah theres Smith floater blocked by Edwards Mets off and running has Gerard Judah tried to get to the rack knocked away Joyner back for Edwards and he lost it Gerard off the save near the timeline with 18 to shoot but thats not typically the way you run a fast break but Syracuse is able to hang on to the basketball minutes reroutes off the screen heres Gerard backside rebound for Smith and this is what North Carolina state would really want to do they want to push it tried to dump it into Gantt turned over there back to Joyner now Marcel standing three too strong and another chance for the pack and down is Smith on the in line and AJ Desai hit the whistle and turquoivion is shaken up here but Wes he went flying through the lane and I watched you know I watched where the ball went I didnt see what happened to him but he could have dumped into the fallen into the photographers seems to be hes going to stay in the game so thats one of those things if hes looking over at Kevin Keats and thinking he needs to come out of the game Kevin Keats is going to turn around and look the other way States got almost three minutes without a basket theres Smith trying to get on track back rim missed fourth chance Joyner right theres Burns rolling on Edwards bound well get a timeout itll be the first on Bell the third on the orange Accused by three early on the inside in the middle of that Zone West he can take the ball and drive it to the basket and you see Chris Bell number zero a little slow coming over now this time Bell gets there a little faster but still not fast enough you got to move your feet and get in front of burns that time he reached in got to get and now of course its easy for me to say you got to get in front of that guy but uh Burns is somebody who can really operate in there and what he would like to do more than anything else is get his body up against you and use that body to score close to the basket you know we we had the NC State Duke ball game what in early January and I remember that night first night without Jack Clark obviously my horses had been on the bench already with an injury and there was grave concern in the NC State locker room about their ability to compete inside stand five weeks later that narrative is gone that narrative is totally gone theyre just hoping to keep burns out of foul trouble and try to get him some rest so he doesnt have to play 35 minutes a game States drought comes to a close on the free throw and now Marcel steps in and steals it from Brown very important for Syracuse that when they turn it over they get back quickly on defense theres Burns skip four Clark theres Jack Clark who returned to the lineup on Saturday for the first time after missing 10 games rimmed off the front rim from Smith theres Burns what a turn and score by the big fella Wesson thats what he does you know he is a big strong guy but hes not necessarily a power guy in there hes got all those little spins how did that how do you get that ball in the basket because hes a dancing bear is what he is DJ Burns has got five of well hes got all five of NC States points theres Edwards and burns fouls him and thats where the problem is going to be for North Carolina State because hes matched up mantoman against Jesse Edwards and thats tough now look at this Wes burn he just picks up the ball he looks he fakes pivots and while hes still spinning he gets a ball in the basket he didnt bank that and he just spun it in a couple of free throws for Edwards after the first on the grad student DJ Burns Jesse is 72 percent at the line and knocks it down dont forget ACC Unity week tips off Saturday weve got a doubleheader for you on acc Network Pitt is tied for first in the league and theyll visit Virginia Tech Dan and Ill be at the castle presented by Subway at five oclock and then Louisville is going to honor the 10year anniversary of their 2013 team and Clemson remember they played a tight game the first time the Tigers will be there our coverage always available on the ESPN app and Virginia Tech struggling to stay in the hunt for a potential at large bid at Clemson they got to get some wins West they put themselves in great position but they faded a little yep tigers are 77 today in the net Clark out of the corner and the rebound for Edwards Jack Clark 68 grad transfer played at LaSalle missed 10 games with a lower abdominal injury whoa Edwards couldnt finish the dunk Clark commits the foul terrific look and Clark will pay for it with his first and the third on the wolf pack really good move ment by Syracuse Edwards just goes right through the two players there was a little screen and he just went right to the basket and two guys went with Gerard and Clark couldnt get over in time Jesse had his 10th DoubleDouble last Wednesday night in Tallahassee in the win against Florida State 18 points on 614 shooting in three or 12 rebounds and three blocks unless he has been such a factor you know blocking shots rebounding the ball now I missed that free throw orange with a threepoint lead wolf pack yet to draw up a three in fact look how far away they are Wes theres a lob for dewana got knocked away recovered by Joyner who was playing with the foul line area now more cell would tend to shoot quick bounce pass heres jarkel hell shoot it over the top of Edwards hit the rim long rebound belongs to Joyner heres Clark right back for Joyner wide open got it thats the best look theyve had West and get the ball inside Force the defense to collapse and then kick it out joyners not going to have very much luck if hes trying to shoot it over Edwards on the inside but that wide open three yeah hell take that orange hadnt gotten a field goal in 409 and Edwards missed the layup there and then committed the foul I believe on the rebound by Ebenezer dewana and thatll be the first on the 611 senior from Amsterdam well once again the North Carolina state does a very poor job on the screen situation and Edwards just cant get it to go in the basket hes very disgusted with himself and hes again hes so valuable hes got to be careful about those fouls thats just a little giveaway foul cant afford those look at Joyner now playing the foul line roll heres Marcel a standing three Jenny Williams onto the floor a moment ago to replace Brown pulls away the rebound and Marcel has drawn the assignment of Gerard thatll be an interesting match Taylor missing the three Justin Taylor into the ball game averages almost 20 minutes a game against the conference and there is Smith a turnover and then Joyner commits the foul itll be the first on the Ole Miss transfer jarkel Joyner itll be the on State and thats that was a break for North Carolina State because jaquavion Smith was a little bit out of control theyre trying to push the ball and you want to push the ball but you have to do it under control Joyner Smiths got the assignment on Gerard his corner and heres Joe hes working against taquavion Smith Applause tried to throw it out front to Williams and stolen by Clark and then Benny Williams commits the foul now Benny Williams was a little surprised by that pass West and he didnt step to it because he thought Gerard was going to do that back down move and take a shot and Gerard has has made that back down move very effectively all season long Gerards out and Samir Torrance has come onto the floor senior from here in Syracuse averages about 10 minutes a ball game for coach behan Quick Pass to one up strong Taylor got a hand on it I believe and heres Mets out of there with it for the orange were tied at eight lob for Williams inside catch and score Vinnie Williams first point thats a really good pass West and a nice catch in traffic but nice job by Syracuse to run off that blocked shot foul line jointer turns and scores five for jarkel Joyner and West thats where he needs to catch it in the foul line area in that area between the top of the key and the free throw line because itll be hard for Edwards to come out and cover them Edwards with dewana defending at the Block or admits is fun to watch isnt he Dan just a terrific young player thats a great matchup mids going against Joyner heres Taylor now hes got three to shoot heres Torrance on the drive blocked dewana slapped up in the air in a shot clock violation Ebenezer dewanas 20th block of the year and an emphatic one were tied at 10 in central New York on acc Network same street without Staples who was a terrific player Burns feeds Clark reverse good and the wolf packs got the lead so youre playing off Burns a little bit because you dont want him to get that drive and that allows him the vision to make that pass inside back in front layup no good from Edwards off the short jump shot and I think thats a good idea by Syracuse to go right after Joyner drops another one hes got eight and hes coming off 26 at Boston College and thats two consecutive assists for DJ Burns in the middle of that zone wolf packs scored five in a row to take a fivepoint lead Mitch trying to answer guards the rebound you heard Smith call for it Smith wants to go yep Music see this is you have to be patient if you cant go then you got to attack and you got attacked by getting the ball in the interior of that zone either with the dribble or the pass theres Clark squeeze his Baseline Burns another assist Jack Parks got four and NC State forces Syracuse to take a Timeout on seven in a row and DJ Burns again Dan wow DJ Burns theyve scored seven in a row on three baskets one being to three and burns has assisted on all of them another look the big fella with the clean bounce pass state by seven well Dan DJ Burns has come in this ball game and he gave him a scoring lift earlier hes got three straight assists I was on the bench with two fouls and then he came in he had got three straight assists two leading to dunks at the obviously right next to the basket and the other a threepoint shot and those are the seven consecutive points for North Carolina state thats a nine nothing run in total for the Wolfpack Torrance lobbing inside the catch and brown had it roll off the rim Wesson thats three times now that the orange inside players have missed from Point Blank Range Schoener had it rattle out on a pullup three priced by Edwards and thats by Brown got a finish though cymer Torrance Hopper Edwards hit the window and look out here is turquavion Smith unless thats what the wolf pack does they want to force turnovers and get going they lead the ACC number nine in the country and fast break points you dont want them to get out and go Torrance looking for position and the rebound pulled away by Joyner and a fats work foul on cymer Torrance or was it just knocked out just knocked out West Syracuse has to be patient enough to put the ball in the hands of Edwards in scoring position DJ Burns has one foul they need to try to get Edwards in the post against Burns to see if they can pick up that second one Joyner gets a break for Coach Keats and LJ Thomas a 62 freshman from Plant City Florida averaging about 11 minutes a game in conference play steps into the lineup wearing number four for NC State Gerard had it pumped away and a foul on to klavion Smith his first five on the Wolfpack heres the thing that gets you about Smith we get caught up in all the offensive flowers right all the scoring hes averaging almost a steal and a half a game Dan and oftentimes you mentioned this earlier is drawing the best shooter on the opposing teams backcourt heres more cell Baseline trying to skip it back and Bell finally tapped it along and Edwards five to shoot thats a miss that Thomas collects where the NC State Defense just has the orange really Flemings now again Syracuse missed three pointblank range baskets that have helped the cause Smith Quick Pass Burns here goes Clark again Baseline back for Thomas Smith loads good Heavens signed off the back room he was standing on the m in the JMA Jones Gerard knocks down a foul line jumper five for Joe Gerard he leads the RN to trail by seven with eight to play first half Syracuse got down early to Florida State West and they did a really nice job battling back theyre going to have to do that again tonight Marcel working against Brown theres Thomas attacking on the dribble back for turquoi Beyond foul on burns lefthand turn and score seven for DJ burns on his third field goal well interestingly enough hes better with that little Hook from that distance than he is with the facing jump shot from that distance I think you just like it because he shoots the hook shot I find him one of the more entertaining players in this league missed by Bell the followed by Brown first basket for Malik Brown averaging seven against the league NC State again has Burns in that foul line area heres Thomass shot fake into traffic traveled with it thatll get us to a timeout so the wolf packs got a seven point lead and the perimeter stars have announced their presence baby T with the hammer and a moment ago Joe Gerard takes the scoring lead for the orange his Gary gate who of course for many years was the Syracuse womens lacrosse coach and now is in his second season as the mens lacrosse coach but he is known as air gate its always good to have Michael Jordan be your coach not all hes the Michael Jordan of Lacrosse oh okay all right all right Edwards left it short against Burns Jessies having a tough night against he really is and burns is doing nothing more except standing there and making Burns shoot over making Edward shoot over that bulk Syracuse West now five for 20 its not good not going to win very many basketball games like that Breon pass wearing number 10 for the wolf pack also in the ball game little floater from Smith no good and Edwards collects the rebounds seven point lead for state Gerard and the orange have won two straight theyre nine and five at home and Joe knocks down a deep three hes got eight now boy thats a huge basket for Syracuse West and Kevin Keats is really upset with Breon pass that he did not handle the screen very well you cannot get caught up on a screen if youre guarding Joe Girard nope because once he gets set Look Out Pass doesnt play much for Keeps against the league and theres a turnover Smith tried to fire an entry pass to Burns and the love and brown and thatll get a wolf pack timeout Malik Brown on the back end of the LOB in a row by the orange to draw the within two when we continue well one thing you cant do is turn the ball over against the Syracuse defense nice job by Jesse Edwards now look at this West he nearly runs into mints but Mintz maintains his Poise and finds Bell open underneath the excuse me thats not Belle thats brown right open underneath the basket more importantly though 50 run by the home team this is what we talked about Syracuse battle back in the game against Florida State they battled back now and the defense got them started Manson Gerard at the front of it if you will here is Clark tried to skip it back out front 11 to shoot Joyner a pullup knocks it down threepoint goal for Joyner hes got 11 three of them triples of his four Syracuse really scrambling on defense and sometimes when you scramble you create an open situation got Joyner in the air and a terrific play by Judah Mitch first field goal for the freshman and thats minces game West taking the ball into traffic like that he can really make those plays reigning rookie of the week in the ACC heres Burns one hard dribble now Marcel shes up a three Clark will get called for the push itll be his second six on NC State and the second on Jack Clark in his second game back after missing 10 with the injury and thatll bring Ernest Ross onto the floor theres the 69 sophomore from Florida state has 110 run Syracuse had a 70 run all told we got a threepoint game and boy that ball got saved by Mintz and right to the Wolfpack for cell for burns turning on Edwards cut caught bounce pass Smith couldnt finish the layup ball slipped out of his hand Wes yep Mets bounce past Brown terrific pass by judaments Wes I dont think terrific is enough to describe wow yeah orange still within one and the building rocks Smith front rim Miss heres the run out and Bell pushes Syracuse in front Applause what a react from bayheims Team Dan boy they really turned up the intensity Wes and theyve done it with defense they forced turnovers from a team that rarely turns it over 10 to shoot heres Ross skip for Joyner Ames Byers bounces out Edwards had it and lost it and AJ desais got a whistle and its on turquavion Smith itll be his second its the seventh on NC State Timeout on the floor orange making a move here Dan suddenly these shots that they were missing West are going in the basket Applause for sixth turnovers here in the first half against the teams that only averages eight in ACC games theyve done a nice job theres a blocked shot so that starts a fast break and theyve executed very well on The Fast Break North Carolina state is back but theyre not really guarding and then some questionable shot selection and sometimes when you take bad shot that leads to easy baskets going the other way so the combination of those factors has really turned this game around second foul on Smith and to quavion puts Jesse Edwards to the line for a one and one and he makes it 2624 all four of Edwards points in this first half have come at the freethrow line one of the concerns tonight for the orange Edwards has nine straight games where hes committed three or more fouls hes fouled out of five games this year including three against the ACC ENT so you got to be mindful of where he stands as the game wears on hes got eight rebounds and Five Points now the NC State at the other end more than half their field goal attempts have been threes here in this first half and thats what the Syracuse defense will force you to do you say okay Im open well maybe you are but maybe youre two feet further away than you should be heres Marcel with another one and thats his first basket of the game 683 of the year for the number one percentage threepoint shooter in the ACC at 45 Gerard tries to answer it Ross the rebound poked Away by brown but recovered by the pack tied at 27 Burns a kick out more cell another one spins away and Edwards gets his ninth rebound unless I thought Burns kicked that one out a little too quickly that time I think when you catch it in there you have to turn and face and force him to guard you Smiths got to be careful out of the corner three ball no good by Bell Smith tried to shake mitts inside heres Ross the catch too strong on the shot and three white shirts around him thats a nice job by Edwards to just go straight up in the air Gerard had it swiped Away by Smith who picked up his third you know Gerard does not nearly have the speed or athleticism but he is really a skilled player that was a hesitation dribble that got Smith off balance got him behind the play picks up his third foul so in less than two minutes Smith picked up his second and now his third here is Gerard who is 85 percent at the free throw line now Joe is a guy Dan who does not have enough attempts per game to factor into standings in terms of stats but this guys clearly one of the most talented free throw shooters in the country let alone the ACC and hes got 10 here in the first half unless he doesnt as you say he doesnt go there that often because his job isnt really driving it to the basket where you would pick up foul Burns Ross the dunk and thats why you turn in face when you catch the ball in there well tied at 29 final 86 seconds Music pull up cool pretty stroke for judaments plus hes really good Music fun ball game and a good one here morsel to Burns tried to go again patted away turned over by the wolf pack Gerard rubs off the screen of brown got more cell in the air no whistle Purcell on the run out after he defended Gerard and Casey Marcels got five crowd here wanted a foul on the shot by Gerard against Marcel its tied at 31 but Gerard was looking for the foul Bell tough shot knocked it down six first half points for Chris bound Point Gerard is still talking to the officials about them the fact that they didnt call Pops so is Jim behind yep well Jim Bams got 47 years of receipts Joe Gerards got about three three and a half second difference between shot clock and the Gamecock Joiner for more cell heres DJ foul line missed it orange spots oh wow and a foul called on Burn yep Applause so one and one with four and a half seconds left at the other end second on DJ Burns Dan well and burns he missed that shot and out of frustration he goes and hes trying to get the rebound West you just have to let that one go because now they send Bell to the freethrow line with a oneonone Syracuse would have had a tough time getting that ball up to court Bell by the way 12 of 15 at the free throw line this season freshman from Concord California knocks the first one down Applause Chris Bell averages less than six a game in League Play hes going to have eight at the half orange by four Joyner and a foul called on mints which is the sixth on the orange with 24 left well you know Wes Im just Ive never been a guy that believed in giving fouls at the end of the first half because the guy like mince he might need that foul later heres Joyner running three at the horn too strong and boy Syracuse who gave up an 110 run by NC State really tight in the screws Dan theyre going to take a fourpoint lead to the locker room what a great response by Syracuse West they started very slowly but wow did they finish well all right stand by Joel Berry and Luke Hancock with the king of Marshall Street Drew Carter points at the bottom of the screen the threepoint shooting Edwards of course the 10 rebounds already turquavion Smith has got three fouls and only two points as we start the second half Jack Clark replaces Greg Gantt in the lineup for Coach Keats here and the Wolf back Joyner at the foul line he spent time there as did Burns jarkel misses the 15footer to start the half if joyners gonna be in there Wes I think he needs to move more toward the top of the key to force Edwards to come out heres Gerard the Orange is leading scorer only playing double figures for Syracuse Bell who had a terrific first half cant get the layup to fall heres Smith on the run out trying to make it a three on two Marcel a triple oh Clark couldnt tap it home controlled by Malik Brown and you talk about Smith on the run out west thats he hasnt been able to do that very much tonight and thats an important part of his game in the Wolfpack game commence on the drive and he will turn it over oh no AJ designed Bert Smith say it was deflected by NC State so it will stay with the orange well thats a break for Syracuse because mints you cant drive in there leave your feet and try to pass the ball in traffic step in a little leaning two is good half dozen for the freshman judaments and thats the second time weve seen him get Joyner off his feet collect himself and make that midrange jump shot sixpoint lead for the orange its their largest and theres a shot to run in from DJ Burns who started the ball game with seven quick points and didnt score the rest for the rest of the way so they got to get back to getting him involved through the wolf packs lots of dribbling by mints and now heres Edwards remember Burns plays with two Jesse for an array of moves missed the shot got his own rebound one more time Burns bothered that they go to the deck Edwards with 18 to shoot now in a reset clock Bell trying to work on Joyner and Clark finally the rebound burns his bolt I think is bothering Jesse Edwards hes just not able to power the ball to the basket Burns left alone put up the jumper and tapped home more cell I believe yes seven for Casey Marcel heres a lead and Gerard has it rolled in hes got a dozen Marcel had that tip in Wes and hes the guy trying to guard Gerard so hes stuck under the basket Gerard got down the court very quickly nobody helped out Marcel Burns foul and jumper a little more initiative out of the big fella here at the start of the half besides you I missed Ellen Edwards hey go get him Jesse Edwards and Jim Bam are having a little bit of a conversation as Edwards was coming back up to court and theres Joyner a little push on Metz itll be his second first on the wolf pack here in half too Kevin Keats his team off to the best 25game start since 2006 Dan I mean 17 years since NC States been this good through 25 games theyre 206 105 in the ACC playing tonight the three ball from Bell out of the corner gives him double Pickers for the fourth time in the last nine games well Weston ACC plays 72 percent of Bells field goal attempts are from Beyond the threepoint arm Clark short jumper answers for the wolf pack half dozen for Clark and his second game back and Clarks in there because hes a very good rebounder and a better offensive player than defense and won the foul on Joyner will be his third or no its on burns beg your part not Joyner its DJ Burns third yeah Burns is the guy who reached in as Vince was going by and burns you know thats really tough for him hes got to move his feet to try to get in there and if he doesnt move his feet just let that guy go by youre too important to pick up a foul in that situation dude immense five and a half nine in the game hes averaged 17 in the last six including shooting 48 from the floor yes he scored 14 points in the last 13 minutes of that Syracuse game stolen but thrown away on ground trying to start a fast break for Syracuse Clark of three too strong it was an air ball orange with the basketball up six Gerard trying to size up Clark the traffic feeds Edwards three ball found it away by Gerard and blocked by Burns and then Joyner back the other way heres Smith a three air ball Marcel the rebound Joyner will try one air ball fart cleans it up eight for Jack Clark where sometimes the hardest ball for a Defender to rebound is the Airborne and the corner Bell had it partially blocked itll hit the end line it will stay with the arms YMC state is just four of 19 from three the wolf pack comes in averaging almost nine threes a game struggle as real as the orange lead four going into tonight no quad one fan well and thats the problem and then their upcoming schedule as the net stands today they only have one quad one opportunity left thats February 25th against Pittsburgh and this is Syracuse team that started very slowly but theyve played pretty well of late so theyre an improving team but right at the moment it looks like their only chance to get into the NCAA tournament is to win the ACC tournament theres been out of the timeout little floater to his left thats a tough shot yep Smith in the pack and heres Joyner Clark was one of the foul line for a moment now heres Burns flashing up there they want to get ball movement and player movement and that ball has to go inside the zone six to shoot heres DJ Burns working on Edwards inside left hand scores and thats what he wants to do West he passed up the 15foot jump shot so he could go and bump Edwards and score 13 for DJ Burns and a miss by Edwards when Edwards has really struggled I mean hes had some opportunities in close against Burns and simply hasnt converted Clark had it blocked by Edwards these are the two best shot blocking teams in the ACC so its not a surprise nope three ball Gerard rebound to Brown now heres mint store Smith playing with the three fouls and what a saved by Bell off the feet of Marcel seven to shoot for the orange thats a great effort but one of the things that we see is its very difficult for Syracuse when they have to play against the said NC State Defense theyve got a 174 advantage in Fast Break points Vance back into traffic on the window and score terrific play Mintz has got seven and a half 11 in the ball game and the lead back to four for bayheim steam hes got some wiggle about him doesnt he West yep Applause heres Burns again back out front Smith pitching to pull the trigger and draws the foul from Chris Bell his second first of the half on the orange now west what burns did when he caught the ball inside he didnt turn and face the basket and I think hes got to put pressure on the defense every time he gets it in there hes got to turn and face the basket does that mean hes got to drive or shoot but you dont have to worry about him if he keeps his back to the basket out at the free throw line heres Smith and thats a long three so cuevion is in a drought from behind the line does not have a three more cell commits the foul or Park I beg your pardon commits the foul thatll be his third and the Third on NC State but turquavion Smith guy on Smith West is a guy who can Miss six in a row and then make six in a row so hes not going to stop shooting him hes one for nine from the floor 005 from behind the line you dunk in transition his only basket of the ball game its a first half this has been an interesting battle Joyner against and Marcel drawing Gerard and heres Edwardson burns with 10 to shoot and one DJ Burns just picked up his fourth lesson Burns has done a pretty good job keeping Edwards away from the basket but Edwards that time with this pivot he takes and pivots and is able to get in on past Burnss shoulder and forced Burns to come across first field goal of the night for the young man from Amsterdam and dewana comes in and burns goes out Weston theres 13 minutes left in this game NC State is down by six points and burns has been such a huge factor for them not only with his scoring but with his assists in the middle of that zone and Edwards has got eight points on his sixth made free throw in seven tries and Dewan is a very good Defender but he is not the offensive presence that DJ Burns is foul line area Joyner Smith launches hits On Cue Dan well Im telling you West now he can make four in a row sir quavion heard you talking over here he plays with such enthusiasm lasting up he has tremendous confidence three ball away and Joyner on The Knockout heres the pack and Marcel thought about it Luca here Joyner for quavion wants another crack at it from the top spins out Gerard collects it for the orange I think if youre NC State you take that shot every time absolutely Gerard trying to drive it got knocked away in terrific defense by Marcel and again Syracuse gets back very quickly stepped over the top of brown oh wait a second it pissed side of the window and dropped in out of the corner unless I dont know that Ive ever seen a ball hit that high on the back door I saw Larry Birds shoot one from behind the glass One Night in New Orleans and that one I think kissed the top of the glass from deep in the corner I agree with you oh heres Syracuse immense on the drive He will draw the foul and I think dewana will pick up the personal itll be his first itll be the fifth on the wolf pack state is to within one and turquavion Smith might be trying to light the pilot light here tonight in central New York that one from out front and then this one very solid 36 there three and four in Quad One games Joe linardi has him as a number eight seed number 30 overall which means theyre right in the middle of the number eight seeds but you dont want to lose a game on the road to a team like Syracuse 98 in the net today 98 in the net so thats thats you know and Syracuse is a team that can beat you yep and if youre talking about Syracuse and theyre remaining quad one opportunities according to the neck today the only one that NC state has left is February 28th at Duke so the quad one wins theyre theyre the the gold in the currency Marcel tend to shoot and almost stolen Sally got a hurry five for Joyner heres Marcel over the top of bell and left it on the front rim and brown pulls it away for Syracuse orange are nine and five at home but just three and three against the league in this building this year of course you know frustrating losses to North Carolina and Virginia heres Brown lobbing Edwards to catch Delana blocked it and then and then Jesse gathers and scores Tim for Edwards Hes Got His 11th DoubleDouble of the year and he got two rebounds out of that West lead is five again Joyner was looking for the outlet and instead drops an 18footer for his first pass to the second half and a foul on dewana as Edwards collected the lead pass itll be the second on the Junior from Acra in Ghana Ebenezer dewana now that West that is a heck of a play to recognize that I I didnt see I was looking down the court so I didnt see who took the ball out of bounds but to recognize that play and execute that pass that is really smart and really aggressive here is brown fighting inside and easily beats Marcel for his and theres Gerard again thats twice hes done that yep Applause Kevin Keats is back to pacing thats got to be frustrating minutes trying to beat Clark on the bounce in the corner Bell long rebound brown but couldnt hang on heres Smith in the pack the corner more south attacks on the dribble Clark a three got it Jack Clark his 21st three of the year seven and a half 11 in the ball game for Clark they missed Clark badly he had that groin injury but again he was in the lineup to start the second half because of his offensive ability and he showed you right there foreign for Edwards thats where the balls got to go on inside got poked out by Smith loose ball collected Bell three to shoot now heres Edwards with two hell launch got it Applause his first threepoint basket of the year Clark to answer cannot Joyner the rebounds step back two off the Baseline heres Gerard and the orange on the Run Bell couldnt hang on dewana couldnt either it will stay with the cuse that was a threeonone fast break a very poorly executed threeonone fast break but Jesse Edwards the clock running down just takes his time look at Copeland in the back of the off the Syracuse bench dancing on the Baseline Gerard tried to hit one off the curl look out now and a foul in transition will be on Bell Chris Bells third just the second on Syracuse its a good idea to try to stop turquoia Smith because once he gets going he is very dangerous in that transition game heres Marcel against Edwards and thatll draw a foul on Jesse Edwards to Edwards credit tonight Dan that is just his second foul and a guy whos got a propensity to get himself in foul trouble has played under control really from that perspective tonight for the orange yeah he has but the interesting thing Wes is hes been under control playing mainly against DJ Burns and I think that hes defended him really well for the most part NC State really hasnt driven the ball much at him and I think thats a much harder thing for Edwards to defend without fouling Marcel 79 has got his eighth point on his first free throw Casey spent two years at Charlottesville came over last year as a transfer and of course averaged just six points against the league he has doubled that number in conference play this year Well West hes already made 67 threepoint baskets this year in his time at Virginia and last year at NC State he made a total of 60 markedly improved basketball player is number 14 in the red threepoint game Edwards working against Gowana turns and cannot score it Smith the rebound nice job by NC State to force him to catch the ball well away from the basket turquion cannot tie it on the three Edwards is going to have 20 rebounds before the Gerard has took a shot in the face around the nose and then turned over here is Joyner going to the basket and Clark couldnt follow it Marcels got the rebound and an offensive foul call on Casey Marcel and Joe Gerards knows has had a tough couple of possessions Applause Kevin Keats is fired up Gerard will be helped to the bench by AJ Desai the foul on Marcel and boy Caseys upset we got a timeout come back no telling what will happen in the last 7 39 orange up three Syracuse during the break Bert Smith and Bill Covington Jr and AJ Desai were at the monitor collectively Dan going through a sequence here wow we had a couple of things going on here Joe Gerard got hit in the face right there by Casey Marcel who was just trying to put his arms out to prevent the pass and then the next time Casey Marcel got the ball the arm comes out there and so Joe Gerard goes down Im not sure that thats a uh Im not sure anythings there is it well I dont know Wes but the referees went over and they looked and what theyre looking for in that situation is the flagrant one rule is contact that is well theyre allowed to go look at a fragment file okay and they didnt make a call so but the rule is that is the contact excessive and or unnecessary and the officials in this particular case reviewed it and decided that it was neither okay so its not a flagrant foul its a common foul on Marcel seventh on NC State but because it was an offensive foul no free throws was 7 39 to go and it is the second on morsel all of that aside its a threepoint game with seven and a half to go yeah a lot of stuffs going over there yep events against Joyner Gerard by the way on the floor after taking a couple of shots minutes a spot up at 16 feet what a second half for Judah missed 11 and a half 15 in the ball game Applause on his sixth field goal fivepoint lead for the orange this is an important sequence here for North Carolina State you dont want to let Syracuse run out anymore on you or sell five to shoot kick for Clark back from Marcel 21 at the shot clock horn Clark to follow boy Jack Clark now nine and a half 13 in this ball game West he is an outstanding offensive rebounder that was a big basket for North Carolina State law for Edwards in tight put it up and the follow is good for Brown fifth field goal double figures for the sixth time in conference play for Malik Brown yeah but Brown and Bell have both produced tonight for Syracuse and that has been a big factor Joyner over the top of Edwards slapped it out but into the NC State bench last Touch by the orange says AJ Desai now Dan DJ Burns is still sitting over there with six minutes to go on Kevin Keach Wolfpack bench its Clark and a foul on Brown thatll be the second on Brown fourth on the orange partisans here dont like it well Wes I think youd have to bring Burns in if the game was getting away from you and that last basket by Clark sort of kept the game from getting away from him right at the moment to the quad with the theragon over there I noticed they leave him on the bench as long as you can get away with him Joanna the dump nice pass by Joyner and Ebenezer dewanas first basket of the game again Dewan is not much of an offensive threat but you cant just ignore a guy that size close to the passing those are his first points in the last four NC State Games five and a half to go threepoint game minutes hes been terrific turned over there by the orange here is Joyner back for turquoivion Smith and we are tied nine and a half 11 in the ball game for Smith the orange timeout whatd you say he might miss five but he could turn and hit five on you well to quavion Smith of the wolf pack have locked it up at 63 tonight at the Dome thats that meets the definition of a blockbuster Taylor Wilsons pretty good huh for The Jayhawks weve got a good one tonight were locked up at 63 sir quavion Smith had a twopoint first half hes dropped three triples here in the second half Jesse Edwards has got his 11th DoubleDouble of the year and Jack Clark in just his second game back after missing 10 has been terrific for Kevin Kings and NC state has gotten back into this game West on the strength of some fast break points theyve finally been able to get out and go heres Gerard working against Marcel and Casey tried to follow it Gerard hits a tough shot hes got 14 and Gerard he has become so good backing people down even the guy the size of Marcel orange by two foulon Clark to tie got it Jack Clark has got 11 in the second half 15 in the ball game Wes its interesting jarkel Joyner had 11 in the first half hes only got two here in the second half Edwards working against dewana mismatch inside here it is oh a kick out for Gerard step in two block Casey Marcel Tracked Down by Joyner boy Brown has to turn and face the basket now I mean hes got a much smaller jointer against him and he just gave the ball up under four we go Smith long three on Smith 14 now in the game on the drive Edwards the dunk 15 tonight for Jesse Edwards got to get back on defense to Cleveland Smith was doing a little bit of celebrating a little too much celebrating and Syracuse created a five on four and Edwards was able to get the dunk Joyner at the foul line Applause backs out with 10 to shoot hell shoot over the top of Edwards in hand you said but he Joyner is a guy who can really create some space on that step back jumper and Edwards a little reluctant to go all the way out there to guard Music Albert Gerard the shoot and dewana stuck a hand in Marcel goes to the deck Edwards tried to make the save heres Mintz for three yes tied at 70 on just the 10th three of the Year by Judah Miss hes a 20 threepoint shooter in ACC play that doesnt matter tonight Marcel eight to shoot back for Casey a shot fake another three its too strong Brown the rebound of the air ball s now one for nine from out there West DJ Burns is getting up off the bench two minutes to go here is Mintz again La per Edwards back down on dawanna turn scores and draws the foul Ebenezer dewanas third eighth on NC State my goodness Judah Mintz what a time for this goodness and then Jesse Edwards will try and complete the threepoint play when we come back to the Dome 35 of those 109 about 32 percent have been five or less are overtime there have been four overtime games the home team is 2114 in those five or less games Applause the West the home team really did a nice job coming back in this one and NC State came back and tied the game and Syracuse has responded again DJ Burns back in the lineup for the wolf pack and Edwards trying to take it to a threepoint lead and guns boy Jesse Edwards has been really good tonight for the Arts so Burns and Clark kind of a double High post here Dan at least initially Burns plays with four dont forget that heres DJ working inside on Edwards lefthand move and one for the big fella Back Off the Bench and right to the rack goes DJ Burns and this is what he does Wes he gets in there hes got one on one against Edwards and he just uses that big body to get himself close to the basket Jim behind very upset hes claiming that Jesse Edwards went straight up in the air to tie the game and he does not and mince gets the rebound but now if youre the wolf pack youve got to dig in here defensively and I think if Im Syracuse Im going to try to get the ball to Edwards in the low post now Gerard with eight to shoot wants some help heres Edwards three to shoot Baseline Gerard gonna throw it up its a shot clock violation on the orange that was really good defense by North Carolina State Burns did a nice job force and Edwards well away from the basket and the pressure on the ball by the wolf pack meant that they couldnt uh Syracuse couldnt see inside to find Edwards now lets see if the wolf pack goes right back to DJ burns on the inside 65 seconds to go Smith picks it up and calls the timeout how about that he let it roll all the way to the front Court a little gamesmanship Syracuse is back in the zone and so they didnt get out to pressure now Wes this is really the wheels are turning strategically DJ Burns just went back in the game and they went right to him and he was able to score the basket and draw the foul although he missed the free throw Dan for almost eight minutes of clock time tonight this games been tied wow its been some kind of ball game now and Kevin Keats lets kind of go to the Huddle here a little bit youre Kevin Keats youve been attacking from the perimeter boy Jack Clarks been great for you in Second Chance points especially and now Smith and Joyner fit big baskets but Burns has been reliable it feels like wow Burns is the guy Wes who all throughout the game when hes been in there when theyve been able to get the ball to him things have happened offensively to Syracuse defense has to respond to Burns having the ball in the interior of that zone and that has created opportunities for other players yeah now Jack Clark he he did most of his scoring when Burns was out of the game but remember weve talked about Clark hes a great offensive rebounder Casey Marcel has not shot the ball well from three so if youre Burns you get the ball inside you either make the move you try to find Clark down low or you find Joyner and Smith on the outside Applause the defense really pushed up here for Syracuse Joyner trying to lob it into a big fellow there he is hell take Edwards to the basket and they are going to call an offensive foul and burns fouls out DJ Burns is going to foul out on an offensive foul with 493 left and 15 points West weve talked about the play of Jesse Edwards tonight and he just moves his feet and Wes this is something that you never see DJ Burns do and that is lead with that shoulder when you lead with that shoulder youre going to get the foul called on you every single time and theyre going to go to the monitor here I believe are they going no no monitor Im not quite sure what the stoppage was for well they may have been talking about going to the monitor to in the last two minutes youre allowed to go see if a secondary Defender was or was not in the restricted area but Edwards was not a secondary Defender he was the primary Defender so if he was in the restricted area wouldnt matter and a timeout for Syracuse because they were in trouble in terms of putting the ball in play but one of the one of the keys to J Burns game West is his ability to back into you to get his backside into you and then spin but that time he was at the free throw line hes driving to the basket and he lowered that shoulder and weve seen that all year you lower that shoulder youre going to get a charge call they see the game where he said heres another look at what youre talking about so heres Burns driving to the basket and Edwards is clearly in the restricted area but hes the primary Defender the only guy whos not allowed to take a charge in the restricted areas the secondary Defender and burns just I mean again you hardly ever see DJ Burns get that foul because he doesnt usually lead with that shoulder so he fouls out with 493 left still a one point Syracuse lead one timeout left for Jim behind two for Kevin Keith well if you want to foul the guy you probably want to foul is Malik Brown yep but you dont have to file yet youve got 20 some seconds differential shot clock to game club obviously a huge possession and I think if youre Syracuse youd like to try to get the ball in the low post to Edwards screen from mints Runner no good Edwards a rebound with just everything hit the rim right and heres Mintz back at dewana and theyre going to call a foul out from underneath it is on Ebenezer dewana itll be his fourth well Mintz is the guy who can get to the basket he drives it hard and dewana is going to get the foul call West because he moved his body into him thats not a situation where he went straight up in the air so here is mints to shoot a pair first one good twopoint game but hes not a great freethrow shooter in conference play West hes at 70 percent and overall hes at 74 so thats pretty good four for four tonight as the freshman and making five for five Applause Syracuse stays back in the zone timeout Kevin Keats hell use one of his two here and youre NC State here Dan you still have one timeout left its a threepoint game the easy choice is to go for the three to tie but hes got enough of a team and enough depth you take the first look here go to the basket get two cut it to a onepoint game Wes I dont think you have to take the three in this situation but whatever you take you have to do it quickly so you do have enough time if you get a really quick drive to the basket and you can score you still have the timeout left but again then you put it on your defense and if you cant get a steal then youre going to have to foul and Syracuse has made free throws tonight well weve seen Jesse Edwards score five points in the first half but he had a bushel of rebounds and here in the second half hes tallied his 11th doubledouble of the year well West he was finally in the first half he had some opportunities but wasnt able to capitalize but in mishap hes done a great job getting great position and then his first threepoint basket of the year how big is that going to seem if this ends up being a couple of points game well how big is the three by Edwards in the three by Minsky so Edwards who had never made a three and mins who was shooting into 20 percent and so mince Gerard Brown Bell and Edwards return for Coach behind but keep in mind that Kevin Keats has on the floor some threepoint Shooters of his own Joyner Smith forcell and Clark are guys who can all make it three but again I dont think you need to go for the three if you have it available then you take it but you try to get the ball in the middle of that zone and again its hard to drive through the zone for whatever you do you have to do it quickly right back to turquavion Smith Applause now heres Joyner dewana helps with the screen Clark weve got to go sure do now you have to take a three Joyner to Todd Off the Mark gawanna cant tap it home slapped out with three two from midcourt heres turquion Smith and the orange win Applause
