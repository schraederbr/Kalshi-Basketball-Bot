Georgetown on the road here in Notre Dame Indiana Georgetown is in the blue Fighting Irish the white blue and gold hoyya with the basketball oh Jay neps being out I this team is a very good threepoint shooting team and uh Ed Coy told us he needed his other seniors to play like seniors is one advantage they have over Notre Dame his age Supreme cook with the miss you mentioned EPS Mike missing his second straight game due to illness as Georgetown is coming off a win on Tuesday against Cen State at home 7154 well nows the time in December you want to get people healthy work on the glass for the Irish looking for a second chance Burton straight away thats a three ball and hes ripping the ropes for the Irish to get us rolling you know I thought watching practice yesterday that you know he struggled from three early that was but thats a great great mental health basket for him uh only 21 on the year coming in but he had a great look and so many times you do on an offensive rebound he was just two of seven from Beyond The Arc in the loss last Saturday at then number eight Marette 7859 for Notre Dame Styles has the hoop for the hoyya theyre on the board we talked about ACC ties and uh we I you know with dantro Styles I didnt know what he could do you know we never saw him at North Carolina the nezi dropping the hammer for the Irish on the strong drive and uh talk about not seeing him we never really saw him at Notre Dame either in his time here hes one of the few holdovers with Matt Zona the Southbend Indiana native Jr Ki with a vicious slam on that determined Drive to the rim Brumar got bumped on his way to the glass all here he is we talked about Georgetown not a great defensive team and late help coming in and he just saw that lane getting wide open to the right hand kzi has a couple of double doubles this season against Auburn and Oklahoma State went for 18 points at 11 boards against the Applause Music Tigers brumbaugh Dre the defensive attention massud deep into the shot clock with the pullup and he rattles it in well thats what Michael Shrewsberry would like to see long contested twos but uh massud a really good Shooter two years in the Kansas State program and prior to that he played at Wake Forest as Mike mentioned part of the ACC lineage thats another three for the Irish and its Roper you know what and I like Zona in in the middle of that he hes really got a good assist to turnover ratio I think he makes good decisions passing the ball from the high post Julian roer who shoots 36 from Beyond The Arc best on the team yeah no he he is by far their best threepoint threat he looking for the kind bounce does not get it kesi pulls it down Burt weathers and brings it up hell just fire away he he definitely needs to be closer to the threepoint line quick turn around M yeah hes the thing is hes a tough matchup hes got good size he can get his shot against most Defenders out on the wing its just as fifth game of the season from massud who might pick up the foul there on the push had a preseason right hand injury Su just had that last basket Rober had another three second of the game for the Irish yeah just great ball movement that time and uh Michel Dre very talk about he didnt want to see a lot of dribbling unless attacking the basket seeing those threepointers fall Mike a good sign for the Fighting Irish just 28 from be on the arc but start the afternoon but 36 here I mean they are a very good shooting team here at home yeah they shoot 49 on their home floor yep way above their season average of 41 kzi Miss Fires fight on the glass John got it for Notre aame and you know what I mean they were concerned about georgetowns ability to offensive rebound so far its been Notre Dame thats been winning in that battle Kei sophomore from Centerville Ohio who averages just over four points per game pulled that one down put it right back up for two travel thats going to be a turnover against Applause Georgetown

the start of a six game home stand isnt it though which is actually there you see and this is one of the youngest teams in the nation so uh you know this makes sense a young team youd think would be much more comfortable at home and so you got six a sixgame home stand great to build confidence going into the league play in January so I I think things are you know things couldnt really lay out better for this team that includes couple of ACC games against Virginia and Duke turnover hoes Bristol is into the game number 31 for Applause Georgetown Styles trying to drive couldnt get the angle kept alive Fielder tough shot he laid it in and thats you know the breakdown you get the drive going to the basket people lose the blockout assignments and thats exactly what michah Shrewsberry was worried about the offensive glass good size inside Drew fielders 610 yeah 345 very tall Fielder shoots 47 from the floor that three out of the corner bounces off coachs son Braden Applause Music Shrewsberry Fielder I got a kind bounce there and it fell in for the three all of a sudden Georgetown has taken the lead the last five points from number 20 whos just come into the game for the hoyya showing what he can do inside and outside not a great threepoint shooter at 29 Ney not a thats a you know one of those turnovers om Mission just took his eyes just a lack of concentration so Fielder with the ball right now Mike averages 4 point four points per game hes had the last five and massud misses the turnaround and see with with a guy like EPS out those are the type of contributions that you need in a game like this Z to the rim itll go to the free throw line chance at the old school prepoint Music Play heres the look and hes you know heres a guy this is he had the drive for the dunk and now he gets the finish here chance to really show some things going to the rim inspired play in this first half JR kzi seven points five boards and the loss at Marquette went just one of eight Beyond The Arc so hes decided to go inside had a jam earlier in this half thunderous Jam Mike yeah I know it was a great take and uh you know that game against Marquette was a it was a game that got this teams attention showed him barometer of how how far they had to go they did well to try to fight back into that one Mike yep they trailed 17 to nothing to start the game against Marquette ultimately losing 7859 and shot just 36 as a team and thats and Marquette is you argument of a final four team quick ball movement and styles shury goes up for the rebound originally signed with Penn State then came here to Notre Dame with his dad first time his father has ever coached his son this been a great experience to this Music point not going to be thrilled with the turnover Braden shury

first time since 2011 they had a first round win against Texas AM and another coach with ACC ties come on Fielder watch out this is one where a coach looks down wait a minute this guy was down The

dribbling into the paint brumall and they were talking yesterday that hes their best Applause passer didnt have to pass that one off Mike 92 points per game for brumall yeah very creative off the dribble ji with the handoff thei on the drive had it Stripped Away Heath to the floor shot clock is down to five along the Baseline foul called on the play Booth missed the shot and there was a scrap

timeout the michah shrewbury an unet and great take Inside by Supreme cook thats a pretty tough name to live first name to live up to one of the best names in all of college basketball absolutely cook is the leading rebounder for the Georgetown team another three for the Irish how about booth and I was looking at it at 610 most of his shots have been from behind the ark and you know I was thinking about why and but he has a great stroke not a great percentage that screen by cook results in a foul against Supreme cook right now sitting at 29 but he gets a terrific look a late close out good little screen Music like 31 of his 49 attempts coming in were from behind the ark he had originally signed with Penn State as well headed to that Micah shury bench came with Coach here to Notre Dame

lucky James breeding Clarence Armstrong in charge of the festivities this afternoon is our officiating crew so Heath will go to the free throw line no real shot blocker out there right now now for

now theres a bump on Music Fielder so Des he picks up the Music foul you look at the pace of the game right now its more falling into georgetowns Pace the way that theyre scoring the ball they were the one thats probably feeling more comfortable Fielder again this time its a Miss from Beyond The Arc first Miss shot of the game Burton Crossing it over by Fielder trying to switch hands in midair too much on it back to Georgetown youre going to have to be pretty quick to stay in front of him he is so fast Tom Fielder and kesn fighting for that one thats going to go back to the Fighting Music Applause Irish yeah you know if Burton has you with a live D live dribble isolated on the wing you have to turn around and yell for help Applause basically Notre Dame attempted 35 threepointers in the loss at Marquette thats a season high they will shoot the three as we go inside of 9 minutes to go on our first half with Burton on the dribble which I think for this team right now is too many I I really think they to build inside out they just dont have the the players that are capable of making those shots unable to make the play on the Baseline and the ball goes back to Georgetown and part of that is you know maybe not creating easy enough offense you know if theyre playing in the half court Im sure the teams are are packing it in against them just daring them to make shots massud his three came up short styles got it back and the arrow will favor Georgetown on the hell ball Music situation Georgetown is not shy about shooting the three either they average nine made threes per game third best in the Big Music East Mumbo had to give it up to Heath the former Boston College Eagle inside of massud he missed the layup I I think he was so stuned how open he was I mean that that was that was as easy a shot as hes going to get this Music afternoon great look by Heath to find mass Burton in traffic and thats deflected out of bounds by Styles know Ryan Matumbo like his father is traffic all by himself 72 259 lbs for the Junior from Atlanta Georgia seeing action in his eighth game this season hoers are six and four so far this year just one true Road Music game a loss for

Pacific well Fridays are magical with an allnew episode of pen and Teller fool us starring pen Gillette teller and new host Brook Burke Fridays 87 Central only on the CW both of these teams with first year head coaches looking for the magic this season Mike trying to find some identity for their teams early on getting prepped up and ready for the full conference slate Michel shury and Ed coie for Mike Shrewsberry hes an Indiana guy um you know had things really going in the right direction at Penn State although the Big 10 is about to look dramatically different next year usfc UA coming in um its its going to look a lot different than it is this year and and he said he actually said this was actually pretty easy decision to make PUD itll bounce out of bounds in the M of Georgetown he missed an easy layup early and then an airball there and hes got too good a stroke to to do that yeah hes now two of six in the game Georgetown in fact has missed its last five shot attempts hadnt scored in over three minutes shb turns and fires and massud pulls it down whats happening is hes only taken two free throw attempts on the year and teams are just flying at Braden Shrewsberry just daring him the drive and its getting tougher and tougher looks at the basket ji picked up the foul on this play with Heath on the Move theres the look I mean thats what you know as a player you cant get locked into one thing you know you have to at least have the threat of the drive to set up your shot Tuesday on inside the NFL nobody breaks down games like our crew with highlights and Analysis you wont find anywhere else this week the guys take a look back at the Cowboys big road contest against the bills Inside the NFL Tuesday 87 Central only on the CW what do you think this cowboys I think this is their a year Dak looks pretty Music good hes always talking about eagles and Chiefs certainly not Patriots this season M no much as that pains me and I hatte it I hated that people are starting to kill belich I mean the guy one of the greatest of all time did pretty well just let him you know let him be and just wants to go off quietly let him do it its a whole another show right there Mike thats a show cuz its on TV like the CW Courtside Saturday were inside of ten on the shot clock for Zona Music looking for a safety valve rooper slides down maintains the dribble Globe Trotter style and fires away wow talk about the resurrection of a Applause possession Julian rooper that was borderline trick shot yeah that was that was that was Marcus Haynes Globe Trish hes got five points Keith drops it to Fielder aggressively to the rim Davis pulls it in and heres shury trying to cross it over against the defender and shoy lays it up and in for the Fighting Irish to take the lead thats what Id like to see him doing more of and probably should have gotten a call on the play too great size long arms tack the rim build your offense inside out so whistle underneath it a foul here you go this is playing against the Washington generals not Georgetown Hoya back up knocked down to three you even remember the Washington generals lers record is not good Mike no its not but but they get paid how about road trips those are some road trips Music yes so Style is headed to the free throw line Julian roer we told you hes the best threepoint shooter by percentage in a transfer from Northwestern with donrees Styles at the free throw line played two years at North Carolina appeared in 45 Games first year at Georgetown game high 19 points in the win against compen state for Styles and he he emphasized athlete but um Ed Co say is the best athlete hes ever seen out on the floor he said he does some things that just leave him speechless four points now for Styles after the free throws shury Burton lines it up volley balled around Fielder hit it for Georgetown it ended up going off of Roper and see the problem too at his size he can be B Ed by a l a larger Defender from farther away you can close out on him and and disrupt his shot a little bit more so Fielder is a leading scorer with eight points for Georgetown in fact that leads everybody hes also got three rebounds and its two of three on threepoint tries hed only made four All Season prior to today turnover Roper trying to get by Fielder against three Defenders how did that go in tell me how Gman first he does the slide and get up three I thought he was going to dump it off to somebody Michel Shrewsberry is just like walking around going what what did I just see the crowd is just now reacting to it stunned Fielder lost the handle here he is again Roper on the run with Burton find shoy Burton out of the corner he spins it off the top of the backboard Zona got it and he lays it in time out Georgetown Irish by Applause three this is just great defense watch the hands right here good active hands and this Ill let this one play out four Defenders around him for rope that defied the laws of physics and gravity for that matter maybe thats all part of it actually I mean M just you know for what hes done so far this crowd was you know looking for something to ignite itself and its and dont forget like 30 seconds before that he slid on the court not on purpose you know right hes made two electric plays in this game kept the dribble alive hit the shot and then spot it off the backboard with four Defenders around him by the way Georgetown has not made a field goal in over seven minutes now the good news is they only Trail by three coach coie to put it mildly Mike in our discussion with him before the game he wants a little more intensity out of his guys and he says theyre going to grow into that just taking a little while thats all he wants some grit Heath the veteran player misses and probably you know when in that possession is probably not the shot you want probably want something attacking the basket maybe get a call so Burton Mike just has three points so far as the leading scorer for Notre Dame hes the top freshman scorer in the conference oh what a bounce for shury and its a three ball yeah you know what when he rose up my initial thought to myself was H I dont know about that but uh gets The Good The Friendly roll well beyond 22t 1 and 34 Ines away thats a baseline jumper for Bristol and Georgetown needed it Music Applause Wayne Bristol who averages just over five points per game for the Junior from upper marbor Maryland the kick to the corner around the perimeter Davis tees it up nothing but net for Davis and another threepointer you know coming off a made three that was a nice extra pass by shrewbury he could have he could have said you know Im feeling a little bit I might take this but he gave it up for a better look six made threes in the first half of the Irish in a steel Burton shovels it to shoy Davis trying to get position how about this four one against four and he comes up with the offensive rebound great great play and the foul was on Georgetown and Bristol fighting for the rebound the Irish unselfish passing and it results in a three some days I cover up because of my moderate to severe plaque psoriasis now I feel free to

a community rooted in Jesuit tradition DC is our training ground the world Isa Arena together we are strong we are Georgetown lets take a look at our Pacific Life game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years Julian rer for the Irish leads a Mike with eight points well and its not the total its how they were scored and you know then In fairness the students are did this last week was exams and they were gone on break it was a kind of a sleepy crowd 215 Saturday afternoon but those two plays Electrify the crowd and now this place is into the game so uh you know you look at the number all right great eight points in the first half but uh he really got things going inside couple of threepointers hes made two of the six Notre Dame threepointers Fielder leads the way across the way for Georgetown and we thought that that stat line was something that Georgetown would win the threepoint line as a team the Irish 48 shooting in this first half heres Burton the pullup the midrange and thats a again thats a tough match up for Burton with massud on him whos got the size advantage and can defend him but good I think thats a good good range for him good midrange jump shot Notre Dame played Niagara in its first game of the season Burton had 29 Points a Freshman School record yeah welcome were glad you picked this 122 run for Notre Dame defensive pressure out of bounds and back to the Applause Irish well heres the look and you see right I mean hes isolated and this is a great you know to give him that freedom he is a tough cover you got to respect his ability to drive but the thing thats changed all this for Notre Dame is on the defensive end and thats just not a good shot at this point Way Beyond the line for Burton it results in a run out for Heath and then Burton fouls him you see you surprise your team theres no defensive transition and you pick up you take a bad shot and you pick up a foul and those are those are the growing pains that you have with a freshman point guard and mik Shrewsberry is going to have a talk with him at this point second foul on Burton with Heath at the free throw line coming up on the Subaru halftime report from Notre Dame Indiana well recap Game one of our double header go around the ACC and give you the highlights and stats although we just showed you what Roper has done in this first half and that that was a highlight package in itself but I but I was going to say the the difference in this stretch is on the defensive end of the floor my did not Dame is causing turnovers theyre getting deflections theyre getting out on the open floor getting to the either to the basket or theyre kicking out and getting shots they havent had to do a lot in the half court Jai looking to give it up put it on the floor Roper down the lane into Fielder too strong ji couldnt grab it and here comes Heath got it right back from Fielder minute and a half to go in our rapidly paced first half Oh What A Move by Heath to lay it in help defense was a little late getting there but that was a good quick take by Heath how about Jay Heath Mike playing in his 111th career game well hes you know Ed coie in his first year hes got some experience on that team heaths a transferred from Arizona State and played two years prior to that in the ACC at Boston College shury Applause andne nice defensive halfcourt possession for Georgetown and a good cover up good close out on that jump shot was knocked out of bounds by ji it will stay at this end of the floor for the hoyya trailing by Music five cam beo comes into the game 63 grad Guard from Hampton Virginia played the last two years at Western Carolina in the Southern Conference got to keep track of all the travels of the players these days in college athletics for that Applause matter the schools as well as the players and why not try to find a suitable setting for your talents Fielder fighting with kesn thats couple number 20s and Co had such a big role in that time where guys could play and now with the extra year and uh being able to play immediately and transferring within the conference Notre Dame losing so many players from last years team massud catch and released for three for the Hoya and thats thats why when he shoots an airball its so stunning to me because hes got a great shot nice little comeback here at the trail end of the half by George down to cut the lead to two after the massud threepointer good screen he gets caught up in you know a direct pass to an open three and then thats just a little bit too Music easy third made three on nine tries by the Hoya in this first half but with only the screener and that guy on the side of the floor theres nobody else to help the only only thing you can do is you know maybe on the inbound or shade that side no field goals in the last two minutes and 19 seconds for Notre Dame massud in the middle of that Georgetown huddle its kind of been a kind of streaky half for both teams absolutely massud had a huge game mik against TCU 16 points a careerhigh 10 rebounds for his first career double double but the outcome in that game against TCU how about a buzzer beater from Emanuel Miller who actually stepped out of bounds but that part of the play not reviewable and so the threepointer counted Georgetown lost to TCU by a point 8483 on December 2nd and hes been the leader for this team that Ed Kul has kind of relied on him to take over that role so the shot clock is off 15 seconds to go in the half Burton on the dribble see if they can give him some room to create some havoc in the middle of the floor five points in the first half for Burton trying to beat the horn bounces off so the Miss at the end of the half for Marcus Burton now the Fighting Irish will go to the locker room with the lead 35 33 have the second half becomes a factor and I think part of that is because Notre name you know settling for those jump shots settling for threes and in their early foul illegal screen but thats what happens when you know when youre shooting threes youre settling for jump shots you dont put any pressure on the other team to defend you dont get them in the bonus you dont force you know you dont get in the bonus pni picked up his first personal foul now Zona defending Supreme cook to two quick ones on him and thats just again thats too easy of a pass from up top got to have a more ball pressure there cook did not go to the line in the first half shoots 53 from the strike hes a guy whos dangerous if he catches the ball both feet in the paint and he was he was really quiet in the first half only two points guy averages double figures for Applause Music him just two rebounds as well for cook who is the leading rebounder and second in the conference over eight and a half per game for the Hoya number 24 in blue kick to the corner kesn weak side Zona preserving The Possession right to Burton hes wide open halfway down and Applause Music out Brumar leaning into a three hook came over the top foul is called thats Zona again Mike I think it was on Burton oh again three in about 3 and 53 Applause seconds so kebba jaai is at the scorer table cook is at the free throw line again 69 senior from East Orange New Jersey first year in the Georgetown program transfer from Fairfield played three years there and now Zona leads the game but see heres the thing Tom I mean were were 53 seconds into the second second half theyve already got three team fouls four more youre shooting free throws for the rest of the Music game so cook ties US 35 all Irish have lost three of their last four games thats a foul on contact inside cook was down low thats his thirdd third foul on cook a lot of whistles to start this second half tied of 35 Burton on the inbounds knocked Away by cook who was defending it it rolls out of bounds and that is Georgetown ball well and thats you know it when you have when you have Burton taking the ball out of Bounds at 510 and you have a bigger ger player on him uh thats an issue brumo trying to work off the cook screen got it to him power dribble turned right into ji cruma shot was deflected and G grab it kesn Davis the sophomore from Indianapolis Indiana spent last year at seatan Hall before trans transferring to the Notre Dame program spins into the paint got the defender in the air kzne so far in this game and he and Burton have been the best off the dribble attacking the Applause Music Applause basket seven points in the first half for keski hes got those two Brum ball sends it right back out to Styles feing up the three you know I watching him in this game I I dont know why he had such trouble finding the court against in North Carolina spent two years in the tarhill program so I action in 45 games from Kinston North Carolina just made that threepointer for the hayers Burton sharp angle elevates and Heath got a piece of it in midair mind you and the ball goes out of bounds to Notre Dame theres the look and then you know the coaching staff was talking about runball and his ability to find guys again you just penetrated broke things down into the middle and knew where his shooters were Burton crossed it over in front of his Defender couldnt finish off the play and now Heath comes out of the pack Heath hesitation and drive thats a veteran move Mike and the hesitation on Burton to

youve got to Long Shots youre going long rebounds youre going to have to get some separation massud is into double digits hes got 10 after making three threepointers against Cen state for his nine points and the most recent win for Georgetown thatll be a reach in foul good hard work on the backboard by cook you know you look at at Cook I mean hes hes averaging eight eight plus rebounds a game but 37 offensive rebounds and 49 defensive rebounds so he does it on both ends of the floor so NN with a turnaround that interrupts an 80 run by Georgetown over the last 1 minute and 23 seconds and

as as a season Progressive the statue of muffin McGrath to be unveiled on the Notre Dame campus so a lot of things happening on CW Courtside Saturday with our womens schedule of ACC basketball Notre Dame has not scored in the last two minutes and 17 seconds and Applause counting georgetowns up to its largest lead of the game Burton Slams on the brakes Tay Davis spinning in the paint theres no angle there and well defended Mike yeah and theyre giving theyre giving a lot of room out on the perimeter its a traveling violation Styles I would think as this game goes along Georgetown is going to give them five six feet from range dare them to beat beat them over the top Booth Booth hits a another three had one of the first comes out firing here in the second half their first made three the second Applause half seven of 24 on threes for Notre Dame the alleyoop attempt goes flying out of bounds heres the look you see massud got he was like like a quarter back that looks a cornerback off with the with his eyes and got his teammate a great clean look second made three for booth and Booth out there because Zona gets into the that foul trouble with the three quick fouls so Jai couldnt handle the pass from shury kind of a careless foul or Carols pass Fielder had a big first half for the hoers wants it back wants to launch a three hoist it high and hits it very and a contested shot I mean you really cant fault the defense that time but you got a guy whos seing a big basket who that that you know that ability probably wasnt in The Scouting Report how about 11 points now for Fielder could not defend the shot by Burton so Burton the leading scorer and top freshman scorer in the ACC comes right back with a bucket out of Penn High Music Applause School massud Long Distance knocked around taken by booth still Georgetown four of eight from threepoint distance this half despite the Miss by Applause massud Burton over bromall weak side tap ji he got tangled up with Fielder so fielder who just picked up the foul is also knocking down the shots hes got 11 points point for the Georgetown hoers so shes a thief and a corn artist youre making me blush Im a cop yeah Im a cop you

Central on the CW great show five I started watching the Swarm this season Mike the ecological Thriller that was that was fun F booy Island got some popularity during the course of the Season we had a great year by the way on the football side of things on the CW first year with ACC football we had some Thrillers during the course of the Year actually we started out basketball with a thriller with Georgia Tech winning at home against Duke yeah Damon Star had a uh welcome good welcome to the ACC sty team Mike this just in an overtime Victory against Penn State 8281 and again and you know this were were 30 minutes into this game just about and only one free throw attempt for Notre Dame and again a long early jump shot coming out of that Timeout grumball on the drive could not get around his Defender and then lost the ball about Davis defensively yeah this just good solid defense just leading him and uh brumba dribbled himself into trouble some freshman point guards out there making mistakes that the head coach you may have to live with 40 shooting in the game for the Irish Burton well they have just built a wall and Burton trying to get inside but just tough for him to find any room to finish brumall R into a double and triple team help from Burton collapsing down about to cross the 10minute Mark here in our second half as Styles came up short shury runs it up threads the pass to Roper Up and Under not Applause enough they run it up and down the court Bristol fight fires three both sides of the rim both teams look like tired Fighters that are throwing punches that arent Landing sevenpoint lead for Georgetown after traving by two at halftime Burton down the lane were just talking about free throw attempts of which Notre Dame had one and now Burton will go to the free throw Music line here it is all hes been seeing its just that that little the the jump stop allows him to get body contact and maybe Tom this is where you know he can get a little bit of Rhythm in this game its just been a struggle hes 86 from the line which is great which is what you want from your point guard but three of 14 one of five so far in the Music contest kesn comes in Davis to the bench for Coach shury he needs he needs some scoring out on the floor and kzn is his most reliable one in the game Burton is reliable from the free throw line has both 86 of the season and Ninth best in the ACC hes up to nine points for Marcus Burton The Applause Freshman rumball take it all the way yeah that was kind of he was looking around to make a pass and all of a sudden he said maybe Ill give this a shot Seven Points now for brumbaugh yeah hes sneaky quick too shrewbury turnaround pesni with a awkward Applause tip brumall wants to slow the pace a little Applause bit Bristol driving it gets boo who held his ground Burton Shere let the defender Go On by found the open man Booth right to Applause Music Styles and the third base coach Ed coie puts up the stop sign and uh theyre going to run some clock Iris struggling from the floor over the last 3 minutes mik two of their last 13 in field goal attempts ass Fielder had it knocked away and a foul is Applause called Burton reaching in to knock it away usually and when the ball goes straight down you get indication of getting more ball than Music anything so thats the fourth personal foul on Burt to put Fielder at the free throw line first attempts in the game for Fielder Burton will come out and Bren shrewbury will more than likely run some point either him or rer nine points for Burton three of 14 shooting one of five from Beyond The Arc of Burton to the Music bench 13 points now for Fielder mind you Mike he averages 44 points per game for the Freshman from Boise Idaho that is a new season high for Fielder as Music Applause Music well pzney got CAU off defending by massud shot clock inside of 10 shb nice touch on the shot yeah again Ill Ill repeat it and say thats what Id like to see him doing more and Ive seen him make a conscious effort to ball fake on his shot get in and shoot the little midrange floater but hes got seven points that includes one of five on threepoint tries brumall trying to find fielder in a congested area knocked away shury stops and hits a three and see maybe just a building up of the confidence off that floater on the prior shot gives him a little bit more to take that three 10 points for shury to make it a fourpoint game nobody makes more nobody takes more threes on this Irish roster and Braden shrewbury Applause Styles foul on the Music play so Braden shoy second double digit scorer of the game for Notre d game with the threepointer for the Applause Applause Irish some days I cover up because of my moderate to severe plaque psoriasis now I feel

deposited the next next business day or sooner net credit credit to the Music people lets take a look at our Pacific Life game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years with Georgetown overcoming the twopoint halftime deficit against Notre D you know Ed Coy was very confident about his group coming in even without his leading scorer and uh their offense has showed up and you know certainly you get a big lift from Mr Fielder scoring 13 points three of four from three but theyve had other guys step up as well including massud whos got one of those four made threepointers in the second half for Coach kie again Jaden EPS for the second straight game not with the team and out with illness thats a guy who averages 19 points per game Mike that is the best of The Big E as far as scoring is concerned and so Styles is at the free throw line 78 for the season from the stripe styles on top of the Miss from the line no field goals made in the last two and a half minutes for Georgetown they do lead by four for the moment so Marcus Burton had to leave the game a moment ago with his fourth personal foul Tay Davis on the handle gets it back from Roper Shrewsbury offensive glass Roper foul on the play and rer to the free throw line for Notre Dame and hes another guy as athletic and active as he is has only been to coming into this game four of eight from the free throw line Applause Tom yeah not a lot of activity from the free throw line for roer and now Burton will come in for shrewbury who just missed that three pointer but Roper was there to collect the offensive board Applause so that this is show Miss by rer was the first of the game for Notre Dame although theyve only been to the line five times and theres a correction in the scoring column Mike for fouls were checking on Burton for fouls right now its just three right moved it back and yeah so so we we believe that was a correction from the scorer table so Burton with three personal fouls were inside of six minutes to go in regulation teams havent played in over a decade after their longstanding rivalry in the Big East shot clock down to three Roper realizes and misses massud reaches out for it yeah that was just a you know that was a possession that went nowhere and it was the thing that uh Mah shrewbury was really harping on yesterday was ball movement uh you know just no standstill no dribbling just wanted the ball moving from side to side how about 29 attempted threes by the Applause Irish Burton and again Georgetown struggles continue two and a half minutes without a field goal and an opportunity here to tie this ball game for Burton Davis and J are in there fighting for it well keep it at this end of the floor foul on Music Georgetown cook got the foul mic is fourth and this this and this you know the three ball is a shot thats going to get tougher these are two teams that are looking very tired at this point in the game and its you know the shot from distance is going to get harder as this game gets along goes Music along inside pass strong move to the basket by ji there were two Defenders there and a foul is called third foul on Fielder and thats going to thats actually I talked about you know Notre Dame getting those three quick fouls in the first half and now theyre going to be shooting the Bon theyre the first team in the bonus it was a great catch by ji on the entry pass hes a 71 free throw Applause shooter again the Irish shot just one free throw in the first half was on a threepoint play by Applause kesn sophomore from Centerville Ohio keba and they both bounce off this the the last two free throw shooters have missed both free throws does anybody want to win this game Notre Dame is trying despite the misses from Jai a 60 run over the last three minutes in change for the Irish Georgetown with the basketball and Heat 440 on the game clock Fielder Fielder wants a Applause three who knew 16 points great Step Up game for him Drew Fielder building on his new season High Burton will cross it over and kick kzne behind the line into the corner and Applause brumall fielder had made four threepointers All Season Mike before today after that last one hes now four or five from threepoint distance GNE stealing Jam well this is what fueled their comeback in the first half lets see if they can get active defensively get some easy baskets 13 for JR kesn fourpoint game Music rumball got bumped on the drive and so well step aside for just a moment with 331 to go in regulation on CW Courtside Saturday going down to the wire Georgetown and TOA Dame when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks B three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winningest programs in division one most of any comp its not bragging if its true greatness is what we do the ACC accomplished greatness heres a holiday thought to ponder is it truly a wish list if you only have one wish heres to getting everything youre hoping for this season make your wish list a reality with exceptional offers during the season of Audi there was a time when the spirit of the Season embraced Us in its welcoming glow when wondering eyes wide with enchantment and with every tinkling Bell another cherished memory was made there was a time that brought us closer to one another and to our better selves it was a most wonderful time it was Christmas this Christmas at Music builtmore Music Music lets take a look at our key play brought to you by Hilton Hilton for the St and the way Fielder is playing he might stay in that lineup for Georgetown Mike 16 points leads everybody well he came in averaging 15 points a game and Tom you look early in the season he had trouble standing on the floor with foul issues but hes cleaned that up a bit he stepped up today in the absence of eps and uh see right there four or five from three 16 points and uh hes probably going to play about 27 28 minutes in this game huge coming out powder for the freshman from Boise Idaho coming off the bench for Georgetown did have a double digit scoring gain game against Cen state with 11 points if you stay ready you dont have to get ready and you have an opportunity with your leading score not playing you step up and you impress your coach certainly what Fielder did today couple of free throws from brumall hes got nine points now after the free Applause throws so the lead is six its SP as high as nine for each team kesn will show and go nowhere to go roper in some serious traffic Fielder felt like he helped his ground Mike maintain verticality hes whistled for the foul get an overhead look here now in that early part his hands were down so that was yeah he he got vertical after the call so he was correct about that but at point of contact he was not kesn is out along with Booth ji returns Davis is in there rer at the free throw line and I you know for a young team and for this crowd its a fivepoint game folks this is this is this is really doable 10 points for rer Mike fifth time this season in double digits for him an air steal from Burton rumball fell down Styles at the free throw line trying to drop it off out of bounds and its Irish basketball uh just a a really really iffy pass that time there wasnt a lot of room no margin for error Applause so Fielder to the bench for Ed Cooling in Georgetown fivepoint Applause Advantage inside of three minutes to go in regulation for Applause Burton rooper this is literally oneonone around bromon he lays it in for roer hes got the size hes got the strength nice job of using the dribble that time and applying some pressure to the Freshman 13 points for Roper at a twopoint game finally the crowd wakes up Heath tried to shovel it to cook its out of bounds it was deflected by the Irish well and Jamie lucky underneath did not see the play he was blocked out and Clarence Armstrong picks it up from the wheat side not quite to the point where they can look at at it but I think it was the correct call heres the oneonone inside for roer against brumall 13 points for rer Heath has it with 10 on the shot clock stop and start from Heath course correction tipped by cook couldnt get it Davis pulls it down twopoint game cook probably should have come down with that and gone back up it just was a tough tip two minutes to go in regulation Burton scrapes the ceiling with the jumper and the ball ends up in the hands of brumall massud did a nice job of keeping Burton in front of him and getting pressure on the Applause shot re Hoy is getting the double dig scoring they turn it over Burton nice steal by Burton three on two to Davis for the jam tied at 60 and a Timeout on the Applause court Marcus Burton with a winning defensive play great defensive way way to open up and then the decision on this end of the floor theyve been terrific in the open its been their defense has been their best plays of the day Tom Notre Dame has fought back to tie us up for the third time in the game a 60 run punctuated by the jam and its been Julian rooper who is the one whos been igniting the crowd well rer put on a trick shot show in the first half and weve seen more conventional baskets from the Irish in the second half to tie us at 60 its getting warm in the building now Mike things are heating up the Big East and the CC head tohe head well you know its funny that Ed was the one who called Micah Shrewsberry and said hey you know what I I need a game were kind of in the same place were rebuilding you know lets play and Michael was like yeah sure it sounds good you know weve got two programs that have incredible incredible histories and uh you know this this is a great this great Applause game coach kie last year at Penn State made the Big 10 tournament finals got him to the tournament NCAA tournament for the first time since 2011 for coach shury and sitting to his right ACC fans might remember Jeff battle who was uh skip prer rightand man for years at Wake Forest tied at 60 Georgetown with a basketball over two minutes now without a field goal running some clock down it must feel like they can get to the rim if they need to CHOC loock is at eight Supreme cook around the defender second move missed the shot Roper came in to snatch it out of the Applause air 45 seconds to go in regulation here this has been the guy rooper lost the handle to Heath and then he fouled him tried the oneonone action against bruma who defended it well Mike its just the first on Roper yeah and it looked like he just he dribbled off his foot I mean brumba was you know earlier on a couple minutes ago that uh roer won that oneonone battle off the dribble but he did bumball did a better job of defending him Heath had been six of six from the free throw line first Miss tonight weve had Bunch weve had three late misses by Georgetown from the free throw line so rer has two personal files correction on that timeout is called Irish with one remaining Georgetown with two and so were tied at 60 and at one point Mike in this second half it appeared the Georgetown because of its threepoint shooting especially early on in the half might create a little distance but the Irish fighting back and a lot of it coming from the defensive end okay thing to remember here for you got 68 seconds between shot and game clock so there is a little room for Georgetown now for Notre Dame I think you cant you absolutely cant subtle for a jump shot here youve got to get something attacking the rim put some pressure on the referees to make a call you know if youre just youre just really playing into georgetowns hands if you settle for a jump shot try to get something inside now theyve tried to go oneonone with rer against brumba and its a 50 50 proposition right now but thats been him backing down if you can get something going straight ahead to the rim you know thats the play to me first year head coach Micah shury in the middle of that huddle and trying to Outlast the Georgetown Hoya you know maybe you get something you get a you get a situation where you give Burton the ball get him a screen give him some room in the middle of the floor and get him into the paint break people down Series history overall has been close Georgetown leads at 1613 as they meet for the 30th time and its a classic chapter of this rivalry which we documented that timeline between the teams it goes all the way back to 1948 Roper on the inbounds come on Applause Davis Five Points in the game for Davis choclock goes inside of 10 Burton driving by massud Up and Under and he spun it off the glass to give Notre Dame the twopoint lead 87 seconds on the clock and a timeout well if you were wondering if Marcus Burton can finish off games I think youre starting to get the answer to that what a big time finish inside uses his body uses the rim goes up underneath makes a defensive play on one end of the floor and then finish there 11 points three rebounds four assists yeah but you know what those arent eye popping numbers but its when hes made the plays last two minutes of the game life is all about timing G man and you saw the two guys that he beat on the play those are some big guys massud and cook okay heres heres the thing now for me you know my I see what Ed draws up here but for me on the road especially with this team Im going for a win you know Im going for the threepoint shot here theyve shot it pretty well Mike eight of 19 for Georgetown y 42 from threepoint distance Fielder is four or five on threes as well Brum Balls got the ball driving theyre looking for two and they got it from brumall wow makes sense Fielder on the bench at this time so bromar driving to the rim and scoring okay he went he ties it well and you know he went arguably could have gotten the call on that so one second left enough for catch and shoot he went right for the body no well he did a nice job that time keeping vertical good no call good finish thats a tough shot off balance shot contact right into ji ji held his ground bumball hit the shot I mean everybody did everything right there and it turned into a tie game at 62 with 1 second Music Applause left they have the time for the catch and shoot as you mentioned M if youre the only thing the only thing if youre if youre Georgetown you cant allow anything a catch going toward Notre Ds basket so they added a couple of tents as well Mike now you got the shortest guy on the floor taking the ball out of bounds and the tallest guy on the floor Matumbo guarding it now the pass over Zona Burton heaves it oh hit the rip PR quarter Court Georgetown beat American University in late November 8883 three in OT and a game against Oklahoma state was an OT win 6664 for Notre Dame so here we go with overtime CW Courtside Saturday can you believe this and late in that first second half I thought Georgetown gave away some points at the free throw line neither team shot it well down the stretch from the line Georgetown 14 of 19 in free throw six of nine from the strip Notre Dame Georgetown that built a ninepoint lead Mike relatively early in that second half and could not make it stand Applause Music up shock clock at 10 brumall lot of dribbling Styles stumbles diving for the loose ball is Burton shoveled ahead cook got it uh and they what they did this the score the timer recycled the shot clock and they shouldnt have because Notre name never got Music possession so now theres a discussion going Music on yeah it did not look like that was Davis who was fumbling forward after Burton Dove after it never grabbed it so theyre going to review it it didnt yeah I I dont it didnt look like anybody really came up with the basketball and until after you know they as soon as Notre Dame touched it they turned on the they flipped it to 30 seconds so Jamie lucky and James breeding are at the scorers table taking a look at it so thats Styles who stumbles down and then Burton comes out of nowhere so they flip it right there and nobody really has it so that should have been it should have been a shot clock viol its probably going to be Notre inv Bol can you make a case that Burton because he was able to make that pass may have had possession I mean it was a fantastic hustle play no question about it but did he have enough control to make that pass was he as he was looking for Davis might be yeah what theyre taking a closer look at and you know its interesting Mike you made the comment that both of the teams looked a little bit sluggish Midway through the second half they picked it up late in that second half yeah I thought I thought there was a stretch in about the 10minute Mark but you know as from the 10minute mark on lets take a look at this again here yeah now I dont know I dont know that anybody really to me I dont know that anybody really has possession of that its kind of fumbled around but I dont have a striped shirt on you had that great looking quarter CW Sports I love it but um no to your point you know toward the end of the game to its you know youre getting more timeouts you there is more chance seems to me that theres more chance to Applause rest okay they they are going to say that theyre GE that Notre Dame did possess the ball right there and it going to be 28 seconds on the shot clock its going to be georgetowns ball so weve sorted that out in overtime again second OT game for both teams and they won their OT games earlier this Music Applause season Kei has to back it out t on the shot clock Styles Wast no time and hits the three in front of his own bench he shown me a lot ability to put the ball on the floor but uh catch and shoot really didnt hesitate at all on that play reliable scorer Styles 10 points in the game eigh time this season a double digits and scoring for donrees Styles he had a streak in this year of 20o games three in a row and all tell you you know he was he could not find the basket had an early three and then really went through a stretch where he couldnt score but uh Marcus Burton has shown up in this game 13 points in total for Burton he gave the Irish a late lead with about 8 seconds to go and then brumbaugh drove it down the other end of the floor and scored a bucket with a second left thats Heath off balance Burton grabs it onepoint Georgetown lead Styles made a three and Applause OT Burton massud fell back Burton had a chance at a wide open shot well and Masss giving him about a five or six foot cushion guarding him grumba dribbled into trouble tried to turn around and get to the rim so that is a foul against Notre Dame four fourth on Burton Music Applause now well and you know now if youre if youre mik Shrewsberry do you go offense for defense with your point guard here you know you leave him in for this possession offensively but then do you take him out on the defensive side of the ball and I saw they made eye contact and I saw michah sh point to his head and said be smart you know you got this is this is part of the learning process for for a freshman player you know learn how to play with four four fouls 13 points now for brumall hes made all of his free throw attempts four for four J trying to direct a little bit of traffic capable full hands of Marcus Burton driving Burton scores it kept it behind his right ear and then laid it off the glass I didnt know how he was going to get that up on the backboard acrobatic shot rumo straight away front rim tired legs on that shot soaring rebound for Tay Davis inside of two minutes to go in overtime Georgetown by one Applause the Rivalry renewed in a big way big East and ACC deep into the shot clock for Burton for Notre Dame trying to get around massud he bumped him all I saw was from our angle were were Georgetown uniforms and then this ball comes out of nowhere and goes through the net weve seen a lot of shots involving high degree of difficulty this afternoon I mean the bucket that he made Mike to put Notre Dame up by two late in the game was acrobatic big make oneonone so make the front end there next foul will be the double Applause bonus so Burton gives Notre Dame the onepoint lead 17 points and a big OT period for Burton hes done this before had six the 11 points in the OT period in the OT win against Oklahoma State 120 on the game clock inside a 10 of the shot clock massud for three raining it in for the hoers and hes been a mystery to me hes thrown up some air balls and then he has thrown up some of the purest shots that Ive seen massud with 13 points its a twopoint Georgetown lead what a basketball game between these two programs they have put on an absolute show for us on CW Courtside Saturday Burton got the defender in the air massud those two players have been going at it here in OT Music heres the look I mean this is this is just a great stroke he didnt hesitate at all but but what I like about that last possession I talked about massud was giving him that buffer five but Burton didnt accept it he you know he went in he took the distance up gave him the little hesitation got him up in the air and got to the free throw line first Miss from the line for Burton and its timeout massud by the way is now three of six on threepointers he just gave Georgetown a twopoint lead 7068 here in Music overtime so the Irish into OT with Georgetown Mike I know you love these old school rivalry type games and what a chapter theyve added to this rivalry in their 30th alltime meeting yeah you know I just Im Im a traditionalist you know we just saw pit pit Syracuse even though now its you know its in conference and uh but still I mean uh you know we you know Syracuse is playing still plays Georgetown and some of those old school things you know its its good to keep up I you know I love it Syracuse and Georgetown played on December 9th a long loss at home for Georgetown against the orange 868 in their 99th alltime meeting but whos keeping track Burton at the free throw line for Notre Dame miss the first oh he missed two there Mike and a tire tire Miss on the front end hes got all six of the Notre Dame points here in O and were down to 35 seconds on the game clock now the thing thing of Notre Dame youve got to get the rebound here youre going to georgetowns going to run clock but if you make a Miss cant give up an offensive rebound Shak clock is at five brumall he tied this game at the end of regulation a spinning shot comes off the rim and Roper secures the board 12 seconds to go down by two for the Irish time out and that is the final timeout for Notre Dame with 9 seconds even on the clock for Micah shury and the Fighting Irish against Georgetown will you ever we were tied at 62 at the end of regulation thanks to on one end and brumo on the other see now you got you got your point guard you got your point guard with four fouls now you got your point guard with four fouls do you um you know do you go and do you try for the tie here or do you you think you have enough gas in the tank to go into another overtime or do you go for the win I mean that move by Burton at the end of the first half the second half rather yeah me to put not up by two yeah but this you know the decision here is do you try to get the three the oldfashioned way or do you go just go for the outright win Music another Stellar OT performance by the freshman Marcus Burton did it against Oklahoma State as well that was in the Legends classic in Brooklyn New York here comes Burton 6 seconds on the clock driving the lane has the kick this for the win its deflected the shot deflected by cook and theres only point4 on the clock it was ji with the shot cook challenged and got a piece a block three wow Supreme cook on the close out took a chance on going on timing it and got a piece clean block look at the elevation you would think Mike for Notre Dame that had to be option b when Burton could not get to the rim look at jas numbers on the year just 104 in threepoint attempts and hed attempted one in this game and missed it and so brumall with a chance to put it Out Of Reach 4 seconds which is enough time for a catch and shoot you need point three but if brumall makes this it in all likelihood is academic Applause and the big without their best player and they had different guys Step Up EPS was out with illness brumo finishes with 15 points Fielder leads the way for the Hoyos with 16
