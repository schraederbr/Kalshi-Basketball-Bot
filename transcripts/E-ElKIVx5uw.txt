College on December 21st starting lineup for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons brought to you by your local Toyota dealers Andrew Carr he had a gamewinning shot earlier this season that was against app state in the buzzer beater and so did Apple be for that matter against Utah Valley you know Tom I think its interesting that Mike young went big I mean wait for dinner to counteract their size he goes with Lynn Kidd in the starting lineup in you know with Hunter Couture out now Lynn kid making his third start of the season I would thank you MJ Collins gets more minutes as a result of that injury as well bounces out takes control theyre in the home white this is Applebee on the handle Music and Poe is going to be a big part of this game today and you know Wake Forest would really like to get into track meet theyd like to have this game north of 75 points shot 49 of that win against Duke but again thats a week and a half ago basically for both of these teams the shot clock is down to six thats a threepointer knocking her down for Wake bails them out is that uh you know only 30 from a threepoint line nice flying offensively theres a possession that wasnt going anywhere far as a doubledigit score for this demon Deacon team the average is just over 10 per game in fact all five starters might get the lead against Duke theyre able to get the double figures in scoring yeah it was a terrific win for them and uh you know I asked Steve Forrest about that do you would you like to play it right away to keep the momentum going and you thought they were ready for a break and then theyve started off quickly Cameron Hildreth inside in another big guard thats the thing that that Wake Forest backboard is a little short or Im sorry Virginia Tech back for a little short maybe their guys can take them inside take advantage of that corner right in front of the Wake bench and Miss from the kid struggles early on from the floor for Virginia Tech they are the second best shooting team in the league Mike right behind Miami yeah both these teams actually really good theyre effective field goal percentage is very very high foreign to in the threepoint specialist trying to work it on the interior some fancy dribbling dropped it to Marshall foul on the play so Hunter Couture at Boston College 55 rebounds made a threepointer but the arm injury to his left arm in the second half against the Eagles in the OT loss welcome to the big thing Tom too with him is youre losing 40 percent from the threepoint line is a guy whos can spread the floor and you know kid gives you a different element the leading threepoint shooters for Virginia Tech time for the Ford keys to the game with Mike jaminsky yeah for Virginia Tech again they want to calm things down they dont want to track meet here try to keep it below 70 points and for Wake Forest regain that momentum and feeling from that Duke win thats uh you know could be a huge Catalyst for them going forward mutts from Beyond the threepoint Arc and he hits it you know he hasnt taken a ton on the year but hes shooting a very good percentage lets see today with Couture out true if he gets up more threes yeah both Couture and fazili with 27 made threes and both shooting 40 percent from the Army just made his eight threepointer of the season as Mike mentioned is close to 50 car spinning in the paint everything but the finish and pulled down by Kid inside and its a rim rocker and its Lynn kid chin up on the rim well Padula made that happen he broke everybody down off the dribble there were four deacons around him at the rim and he threw a nice little easy wraparound pass so again Lynn Kidd getting his third start of the Season he only averages about five points per game a little Rim Bender from the kid foreign you know the thing too for kid its a good confidence Builder get an easy basket like that not used to being in the starting lineup Virginia Tech had a chance to win that game at Boston College on December 21st a couple looks at it at the end of regulation and Austin Overtime 7065 Bill trip had it knocked away mutz was back there and here comes Cabool in transition he got bumped hey heres the look I mean nobodys really in front of him right there so he engages gets into the lane area draws everything and you know if youre a big guy the guy turns his back to try to go for the block follow right behind him keep your hands available Music youre with us were tied at five Virginia Tech and Wake Forest in Virginia Tech just went four in a row here thats a three thats once again Mike he checked on yeah well you know we talked about it just a possession ago is he the guy now whos going to be out there spreading the floor you know that lets kids stay closer to the basket Applebee got fouled on the threepoint shot attempt by Padula who helps him out good sportsmanship and thats the lead on the road here at Wake Forest the only meeting between the teams this season time now for the fresh market discover the best that we feature Sean Padula in time you know you may say all right his minutes are up so naturally the scoring is open that doesnt always follow and for him you know you usually take the biggest jump between your freshman and sophomore year nobodys maybe not many people have taken a bigger jump in the country than this guy is scoring the ball sophomore from Edmond Oklahoma just over 17 points per game is fifth in the conference had 18 points in the loss against Boston College has struggled from Beyond The Arc just 104 and 44 minutes of action and that last one before break a bad foul by Padula putting uh Apple vehicle really quiet and then you foul him on a threepoint shot so one youre giving away a foul and then youre getting him involved offensively Tyree Appleby 88 for the free throw line that is second best of the accent Music first year of the Wake Forest program played two years at Cleveland State in the two years of Florida where he faced Virginia Tech in the NCAA tournament two years ago Mike and they beat him well and this is a this is a battle that Wake Forest has to win theyve got to win the freethrow line uh its an area that Virginia Tech doesnt visit often free throws put an end to an 80 over Jimmys Tech run paint Roger Ayers Jamie lucky Bill Covington Jr are officials Bradford picked up the phone Steve Forbes coach of the year in the ACC a season ago hes these last two have been the last two ACC coaches of the year and it was interesting Mike before the game you said you saw something you have never seen before youve been in broadcasting for 40 years well it wasnt casual but Steve Forbes and uh foul in the basket there but Steve Forbes and uh and Mike young were seated talking to one another for an extended period of time all so con stories huh heres the heres the replay the good handoff and uh Maddox getting a good look at that coming off the screen yeah and you know you know great to see we you know we went over and started chatting with both of them at the same time they didnt go over scouting reports then but he made free throw but um you mentioned the this referee crew this is like an ACC final Tournament final crew its veteran and three great officials Williamson is in there for Wake Forest he wears number four thats a Miss from Monsanto and thats now over their last five shots but wake their last field goal of the 1835 mark of this half and conversely Virginia Tech four of its last five from the floor after starting over three congested area Collins had to retreat mutts its the open man Applause theyve gotten off the drive like that and one thing that Steve Ford said weve got to try to keep him out of the lane so far Virginia Techs been able to get in and make things happen Elijah Poteet transfer from rice years in that program and played 33 games a season ago for the hours yeah I mean if those two have poteen and kid are playing extended minutes and you get them dunks it takes a lot of pressure off your offense Appleby Slams on the brakes High degree of difficulty and if that is off a much better defense that time no foul forcing him into a very awkward shot its had to kick it out this is Maddox around the perimeter its a lightning quick move by Maddox cant finish it off Williamson trying to get around Maddox whistle and foul and Maddox was just in the wrong place that time got called for the foul but look at this everybody converting all those jerseys focused on the driver and thats just the Poteet and hes as easy as two as hes going to get really nice pass too I mean you know with one thing we talk about mutts that may be the last thing we talk about but he is so valuable three and a half assists a game for him whats at 18 points and eight boards nine of 17 from the floor against the Eagles and the most recent game for Virginia Tech the loss on the road played 41 minutes in that OT game as well how about his game against North Carolina and that victory at home mutts had 27 points Mike a season highend game high against the targets and also 11 rebounds in that game he was just a man against a very big front line in the vicinity and a foul is call okay so Mike young the head coach for the Virginia Tech Hokies taking them to the NCAA tournament two years in a row as Mike mentioned Mike jaminsky mentioned coach of the year in the ACC back in 2021 Mike when they went 157 and they were third in the ACC with nine victories and he had to go into the high rollers sweep to get his popcorn today was asked to make a contribution thats a longstanding tradition yes Mike young always has his popcorn before the game he will sample the popcorn from the Arenas and venues in and around the ACC and Beyond car zigzagging dribble had it knocked out of bounds looked like maybe Poteet recovered defensively Mike Applause he did and so far I mean that uh no it was a yeah so far this move of having kids start and putting size up there in the front line is paying dividends for Virginia Tech and Wake Forest of its last eight field goal the 10th Appleby the only points he has are those three throws got the defender in the air with the ball fake and that was Darius Maddox with his second personal so far and this is you know there are lots of different ways to work yourself into a scoring Rhythm free throw line that being a bad place so this would be number four and five for uh Mr Applebee Appleby had 32 points at Wisconsin a couple of reinforcements ready to check in for Virginia Tech Music this you know this its a short bench for Mike young as it is and so you put you have the tour out that really makes things you know six seven guys maybe so we told you Couture was tied for the lead in threepoint shooting with his teammate grant bazilli for Virginia Tech and Brazilia is in there 21 in Black Applause by the way in that win for Wake Forest Mike against Duke on December 20th they were 22 of 26 from the free throw line the freethrow line is a weapon for the steaming no no question its a big part of what they do and uh 20 almost 20 percent of their points coming from the line hes also havent lost a home this season another interior feed that got knocked away Bradford I think got the block that time was a really nice high low pass they just couldnt finish heres that look I mean this is a great look down inside kid right there and look maybe look black was from behind up to a half a block each Fantastic look from right behind the rim and the backboard here at Joel Coliseum store at home of waiting for his basketball score the basket put doula you know the interesting thing I mean with with control out you have to change philosophies defensively and really guard inside out but Padula has been able to take guys off the dribble here early nice move back to his vehicle left and then coming right Applause Sean Padula Applause rearhigh 22 points and a home win against William and Mary earlier this season barring anything in a close game hes probably looking at 40 minutes this afternoon struggles continuing for the floor right now 18 still go shooting while Virginia Tech is 46 percent brazily will turn around with touched in a soft bounce Steve Forbes wants a timeout and can you blame him Virginia Tech has built an eightpoint lead scores so far Mike and with Couture out hes expanded his Game knocking down a couple of Threes right now hes perfect from the floor there you see his ability to pass use his size inside and then defensive end as well Justin Lutz stepping up early Music Virginia Tech has made two threes and they are both off the hands of Justin mutts leading rebounder for this team as well also averaging over 13 points per game last year Wake Forest went to Castle Coliseum Blacksburg Virginia and won the meeting between the teams the only regular season meeting last season lets see if you know right at that last time basily had no double team on it the easy back in and lets see if they change defensively now maybe come on him on the double team so you know its an important possession here to execute Music like uh Hildreth was trying to set a screen and he got through a ghost so Collins picks up his first personal Maddox has two for Virginia Tech Carr has two personals per week far out there right now Applause Williamson cant find the mark what is it about these noontime starts Michael yeah I mean you know sometimes for teams it takes uh 10 12 minutes to get going I was never a huge fan of noon games GMan notorious a little slow start up the engine heres a stealing a break and Captain America advantage and thatll be two on the break good decision by hildred to give it up on Bobby Clinton is able to catch and finish brazily stop and start possession but bazilly got fouled and that time out you can see a lot more intensity one on the offensive end right here a good finish by Clinton and then on defensive end even though you know they bail him out with a foul but a lot more active so Clinton picked up the foul at the other on Mike to put the zillion Applause heres the thing you know wake is already at 16 foul so one more Virginia Tech is going to be at the line in the bonus hes silly the grad student and transfer from Wright State in Ohio playing his 109th career Collegiate game is up to Four Points you know and hes not Kevin Aluma but he really brings a great element to the floor here special his ability to spread the floor as well as go inside room a part of the Virginia Tech Squad last year that won the ACC tournament in Brooklyn New York to Barclays Center to win over Duke in the title game there are people already talking about a statue outside of Castle Palestine for Mike young oh there it is Williamson finally finding the range from the corner in a threepointer yeah they need his offense hes been in and out of the starting lineup uh still you know for him he needs to shoot concentrate on the three brazily threepoint line put the shoulder down and Hildreth had the position offensive foul thats where hilders had the advantage but we talked about it with Williamson you know these two its a shorter back court that was a terrific crosscourt pass by Appleby to find him but you look at Williamson from two hes 14 of 42 from three 1746 shoot the three I mean you know it doesnt make sense for him to be inside the ark Williamson steps inside the arc and inside the freethrow line he comes up short saved on the baselines and Williamson transferred from East Tennessee State basically alongside his head coach Steve Forbes thats not bad when you get it you hire a new coach and you show up with a couple of pretty good players so the whistle is going against Virginia Tech and its the silly trying to plead his case unsuccessfully hes picked up his second personal so Brazilian has to leave the game with those two personal fouls and to the Mike young bench and right now yeah and thats the thing that we talked about the short bench for Virginia Tech and to try to get into that with fouls they are 21 of their minutes are bench minutes Tom thats 350th in the nation out of 358 well at Boston College the Virginia Tech Banks got outscored 301 my hip thats a follow from Marsh good work on the boards first bucket for number 33 in white and old gold and black hes ridiculous hes now 32 of 36 from the four Tom just incredible in the 80s thats mutts little Runner couldnt calculate the angle demon Geeks Come Away With It with Clinton well how about with Clinton leading the break you get Williamson and Appleby off the ball they gotta wake as a smaller team out there now with Hildreth and those three other guys look at hilders backing it down miscommunication into the backcourt with Appleseed and thatll be a backward violation just first turnover of the game for Wake Forest and theyve climbed back into this one Mike in 2017 just under nine minutes to go in our first half so Im glad that youre with us on New Years Eve and early happy New Year Mike absolutely to all our viewers as well weve got some good college football coming up later on this afternoon our Focus right here yeah Joel laser laser light theres a lot of action early riding around the league at 12 oclock and two oclock yeah theyre one of six games on the schedule of the ACC on this Saturday there were three yesterday North Carolina theyve got a bit of a surprise in the league a couple of Clemson up near the top hit up here started one and three and now has won 10 of 11 to meet Miami one again Mike thats nine in a row and undefeated in conference play and thats Williamson for three yeah its its really important for him to get that confidence and see a big basket early and all of a sudden the crowd is here gone it is an 80 demon Deacon running were tied at 20 mutt stepped on the inline foreign ER Applause you should talk about playing a lot of basketball is 134th Career College game and hes now made 181 career threes it was two today Appleby around the edge tried to put it up on the rip for marsh and they got bumped in midair mind Jeff potee went underneath him that time all right so the foul goes against Virginia Tech and were tied at 20 play between Virginia Tech and Forest lets go around the ACC for some news and notes four teams in the top 25 Mike that might change after the results yesterday well yeah and how about Miami and 14 a nice move up for them they were not in the top 25 early in the season and Pitt started one in three time we talked about 101 since a big win against North Carolina and uh Miami 40 in conference play Miami went on the road and won at Notre Dame Pitt was hosting North Carolina yesterday won that game their 30 in conference play its going to be a race all the way to the tournament Greensboro North Carolina the 70th ACC tournament happy New Year theyre already celebrating inside the Joel and theyre celebrating a comeback by Wake Forest here down by as many as eight Mike in the first half to Virginia Tech and it was it was from that time out that Steve Forbes called that when it was 1810 and uh theyve theyve flipped the switch and then 102 run the sophomore from Cornwall England Applause Music I call Steve Forbes right maybe one of the best nicknames has come up with with Banger and mash with him and hilderth and no run by the deacons Hildreth from Worthing England Applause thank you now in the corner of the front rows Hildreth took a spill Music um and that was interesting I thought that Camden might have stuck his right leg out a little bit to get the call we saw Appleby get fouled on a threepoint shot by Petula and now same thing happening at the other end of the Court John Camden with his first free throw of the Season Mike heres the look at it drifted a little bit that was close but he got the call and you know heres the thing you know with him two of nine coming in why foul him in that situation make him make a shot had not been to the freethrow line this year that only attempted 10 shots All Season yeah as Mike mentioned nine of those were threepointer Cuts prior to that one so John Camden and maybe this is some trickledown effect on the Couture youve got to find people to build them in spots and mutts has been the only one whos made it three up to this point Virginia Tech is 77 from the freethrow line its a Miss from Williamson out of the corner hes made a couple of Threes in his first half Maddox tripped up thatll be two minutes in The Penalty Box for March and that was a smart play by Padula you know you get a switch like that theyre trying to keep him boxed in but you get the big out in front of you drive right at him pick up the foul you know Marshas not going to be able to guard him moving laterally so pedula 11 Virginia Tech has gone about five minutes without a field goal and still have the one point lead one on that 100 run Applause Sean Padula its just oozing that confidence Mike its really the the Difference Maker yes his minutes are up but as you mentioned that doesnt always translate into scoring for pecula this season it certainly does over 17 points per game yeah like I said heavy minutes he played 44 of the 45 minutes against Boston College double figure scoring in every game this year for Sean to do as a sophomore theres nothing better for a coach to just you can put it in ink what youre going to do every game is so consistent the jiminsky factor theres no eraser on that pencil I always kept it in my pocket great to have you with us for ACC basketball Tom Worley along with Mike jaminski the Duke Legend send it into the corner to Williamson that was on target but shorty follows it up and grabs it and hes stepping into the three for Appleby Mike just a second field goal attempt of the game yeah so far the uh the threepoint shot has not been there for Wake Forest with concentrate getting inside a little bit more wake is three of eleven from threepoint distance much closer to the hoop for coaching too and see thats just you know that was all Padula he had to post up inside but theyve been really making some nice interior passes for easy baskets bonus offense from potique hes got four points thats around the river Inn and hildred with an advanced skillful drive to the rim tell you what Cameron Hilder is another guy whos made a big jump Four Points a game last year to 12 this year he had a triple double this season Mike in late November against Hampton 14 points 10 boards 11 assists third triple double in school in history and hes got the rebound he is their leading rebounder Mike at six foot four almost seven rebounds per game and uh showing the ability to handle and lead the break that time good decision to pull it out Music Applause ing threepoint lead inside Marsh thats soak Forest Rim Bender and thats how you shoot 85 percent folks you get those who roll into the basket they did a nice job spreading the floor and he gets an easy finish how about that pass from Applebee just slinging it inside the marsh shes able to take the rim off its hinges mutts again looking for three hes connected on a couple in the first half inside of five minutes to go now Applebee getting his teammates involved Applause bounces off for Clinton Applause Music Virginia Tech in the world black uniforms this afternoon will be on Padula Applause really really showing some nice post moves Ryan theyre going to call Double technicals right after that shot Padula got right into forbess face since or turned around and said something and Jamie lucky is going to clean this up quickly it was a double technical foul now watch after them watch after the shot the fade and we cant see it and right there you missed it he turned around and said something to Forbes see if you can hear it I mean thats a terrific move and then right there Forbes is standing there and he turned around and said something I think Padula was trying to smooth it over yeah were all good yeah well Padula got attacked and so did Forks and the interesting thing is is that these are these are two great friends Mike young and Steve Ford from their dates in the Southern Conference and reports of East Tennessee State and Mike young at Wofford lets take a look now Tom Jamie lucky blows a technical foul lets see how the game I think this is going to be officiated a little more tightly for the next uh next few minutes theres the look and it was it was almost like it was like oh and see Jamie lucky was right there as well so he heard the exchange so Padula in the process getting that technical it also equates to his second person and hes going to come out of the game right now hes you know Norma and Mike young will play guys with two fouls um you know you look at them that that may be a sports a sportsmanship gesture by Young right there lets get the Doula to the bench calm things down just just a thought because and then he and Forbes just a moment ago you see Mike young walking back to his position they shook hands like right at the 50yard line and returned to their spots Monsanto thats a free yeah hes been quiet Israels first points of the game and uh you know for them Appleby and hillgriff in Monsanto have to be big scorers 35th three of the season for Monsanto and he leads the club in that category winning and scoring athletic Drive MJ Collins oh offensive foul turn off so Collins picked up the foul good catch Mike his second how about damari Monsanto find some daylight and knocks down the three ball Ill tell you Florida States 21 in conference but their overall record four and ten but playing very well as of late um though youre locked into the Boston College Syracuse game and man Louisville how about that you go out of conference and you know its Im beloved that they keep that rivalry alive but that is a Stern test right before a conference play starts Boston College the most recent opponent for Sean Padula back into the game of his Virginia Tech teammates they lost about a week and a half ago on the road at BC Connie Forum in overtime killdrift two Defenders gets some help Miss in tight from Clinton I remember whether he realized he was just so wide open mike had no defender on him and too strong with the layup the Doula into the corner Catch and Release Collins how about that bounce for three and uh whos another guy who struggled from the line this year from on the threepoint line to 15 but uh you know weve talked about it this whole first half of different people having to pick up for Couture not being in the game Collins had only made four threes prior to that make to the Freshman from Clover South Carolina wearing number two in Black is from the corner for three seventh rebound for much so far two assists six points hes looking at a triple double the doula Applause forced in transition Hildreth had a steam to the rim collides with Poteet whistle and foul free throws coming up for hildred well this is a good look ahead and hes got a great hes got a great Lane right to the rim hes got really good size I love hit six four very strong looking for contact family in town for the holidays making the trip freshman from Worthing England a couple of shots 76 percent from the line for Hildreth this season Applause lets get a message from Coyote Tractor my experience if you work the land youve got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism and a whole lot of getgo foreign Applause Music Applause Applause thats why you know if your weights worse dont settle for jump shots and threes attack the basket Collins from that same Corner in front of the Wake bench Hilton comes away with it Music Santos got a three in this first half series of moves unable to get the shot away but Appleby Mike five points does not hit a field goal yet until now for three and he said what Mr wormy ahead and how long eight points for Appleby feeling good in the threepoint neighborhood yeah and hes going to be uh hes going to be a little more active looking for a shot Music foul on the play against wake heres a look it just gets a little daylight kind of a switch looks like Collins got a little confused on that play but thats really Appleby creating I mean he shoots it so well Mike from Beyond The Arc 43 to lead the team this season for Applebee on threepoint attempts for the graduate student in Jacksonville Arkansas there was a foul against one of the demon Deeks and that was against Cleveland his second Applause Lynn Kidd is at the free throw line I think you know right now if youre Mike young youre just holding your breath and youre going to try to get all these guys with two fouls into uh into halftime entrepreneur not available Applause Music Applause and the folks who made the trip from Blacksburg oh its Justin mutts with the serious how about efforts how about eight points and eight rebounds for just as much nobody getting a body on him he had a free run right inside four white jerseys see right there he just comes in unimpeded off of that John Camden missed from threepoint distance and I think initially Mike a lot of folks here at the Joel Coliseum thought that might have been a goal time but when you look at it from behind the room you can clearly see that ball was to so were closing in on the final minute of the first half the one point lead for Virginia Tech after the following Jam by Justin musk and the threepoint shooting aside is a good midrange jump shot by Monsanto but this scoring kind of where Virginia Tech wants it Applause Santo gives Deeks the lead back at 3635 one more Music Virginia Tech basketball Padula and thats again you know that the Doula would only have one foul except for that technical that he picked up see if that becomes costly and that was a brief exchange with Steve Forbes the head coach of Wake Forest mutts Camden threepointer Virginia Tech and Ill tell you he wasnt in the top five or six on The Scouting Report um but you gotta take a look at the shots that hes taken on the air most of them have been threes hes got six points with three and three three throws and thats Marsh at the other end another Jam for 33 in white and were tied at 38 20 seconds to go in the first half great force led by as many as five Mike Virginia Tech led by as many as eight were kind of 38 final seconds first half five extreme role for Purdue steps back beyond the line fight for the loose ball time runs out so Marsh with that Jam at the Wake Forest then Padula cant hit the threepointer and well go to the locker room tied at 38 yeah and the best thing the best thing for uh Mike young is he got his guys out nobody picking up that third personal foul four made threes in the first half for Virginia Tech Wake Forest had five and two from Williamson tied at 38 halftime Straight Ahead from Joel Collison ACC basketball is brought to you by Toyota visit your local Toyota dealers today Toyota Lets Go Places and by CBI Security CPI home security that protects what matters most Music back inside Joel Coliseum WinstonSalem North Carolina the Geeks will start in possession of the white Virginia Tech of the traveling black tied at 38 as you start our second half of play Tom wormy Mike jiminsky in our outstanding ACC college basketball production Foods anticipation of that crosscourt pass just a second turnover of the game for Wake Forest we get the ball right back with Hildreth car fouled going to the line kid was in the vicinity five points for Carr and the chance at the threepoint Play heres the look and one of the things that the key on this look at basily had to lay off hes got two fouls he only played Seven Minutes in that first half I think that was the key of how that play unfolded and thats a nice wrap around a good catch and with the foul on kid Mike thats now six Hokies fouls and you know the two guys I mean Padula is scoring but 005 from three so theyve kept him calmed down and for basily he needs to get going offensively as well mutts carrying the load Virginia Tech is a team 35 percent of the season from Beyond The Arc they go inside kid trying to return the favor and he has a chance at a threepoint play keep in mind too that you know when you have injuries like this this is probably not a lineup thats practiced a lot together so you know theyre trying to find a rhythm of especially with another big in there and kid but you got the mismatch inside and a pretty good move kid the Junior from Gainesville Florida the transferred from Clemson unable to complete the old school threepoint play and that goes out of bounds and back to Virginia Tech so wake Mike had only one turnover in the first half two early turnovers in the second half well and the key thing is those were unforced turnovers by Applebee just uh kind of lost concentration on two possessions Music prior to the loss of BC about a week and a half ago Virginia Tech had won six in a row including the win in the ACC Big Ten challenge against Minnesota kid trying to work down low fouls on Monsanto so hes picked up a couple of early fouls in the second half now he has three well and its lets lets see you know on the look on that that theyve been posting kid up on that left block and uh going to work and come back with an offensive foul after those double texts a lot tighter whistle now so Mike bazilly just picked up his third and you could tell by the expression from coach young not thrilled about it already a little fin on the front lines with Hunter Couture out with the left arm Hildreth all kinds of dribbling and moves mutts picking up the foul first on mutts according to Jamie lucky Music this is one of the things too that uh Steve Forbes had talked about matching the physicality of Virginia Tech uh you know maybe not the most imposing sizewise team but very physical in how they defend car a little show and go on bazilly working with the three personals bounces off Carr bats it out of bounds and mutton Virginia Tech take over possession Applause thank you coach Forbes 2021 was a struggle for his program Petula a cut off at the rim and we wanted to cut him off with his own teammate kid roll into the basket they work it around the perimeter Appleby ripping the ropes for Wake Forest big basket for him to get that pilot light lit into double digits with 11 points in the 12th time this season for Appleby and he and he turned around at the bench but got a much better reception thats his match Padula did today thats his move heres the look Mike how about the passing though right yeah I mean really nice across Court getting the ball getting him a look in the you know on the weak side so thats the second three for Applebees up to 25 May this season again best percentagewise on the roster for Wake from threepoint distance Brazilian catch in release Applause kid active on the glass and he got fouled on the putback well Lynn Kidd is making the most of his third start of the Season Mike yeah I mean if you know for you know putting you know putting him in the starting lineup Five Points five rebounds with a chance for to get up to seven here its nice production from the first time start monsantos up to four personals we got that last one okay so were being told it was changed to Applebee either way thats seven fouls already called in the half as brazily goes to the bench hes got three and won this half well and again its its the bench in uh Camden gave them a huge lift ing knocks it down to three and three free throws once again Hunter Couture tied for the team lead in threepoint shooting with Brazilian on the bench a left arm injury in the second half against Boston College in the overtime loss on December 21st fine this is uh Mike young whos having to get creative with the teams he has on the floor this is certainly not in a normal rotation and you know thats a lot of leadership as well its a pile of leadership sitting on that bench with the tour well and thats you know thats why its falling to Padula to really kind of take control Applause three ball nine points per car fivepoint lead Wake Forest good find good spacing ties their largest lead of the game much hesitation and drive Applebee Camden with the closeout on Carr this time just brings it up right now this is the pace that Wake Forest wants to play at very frenetic up and down two players on the deck nuts and Appleby wrestling for the basketball Applause second on mutts Mike Carr coming in uh not a great percentage but two three so far in the game hes got two of the seven set threes on 18 tries from Beyond 22 feet one and three quarter inches away its been a slow start for Virginia Tech one of five to start the half wake also made Seven threes on 19 tries of the win against Duke on December 20th their last outing that was here with her undefeated 70 at Joe Coliseum R hemmed in all right thats a really nice defense by Camden medulla unselfishly to the corner Camden car the rebound Music Applause theyre getting theyre letting Hildreth handle the ball and bring it up a little bit more to get Appleby a little bit of a blow but ball back in his hands how about Applebee Mike knifing his way time out of the Court 13 points for Appleby and the largest lead of the game its now seven for the demon geeks on their home court against Virginia Tech Applebee three and four Defenders trying to hang with him and they cant third leading scorer in the ACC two were tied at 38 at halftime and fouls I mean this is starting to look like a war of attrition for uh for Mike yuck being one starter down and you got your figs and uh basilian Boutique both with three personal fouls so you know wake up you want to mix it up for the three every now and then fine but I think its just full Attack Mode inside youll wake on a 134 run start the half and car can increase it right here from the free throw line two from the line for car now and hes up to 12 points fours is one two of its last three the Duke win and the game against App State where Carr was the hero with the buzzer beater 6766 right here Joes Coliseum into the passing Lane of the Steel by car hes everywhere Mike and thats the thing thats why he got into the lineup and worked his way in on the defensive end but really paying dividends on the offensive end will be changing direction and kid for the board Virginia Tech does not have a field goal since the 1921 40 seconds into the half they coughing up again their 10th turnover on there on Hildreth up on the rim for Carr his surprise car at that time with the lobby probably should have gone right in mutts individual effort from mutz is an offensive foul now hes up to two personal fouls and now with that one Mike is third yeah Mike you want to stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer I know you will not going anywhere we got a long way to go this season we are cranking up conference play great stories emerging Miami continuing their momentum from the elite eight run from a season ago weve got to look at them with a couple nice wins against Cornell and NC State a couple of weeks ago Wake Forest both of these teams good stories as well Virginia Tech defending champs in the ACC they came from they had a very slow start to their conference play last year at one point Virginia Tech was two and seven in conference play ended up winning the title wake comes up empty the Doula jogs it up and he said theyve really kept him quiet to start the half doula Virginia Tech does not have a doubledigit score a facility which forces his way in and on the follow puts it in six points Brazilian nice job staying with it and uh I was like right there just an effort by Mike young to get him a touch and get him going offensively Applebee just too good I mean the defense was really solid Doula came out under control and Applebee just made a tough shot 16 points now for Appleby Music Corner Padula and he hits a three and thats also under duress great concentration uh yeah Appleby all over second three for Petula now his first three Mike on six tries and now 10 points just a second ago I said Virginia Tech did not have a doubledigit score until Padula did it hes done it in every game around the rim and ounce Bill drift possession preserved for Virginia Tech on defense Wake Forest working on the offensive end with Hildreth Applause interception Padula clean Lane to the kid will be trying to get back recover thats the thing I mean Virginia Tech is not going to run hes not going to get a track meet but those turnovers out front just turn into automatic points 12 points for Sean Padula still below his season average of 173 and hits the back iron and that was the ninth point off turnovers for Virginia Tech so thats a stat theyre starting to win its the chip into this lead once again shot from Collins came up short weve got a line change coming in from Wake Forest they got three guys at the scorers table hopping over the boards to hit the ice Applause Music Applebee with the commands directing a little traffic trying to work off the screen watch the handle in the corner Collins waiting for his teammates mutz fills the lane says off an easy chance and you need to convert Hildreth High stepping his way around Collins and in weve seen the guards have some nice plays in the paint area eight points for Cameron Hildreth mutts Baseline this time he converts looking to score and converting Justin mutts and hes got 10 well and the thing was that he had Bradford in front of him when he knows he can take off the dribble endtoend action just about halfway through our second half of play sixpoint lead wave Forest will be medulla trying to hang with him defensively circus shocked medulla got a piece of him to his dismay wow yeah that was a big foul for them to pick up his third and heres the look you can see that break away off the steal but then how about Cameron Hildreth both of them Applause Music foreign Music here at Joel Coliseum as you were saying a very festive yes atmosphere so glad that you joined us on New Years Eve as we will welcome in 2023 tonight and it looked like wake was right on the cusp of taking this game completely over a nice fight back by Virginia Tech to cut it to six so Applebees at the freethrow line Padula had fouled him and picked up his third and really a giveaway foul I mean it just he bit on the pump fake and it was a nice job Appleby drawing that foul 102 for Applebee he and carved combined for 18 of the 20 points in the second half for Wake Forest its a seven point lead 10 and a half minutes to go so Doula gets three Defenders how did he do it GMan button to think too is maybe Scouting Report you want to send them left and you take your chances that way that was a great finish in a crowd 14 points for Padula the sophomore at 61 making his way to the rim against three and four Defenders from Wake Forest that was the thing with Couture too youre missing a big guard with him out its six three six four so Camden gets a piece of Monsanto whos back in with his four personal fouls it really through the course of the game time has been able to get into the lane area now he had Marsh Marshall trying to show out on a on a screen he just went right by him Music one and one thank you six points now for Monsanto its just the miraculous story with him with his Achilles I mean I I just I still cant believe that he he played last year coming back from that surgery had that injury in May of 2021 first game back is that Georgia Tech January 19 2022 Mike said an amazing comeback from Monsanto Marsh high for the board of the Purdue the Miss and did he pick up the foul boy and that you know talk about making the adjustment from your suggestion to sophomore year but wow that was just a giveaway foul for his fourth not a good decision at all so Petula who is the leading scorer for Virginia Tech is now playing with four personal fouls this is marsh lets see Im going to be interesting to see down at the other end who Padula is guarding a 14 of 18 from the freethrow line for Wake Forest foreign Applause Music thats the matchup they can take advantage of they have Marsh on mutts and he can beat him off the dribble which he did and uh boy petite has just been its just been catch and dunk for those guys in the back line six points for potique above his season average of 42 thats off the hand of Marshall Tracked Down by Padula another really loose pass thank you fivepoint game tied at 38 at halftime double team on Padula got it to Poteet as he was falling down and Poteet to the line for the Hokies wow pinch Point production for the Virginia Tech in this game especially on the front line solid finish by Boutique one shot this is falling down boy the play didnt look pretty but then were going to now see now a chance to see what weight does Padula out of the game with one well see how long he stays on the bench and well see how Virginia Tech conducts itself with him on the floor Virginia Tech has started the half one of six from the four Mike seven of eleven since potique with the threepoint Play Wake with the basketball Williamson has come back in for Wake along the Baseline that will be off of Madison trying to make a move on the Baseline uh you get a freshman in Collins and a junior in Maddox out on the floor now over three minutes without a field goal for Wake Forest and that was mutts with the bumped at four yeah thats his fourth its another cheap boy I mean you know were gonna hit it if youre gonna take a hard foul in the lane thats one thing but those are your two key fouls theyve given up and mutts did not have a foul in the first half no none four here and he picked up two and two possessions early on Applebee of six of seven from the strike in this game Applause all of a sudden the Purdue has hit the bench a tour on available to play this afternoon with the left arm injury and he had started 49 games in a row for Virginia Tech one of two Appleby Music looking Mark says everybody ran down the floor nobodys used to being in the game right now butts is your primary ball handler with this group a bit of a patchwork effort from coach young trying to push the right buttons and the thing is that much is up to it but the other guys I mean thats you know thats a thats a path maybe Poteet doesnt make a whole lot and he didnt on that position 12 turnovers in the game Mike Youngs Virginia Tech Hokies makes young in his fourth season you know they they normally look at 10 10 is 10 turnovers is about the pain threshold but I got to think with you know with this lineup youre gonna have to live with a little bit more than that yeah 6158 wake with the ball inside of eight minutes to go in regulation from back Monsanto volleyball to round to Poteet Camden has the size advantage on Apple being a foulest call Monsanto came in on the back end of the play but the foul goes against Wake Forest it is a one possession game in WinstonSalem Music its time for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer foreign schedule in the ACC and Mike jaminski these are the top five scorers in the league so far I dont think any real surprise you know Armando Bangkok coming back uh certainly turkavian Smith we knew about his ability to score Appleby they get a second guy in the portal uh whos playing extremely well for him and then you know Caleb love needs a proven score and Sean Padula really has been a Mainstay for Virginia Tech much approved this season for Padula one of the players just outside of that top five Mike is Isaiah long from Miami undefeated in conference plans I dont know this early on if you can say out if there is a top five he certainly has had some incredible games had a 36 point performance earlier this year um really is a dynamic scorer in the open floor and uh you know there was some question about him coming back this year but I think he made the right choice getting his teammates involved as well seventh in the conference an assist per game and he can also take it away from the opposition hes fifth with was almost two assists per game and they dont want to start out one and two especially if youre awake given a you know a home game you protect the home court against Duke very well um so you know again there are some teams that struggled early that are in the top four in Florida State and Pitt one of those conference wins Mike for Clemson was at home against Jeff Wake Forest challenging scheduling for Wake they came back and responded to the win against Duke in their most recent game Camdens at the freethrow line for Virginia Tech and now right now were to update is the bench 18 points for Virginia Tech huge lift for them Camdens been a nice fine one of his uh six points for him Poteet has nine off of that bench for Virginia Tech trying to keep it alive off the second Camden Miss Hill ball the arrow favors Virginia Tech now the nine from Poteet that ties a season High Camden I got to be honest Mike I had to go to the bottom of the roster to find him because he hadnt really taken a whole lot of shots this season but hes been a nice compliment with Couture out of the lineup today Ive been to the freethrow line this year uh before this game and for in for Poteet has not scored in double figures this season and that that season high he talked about was the first game against Delaware state Tour on that bench a senior from Orlando Florida has to watch this one unfortunately so I mean for for contributions say Mike young has got to be thrilled with what its been shes giving him the mutts the experienced man in that lineup Up and Under and 12 points and the thing off the dribble hes got to be careful about the offensive foul is playing with four right now once also has a double double mike 12 points 10 boards five assist three blocks great day for mutts and thats the guy I mean they took Padua off of Appleby put him on Williamson and Williamson knocks down the pretty open three of the game and nine points Damian Williamson right on his season average of 93 per game mutts operating on the Block no double team coming either they look like Marsh play him one on one and play much is really shooting the three in this game the postups and scoring off the drive really diverse offense 14 points in the game for mutts third best shooter in the ACC by percentage trying to live up to it this afternoon its a car by mutts challenged by potique car he got it back and he lays it in thats I mean nobody really could do anything about that in the lane theres no real shot blocker out there but you know maybe a little bit for much this again we may be at a little bit of a Tipping Point here but Doula was the cutter and he lost it Music Applause eight turnovers in the second half of Virginia Tech and now Padula and for for Mike young theres going to be a lot of offense for defense substitutions here to get Padula out on the defensive end of the floor foreign Monsanto has three hes in the deepest foul trouble Williamson again fourth three in the game for Williamson and 12 points and a Timeout on the court he has been living on the left side of the floor two consecutive big big shots Applause four of seven on threepoint attempts for Williamson and he is part of the Coyote Tractor Turning Point from threepoint distance yeah hes just been getting really good looks at the three and theyve had that kind of you know Cross Court pass he catches it in rhythm the 10th made three of the game for Wake Forest third time this season they have made 10 or more in a ball game yeah yeah you know we we you know we talk about bench points and and uh you know if youre strictly speaking yay is a bench player in this game but hes had seven starts on the year so hes played starter minutes Music hes got the fans out of their seats on New Years Eve trying to ring in the new year with a victory on their home court Virginia Tech refusing to go away and now trailing by seven 5 45 and rolling in our second half of play Justin mutts working on a double double angling to the rim Motts determination in the layup great answer out of the timeout Applause thats now 16 points for mutts on the skip Prosser award last season in the ACC for the scholar athlete I think hes working on his PhD right now a couple of Masters for him Hildreth Second Chance out of bounds keep it at this end of the floor he already had his degree from Delaware for mutts also played a season at High Point transferred from Delaware into the Virginia Tech program Music hes got the last six points for Virginia Tech now on the defensive end trying to muscle his way put the shoulder down trying to attack mutts and pick up that foul but but lowering his shoulder I think that kept the whistle out of play medulla hoisting a three hell drift the clearance wants to slow it down now one of seven from behind the arc The Duel has not been able to find his rhythm offensively 14 points for Padula behind mutts set the leading scorer in the game for Virginia Tech three players in double digits led by Appleby for Wake with 18 Music side of the backboard gratuitous angle shot clock down to two recognition Applebee first Split Second nobody knew that that shot clock hadnt recycled massive threepointer a game high 21 points Tyree Appleby collision and foul Hildreth surprised but assessed yeah and right now Mike young is holding his breath on every whistle heres the look oh okay you mean I have to shoot it theres here right there one second on the shot clock Applause the efficiency I think its taking nine shots hes got 21 points early on got bailed out who made you know made a lot of his free throws four or five from behind the arc seven assists as well doulas at the line for Virginia Tech with 15 points after the free throw s Hildreth trying to stay with Padula yeah Id say that was a good call they never really established defending position 16 points for Padula tied with mutts for the team lead and now 15 of 19 as a team on the freethrow line for Virginia Tech still tight sixpoint game Music by his standard Appleby struggled against Duke just two of eight from the floor he did it from the free throw line 1314 scoring 18 points Applause that bounces near the end line and heres Padula three and a half minutes to go Mike in regulation and theyve got Collins playing Applebee and he did a nice job on that possession Applause three feet behind the line and it hit the end line Jamie lucky was right there was it Roger Ayers Roger Ayers is down there the minutes to work into this game but uh Tommy has done a really nice job uh points off turnovers and not a lot of times youre going to see Virginia Tech losing that battle but right now uh wake only six turnovers Virginia Tech with 13 12 points of the game off turnovers for Wake Forest in the second half Appleby with 13 points car with 11 most times you asked Mike young he feels like if he loses that battle it doesnt bode well for them maybe its just an illadvised pass that time so you can come alive itd be huge but theyve gotten switches and again Padula well hes hes at a go nogo point from right you know right now he can afford to be aggressive great take off the dribble against the taller Defender 18 points for Padula thats only one three Hildreth bounces off Marsh had it for Romo with pizzelli over the month what did we say at halftime Mike going right down to the wire double double now for much 1810 Steve Ford wanting a timeout Applause a little 60 run over the last 146 for Virginia Tech and its a twopoint game foreign both of these have been off the dribble you get the switch the bigger guy nice reversal and butts has been doing this for a good portion of the game and theres just theres no help behind you see everybody lifted out and once you get past that first line to move the sailing how about Virginia Tech shorthanded massive foul trouble and just not going away in this game two guys with four personals thats mutts and Padula its your top two players essentially and Poteet has three on Santo and Hildreth both have three personal fouls theres the Run and theyve made Seven of their last nine field goals Virginia Tech this half shooting 54 percent Applause 38 from the fourth awake in the game two minutes to go in regulation will be a little shove there from the defender MJ Collins and his third person you know for him he can you know they can use all five fouls hes still got a couple to give instructions seven of nine on free throws in the game for Appleby its a double bonus for Wake Forest going out free throw line was a big part of the win against Duke last Tuesday December 20th 22 of 26 as a team thats going to be you know Tom theyve left some points at the freethrow line in this game but that that statistic so its going to be big for Wake Forest going out throughout the season 16 of 22 from the line for wake in the game threepoint lead 145 to go vasili attempting to tie us Applause Music Williamson his damage outside of the arc in this game able to stay a little bit closer to him shot clock at seven Music a Big Show and a giveaway foul Applause I talked about it earlier in the game Tommy you get a big showing that hard just dribble right at him fourth on bazilly Music youre looking at the second best freethrow shooter in the league by percentage 88 of the season Tyree Appleby Music Applause five straight games and double figures hes up to 24 points in the game for Appleby and that leads everybody if youre looking much has been their best threepoint shooter in this game blocked by car on the Petula Drive better job of him staying in front able to get the block Applause Brazilian he hits a three wow nine points for basily exactly a minute to go in the second half that was that was a fabulous fabulous confident shot you really havent hit a basket all game long you put it behind you step out and hit one of the biggest shots of the game so far for your team especially a direct pass like that a little confusion there was a lot of movement with the Virginia Tech people off there and he just got a clean look first three of the game Mike yeah bazilly his 28th of the season and that leads the team in made threes he now has 90 made threes for his career and that was a monster three from Grant basily foreign from Pewaukee Wisconsin transfer from Wright State I think again we talk about the value of the portal and you know you have a freshman maybe he doesnt make that shot but you got a guy like missouli who has been there before and can put a poor shooting afternoon behind him in the last minute of the game so on the other end Steve Forbes in the middle of that Wake Forest huddle lead down to two with exactly a minute to play and wake has not made a field goal Mike a little less than three minutes at the 418 Mark I still think youd try to get some stuff going to the rim High pick and rolls get into the lane youve got guys with a lot of foul trouble youve had success scoring inside you dont need a threepoint shot right now I think if you if you take a quick three you really bail weight of your Virginia Tech out 11 of 26 for Wake On threepointers thank you yes under most circumstances are going to be Mr Appleby time and this is a big defensive possession for Collins Applause Music Applause staring contest Collins and Appleby Applause Williamson adjusting to that pass to keep it alive Pilger shot clocks at four steps back long rebound that was very very fortunate okay so Jamie lucky is walking over to the scores too probably has something to do with the shot clock Applause right now just over 25 seconds to go but you know what is that that position the the uh the defense was good that really the offense was going nowhere and youve got to come up with this ball somehow and you can see the shot clock went off Music shouldnt have because the reset would be to 20 which is on there now this is big though they got to figure this out Mike yeah got the you know you got that off shot and you know what and Credit Credit Marsh hes in there hes not able to get control of the ball but able to bounce it back out shockbach certainly went off in that replay yeah so they yeah so instead of you take four seconds off of both to get down to 16 seconds on the shot clock means that you still you know all you have to do you dont have to follow in this situation you can play straight up you got nine second differential how about this Mike wake hasnt won at home against Virginia Tech since January of 2015 and the final on that one was 7370 I was a young man then we were all much younger Applebee theyve waited a long time to get in there theres like 10 seconds you gotta go Applause clock running down to five for Appleby its all Appleby bounces off tapped around pulled in Monsanto now you got a five its just two two misses that you you couldnt
