where that Syracuse defense is most vulnerable hes got to make the proper reads for the entire 40 minutes and he has to be productive scoring the basketball officials tonight Ron gruver Ted Valentine and Jamie lucky Syracuse in the road Orange Florida state in the home whites Jesse Edwards and cam Corin to jump Center sparse crowd tonight in Tallahassee Syracuse controls the opening tip and the early basket good through the contact Malik Brown on the fast break right off the opening tip and he is a little slow to get up tell you thats how you start a game in terms of execution didnt go the way they had wanted to Florida State wanted to tip so easily just a good read from Brown came down kind of rough but tough guy gonna stick it out no foul on the play Jim Boeheim leading his case with Jamie lucky an early issue and a fair one for Florida State no Jalen Worley and the starting lineup disciplinary issues internal were told so Chandler Jackson who fires that jumper makes his first start of his career The Freshman from Memphis rest of the lineup for Florida State we told you about Cleveland Darren Green has one to watch his shooting against the Zone could be problematic for the orange hes one of the best threepoint Shooters in the ACC hovering around 40 percent hes going to get his looks you cant just take the first one though thats always how youre baited against the Syracuse Zone work be disciplined to get great ones each time down Applause Joe Gerard is Syracuses leading scorer Jude immense The Freshman point guard leading the team in steals leading the conference and steals and Malik Brown has scored the first basket back in the starting lineup he started the last three Cleveland rebounds the Miss here is green his first look on its way no good Cleveland to follow and the rebound by Chris Bell the orange have not had much rebounding from the small forward position as green picks up the foul near midcourt now youll take the threepoint shot thats in transition defense hadnt settled proper offering from Green but what is unacceptable is the foul in the backcourt get back defend live for the next play foreign Judah Mintz really shined down the stretch against BC on Saturday after getting benched for a spell in that game misfires Jackson snares the rebound mints as good as anybody in the college game drawing the foul to make him settle for the midrange if its contested its a win turns it over Corin has started to come along for Florida State hes been their leading scorer the last two times out but an early turnover for the Freshman didnt think theyd have corn in his position but it speaks to the unexpected season that the Knowles have had to this point he would have been their third option at the five if everybody was healthy injuries have taken a toll both of these teams play a lot of freshmen both very young mens throws it inside Edwards with a mismatch on Mills and thats too easy I love the offensive approach from the orange early Edwards red hot coming off that PC game Lets establish him have him with an aggressive approach early on by getting him those touches Syracuse if its patents a 23 Zone Cleveland thought about it Jackson picked up the dribble now Gerard with a good look lines it up and knocks it down he had come into this game in a nine for 33 shooting slump three of his last 14 from downtown and a 70 run by the orange to start look if Im FSU the minute in warmups that Joe Gerard stepped onto the floor I have awareness of what hes doing and where hes at miscommunication allowed an easy threepoint look down low too easy for Cleveland Florida States leading scorer he had 15 and 10 over the weekend against Louisville his eighth DoubleDouble in conference play Applause mens thought about it Cleveland backs off catch and shoot Bell rebound comes back to Malik Brown new 20 for the orange about the activity from Edwards bench down low Edwards lost it working against core and off the window too strong and coren turns it over it goes back to Syracuse coach bayheims okay with everything hes seeing from his big be aggressive be selfish down low corn is a freshman hes not used to defending a guy with that size and right now that confidence at the big possession position that Edwards possesses and quickly we see Leonard Hamilton address the lack of size on the floor for Florida State he brings in the six foot eleven Baba Miller he brings in the seven foot four nahim McLeod this is one of the biggest stories of the game can Edwards have production and success against a massive front line as Bell knocks down the open 18footer theres options for this Qs offense though Applause Jalen Worley did not start hes coming off one of his best games as a seminal in there now a point guard for Florida State hes really started to come along as this season has progressed the cloud left it short rebound to track down by Cleveland Syracuse gives up a lot of offensive rebounds now its green theres another offensive rebound Cleveland down low pulls it back out Clevelands ability to rebound from the wing they have to exploit that for Second Chance Cleveland from the outside did not hit the rim but there is McLeod so early on the influx subsides into the lineup paying off for Leonard Hamilton and as you watch Syracuse basketball season long look theres a few things you can point to but they will always need to rebound they will always need to take care of the basketball especially with this version of the orange this season four offensive rebounds for Florida State Gerard sapling amongst the Sequoias and he gets it to Edwards who cant finish Edwards is rushing it he has the size advantage over Cleveland can pose he cant get you with that release Point finish more confident McLeod off the pit ball Applause Jalen Worley a six six point guard shadowing Judah Mintz now Drives By McLeod all the way and missed the dunk Cleveland nearly lost it kicks to the corner Morley rushed the shot left it short and the rebound to Malik Brown but heres the deal Anish now you got to get 10 minute pick and rolls into rotations because itll be Advantage Syracuse with their guard play get McLeod and PNR and take advantage like they did just couldnt finish the dunk Gerard the lob and its too high for Malik Brown Syracuse got off to the early 70 start Florida State respond to a thousand games twice made some news over the last few days when Pete thamold published an article on espncom in the article bayheim accused Wake Forest Pittsburgh and Miami of buying their teams he also said he would call his own shot on when he would retire hes 78 years old and then on Monday he had to walk back both of those comments with two apologies yeah I mean to me what jumps out on the page with the quotes from coach with Pete them was just he speaks for a lot of coaches in terms of how alarming this space is currently within IL and the lack of structure around it that being said Coach and hes acknowledged this was absolutely wrong to mention programs by name and reputable coaches doing reputable things with their program by the way within the confines of the rules coach cleaned that up so to me Im only walking away from this Smith coach behind speaks for a large faction of coaches that are fresh with whats going on and beyond that I do think it was regrettable for him to say what we all know that its his job and he has the ability to walk away when he wants well duh hes an icon everyone knows that but you dont need to Splash that in everybodys face youre talking about a legend and Coach Bayonne hes earned that right but I didnt like how it was executed Im glad that he walked some of that back that was important as speaking to several coaches over the last few days all of them had a similar sentiment there is truth in what he said no question the delivery and how it said and again we live in the world of decorum and there are certain things where you will ruffle feathers and you have to deal with the aftermath as Jim behind did and now look in East theres frustrations for different reasons from coaches some of the frustration I dont have time for it I dont want to hear because I disagree with it other frustrations which came from coach bayheim and others who I also greatly respect Im aligned with their frustration there needs to be a middle ground there needs to be more structure around this rather than just saying hey the toothpaste is out of the tube and just figure it out thats not the right approach there has to be a better way and Coach Boeheim was speaking to that in frustration in regrettable form and Im glad he walks back the stuff he needed to and what irk some is that Syracuse has a big money donor who is using nil to lure recruits and again we bring that up as a traveling violation is called out Florida 8th we bring that up none of that stuff is under the table anymore that is all out in the open a lot of schools not just in the ACC but across the country are doing it so again its saying the quiet part out loud but one thing and this is my last on this I mean get back to basketball coach Mike Price said this earlier this season we can only complain so much these are the rules we as coaches live cush lives so lets figure out how to navigate this thing forget complaints how about Solutions and if you dont want to be a part of this even a legend like coach Bay Hut hes done enough great he can choose to walk away from this or continue to try to win in this and thats the reality of a Miller rebounds the Miss after the Benny Williams done Mills missed the layup it comes back and its taken by Syracuse Benny Williams the sophomore its simple for him if he rebounds hell play his minutes reflect that Edwards down low twisting and McLeod the rebound Edwards Hes just rushing it compose yourself youre 611 time is on your side just one out of five Mills left that one short Mills bodies up Gerard Gerard leaning in nice Up and Under and Syracuse extending to a seven point lead green catch and shoot it doesnt go another offensive rebound thats seven now for Florida State cloud back to warley and the three is good and Jalen Worley had a big game over the weekend 14 points on six of seven shooting to come into his own for Florida State as a sophomore Vince has the mismatch now with McLeod injury pass off the hands of Edwards whos off to a rough start after a career game kind of go a little bit higher for that one to avoid the turnover otherwise you have an easy bucket but Syracuse doing whats necessary on a road runnerup North Carolina Tar Heels this is a group that is in disarray right now they have the Personnel but it seems like the locker room is a little disjointed given the postgame comments from Armando baycott those were great young men in that locker room Ive gotten to know that program decently well its put up for shut off time for the heels right now and how they look this weekend is going to matter if they cut essentially said that after the game hey we want the guys that want to be here North Carolina blown out by Wake Forest last night Caleb Mills lines it up Florida State now just one for 10 from three and a foul as Bell was fighting for the rebound and that is two on Jalen Worley Bell finally taking it upon himself to go get that defensive rebound trying to outlet to Gerard and spur something in the open floor keep in mind Gerard got one of those open look threes with a breakdown of communication in the open floor I think they need to try to run a little bit more but it starts with rebound full court pressure now from Florida State Chandler Jackson back in there for war League Jackson got the start today Applause Applause Gerard picked up the dribble Bell Falling Away and the rebound comes to Green UCF transfer known for his shooting prowess try to get somebody to the ACC logo at that mid post thats where you collapse the defense Cleveland needs to be that guy flashing and that one doesnt go Florida State now one for 11 from three and more than half their shots have come from Beyond the threepoint line thats exactly what Syracuse wants take the first one you see Bells three doesnt go rebound porn Applause sets up too strong mens on the drive out of control and bailed out with the foul Mintz does that as good as anybody in the conference hes not going to fall in love with the threepoint shot hes going to push the envelope put the onus on the official to Blow That Whistle because hes gonna initiate contact through two Defenders stays right at Jackson thats a score wired to get to the line and get free ones Applause Vince a freshman out of Oak Hill Academy which has been quite the pipeline over the years for Syracuse Carmelo Anthony went there Eric dievendorf who is doing color tonight on the Syracuse radio broadcast with the sublime line my man thats what Im talking about it get his bar because my hair is struggle right Stephen dorf and no kill product and not often you see demonsor sitting down at the scorers table Id like to see mayonnaise Shroff with a line would you get a lineup would you do that I mean you got great hair youre about 11 years too late oh you went with the low boy picture evidence foul its on Syracuse and mints his first only the first team foul halfway through this first half as I as Im watching 10 minutes into this game Matthew Cleveland needs to be a little bit more aggressive demanding the basketball at that mid post and being a decision maker you want your best playmaker to get to that mid post and now you see Cleveland Manning it a little bit dont be scared to linger Jackson in that mid post back out to green and hes still without a threepoint shot and a foul underneath Corin did a great job carving out offensive rebounding space good anticipation with the shot going up from Jackson to carve out something give them yet another chance here in a possession and the threes not falling for Florida staple the offensive rebounds have kept them with him Striking Distance Florida State second seven more shots than Syracuse make it eight foreign ER goes for Darren Green 41 for three on the season 14 games in his career where hes hit at least five threes mens strong to the bucket and a foul on the floor youre going to see Darren Green step into this three and a 40 shooter from Beyond The Arc when hes able to get the feet set and step into it like that hes gonna feel good hes got the shoulders squared it was a late contest its Advantage Knowles Music Justin Taylor five at Orange the freshman in for Syracuse he can shoot it Edwards against Corinth Edwards spinning down low follows his Miss and gets the basket you brought up the point earlier he was rushing what did you see there he was rushed again but at least the aggression came to the Forefront for the putback his feet are too quick hes just hes very fidgety needs to slow down Benny Williams with his hand to the passing Lane Taylor using the screen thought about the three knocked down three on Saturday going back the other way look before we see it I think there might have been a travel from Edwards on this movie it was so sped up yeah I mean it was a travel for one because he was that sped up but I love the big fella sticking with the play to hurt himself too Florida State brings in Tom house looking for some more shooting so how should green both out there along with Corin Cleveland and the Freshman Chandler Jackson of late has seen his minutes increase this time at the beginning of the season eight weeks in preseason with a broken thumb it cost him the first three games of the regular season Applause Jackson down the lane over Edwards and able to draw the foul and he sets a good offensive possession because the basketball moves which makes the Zone vulnerable which provides a gap to explore and thats exactly what you got from Jackson there to draw the foul Applause foreign Applause Torrance down low to Edwards Hes got the size advantage on green waits for the double kicks it out Benny Williams back iron you gotta win that match youve got a distinct title man you got to win it as McLeod wins the matchup on the other end seven foot four against nobody big as you jogged back after you after you dont make a score and play in a oneonone matchup you casually jogs back and you let a guy almost headed to the ceiling beat you down the floor Gerard tried to draw the contact could not wanted the foul and Florida State with a chance to take the lead and house stepped out of bounds Music you run the floor big fella will be rewarded name McLeod catch dunk Finish watch out Edwards business for Florida State football and basketball still the voice of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers post the picture on IG a legend in Tallahassee hes taking selfies with fans its not real if its not on the timeline James handed the reins over to Jeff killane this is a terrific job at Florida State and news out of Tallahassee today they locked up Mike morvell to a longterm extension a deal that takes Norvell through 2029 after really a much anticipated much awaited bounce back season for Florida State football look norvelle breaded through 2029 as he should be that man secured the bag in year three built this thing up built the culture a winning program uh one that look you may say nil but I say the culture he built make guys like Jared verse George Travis want to return this group will be season top five down here in Tallahassee I cant wait to bring our huddle crew down here and cover some cocoa down low end low and Loud has been the best player on the floor in this first half heres Cleveland off the skip at Florida State leads For the First Time The Freshman Jackson in his first career starts swings that thing cross court allows Cleveland to get all his ducks in a row square up and back it down four assists for Chandler Jackson Applause Here Comes mince the long arms of Bobble Miller forced him to give it up now Taylor straight away three knocked out of bounds by Edwards Saul starts this action getting Cleveland a threepoint look from the swing pass look at Jackson crosscourt even at protection with the screener so there was no chance that wasnt going to be pristine view of the rim thats all it took for Cleveland to get something going and get a rhythm Cleveland 56 rebounds more than halfway to his 12th career DoubleDouble The Freshman from Mallorca who oozes talents missed the first 16 games of the Season due to a suspension for proper travel benefits on NCAA hoopla really over very little Cleveland turnaround and the rebound by Bell but thats what Florida State wants you got your best player about eight feet from the hoop getting a good look that needs to be the approach moving forward Cleveland has to hunt his and be aggressive its been a quiet start for Mintz now Gerard is picked up by house tend to shoot Gerard drives kicks Bell for three the rebounds on Miller who lost it but punched out by Malik Brown its good defensive possession make Gerard a driver can test on a jump shot locate a block out good sequence on both ends for Florida State 30 second timeout will step aside it hasnt been the prettiest first half but its close on the other side McLeod has been active active swing pass and Cleveland rocks Im from Cincinnati I actually have to retract that statement I cant even say that confidently makes me feel a sort of way you felt really inauthentic yeah you didnt like it its corny and it Atkins Cleveland lobs it up McLeod nearly lost it and now its taken away by Mitch the leader in steals in the ACC the lob up top missed connection and it belongs to Florida State I mean zero respect for Tom house as a Defender just believe that Bell is just gonna annihilate him house is like ah not not today not on my watch some house I respect it like no thats gonna dunk on me a gamehigh 10 points to go along with four rebounds for the sophomore from Philly and this is the McLeod theyve wanted to get now look the system for Florida state is typically in an ideal season with Coach amp 10 guys minutes here and there McLeod has had to play extended ones that hasnt been able to hes earning that back though here tonight Florida state has not been able to space out its rotations and its minutes like it usually does tend to shoot Gerard Allens the dribble against Jackson kicks to the corner two on the shot clock and a shot clock violation Hema had no idea how much time was left no one all Five Guys on the floor for the orange had zero idea inexcusable meanwhile on the other side to eat McLeod how about Cleveland giving him the look Im just going to be 74 Im gonna loiter around the rim and God Im Im gonna allow good things to happen and thats what youre seeing for McLeod Applause Miller over to Cleveland in the mid coast and that is the soft spot in the Zone look how confident and Cleveland is its an awkward position to catch right there and make complaints but Cleveland has that ability Edwards alone on the Baseline passed on the shot now mince amongst the trees swatted who else nahim McLeod the clouds out there just being seven foot four not forcing the issue Cleveland in midair kicks it out to Jackson back to McLeod I get McLeod in the dunker spot get Cleveland back up to the mid post there you go theres Cleveland again down low the cloud and the Thunder its an easy game Im no basketball Buddha its an easy game you flash Cleveland to the mid post left McLeod dunk it hes clear cant write it up high five she gave him life but his father is seven foot five he gave him the size and hes utilized it all game long but magic Cleveland at the mid post inserting him at the dunkers spot hes been running the floor hes basically simplified the game to say look Im taller than everybody Im gonna hang around the rim good things will happen both offensively and defensively and they have now this is a team thats been beat up in the front Court this season so they brought in Jalen Gainey a twotime defensive player of the year for brown in the ivy league hes out for the season with a torn ACL Camp Fletcher one of their top rebounders a Kentucky transfer they expected big things hes out for the season its pressed cam corn into a bigger role for Bob Millard and play early in the year and oh now McLeod whos lost some minutes of late to Corin getting an opportunity and making the most of it tonight as Gerard ends to Syracuse drought with a triple I mean again youre not a little hung up on Mom five five damn seven five thats kind of wild right but hes still not the tallest one in his family Music tonight its the same formula get the ball at Mid post theyre ball watching and you just go upstairs where only McLeod can get that basketball Syracuse tries it Miller gets the block on Edwards so if they do that again bring it to the mid post and Rob to McLeod whats the Syracuse counter theyve got to get theyve got to get Macomb pushed off hes getting too close hes positioning himself its essentially post position hes getting ready theres the lob that one hits the bat forward it comes to Bell but nobodys locating the cloud you got to get an arm bar a body on him push him off that Baseline dont allow him to inch towards the rim Gerard bodies up his Defender offensive rebound Edwards Gerard for three good Joe Gerard with 11 points to lead Syracuse and a stop play to check on Chandler Jackson Applause Music thank you Applause now with the lineup shifting if Im Jesse Edwards Im looking at a position like okay McLeods out of this game I need to be a guy that reestablished myself Millers out as well a lot of size lost Florida state with this lineup Syracuse would have was at its best offensively when Florida state had the small lineup Ben Jackson down row Corin the tip in waved off ensive interference strike call ball was still on the cylinder but you dont mind Cleveland being aggressive yeah but one challenge for Florida state is going to be a guy like McLeod only plays about 1314 minutes a game how much can you get out of him tonight thats why you sub him at that two minute Mark you let him ride that into the into halftime you get that rest you probably set him to start the second half then hes reenergized Gerard to the rim and Joe Gerard came into this game in a shooting slump not tonight five of seven 13 points the rest of the team hasnt done much lets plagued this group a little bit I mean youve never had mints and Gerard really on that same page and also getting it from men worms I mean those three stars rarely align this season green hits the three Applause is checking to Triple hes got six Applause Torrance the lob for Edwards snatches it out of the air and this time uses his size over green yeah without any Miller or McLeod around a little easier thats an easy catch and finish theres no challenge theres no link whereas the last catch down there three guys blocked a stop Florida state has hit its last three from Deep after starting one of 13 it goes four threes in a row for the Seminoles and their lead is six Applause lets try to go back down low to Edwards theres the lob Edward for size Advantage kicks it out Bells three not fair rebound Cleveland thats seven boards for Cleveland Gerard playing defensive back lost it out of bounds thats a purple read from Edwards he fielded a double team he kicked it out to a guy who shoots about 38 from three and bell with the clean look draw a double kick it out thats what you want to see shot clock is is off youre gonna use up everything here and Id love to see Cleveland with the ball again at that this post just under 10 seconds for a second chance opportunity because theyve been dominant with them plus nine in the rebound margin are the most and thats been the difference Syracuse commits the foul they had fouls to give Syracuse still has one more foul to give first one on Torrance so Mills will inbound Cleveland Corin Bell or rather green and Jackson on the floor here comes Jackson and there is the other foul given by Torrance 47 seconds to go in the half now youll just play into the corner green the shot fake fires and it rolls out and thats how the first half ends really impressive move from Caleb Mills to no look that thing to get the shot from the Baseline but look Florida State won that first half with size Second Chance McCloud Cleveland at the mid post did everything they needed to to establish a cushion here in the first half Florida State NBA Scouts in the building and Judah Mintz is without question one of those guys theyre looking at because of how hes burst on the scene in this one season hes over three hes got to be a little bit more aggressive hunting his to elevate this perimeter for Syracuse Chandler Jackson comes out to begin the second half he made his first start of the Season today Cleveland in the high post and Edwards snares the rebound his sixth Jesse Edwards had a careerhigh 27th Saturday against BC just three of ten from the field in that first half Edwards from post up against Corin now Mitch controls Jackson tipped the pass 10 to shoot Edwards trying to fight through a double team hasnt stolen away Cleveland ahead of the pack missed the layup rebound Edwards that Florida state gets back good job of bell wearing 52 because his jersey got ripped so hes not wearing a standard zero jersey but getting back defensively huge offensive rebound Edwards and the putback is there Music green thought about the three now its corn face up Baseline no and the rebound taken away by Malik Brown The Freshman whos played Major minutes the last two games since Benny Williams went to the bench Brown has moved into the starting lineup Here Comes Mitch down the lane against Cleveland no Applause Jackson back shot deposit slip concave with Jordan shrug not quite as dramatic but like hey its three Ill take it his seventh three of the season Music Applause s done a nice job defensively on hits Gerard from long range Applause look Jacksons getting his first start as a freshman Taylor Jacksons Gonna Make It Count it theyre not going to respect him from three maybe proving why they should respect number three but it counts tank is open and he heard the highway call Here Comes Jackson all the way it comes to Gerard Syracuse has had very little in transition Gerard working on green and it rolls in thats where Jacksons got it develop the float team when you got 611 waiting for you playoff two floated over the extended defense thats where your offensive game can evolve corn in the high post kicks it back out Cleveland strong drive on Edwards thats what Matthew Cleveland can do nine points eight rebounds now for the sophomore I mentioned those NBA Scouts that are here inevitably theyre watching Matthew Cleveland meet long and on a baseline attack in the closeout he absolutely showed his link to finish Jackson hes got a big size advantages again did a nice job denying mids but Edwards able to draw the foul its against Cora I love this from Cleveland its six foot six prototypical wing attack a closeout play into the contact but how he was able to contort control his body but look at the eyes all the way through the Finish through some contact thats how Elite finishers are able to complete sequences keeping their eye on a goal thank you what hes really added to his game this season has been the outside shot he was not much of a shooter last year we knew he could slash hes improved on that aspect and Leonard Hamilton said hes also developing as a leader which is a much needed ingredient for a very young team and you needed that leadership with all the obstacles this group has faced this year look the season looks entirely different if they dont have the bad luck with Personnel they didnt start the season but Cleveland shoot 38 from three and that matters is a Next Level guy hes one of top recruits of Florida State history starting to look the part here top 30 recruit out of the state of Georgia at the fsus leading scorer and ACC play and overall Worley back in there Benny Williams into the game for Syracuse Orange in that zone theres Cleveland in that high post again and so many options open up when you can get the ball there and Cleveland is masterful in that slot at the midpost where the defense is most vulnerable catches faces sees hes open composes offers the floater high percentage opportunity a cloud in there for Florida State catch it flip it and reverse it Jesse Edwards thats exactly what Edwards did right there Ill tell you what over in central New York at a little uh pub called fagans Wednesday is foot night there you go Mills launches what is it at Tallahassee whats Wednesday night in Tallahassee my wife listick says its your hotel room youre absolutely right youre absolutely right please stop for dinner and then the hotel room I think I gotta eat this body is no accident heres green catch and release battle for the rebound down low its blocked Syracuse looking to push Gerard bounce pass Mitch strong missed the dunk Bell to follow the basket is good and the foul met so for two on the dunks at this point maybe just lay some of these end minutes to complete the play but I love Bell not giving up on the play and that matters here nice pass from Gerard cant finish but everybody else ball watching not Bell whos able to finish Chris Bell a terrific shooter thats his reputation coming out of high school they didnt really need him to rebound much in high school Jim Boeheim wants him to rebound more hes been a little better at that today yeah these are things that are part of the growth from high school to college you have to understand the level of athlete physicality changes you cant just Meander in to grab rebounds everybodys High gets up like that got a box out you got to be physical its a job to reboot green off the nice feed from Caleb Mills for the last couple of times out has really done a nice job of facilitating 11 assists just one turnover in his previous two games near turnover Bell able to save it wearing the number 52 after his jersey ripped thats a nice movein shot against Worley and mcclouds got to double down there I mean you dont need to hug outside Edwards can make a three sure thats a lesser percentage shot as now you see huge implies suppression Applause Florida State breaks the Press Here Comes Mills accelerates looking to drop it off that will be a turnover you know when you got the nice ride and Florida States lead six at halftime down to two and he Shroff Jordan cornette with you on a Wednesday night and the capital city Tallahassee Batman is in the house Florida State comes out with its tall lineup seven foot four nahim McLeod 611 freshman from Mallorca Baba Miller Worley in there is a 66 point guard along with Cleveland and the shooter Darren Green Gerard Torrance Edwards Williams and Bell the five Virginia bayheim Applause Gerard likes this seven foot four McLeod on him a miscommunication and that allows him to bang down the three you can tell warley Worley wanted to get back there to relieve McLeod and in that exchange provided the threepoint look and Syracuse with the lead for the first time in the second half Gerards got five threes green drops it off for Cleveland beautiful passing down low from Florida State Applause Danny Williams thought about it Edwards lost it its too much length theres no window there for Torrance to deliver you gotta Retreat Dremel move the basketball no opportunity presentable heres Cleveland kicks to Green hell launch and connect its the third three for green hes up to 11 Florida States lead back to four Torrance lost it into the long hands of Miller Worley right around Bell and the foul is called its going to be on Bell thank you heres green again Edwards snatches the board Applause Florida state gets it back green shot fake open in and out Edwards had it lost it that opportunity it doesnt get any better for Florida State your best threepoint shooter off a turnover a nice Baseline look but Edwards couldnt Corral the rebound you get a second chance opportunity here once again FSU cant get bored with Cleveland at the mid post too much success has been garnered there gotta continue to pursue 35 at the logo hello we have a timeout well take one two fourpoint game in Tallahassee 1319 to go second half second part of the second half you got a couple of young teams and both at times this season have struggled to close out games whats critical down the spread thats why these are two teams that are the only chance to continue NCAA tournament is auto bids they dont know how to win they havent figured out how to consistently do that whether it be untimely turnovers from Syracuse failure to grab a rebound defensive let down shot selection and the same with Florida State mainly for Florida State defensive letdowns for that group that theme is carried the season for them so as you look at it here whos going to execute here in these final 13 minutes for two teams that have failed to do that consistently Florida state turns it over off the inbounds roll and that is his first field goal just four points on one of six shooting over the weekend we shot Florida state had a 17point lead against Louisville Cardinals came all the way back nearly won the game before Florida State prevailed Syracuse was able to pull away down the stretch against BC Cleveland again in that high post now Mills off the shot fake back to Cleveland working on Bell and a Nifty under move by Matthew Cleveland Cleveland getting the touch initially starts to move the basketball then provides a driving lane for Mills to dump back to Cleveland against the lob to Edwards to strong Williams on the follow its the right call its the right call from Jamie lucky that ball was right in the cylinder when there was a shot or a pass the ball was where it was and again that was a missed Opportunity by Syracuse you had a cloud up top Edwards was free a good pass and thats an easy and it doesnt matter the attention of it was clearly supposed to be a bass that pass turned into more of a shot in the cylinder and it was deterred by Edwards right whistle from Jamie its the reverse Lorenzo Charles yes a little bit more at stake in that in that game too slightly just a little bit Cloud was calling for it down low the shot goes up here comes Gerard its a bad decision clear after thoughts were built Gerard misses the runner numbers for Florida State Mills ahead of a pack driving on Edwards through the contact McLeod had to go off his hands out of bounds and it looks like it will stay with Florida State last touch Syracuse median timeout with 12 minutes to go in regulation Anthony they played Jordan cornetts Fighting Irish twice beat you guys both times correct thank you for that memory we also shared that memory with GMAC earlier today one of the great young coaches in this game although were not so young anymore uh yeah Carmelo Anthony still gives me nightmares hes a top 10 scorer in NBA history like do I need to feel bad about that its not like theyre going to put a graphic up with you trying to defend him or please dont do a stack comparison you can put up a picture just those that compares please mince kicks it ahead to Bell fires the three offensive rebound Gerard that one swatted back Edwards calling for it Gerard instead dribbles it out Edwards hes had his hands ready on a first catch Gerard through traffic Applause a whistle is blown so you mentioned you went up against Carmelo in two thousand youre not great youre not really gonna do anything here were supposed to be friends we are friends and again part of the job description is you go down Rabbit Hole so I I dug up some old box scores do you remember how you did uh not well I never played well against Syracuse do you want to know the exactly yeah why not two games 20 total minutes zero points yeah man I knew it wasnt good I wasnt gonna bring it up and you asked dude found me out I think hes one of them one of the games you played four minutes so was that a foul Trouble game that was actually sophomore year that started what would become an extended role for me thank you very much for next two and a half years time for this to become a therapist I had no business being on the floor against there and you were reminiscing as you said with Jerry McNamara in a game at the Carrier Dome in 03 and Notre Dames late and McNamara got a three from the corner to win it for Syracuse Applause Mills up ahead to Green back to green and the three is good four triples now for green he is going to shoot he is fearless very much like McNamara who we were talking about a moment ago the other way mints through the contact and this is as important as any theme in this game dude immense now is hunting getting into the painted area and drawing contact hes also chasing early offense in the open floor Florida State better get back and protect the goal because Mintz is now applying pressure Full Throttle and apparently Anish he scored more points than me in the two contests for Syracuse in that one play Tallahassee Judith mince at the line we saw this for mint Saturday against Boston College that didnt play his best ball early on he got an ingame benching from Jim Boeheim came off the bench then played real well down the stretch Kaiser competitor he loves the game works his tail off mentally tough and that could be a differentiator in the game nowadays thats something to watch Bob Miller and McLeod on the bench so Florida state with its small lineup on the floor smallest relative for this program warley air ball I mean that looked wrong from the from the catch but Worley was committed to what it ended up being oxygen Applause Laura Lee came into the game just six of 213 so Syracuse can tie it with a two can take the lead with a three we come up on the midpoint of this second half bends over to Gerard hes been the high man for the orange tonight Applause Music Bell Applause offensive rebound Edwards back out to Bell for the lead Syracuse up by one time effort from Edwards off the switch had offensive rebounding advantage against the opposition who was forced to block out rebounds so I didnt have a put back kicks out for three and thats the best threepoint opportunity presented after a missing an offensive rebound 10 points for Bell who only had one field goal in his previous three Jackson looking for the answer and a foul against Syracuse its going to be on Edwards only Edwards second so you can keep him on the floor continue to play this is again a lineup of Florida State where you look at Edwards and say you have to be a Difference Maker you have to have plays like that the offensive rebound kick out you have to be the force given the off given the oppositions line up currently being smallish and you wonder if Leonard Hamilton is biting his time Jackson gets the teardrop until he inserts Miller and McLeod back in great Point thats absolutely Whats Happening Here now mints dauntless and one here he comes so quick hes unrelenting getting there look a little hesitation dribble got Jackson on his hip Advantage bits and he just kept on proceeding towards the goal gives him a look too real stars know how to locate the camera as well hat tip to you Judah thats a pro move Mintz has hit three straight from the field after starting oh for five eight of his 10 have come in the second half lets see if they go back to the high post they do Mills to McLeod who checked back in tonight at The Rim a heck of an effort from Edwards and itll be Syracuse ball I think it went off McCloud as he came down Edwards kept vertical at The Rim good way to recover back a little bit of both and yeah it came off the left hand of McLeod as he went down Applause Gerard over Mills and Syracuse extending to a fourpoint lead the perimeter Stars elevating their game down the stretch youre going to need Gerard youre going to need mens and theyve appeared when theyve been most needed 22 for Gerard Cleveland gets it back from Jackson plenty of time to shoot Jackson for three back iron Tapped Out comes to Gerard up ahead to Mintz hes got a trailer and Bell midst the runner off the window and a dozen for the Freshman Judah mint that is impressive for mens he thought he was going to lob that to Bell so he didnt have it kisses it off the glass shoot a Miss is starting to announce himself come winning time to get the open floor but right here Judah with the floater Judah Im at the top of my game look I got to be very clear shes one of the best players in the ACC hes only a freshman but that ability is undeniable as you watch what hes able to do how he contorts controls his body great touch and an open floor Fearless why is he Fearless a niche because that front line from Florida State when that lineup big lineup goes to the bench IE McCloud that changes everything Miller as well when those guys arent there as Rim protectors guy likes you to mince feels like okay I can chase my Big Fellas back seven foot four McLeod is back in the game so hes hoping to change some of that Terminal Drive activity but cloud has played 18 Minutes tonight his ACC high is 22 that came back on the 7th of January against a Georgia Tech green hes at 43s tonight Music fell all over a shot clock running down Cleveland falling down over to Green beating the shot clock and the rebound to Edwards mens pushing Vince driving on Jackson to the left hand and a block called on Florida State another chance at a threepoint play Judah Mintz taking over this game I dont know whos more enjoyable to watch in a conference than him in the open floor turquoivion Smith is the only one I got off the top yeah thatd be a nice challenge thank you turquavion on line one but this is mince at his best look turquoigon scores from all three levels Jude is an inside the arc scorer and in the open floor is what his eyes get big warley getting ready to check in for Florida State and Mills fouled on the drive it looks like theyll get Benny Williams Applause Music sir quavion Smith comparison turkuevion is likely to also pull up from NBA range I mean thats in his bag thats why hes a first round Talent you know Jude is going to one place its the rim and yet still he aint stopping thats the difference this is Syracuses largest Elite of the game Florida State led by six at the half Cleveland less than 10 to shoot Zone Contracting Worley his pass picked by Williams his passing lanes are never available not with the length of Syracuse Gerard down the lane and able to draw the foul Florida State failed themselves that last possession by not flashing mid post theyre empty possessions when theres no receiver at that midpost area right around the ACC logo in the painted area thats number three on Jalen Worley Joe Gerard and 85 free throw shooter misses the first hes been a lightning rod for this fan base but there have been games this season where he has carried this team no question all right heres the focal point offensively him and obviously Judah Mintz again this group is just such a tough out when those two are playing at a high level together that just hasnt been a consistent thing Syracuse in the midst of a 162 run wheres the answer for Florida State Zone packing in shot clock again down to 10 Cleveland snow dribble Drive no real movement too easy to defend Alex Mills foul on the floor and bells bailed him out over zealous defensively it had a Florida State team and rights only the fourth team foul shot clock resets to 20 and Worleys got to get it in he does another foul called against the orange Applause thats another one on Bell so that is four now on Chris Bell whos played well tonight 10 points five rebounds he will remain in the game Green from the outside Tracked Down by Benny Williams Applause screen and rolling out there Edwards setting the high screen for Gerard the kick its Bell the three air ball McLeod had it knocked away and orally able to retrieve Florida State looking to end a 100 Syracuse rod its team to two over the last four minutes and 40 seconds too congested Clevelands got to be the lone guy at that midbot been successful threefourths of this game theres Cleveland in the high post turns around its not there and again Florida State now working deep into the shot clock against this 23 Zone but thats the problem theyre waiting too long to distribute that ball up to that mid post area for Cleveland lets get into touch as the shot clocks winding down thats where the possession must start and Chandler Jackson getting ready to check in Benny Williams for the win Edwards tried to track it down it stays inbounds a cloud up to Worley transition opportunity Mills able to draw the foul for an offensive struck could operate in the half court you got to pursue runouts off misses anytime theyre semiavailable they need to try to speed up play a little bit faster because theyre stuck in third gear and a half court the Seminoles have missed their last five from the field theyve gone more than four minutes since scoring and Caleb Mills with a chance to end that second season and Tallahassee came over from Houston former American Conference preseason player of the year that was back in 2020 that was the year Houston ended up going to the final four but Mills transferred during that season Applause Applause our press by the Knowles thank you we come up on five minutes to play Syracuse at seven and six in the ACC Florida State a game under 500 at six and seven commence the drive the kick down to the corner offensive rebound Edwards but theyll get him with the foul and thats going to be three on Jesse Edwards now this is big because now Edwards with that push off is going to give Florida State to the line and now an offense that is completely out of rhythm has gone cold canals try to get some for the rest of this game from the free throw line that matters nahim McLeod nine of 23 at the stripe this season a one and one and he gets the first 15 points for nahim McLeod that matches a career high 14 of those came in the first half hes got seven rebounds to boot one out of two possession game less than five to play Applause mints looking for help now its Edwards lost it Gerard able to save it shot clock in single digits Mills hounding Gerard shot clock down to three mince 43 battle for the rebound out of bounds last touch Florida State itll stay with Syracuse they get a new 20 Anish Syracuse has to use whats been an advantage for Florida State and make it become a disadvantage what I mean is lets see seven foot four nahim McLeod defend in a pick and roll lets see him defend exchanges and lets see if theres Advantage both for Edwards as a dive guy or one of your scoring guards to make McLeods dance on the outside theyre not even pursuing that which quite frankly is mindboggling to me and heres one of them shot clock again running down Gerard no McLeod the rebound whats changed in this second half its Syracuses rebounding they were minus eight at the half plus 11 in the second half Clevelands pass knocked out of bounds Music median timeout well bring you the exciting conclusion 338 going into the tournament a year ago they earned the uh the AQ because they had a run and a path to go win a tournament Championship Virginia Tech did it as a seven seed Mills in the lane Edwards had the rebound lost it out of bounds last touch Florida State the other part of it Jordan with so many teams so close to each other in the ACC standings those tie breaks become important especially when you have a game like this this is the only regular season meeting between these two and keep in mind look Syracuse its been a forgettable year at this point I get it theyve been very close against some of the top teams in this conference and those close losses you never know March gets wacky but you gotta start by winning games like this one to build that Rhythm McLeod on the perimeter Syracuse tried to go inside Jackson has it here comes Cleveland look out you cant have live ball giveaways to allow runouts for Florida State you simply cant have it looks like theyve got a wet spot on the logo so theyll mop it off stop play Applause get yourself to eliminate anything easy for Florida State they werent a scoring drought at one point thats how Syracuse opened this thing up but now Florida State a can earn it from the freethrow line B is getting run outs and that activates the stagnant offense and now weve got a two possession game a timeout by Syracuse Cleveland to continues his Stellar play 17 points 11 rebounds his 11th doubledouble of the season nine of them have come in conference play hes now in double figures and scoring for an 18th straight game Jesse Edwards got off to a slow start hes put up a double double today Judah Mintz has been huge in the second half and while the shooting percentage doesnt bear it out Darren greens hit some big threes for Florida State yeah no question I also love the 11 rebounds from Matthew Cleveland thats a big deal going back to Syracuse though Judah Mintz wins with attacking if hes not going to get those open floor opportunities try and get McLeod in a ball screen scenario where it gets him out on the cloud that quick First Step you get mints going back in attack mode youve got to find a way to get mints back to going downhill there he comes downhill on the drive and finishes at The Rim just got to give him those opportunities thats the path to Syracuse winning here down the stretch of closing this one out Born Into The Tackle mens is 16 have come in the second half now he gets in the passing Lane hes the ACC leader in steals per game slow the tempo for the orange as we come up on two and a half to play Edward setting the screen now Brown Applause to miss Gerard for three offensive rebound Brown mints into the corner for Bell climbs it up too strong Chase for the rebound and we get a foul and lets see who they call it on it looks like they get Jackson so that is against Florida State and it stays with Syracuse with 205 to go now heres what I dont like mens look you love the vision to swing it to Bell Cross Court but sure Garrett your teammate to take a shot early in the shot clock but all you need to do is run clock and use that as your weapon I would have loved to see Mintz hold on to that ball not swing at the bell and it might Bell to take that bass line through a one and one for Jesse Edwards 60 free throw shooter gets the first Applause now both of these teams have had their issues at the end of games this season 205 to go stood plenty of time Applause three possession game and the clock begins as Jackson picks it up off the ground green high pass down low McLeod and hell go to the freethrow line thats a good foul if youre Syracuse McLeod way below 500 on the season as a free throw shooting yeah thats his fifth have to foul left with no choice but thatll be the end of his night hell is out Justin Taylor fellow freshmen will check in Bell had himself a good good evening tonight double figure score was active on the backboard made some timely plays defensively gave them the lift that he needed to six rebounds too thats what Jim Boeheim will look at he was a nonfactor on Saturday only 11 minutes against BC and now two huge free throws coming for McLeod and he missed the first we told you entering the game nine out of 23 and one for three tonight but look when you talk about that young core in Syracuse I know you want to live in the present but when you look ahead the next season a lot of the important pieces freshmen for the Syracuse team and you can say the same about Florida State the problem is in college basketball in this day and age its hard to get too far ahead with the player Movement we have Down Low brown finishes with two hands Applause Music and its a nine point lead they come up on the final 90 seconds Clevelands three not there Taylor skies for the board tries to dribble out of trouble and he gets fouled itll be a one and one for Justin Taylor Whos made 16 out of 20 at the freethrow line oh no question you know you may mention Anish about you know how roster changeover has just become the norm itll be interesting to see what Syracuse how they approach their roster going into next season Florida state is very clear theyre going to hit the portal with in a big way I would imagine but again just understanding this new world order uh is a big part of it its any guess what these rosters will look like I look at Pitt a few years ago when as freshmen they brought in Xavier Johnson Trey mcgowans and Audis Tony and you thought wow you can dream on this core all three of them went on to transform Florida state gets two back 7164 but you know what coach Capel did when it got a great group of guys the culture in the locker room is strong bunch of talent and its reminiscent of we talked about 2003 pit now looks like 2003 pit once again what theyve done it in the 2023 fashion theyve done it with transfers and theyre looking at a double buy currently in Greensboro Gerard the three the dagger 26 points for Joe Gerard Cleveland at the other end and Gerard Corrals the rebound Syracuse by 10 this has been one of the best games Joe Gerard has played he played awesome in a Syracuse uniform five threepointers seven rebounds a couple of assists hes played under control the shot selections been terrific and wildly efficient because of it hes taken everything that the defense has given him hes played like the leader tonight no question the extra pass and the punctuation from Jesse Edwards and what you got tonight was a consistent Gerard an elevated mints down the stretch and a little bit of Edwards as well thats a winning formula for Syracuse Applause Juda mince will dribble out the clock Joe Gerard thats the final seconds run out and Syracuse comes to Tallahassee and hangs on for a road win 7667 the Orange down six at the half it was the rebounding in the second half and the play of Judah Mintz that got Syracuse the W on the road yeah Joe Gerard carried today was hunting hits from the threepoint line didnt force and took good care of the basketball only a couple turnovers
