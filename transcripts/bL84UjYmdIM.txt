while defending the threepoint line right now Charleston Southern they make 10 threes per game of their team that wants to shoot the three ball and then you cannot turn the ball over uncharacteristically their last game Virginia Tech they had turnover issues where they gave up some points off the turnovers theyre normally pretty good with taking care of the ball they have to get back to that tonight and the tip is in the air and we are good to go Applause Music Applause at the point up front zillion months a dynamic combo and missilla the transfer from Wright State connects on the long ball and thats the name of the game for the Hokies hey thats a good sign right there if youre Virginia Tech start off with a good offensive possession and a three ball Charleston Southern 74 points again are allowing 74 points Brian Chavez Kelly Clinton and duhart pick up their starting five I want to be delivered theyll kill some clock pass inside good rebound put up and in one of them Clinton industrious off the glass and thats what Charleston Southern wanted to do spoke with the coaching staff at shoot around and they said we must get some easy opportunities crash the offensive glass that time nice Second Chance opportunity passed by Padula out of bounds Charleston Southerns coach hes no stranger on that sideline Barkley radabaugh Big South coach of the year the three postseason appearances it says Malcolm hes very good with us earlier today he said how you do a good job the last couple years traveling through the tough course that was the pandemic and also the transfer portal he feels like he needs to do a much better job getting this program through it but you said it uh hes experienced I really enjoyed our time speaking with him and obviously hes been a Mainstay of this program and uh tonight on the road uh he has to be pleased first early on minutes of this game how his team has executed offensively Chavez with a threepointer seconds ago the junior transfer from Iona reidabot told us that he thinks hes one of the top 10 shoes in the country thats his 133 and 37 attempts he said thats not hyperbole wait till you see him shoot yeah and he said look most uh people say that they dont really mean it theyre just trying to Hype guys up that he said hes got some of the best forms hes seen faster Justin mutz in the post and I know hes one of your favorite players in the ACC why do you think he himself he does a little bit of everything Justin much youre right hes one of my favorite players in the ACC hes so versatile he rebounds hes one of the better rebounders uh in the ACC and again theyre going to be looking for his production on both ends of the court of Virginia Tech but he does a little bit of everything for this team Applause Kelly Powers underneath he needs to be 138 this year for them to be successful but threepoint shooting that graphic tells it all Charleston Southern loves to launch so does Virginia Tech 10 for the bucks and nine per game for the hostess and John thats what I said right away the keys for the game uh for Virginia Tech defending the threepoint line Charleston Southern uh theyre going to shoot him uh they make 10 per game you must be there on the catch and thats something when we spoke with Coach young this afternoon he said look we must do a good job defending the threepoint line against his Charleston Southern team and a travel and a turnover theres Mike young a man who needs no introduction fourth year in Blacksburg he called it his green job coming over from Wofford he grew up down the road and Radford and about a 59 and 37 record and a dream run to the ACC tournament title last year when they won four games in four days one of the best in the business uh coach radabaugh had a a praise of for Coach young he said look that right there uh this is the key for them defending this Virginia Tech offense he said he is one of the most difficult coaches to game plan against because they do such a good job spacing the floor but he said theyre counters they have a counter for everything Chavez three is too strong with mutts grabbing the rebound Darius Maddox he will launch you saw that with his threepointer 50 from the field thats what thats why theres such a difficult matchup you have to defend all five spots indeed three off the line by Hunter Couture ACC tournament MVP last year Music Clinton tries to get in the lane nice move by Kelly Applause that will bring us to a immediate timeout good start for both clubs with tech League by one in the early going Music these goldfish megabytes are too big nation very proud when he announced in June he was returning to Blacksburg and check out his decorated academic career amount thats not too shabby I love to see this young man get it done on and off the court coach Mike young really just Raves about what this young man has meant to the program certainly outstanding basketball player but you know he talks about him as a young man off the court what he represents and obviously getting it done in the classroom and hes going to have success whenever he decides to stop playing ball too but back to the ball piece he really sums up kind of that lunch pail guy that does a little bit of everything one of the better rebounders and the ACC was on the alltournament team in the Charleston classic a double double while he was down there 12 and 10 and shot at a high clip 56 percent from the four I thought it was extremely high praise but Mike young told us that hes the best defender young has ever coached 20 plus years of Mike young coach and he says Justin Muntz is an elite Defender and he loves coaching him every day as it goes out of bounds thank you bucks put up a triple double last year against Syracuse in February put up 12 1411 assist game together a huge part their success he really is a Swiss army knife does a little bit of everything but back to the defensive effort theyre going to need tonight Ive been impressed early on with this Charleston Southern offense theyve done a nice job spacing the floor oh Music Applause Music said he got worried about not starting hes fine with being a sixth man hes averaging over 33 minutes per outing so Harris is happy to accept the role mutts launches of three thats off the line and Harris grabs the rebound its Unique Battlefield that Harris is willing to accept his role Chavez with a three so they go back to back threepoint attempts and they grab the sixpoint lead and that right there is bad gamble uh you cannot gamble against this Charleston Southern team you go with gamble you dont get it Juans number three and the blow by by Sean Padula the counter to stop the mini 60 spurt Junior Tech cant be too aggressive on the defensive end right because Taja Kelly with a turnaround an erratic shot with buck scrapping the board Music four three Applause 10 points per game last year this year off to a good start at 107 and hes 42 percent from distance and John little thing but Justin mutts we talked about it heading screens uh that three is available because Justin Muntz sent two screens uh to free up the tour excellent screener of the basketball as well too and a giveaway by the Hokies Harris cant capitalize Kelly doing more dirty work Here Comes Padula got some numbers Applause Baseline Drive is good Darius Maddox aggressive thats a 30second timeout so Virginia Tech countering the Charleston Southern Spartan and they grab the one point lead again Music I wish I could say I didnt know how hard it is to feed my family during the holidays but Ive been there sure honey thats why I love to give back this time of year I know no gesture is too small a sodas Food Lion when you donate a Food Lion feeds box youre filling tables and hearts with hope this holiday season Music Food Lion feeds here for every moment John the Lost Art of setting screens right here Justin mutts sets two screens to set up his teammate for a good look from Beyond The Arc and you know John Young Players a lot of times theyre not willing screeners and for an offense to be good in particular the spacing that Virginia Tech has and the screens and Pen Downs you have to have bigs that are willing screeners Justin mutts one of the better screening forwards in the ACC that illustration right there shows why these guys get a lot of open threes its been all one and done trips for Virginia Tech so far no Second Chance opportunities and all five Hokies have scored were averaging 80 points per game theres a foul on Hunter Couture its on Claudel Harris dont forget weve got some great college football tomorrows robbery weekend matchup its the 1950 in the series 74 fit has won three straight they screw off against the Miami team looking to get full eligible our coverage begins at eight Eastern on HCC Network and the ESPN Waddell Harris an aggressive score third in the big self and free throw percentage Applause Music just back to your earlier story on him willing to come off the bench knowing that hes playing the most minutes hes their leading scorer uh speaks to what type of young man he is he said coach radabaugh said look he does not care he did not even think twice about it hes team first guy certainly theyve benefited from that type of attitude Sean Padula fourth point of the game Music nice drive well off the line wild shot by Caleb Clinton you like the folk clubs are doing offensively well get into that coming up after this time out we have another medium timeout but also coming up a special connection in Charleston to tell you foreign pictures and signing autographs and giving out memorabilia that really summarizes what a great tournament this is and how giving it is both Squad every Squad participating in Malcolm how could he thoroughly enjoying this tournament one of the best tournaments in college basketball bigger than basketball and thats really the message of Mike young shared with us about that moment right there he was very proud of his team all these young men and certainly the time that they took as you said to give back really get goosebumps watching that excellent job by all them that are involved kid with a dunk who saw that graphic of large leaves blown by the Hokies including eight on Sunday against the winner in college and Charleston that was a terrific game you called it the Jay alter and its back and forth in so many swings of momentum and Mike young told us that game still Burns him hes still thinking about him hes Tracked Down by Sean padulla thats the competitiveness of young but says hes also really not worried about the direction of his team he thinks theres a lot of good stuff thats going on for them Music second after that Buzz number four Tyree Brian well there were some uncares there were some uncharacteristic things that happened in that game he talked about obviously it being pretty much a home its a home game for uh the College of Charleston but I think the big thing was the turnovers uh College of Charleston had 14 points off of 13 Virginia Tech turnovers of Virginia Tech really uh starting off the year or year over year theyre one of the better teams at taking care of the ball and certainly a fatigue and just getting out of there what they do hurt them in that game but make no mistake about it I think hes very pleased with where his team is at right now deep three converted Music outstanding shot that time by trezberia transfer from Rhode Island its a onepoint lead for Virginia Tech any offense the Bucks get from Berry will be a bonus all right the elbow jumper and the rebound kept alive as Maddox missed it was the three by Couture the zilly crash in the lane but he stepped out of bounds Applause Mike young not happy with the closeout again top of the keys you have to be there on the catch if youre not there on the catch its too late uh Mike young talked about that hes in the game his guys having good pulls out being disciplined and transition D but then in their half court sets we said at Charleston Southern they make 10 threes a game if youre not there theyre going to make you pay if you give them wide open looks Music three by Barry they hadnt made a bucket four minutes Applause Music sloppy driving a lane in the Kickball Music Applause tomorrow at 6 Easter the ACC huddle crew without a complete wrapup of the afternoon game so theyll get you set for the prime time matchup between Pick Miami and all right here on HCC Network and the ESPN app Music another three and its good how about that by Brian to give the Bucks their lead 2119 thats four makes in six attempts from three 67 percent sound like a broken record but Virginia Tech again they know the scouting report threepoint defense is going to be key in this one second three of the season for Brian in 11 attempts and here they come five lead changes already the blowby attempt is no good Johnson on the drive transferred from Holy Cross Couture finds Maddox tough competition from Johnson but he nailed it I love maddoxs pullup jumper thats a tough uh pullup Jumper in the lane hes got great elevation uh off the bounce sometimes uh good defense uh just gets outmatched by better offense Applause Brian Applause Music Merry Christmas quiet Applause but not so much that time right onto him one of the mens shooters from distance uh he fits right in with uh Mike Youngs offense uh he hit 47 threes last year uh the grad transfer from Wright State and thats a beautiful offense by Virginia Tech Applause oh yeah he can dial up from long distance the hoagies lead by three Music Charleston Southern doing a nice job yeah right now the Closeouts are late that time a gamble uh by perdula makes them pay you know you can even expect a from Virginia attack theyre one of the better offensive teams in the ACC a pick and pop a facility uh hes a guy that you must be aware of any time youre playing Virginia Tech to pop back out beyond the threepoint line both teams shooting at a high a percentage right now the advantage to Charleston Southern Applause like that Justin mutz with another bucket second foul right now uh is a guy uh all League guys he does so much hell lead the break uh you can put him down low in the post uh hes a guy we talked about one of the better rebounders in the ACC uh Ill call it country uh and you know hes going to be relied on this year because of the loss of Kevin Aluma but hes going to be a guy that has to shoulder a lot of the front Court play for Virginia Tech largest lead of the game for the Hokies riding an eight to nothing run after the foul on Caleb Quinton in the N1 conversion but says Five Points and four rebounds Applause Music Johnson deep three good job by touching Kelly the man on the spot to lay it in hes been impressive in the first half and thats a couple times now Charleston Southerns been able to get some Second Chance opportunities off of Misses that time an air ball Applause Music its an all Patriot League two years ago in a threepointer missed by Darius Maddox Maddox I want to talk about Dramatics he had a buzzer beater against Clemson the ACC tournament last year then he put up a 20point game against the Tar Heels for the semifinals his first right here this is just a tough break again uh basily trying to block out uh certainly I didnt think the ball was going to land right underneath the basket and so thats a tough break a good contest though on the threepoint shot bad news is the ball did not draw any iron and Charleston Southern was able to get an easy put back foul on Tres Berry first zilly thought about it like the way theyre passing around the perimeter they are but I do like the Closeouts by Charleston Southern thats all you can ask for with this uh offense put back attempt by Padilla Padula and it here comes the Buccaneers again Music foreign Applause Music Applause 10 baskets have come from six different players these uh such good shooting teams they aint got guys that if you blink uh they are going to light you up from Beyond the yard Music right here again not there on the catch uh theyre gonna make you pay John on the other end right here nice little rub screen you lose contact and we talked about it at the open Padula shooting over 40 in his last couple four of Virginia Tech what a rise for him 54 points per game last year 17 and a half this year fight 5050 ball attempts Scrappy as well Sean Padula going towards the Hokies bench thats a coachs dream isnt it it is and thats what Mike young talked about hes a copper that will compete against solid freshman campaign the last year you saw flashes that time uh but credit Mike young and his staff of the job they do with the Player Development it just seems like guys year over year get better and man thats a big jump now you look at the first 18 games until now almost doubled his point production Applause Music launches the three Music fight for the loose ball Applause out of bounds off Virginia Tech Michael Collins getting his first Court run of another Music foreign yeah hard to tell from that angle the rough obviously has the better angle right there certainly the fans did not agree with that ball Music its Four Freshmen averaging Four Points three is good Brian its his second of the game theyre not going away Malcolm well were seeing great offensive execution by both teams thats a beautiful skip past that time both teams utilizing spacing and then all their players out on the court really good passers thank you its always missed Music Buccaneers with a chance to grab another lead what an offensive foul 15 in last place in the Big South and Barkley random said they really needed him out yeah he said look it was a great experience obviously of they played some good competition over there but from a team building bonding he said look I think its going to do wonders for our season I saw these young men come together uh as teammates uh and he thinks that again its something that uh they are going to benefit from as they get deeper into the season two Marksman Chavez and Brian putting together a nice nice rebound by Watts oh that is top of the low post that he capitalizes that was a top of the keys for me for Charleston Southern uh mutts and Padula you must contain Justin months in particular on the offensive glass Applause Music Applause thats the transfer from Delaware how about the role in the rib by Dodd Dodge just off the bench yeah theyre doing a good job on the offensive blast and theyre in plus three now above the Hokies in the rebounding Department not coming off of a 2021 had an ACL tear and looking pretty healthy there nice little spin move and finish quick feet soft hands this by bazilly Music Harris between the circles Chavez has been failing it tenacious defense by Couture to reset though by a composed Buck Squad Harris the pullup and muck to golf the board here come the Hokies Padula oh that was pretty wide open and he Nails the layup John that was Virginia Techs best defensive possession of the game that previous possession which led to a transition bucket Applause foreign but another counter by Brian counter punches are at a furious pace for the bucks Music Chavez again that time with the pullup jumper Applause not bad d by Virginia Tech but thats his better offense guy just raising up over the defender monster bass that would have been a Nifty to you by Padula old school no look shot by shot Padula Charleston Southern with under a minute to play in the half Berkeley rade of Oz going to be very happy with this result but an offensive foul called on Claudio Harris by Teddy Valentine ACC pm with Mark Packer Troy Boston and Taylor ten of bomb well talk football but well also have the latest from around the conference check it out weekdays at four Eastern on his Sienna and the ESPN Music Packer busy on Twitter tonight tweeting about North Carolinas football loss State a bit of a shocker in Chapel Hill and also the Tar Heels lost the basketball the Iowa State tough day if youre a Target fan Couture called for an offensive foul Hunter Couture at the elbows I mean thats all about yeah lets see right here yeah hes in good position again the referee is sitting there thats great position Music got the arm out call for the ref to make thats just a really good defensive effort Applause Music Applause Music Chavez gritty on the fence event picking up the offensive foul and now a four second differential with the shot clock of the game clock three big side rebound Applause Music and then terrific end of half execution right here draw two Defenders nice hesitation that time and fitness uh you could not have for A better ending to the half uh if youre Mike Young kid that time using a crate hands and footwork Music and followup Brian and kid at the line averaging four and a half points per game doesnt play much but pretty productive and a good way to end the half of the threepoint play fourpoint Virginia Tech lead Charleston Southern a good first half Austin Southern hanging right in there with the five and one Hokies Applause bucks shooting 43 percent Virginia Tech 50 on Second Chance opportunities Virginia Tech has to do a better job on the defensive glass and not give Charleston Southern any second chances Johnson with a basketball for Charleston Southern in the visiting navy blue jerseys Music six and four the first half out of bounds of the Buccaneers whats to the Chagrin of Iona transfer to lead Chavez thats all set up though by Hunter Couture being the best on defense now hes done a nice job uh Weve defensively being active with his hands Applause Music silly trying to back in punched away and out of bounds off of the hoagies turns by Charleston Southern Virginia Tech basically just trying to isolate the silly on the Block and sort of dig down from the guard Force the turnover control balance bazillion mutts original starting five for Virginia Tech hes already the transfer from Wright State much of the transfer from Delaware both schools doing a good job mining the transfer portal and toxic interior defense yeah thats great patience and post entry pass again that doesnt happen unless there is a really good post entry pass pinpoint passing great spacing and great hands as we talked about pulled away by Caleb Quinton Music marks led by as many as six in the first half on a 5050 fight between Clinton and the zilly Music how about the last Bucket look at that perfect uh postentry pass and then you talked about the hands Kelly that is great A set of hands for the big never brought the ball back down went up and finished all set up though by excellent passing and Barclay right about told us Natasha Kelly needed to be a 138 guy this year for them to have success felt like that was definitely part of his Arsenal tour with the miss Applause Music ing the wild drive but he couldnt finish contacted a foul that was on Virginia Techs 25 Justin months thats his second time Music spacing by Charleston Southern and because theyre shooting the ball so loud Virginia Tech has to be out and be aware of the shooters on the perimeter and thats allowing some driving gaps for these Wing players foreign Music kid who had the threepoint play to end the first half and give the Hokies the four point Edge the southern shooting 45 they entered the night at 39 through their first four games Music lost to Tulane and they got blown out by Ohio State Music coming off a win over BethuneCookman foreign Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music cant say enough about his release if youre not there on the catch you got no shot of catching up to his shot quick release high arc and one of the more lethal Shooters in the ACC maybe we dont talk about much passing enough mentioned a triple double he had against Syracuse last year in February when he posted 11 assists youre not going to see that often now come from a guy whos 68 its so versatile again hes the first for me uh one of the top players not just in the ECC but in college basketball he can rebound it he can handle uh as Mike young said Mike young calls him the best defender hes ever coached and hes been around a lot of really good players and coached some really good ones High Praise though for just as much what he brings second years Music and the screens dont show up in that 07 he need help a lot of those although he may not have gotten an assist for it hes a freed up Couture and Padula with his ability to scream moments ago the third foul on Couture Kelly down the lane took kick to the rift Kelly is in double figures with ten and you can see why the staff is so high on Tajay Kelly great size and Im impressed with his Footwear man I mean thats a great spin move yeah and finish with the left Applause the drive by Maddox but an old school Booth by Kelly yeah and we spoke with Coach uh Loretta ball he said look this guy needs to be dominated for us and you can see why they are so high on him but John thats a big time spin move and finish with the left and tonight hes done a little bit of everything rebounded uh shooting a high percentage but Im going back to my earlier keyboard Virginia Tech Second Chance opportunity right now theyre getting a lot of Second Chance opportunities and right now they have nine points uh off of Second Chance opportunities to two for Virginia Tech so thats a plus seven Music great work happening on the offensive glass for Charleston Southern plus five rebounding Edge for the bucks kid goes down three got it Chavez ties the game at 41 man has he been dangerous when distant Music how about four threes and six attempts for Chavez oh yeah theres 55 trailers well this is just the breakdown right here John gets trip in the backcourt by Kid and oh its a imbalanced number five on four in favor of Charleston Southern and theyre just too good uh they passed the ball well made the extra pass and we talked about their threepoint shooting uh they are one of the better threepoint shooting teams in the Big South thats why Berkeley read about called him one of their top 10 Shooters in the country the hook shot by mutts put back by Kid for eating the glass keeping it alive theyre missing the bunnies theyre doing the hard part theres a lid on that thats three layups in a row they just missed and the pullup is good thats Cornell Harris whos been quiet theyre leading scorer and Buccaneers grab the lead stunningly so the sellout crowd in Castle Coliseum is flustered kid trying to grab a loose ball rebound and a travel Charleston Southern with the twopoint lead gritty but right here beautiful pullup jumper Virginia Tech has got their work cut out just got it going on all three levels but right here gamble uh by Virginia Tech hes made them pay nice looking jumper all within the offense they found the extra guy and he has made them pay every time theyve left him open thats something that leads to teams before Virginia Tech they have to do a better job defending the threepoint line plus six rebounding Edge for Charleston Southern Music 03 rebounding and entering the ball again what a block various Maddox gets the bucket the goals head good attempt but Maddox will take it Applause hes season high is 14 hes at 12 right now Applause to go in this game Jolly awkward shot become the Hokies Doula to Maddox and a foul thats on Claudel Harris Madison Music right there yeah thats a pretty good angle and again referees theyre judged on the positioning and if theyre out of position they cant make that ball hes right underneath the basket in great position he has the best angle in and it looks like a pretty good call right there tough break for Virginia Tech thats got to be a jump stop jumper right there cannot keep your momentum going into the player a good call so the turnover numbers are minimal for both squats Music pushed away then IQ a turnover and a bucket by Petula Applause Hudson Padula at nine of Virginia Techs last 11 points to end the half the Hokies are up two again Applause Music RJ Johnson the Holy Cross transfer Music Applause Music yeah 20 seconds on the shot clock for Charleston Southern second Andrew Charleston Southern 13 Chavez Chavez back in after a brief respite on the bench Applause Music he played just seven games last year with a knee injury to Patriot League all rookie campaign 2021 Applause foreign Music Applause Music Applause defense by Virginia Tech but Chavez takes it tomorrow at 6 Eastern the ACC huddle crew will have a complete wrapup of the afternoon gigs and theyll get you separate a prime time matchup between big Miami on acc its all new ACC Network and the ESPN Applause Music Applause Music crystal ball and you Applause Music Applause out of bounds off of the active Buccaneers Music Berkeley right about 218 and 301 and on a buck sideline tour checks back in for Lynn Kidd okay shooting just 30 percent in the second half Malcolm why does that happen well credit oh Charleston Southern theyve done a nice job defensively uh Barclay rayoval we talked to him this afternoon he said look we have to get back to our mantoman principles we need to be tough we need to make it difficult for others to run their offense I think thus far in this game he has to be released without his team has defended and then also rebounded the ball hes off right now in favor of Charleston Southern uh in the rebounding Department if I was on Clinton his third with months at the line checking in for Charles instead of number four Music Tyree Bryan back in for Charleston Southern Clinton to the bench with three fouls and an inability for each team to pull away yeah high level basketball uh spacing has been good but the defense I think the defensive intensity in this last a really fourminute stretch impressive on both ends Music foreign Applause Music ER defense the Hokies elbow jumper claudell Harrison hits Music amazing what hes been able to do and this guy uh 22 points off the bench in his last game uh hes their leading scorer 19 points per game in his pullup game really is difficult to defend Applause hands here the post with spots but the last pullup by Harris and John thats not bad defense I mean thats just the guy you know going to his left pulling up and the defender is there hes just raising up over him thats a tough too stuffing the shot stops sheet for those numbers Music Applause for three Music shooting three three shots for Padula Applause closeout and you know Padula is the one guy you definitely do not want to put him on the free throw line there you go though the old announcements Music back to this production increase obviously last year freshman year solid showed some flashes and obviously that was not his role within that team but this season again the Player Development and say enough about what Mike young and his staff do with guys they get in there and they just seem like they get better each year Padula huge jump in numbers Music Here Comes mutts with his steal and numbers fast break run expertly by Justin butts pokies with a burst Music when he gets going look out I mean thats just a guy let me ISO cross you up and then raise up into my jumper he is a difficult matchup oneonone Applause Here Comes Chavez Applause good decision to hold three got it thats Brian again who has three out of three from distance and they tie it up point lead seconds ago wiped away John thats all set up by cuadel Harris again could have pulled up head fake and then draw another Defender unselfish play to kick it up to his teammate for a wide open three zillys been quiet rebound weak side a good take by Maddox that goes out of bounds how about this from Bryant third three and three attempts are you kidding me hes got a pretty shot the offense for the Buccaneers is flicking at the Home Depot Justin monster versatility Malcolm Huckabee from Virginia Tech he dug the little things double screen right here frees up Couture a four jumper again unselfish a willing screener something that may not show up in the Box Score but believe me these coaching staff knows what he means to this team in the passing Lane thats your six seven uh do it all forward leading the break making an unselfish pass that led to another uncontested layup you look at his numbers eight points you know hes going to rebound three assists but the screening John I think thats the key thing mutts Couture all these threepoint Shooters have to get open somehow he does a great job screening freeing up guys for some quality looks shout out to Olivia our Piero operator for those pretty pictures about that Huck its a move again by Justin butts inside He Is Crafty just when you think hes got something else in the back well I think thats in the matchup they need to go back to right here Charleston Southern is not going to double team but let Justin mutts go uh end the books but I think that might be another foul on months since his third fourth his third on months nine knee changes now but this right here again I like this matchup if youre Virginia Tech they dont double I go back to that if Charleston Southern is going to stay in man and not theyll let Justin Lutz uh play in the post although Harris has been hot rebound by too hard Applause by Brazilian Harris double team splits it was proving wise one of her top scorers of the big self were on all three levels weve seen his pullup game solid threepoint shooter but thats great body control there eight tie of the ball game to three Maddox missed Music foreign equally good defense by Matsu fights for the loose ball Applause s behind the back raining seconds of the shot clock good defensive possession by the homies yeah and thats individual defensive effort by Sean padul at that time forcing a deep contested three open three months cant ask for a better look wide open uh double that almost seems like Charleston Southern but theyre going to live with much shooting threes and certainly youre right they left him wide open cant answer a better look thats been a tone in the second half for sharing by rajira attack at 26 percent Applause is led by four at the half Kelly to the rack and the end one point of the posts and passes does a great job sealing his defender in see why are they hes the X Factor six seven about 250 is solid great hands and Ive been impressed with his footwork and physicality around the basket hard not to be bucks did not complete the threepoint play Music Applause Music neither team is led by more than six points Music for Doula drafting again and kid the putback they needed that thats great work on the offensive glass of Island kid you actually right they needed that bucket foreign Music last season all big South freshman team comes off the bench which starts for probably pretty much any team in the league he accepts his role plays more minutes than anybody and that guy can flat out score silly kid the board and a foul Charleston Southern nip and tuck with the Hokies twopoint Advantage at Blacksburg foreign challenge you do not want to miss it the next couple days on ESPN family of networks look at that slate is a basketball potpourri now so many games on that schedule what are you looking forward to I mean all of them but really that Michigan uh Virginia game really intriguing uh so many good ones out there but I think the biggest thing bragging writes for the respective conferences theres been so much debate going on you know obviously ACC had a pretty good tournament month run last year and I think thats really the only one that matters uh what you do in March Music thats an early table though perhaps tilting some levels of competition but what a dog fight in Blacksburg between the Bucks and the Hokies for shooting by Virginia Tech in the second half thats why Charleston Southern sticking around they have a twopoint lead Justin mutz the Double T works out him until then kid Applause if Im Mike young right now Im running my offense every possession uh Justin mutts is getting a touch if Charleston Southern stays man and stays home let him go to work if they come double hes such a good passer and willing passer and I like that last possession beautiful find by Justin Lutz foreign Applause kid cleansing transfer Maddox track down by Couture comes up to empty not a bad look pass was off and I think that threw Couture shot off but the pass was on point I think he has a better opportunity of making that three yet to adjust just to catch it Applause tour the 63 sooner from Orlando with six points something under move and a misfire by Dodd The Duel is spinning at it oh that was Nifty what a move by Darius Mattis I think the key thing he didnt settle for a jumper he could have easily settled for a jumper on that kick out decided to drive Applause takes time out Charleston Southern is it tilting towards the Hokies do they have a Knockout Punch coming up Music so amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help this winter HTC Network wants to experience support from your perspective so snap a pic or take a video tag it with a hashtag all the devotion posted to your social just might see it on accn theres one for you that looks familiar that other guy looks familiar man see what

sellout crowd post Thanksgiving three by Chavez wild shot empty possession off the Barclay right about timeout by the Buccaneers what happened well Virginia Tech defense has picked up and great job of identifying screens and then they communicated forced a very difficult contested three hunk shot five months Applause his outstanding game continues sometimes you just gotta simplify your offense and I called it both Justin mutts put them down low on the Block one on one if theyre not going to help and let him continue to go to work Kelly snaps the scoreless string for the Buccaneers Applause 14 for Kelly hes had an impressive night Ill tell you right now they were picked not to finish high in the Big South but been impressed with their performance an offensive foul called against Virginia Tech well be back right after this our final media timeout I remember when I first started flying Point Edge over Charleston Southern Justin butts has been the chef and theres a theme with these last three buckets of theyve all been inside the paint right here a dribble Drive dont settle for the jumper work it in higher percentage shot I think this is a key right here Justin Munch let him touch the ball on every offensive possession if they dont double let them do that right there if not hes a willing passer I like that now from the plus 14 points of the paint Edge for the Hokies Kelly has been foreign hits it somehow on the put back to tie it again grown man move right here this is just a big boy going up Im just going to out muscle you get my own Miss go back up into contact and finish we spoke with Barkley raid a ball this afternoon he said look this guys The X Factor uh he must be dominant in the paint for us of a night uh he was pretty dominant and hes doing a nice job establishing himself uh in the post if I was on Lynn kidding Applause thats what you think the Hokies are ready to pull away Charleston Southern has an answer Applause but under move by mutts thats his first Reginald and I like how theyre posting months again see how much spacing they have because you have Padula Couture out on the court when they make post entry passes you cannot help off of them XMen spacing by Virginia Tech and identifying uh that much is their advantage Applause Music offensive moments for Mike young his fourth year on the Okies bench a record of 59 and 37 as mutz hits both timeout that take a 30second timeout pokeys trying to go to six and one with a twopoint lead Music final 253 whats the strategy for Mike Young at Virginia Tech now well the problem has been uh Kelly Tasha Kelly really has been an issue for them so you got to make a decision I think you almost have to dig but you cant double because of the way Charleston Southern uh has shot the ball so you have to try the front or threequarter of uh defend the post and try to deny Kelly getting those post entry passes up within your guards have to dig out off of him see if you can come up with a turnover but theyve been trying to find him in the post Hollywood 169 Chavez to Kelly again Applause possession for the Buccaneers with 20 to shoot and I like what Charleston Southern is doing theyre using ball screen action just to get Kelly moving they know they want to post them up see theyll bring them out to the high post but theyre just trying to roll them down to the paint how about that easy ridiculous Claudel Harris thank you man that was simple wasnt it it was all set up though theres so much attention on Kelly of the big did not even help that time Harris with 15 hes one of four bucks in double figures but spin move Beauty Justin butts what a touch thats it for him in this second half up to 16 points for Justin months foreign changes Applause Harris oh he gets the role my goodness and pretty much all of his points in the second half theres been a lot of them have been contested hes had very few open looks like hes hit some tough shots off the bounce off a double team and a power slam to LinkedIn always makes the right pass timeout Hoagies Justin mutts line for tonights 16 points eight rebounds but Ive been so impressed with this right here his passing that time out of the double team hes drawing so much attention because they cannot handle him oneonone and then hes so unselfish uh Mike young and snapped his rave about what he means to this Virginia Tech Team we talked about him being excellent student as well too getting it done off the court but for me hes one of the better players not just in the ACC but in college basketball so versatile can really guard one through five and offensively really has expanded this game and he has he has five of their 14 assists first up there is 11 combined careers the second half just three both teams have gone inside the arc does that surprise you uh for Virginia Tech no I think its a good call for them they shoot the high percentage shots but I think the issue now is defensively uh Kelly really has been a handful in the second half of Virginia Tech uh really has got to do a better job making it a little bit more difficult for them to enter the ball into the post hes establishing basically two feet inside the paint because theyre doing a lot of actions to get him diving into the post and get him posted up but thats going to be the issue right now Virginia Tech how they guard tajai Kelly and then for Charleston Southern uh what are you going to do with Justin mutts they doubled the last time down hes such a good passer he wound up getting his teammate a wide open dunk thats really the strategy right now for both teams how youre going to defend mucks and on the other end how youre going to defend tajai Kelly and Harris have 24 of the Buccaneers 31 in the second half points this is Claudel Harris one minute to play remaining in regulation take hook shot off the line by duhart not what they were looking for Doula will hold s skips it what a move Maddox punch from kid flustered at The Rim gets it back and a foul Justin mutz industrious again in the Post Falls right here theyre not settling for jumpers uh theyve scored a lot of their points in the paint to close out this second half we talked in the first half they were shooting at a high clip from the threepoint line Id like Virginia Techs patience and then recognizing uh that they dont need to settle for Jumpers in this situation timeout Charleston Southern one remaining for each team Music Tasha Kelly huge part of their offensive success and defensive success Ill tell you what uh Big South on notice uh he is a handful down low Ive been impressed with his footwork ability to finish and then Charleston Southern has done a nice top spacing before because they have Shooters but on the offensive glass he has been a handful of four Virginia Tech to handle inside the Berkeley rated ball puddle where are you going well right now again its all going to come down to defending a Justin mutts you have to stay home though because they have those Shooters out on the perimeter for Doula a Couture they really have not been uh shooting many threes rightfully so because mutz has been the goto guy so it starts with your dig outs and then your rotations if you do double on months have to be quicker it wasnt there the last nine months Ive made a nice pass for a wide open dunk on the other end its the same thing same strategy for Virginia Tech you have to dig ontase Kelly uh you havent been able to defend him one on one so your guards have to dig but then if you do go dig or double you have to be out and close out on those Shooters uh easier said than done youve seen some high level offense from both teams I also think defensive rebounding cannot give up uh any second chance opportunities uh either team 3635 rebounding Edge for the Hokies with much at the line after the foul was on duhart Applause threepoint lead 17 for months one out of two shot clock off and another timeout for the Buccaneers Applause Music 222 remaining in regulation Music but not if youre Charleston Southern 222 seconds thats an eternity right so you dont need a three now again if it comes off of you get the ball down low to Kelly or off the screen dribble Drive kick out for a good look thats fine youll live with that but right now youre just looking to get into your offense quick Kelly has been your guy play through him and then you still have time to set up your defense go for one skill and then foul obviously if you dont get the Steal unless you hit a three but certainly in this situation you dont need a three right away the three ball though has been kind to really uh Charleston Southern in this game you look at their numbers 42 percent uh from the threepoint line theyve made eight Cornell Harris oh for five from three Brian three for three Chavez four for eight here we go Harris has the ball switch mutts on him now the three Chavez punched out of bounds Applause well take a look at this Applause I know you must have this ball if youre Virginia Tech yeah that aint go right there now that angle it looks like Kelly was the last one to touch it but certainly though mutts is swinging his hand yeah I I dont think theres going to be enough to reverse it only because just as much yeah Justin mutts is swinging his hand in the ball goes the way that butts is swinging his hand Music yeah I think thats still going to be Charleston Southern and it looks like mutts yeah it looks like mutz is the one who knocked it yeah yeah and again you look at the position of Defense Teddy Valentine right there again Music positioning hes in great position as you would expect he would be veteran official they just want to make sure theyll take a look at it get it right such an important call in this game but I still believe its going to be Charleston Southern ball Music what a ball game Malcolm so many times so many lead changes back and forth monthly rate about sounded confident we spoke with him earlier Mike young has confidence in his Squad and the other day when we spoke to him so both coaches felt like they were in a good spot both teams have played well despite Court shooting by Virginia Tech in the second half they still have had some answers and credit Charles from Southern lets take a look yep they say its going to still State Charleston Southern Wall but youre absolutely right John I think you know Tom from Southern who really has performed both ends offensively you know they can go and shoot the ball from the threepoint line but Ive been more impressed with tajai Kelly uh his presence in the post for them Claudel Harris one of the better scores Applause mix outfit theyre resetting the game clock up to 113 seconds Music where you going on the inbound right now if youre playing the way they are Im just blobbing it up to Kelly let him go to work uh Padula looks like hes going to excuse me that looks like the hunter Couture looks like hes just gonna stay home to inbound its a hurry he does Harris Beyond The Arc the launch rebound to tour going the other way on the foul good luck for Claudel Harris but he hits the back iron well the plate took so long to develop and this is good defense by Padula again you do not want to foul in this position so just get your hands up make him shoot a contested three Music but that play took a long time to develop ment did good call quiet Hunter Couture at the line first time in the game and he Nails it Applause Music second time foul shot by Hunter Couture the Rainy ACC tournament MVP Holland is back in his only run of the second half Music point hokeys lead money at the line for Hunter Couture Virginia Tech right now just do not want to foul and certainly thats the last thing you want to do Paris the three at the Buzzard no good and that wraps it up value and effort by both teams it was gritty it was gutty and Virginia Tech wins by five your final thoughts huh Virginia Tech comes away with a win uh Justin mutz uh solidified hes one of the better players not the ACC but in college basketball but on the other side Charleston Southern uh I think a lot of people are going to have some eyebrows raised thinking
