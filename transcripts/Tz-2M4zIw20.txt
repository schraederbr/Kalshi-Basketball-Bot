Bradford he is not available tonight Henry Coleman is back for AM he did not play and they come from behind win over Iowa State due to an ankle injury but he is starting tonights game and in that game against Iowa State they were down 21 so it was the largest comeback win in school history and they did it while their forces were depleted yeah they did that without Coleman and without boots raford as you mentioned so Buzz Williams said he found out a lot about his team in a positive manner jump shot goes down for Jacob Grove so good start for him inserted into the starting five tonight yeah Grove started the first two games of the season however Blake Buchanan had a come out performance against Florida and has been in the starting lineup since Wade Taylor comes up short in the three but theres the rebounding weve been talking about Henry Coleman with the stick back and that is going to be the Storyteller here this evening is can Virginia keep Texas AM off the glass or will the agies flex their muscle average 18 offensive rebounds per game and looking at the two power five opponents that uh Florida or excuse me that Virginias played Virginias given up 41 offensive rebounds in those two games Jace Carter trying to drive the angle cut off by Andrew roie and Hefner stepped on the sideline to a turnover by Texas AM you do a lot of NBA basketball however what you just saw is the most common turnover in the college basketball game ever since the the threepoint line was moved back you see guys constantly with that Retreat step stepping on that sideline forcing dead ball turnovers got to be really frustrating for Buzz Williams when youre that late in the shot clock as well but Virginia obviously thats the goal Cavaliers will throw it around the perimeter with McNeely who shooting 55 from three shot clock down to six heres beakman putting it on the floor driving into contact kicks it out for a three from mcney and it rattles home 39 threepoint shooter last year and as we just mentioned 55 thatll go up after the three unable to answer his Hepner long rebound beatman three on two at the hurry spot up three mcney back to back triples for mcne great start for Virginia specifically Isaac mcne but ree mman with a great decision there he had Ryan dun on his right going to the hot hand early and there last game they hit only four threes the entire game already two here in the first 2 and 12 minutes but one thing for certain Virginia is a different program a different team in this building the defense ramps up the shooting of course is much better and that time they get a stop and more importantly finish it with the defensive rebound three and0 this year they won 18 of their last 19 here at jpj defensive rebound for Coleman 82 Virginia Lee havent been many thre minute stretches this year in M Ms had just two points Coleman offensive rebound again back up missed it again and then batted into the back court and saved by Taylor this is Texas AM basketball they will continue to attack the rebounding the offensive glass Tony Bennett talked to his team about not hanging their head when they got an offensive rebound just continuing to defend out of bounds off Virginia 16 to shoot for Texas AM one loss for the agies came against FAU and in that game they scored 89 points and lost by seven FAU a final four team year ago as L will go to the bench and in comes Solomon Washington in that game they lost Henry Coleman at the end of the first half and a tyres raford wasnt available for the second half for the agies Wade Taylor went off for 34 points however check that Anderson Garcia into the game excellent offensive rebounder the best in the country nice pass by Garcia and the layup inside for Jace Carter Andel Ro got caught up chasing Carter off of that screen nice cut by Carter to find that wide open Applause layup efner guarding bman shot clock at nine heres mcney hit a couple threes now drives into the lane boy looked like a foul that time by Garcia up top a three from roie off the side of the rim out of bounds to Texas Music AM here in Virginia but happy to see lak doing well also I think she got Dads credit card number earlier today do a little shopping he did say that think she was looking to go to a apparel store and he said L you can do whatever you want just go ahead fire away at this point of course hes extremely proud of her Laken who is in medical school in Boston but more importantly fight the good fight and now in remission versus caner Roger working tonights game with John Gaffney and James pring so an excellent Crew 8 to4 Virginia with the early lead Over Texas AM first ACC SEC challenge as Hefner drives missed the layup another offensive rebound but Carter couldnt put it back in and with the smaller starting lineup with Groves at the five for Virginia the one thing you dont have on the interior shot blocking was Blake youan and cant provide however Gro provides a threepoint shooting to space the floor tough shot inside it wouldnt fall for Ryan Dunn they need his scoring done averaging 10 points per game on this season heres Wade Taylor quiet start for Taylor F nerd tried off of a defenders leg and it somehow ended up underneath in the hands of Carter one of the things that you will see from Texas AM they go after every 5050 ball as though their life depends upon it but bu Williams does a drill their shoot around where he rolls the basketball on the floor and guys are running all over the gym diving after the basketball theyre used to it as part of their culture year five for Buzz Williams but no stranger to this building spent five years at Virginia Tech number three thats three already Ryan Dunn stepping up off of a nice find from Ro attacking the B the Baseline Ro does a great job keeping his eyes up and dun has a shot at great from three this year steps up and makes a big one for Virginia four threes in each of the last two games and theyve got three already here in the first 6 minutes and thats not really the strength of Taylor at least not this year 27 but that was a long one that goes down first three for Tech he got it going at the ESPN events imitational in Orlando and hes a guy that will shoot it as you just saw from Deep you got to be prepared for him to shoot it from 30 ft away pman almost threw that out of bounds good save by mcney nice pass underneath and done with the slap five quick points for Ryan Dunn nice cut by Ryan Dunn along the Baseline but even better find from Jacob grov being able to put the basketball on the floor knocked out of bounds last Touch by Applause Music Virginia and the dimension that grow gives Virginia his ability to be a to put the basketball on the floor make a play but more importantly the nice passing to find Ryan Dunn creeping along the Bas sline and of course whenever Ryan Dunn gets an opportunity at The Rim hes going to make it look spectacular Dunn getting a breather Manny oasi checking in for Virginia and Solomon Washington on the floor now for AM he got his first start last game had a careerhigh 18 points and a win drives here nice finish off the window and solo will not waste time thats one of the things about him whether hes in the starting lineup or hes coming off the bench he will not waste any time has a conversation with with Roger SS and I love this Solomon Washington got a technical foul against FAU in that semifinal game in in Orlando Roger a is a great piece of officiating goes over has a conversation early about what is going to be tolerated what is not but he did not put down a technical foul which I love that officiating talking to his guys and then Washington teammate Eli Lawrence came over and pointed to his head meaning use your head dont make a mistake like that on the road mcne getting into the lane eight points now for mcney he averages just under 10 per game yeah great start for mcne hasnt had a double figure game since opening night for Virginia so great to see his offense showing up with Tony Bennett Lawrence penetrates as it poked away and duns got it fourpoint lead for UVA against the 14th ranked team in the country Texas AM you look at this Virginia lineup playing without a true point guard Dante Harris is out Reese beakman on the bench wow that was from a good six feet behind the line mcne comes up short Im okay with it you made a couple of them you got you got freedom to shoot that little heat check Lawrence is three not there and good defensive rebounding by dun who averages about seven boards per game Virginia opens up conference play this weekend against Syracuse got an official timeout Applause here when you come to jpj always look forward to seeing Ryan Dunn take off and have something type of highlight here at home one of those wins came against Virginia here Cavaliers are ranked number two in the country that time and because of course Virginia Virginia Tech are permanent Partners Tony Bennett and Buzz Williams had to see each other at least twice a year and Virginias perfect season at home was interrupted by Buzz Williams and Justin Robinson in that crew in 2018 where they came in and upset number two Virginia Virginia Virginias only ACC loss of that season that was the year they got knocked off in the first round by UNBC but then came back the next year and won the National Championship I wasnt going to mention that thats not something that talked about much here thats why I mentioned the championship after they they go together its a great story of perseverance I I agree Im with you on that one Ro meanwhile with Virginias 43 matching their total from each of the last two games trying to answer is Washington but Js done a pretty good job in the glass only three offensive rebounds forf and the young man coming up with that rebound number 12 Elijah Gertrude who had planned on red shirting this season but with the injury to Dante Harris is now active and playing his first minutes in the Virginia uniform Cory we touched on beakman at the top of the telecast about that knee wasnt sure that he was going to play tonight how does he look to you so far well hes not attacking the same way youre used to seeing Reese beakman get downhill and get into the paint in air area but whenever youre dealing with something like that if its not structural as the game goes on you loosen up I look forward to seeing him be more aggressive senior from Milwaukee hes on the wooden award watch list tested the NBA Waters but came back out of bounds last touched by AM but one things for certain Reese beatman continues to do the job defensively right in front of his head coach Tony Bennett forcing another turnover 15th year for Bennett here in Charlottesville the alltime leader in wi at Virginia pass Terry Holland back in January largest lead of the game here for UVA little push shot wont fall for Roadie but a foul on Texas AM thats the first foul in the game on either Team Blake Buchanan doing a great job attacking the offensive glass putting pressure on Texas AM giving him just a taste of their own medicine Henri Coleman checking back in along with Jace Carter again no Tyrese Radford the second second straight game for Texas AM aing 13 points per game thats a huge loss for Texas AM hes a strong component to what Buzz Williams and this team does they got a lot of guys coming off the bench that can give him production but hes the veteran of this group checking in is Elijah gertrud they were going to red shirt him as beakman misses but gertrud had his red shirt pulled and the Freshman from Jersey Citys on the floor Taylor weaving through traffic draws a foul the first on Virginia on Buchanan both teams dealing with injuries you see Tyrese raford AKA Bots whos out tonight Dante Harris for Virginia whos out tonight on crutches on the sideline and then Reese beakman of course the leader of this Virginia team was a game time decision you see him playing with the brace on the right knee you and I happen to be in the office talking to Tony Bennett when the Great trainer Ethan S came in and gave Tony the thumbs up which was a sigh of relief for Tony to know that hes going to have Reese on the floor to start the game tonight and hes been out there pretty much the entire first half save one minute called for a kick here you think about an AM one of the top offenses in the country and right now on Pace for about 40 points but Buzz Williams knows whats going to happen he understands whats going to happen in this game his biggest concern is to make sure that they dont give Virginia easy opportunities off of turnovers Texas AM comes in as one of the best teams in the country handling the basketball 91 turnovers per game but thats been a proponent for Virginias defense that theyve turned into offense all this season theyve had a lot of success when theyve been able to turn the opp opponents over and almost a steal by beakman Boy Wayne Taylors getting a workout weve seen it going to the back court two or three times already to track down a loose basketball and good d by beakman shot clock at six catch and shoot Coleman from midrange able to knock it down and Henry Coleman is comfortable in this Arena as well of course started his first year at Duke but this is a place where Henry Coleman used to come to Elite Camps he was a a high Virginia recruit his mom Cynthia who was of course taken in the game is a UV grg class of 92 so going be very familiar with the confines Virginia turns it over Taylor thought about the logo three but again beakman is right there first turnover by Virginia they get it right back a steal by Buchanan then he throws it right to Coleman you had beakman sitting at the perimeter great Hands by Blake Buchanan but thats one of the reasons why as a guard you always tell the big guys pick it up Ill come get it dont try to push the break on your own efner rattles around and out and a defensive rebound by dun Virginia ball with a fivepoint lead eight and a half to go in the first Music Applause Music half work that perimeter MC nes got a couple threes already Coleman extending on him beakman hangs and finishes with the left hand his first points of the night and thats Rees Beakmans game attacking the paint whether its making a play for himself or his teammates does a great job getting downhill and making sure he finish it off the lead back to seven for Virginia pman the leading score on the year averaging 12 per game nice drive and finish by Henry Coleman looks to be good after suffering that ankle injury couple games ago yeah Henry Coleman has picked up where he left off in Orlando when he was the best player on the floor often times for Texas AM however the best player on the floor for Virginia to be successful is going to have to be Reese beakman all ACC potential this season 92 mother of Henry Coleman theii and she is super proud of her baby and he has played very well off to a great start here big baby by the way and and Henrys dad Hank played football at Virginia Tech in Virginia and Virginia Tech were both heavy suitors for Henry Coleman the third Services coming out of Trinity Episcopal School in Richmond Virginia however he chose Duke as a freshman and has made the move now to go to the then Virginia Tech coach Buzz Williams who was created a program at Texas an 25 wins last year 15 and3 and Conference play good for second they ended up losing though in the NCA tournament their last NC T NCA tournament win was back in 2018 shot clock down to two Roy had to hoist it missed the three and its a m ball one offensive rebound for Virginia but if if history continues to repeat itself this is the year for Texas AM it was year five that Buzz Williams took Duke to the Sweet forgive me took Virginia Tech to the Sweet 16 with a tip end chance to beat Duke to get to the elite eight it was year five at Marquette where he had success so year five at Texas AM if history repeats itself this is the one for the ads stolen by beakman Fifth turnover by Texas AM they lead Groves open he didnt pull the trigger though 645 to go first half Virginia leading by Applause five pakman two points so far penetrating and good hands knocking it away as Washington a number of very good individual defenders in Washington and Garcia a number of guys that can slide their feet making it difficult for ree beakman to get a good look in the paint Taylor got knocked down missed the three but hell go to the line as beakman commits the foul his first itll be three free throws for Taylor and you have to be aware as to where Wade Taylor I fourth is at all times on the floor hes shown us that hes got deep range already in this game Reese beakman over aggressive closing out on that one getting the foul sending Taylor to the free throw line for three first free throws of the game for either team and Wade Taylors an excellent foul shooter set the school record and led the secc in free throw shooting last year at 88 hes at 83 this year Tomorrow full evening of ACC SEC challenge matchups for womens college basketball first at 5 Eastern Missouri taking on Virginia then Alabama takes on Syracuse and to wrap up the night Texas AM against Wake Forest catch all the action on acc Network or the ESPN app of course two of the best conferences in womens basketball as well the ACC and the SEC doing battle a number of great games on tap Angel Reese will be in the lineup for LSU as they take on my big cousin Kenny Brooks in the Virginia Tech womens basketball program in a top 10 matchup tomorrow night Ill be tuned in for that on ESPN at 9 eastern time tomorrow turnover by Virginia so AM with a chance to Tire Take the Lead after the three free throws by Taylor McNeely on him heres Hepner knocks down the three and Texas AM has the lead off of turnovers points off turnovers benefit both these teams but you cant find a different contrast and personalities Buzz Williams just sprinted from the Baseline all the way to half court when his team got a turnover as Tony Bennett stays seated in his chair calm cool and Collective eight nothing run by Texas AM over the last 2 and 12 minutes pman tried to answer cant from threepoint range and one and done easy defensive board for Coleman effner driving this time couldnt finish with the left but an offensive rebound Coleman working hard in the glass on both ends now Taylor drives three on the way Washington two strong ends up in the hands of Coleman underneath for two there and lies the Achilles Hill for Virginia rebounding the basketball finishing defensive possessions is a challenge for Virginia but even more of a challenge versus this Texas AM team which is one of the best crashing to offensive glass leading division one and theyve got a 10 nothing run right now in part because of those Second Chance opportunities roie gets through the lane wild shot but it drops through nice move by ro recognizing he would have an advantage against Henry Coleman on the perimeter able to get past stumbled a bit but still concentrating to be able to get the hoop Ro a transfer from St Thomas where he was the summer of the summit League freshman of the year a season ago going to the left hand is Hefner but it wouldnt fall out of bounds though going to stay with Texas AM again Virginia having a hard time securing the defensive board now Beakmans going to go to the bench with 416 to go Dave Tony Bennett talked to us about that earlier he knows that Texas AM is going to get some offensive rebounds he does not want his team to hang their head when they do get a offensive rebound but to continue to stay solid defensively as my boy Jay Willie Jason willford the associate head coach of Virginia gets out to clean up the wet spot Im not sure thats part of his job titles but showing that hes willing to do it Applause all oasi bringing it back near midcourt being watched by Leon bond is checked into the game shot clock down to five Hepner sees it launches over mcney and a foul call on Texas AM thats going to go against Garcia his first and the second on Texas AM Coleman how about the fact hes got seven rebounds in Virginia as a team has eight and four of those rebounds offensive rebounds for Henry Coleman getting involved so the majority of his points are Second Chance points and that has been the difference in this game thus far 60 Advantage Texas an in inside four minutes to play here in the first half in Charlottesville Virginia has won 18 of its last 19 games played in this Arena Groves left wide open little rhythm dribble but brick the three and good fight by Bond but Lawrence controls the loose ball and Jake Groves who started the season seven of nine from Beyond a threepoint Arc now one of his last Applause 10 and Virginia two for its last eight while Texas AM is seven for its last 13 AMs offense finally getting going shot clock six and an offensive foul is called here on the drive Lawrence his first Eli Lawrence attacking watch the right arm as he reaches down I think he had a hold of Bonds elbow like that was it official made sure to mention the right arm on the push off on that side when he made the call that was John GNE the official that made the call just one basket in the last five minutes for Virginia and coming over to get the SWAT is L and L the tallest player in the starting line of really the tallest player that Texas AM plays coming up and giving them some type of resistance at The Rim great job by McNeely getting out recognizing way Taylor can shoot it from that far away Taylor spinning kicking oass three not there offensive rebound l lost it but our Virginia foul third team foul its going to be on roie in the active shooting so two free throws for Le they were in shoot around earlier today one of the things that Buzz Williams talked to his team about was they have different plays as far as when they get offensive rebound its such a big thing as part of their offense once they get one if they catch it in the paint they know to go back up if its outside the paint all the shooter space but it was interesting to see how he talked about what they do on the offensive board and coming up at 915 Eastern on ESPN its number seven Duke taking on Arkansas as the ACC SEC challenge continues catch all the action on the app as well got a Timeout on the floor here by Virginia with the Cavaliers trailing Texas AM by two with two and a half remaining in the Music first 13 Virginia about 7 minutes ago and M with one more free throw coming for Le in a twopoint lead yeah the only field goal for Virginia in that last five and a half minutes was the Andrew Roy drive to the basket where he was able to get past Henry Coleman to Third and finish but Tony Bennett understands that his team is going to go through offensive droughts at time but as long as their defense stays consistent they can survive though missed the second free throw and ball batted by Garcia out of bounds but man they are going for every every every time the ball carams off the rim youre seeing an AM player at least get a deflection it feels like and youre seeing the leading offensive rebounder in the country and Anderson Garcia number 11 for Texas AM he is Relentless going after offensive RS and thats going to be a backourt violation great defense that time in that Trap by AM forcing a turnover the fifth by Virginia but how about the Buzz Williams celebration on the side sideline as you look at this as Ro makes the pass get a look at Buzz Williams in the way that he celebrates this backourt violation the 10 seconds Buzz got it in Buzz St in great shape hes leaned out a lot over the last few years changed his diet and got a lot of energy on that sideline thats winning an NCA Tournament game at the buzzer type celebration for a a defensive stop where they force a turnover but thats how important this game is to Buzz Williams he understands the task at hand and where hes bringing his team into hes familiar playing in this building pman able to get to the rim Stu at home to tie the game of 24 nice cut by Reese bman and a beautiful find as miners able to get on the floor hasnt gotten many minutes early in this season playing through a knee injury blocked by dun against pman and now beakman looking to push mcney spots up for three again one and done for Virginia with Carter getting the rebound Ryan Dunn we showed the Virginia stats of what they a top 10 team in blocks have go six blocks a game Ryan D is the leader of that group Coleman nice finger roll in the lane great hands nice catch from from Henry Coleman to be able to finish it off he and Wade Taylor are excellent in pick and roll basketball together Coleman shooting about 75 from the field on the season spin by beakman floater no off the window and its AM ball and then a collision near midcourt Taylor hits the deck just the fourth team foul on Virginia its on Jordan Miner his first and a ways to go before the bonus ree beakman able to get in the painted area you normally see Reese going off of one foot this time going to two feet nice find from roie to be able to see Reese and just slip that ball through a slight opening there allow Virginia to get the easy bucket inside a minutes to play and in possession with a twopoint lead theyre going to put obasi on the ball put Taylor off the ball oasi into the chest of mcney put up an airball and then a battle for the loose ball underneath out of bounds to Virginia as Garcia hits the deck and dun had to continue to box out Garcia all the way until the ball actually hit the floor and became a dead ball thats how Relentless Garcia is but Ryan Dunn recognizing that made sure to keep a body on Garcia not allowing him to come up with another offensive rebound as you see this battle Ryan D you you cant just stop boxing out Texas AM you have to keep a body on them great job by done on that possession McNeil into the lane lost his footing and the ball poked out of bounds oh wow Carter goes into the front row hopefully everybodys okay over there John Grisham just missed theres JN and the the blue sport coat to our left theres a young lady over there and a young gentleman that Carter crashed into but class move there by Jace make sure that theyre okay that gentleman will be one Mr James AKA Jim Walker UVA supporter for a very very long time so Mr Walker putting his body on the line right there hes like yeah I took it in the chest Im good Im good theyre just looking at the clock here is what uh were being told yeah John gaffy letting us know theyre only checking out the shot clock to see if that basketball hit the rim on the Virginia Applause possession so a stay as it is 19 to shoot 34 on the game clock its Virginia ball down two Applause 2624 Virginia picked fourth in the ACC preseason pole behind Duke Miami and North Carolina Miami got hammered last night by Kentucky yeah once it it started you know when it rains it pours Miami hit a fivepoint game at Halftime and then once Kentucky got going there was no stopping him that game of course at rup Arena I think that contest would be a little different if they played on neutral floor bman with three to shoot gives it up to Dun and dun thr a three Virginia has the lead 10 seconds to go and Buzz Williams will take his use it or lose it timeout here two hours before the game Ryan in Lexington here are some other scores Clemson with the upset over Alabama and game going on right now North Carolina by 19 over Tennessee now that is surprising Rick Barnes returning to the dean Dome where he once had a little bit of an altercation with Dean Smith so but you can see the Carolina faithful was ready for Rick Barnes coming back and Hubert Davis had his team ready as well a foul here on McNeely and why not you got fouls to give still one more to give first personal on mcne and a smart foul because Virginias basically trying to scout out what Buzz Williams wants to run coming out of their timeout by using that foul to give they know exactly what the action was heres Hefner 5 Seconds To Go efner penetrates and throws it away 16 seconds remaining in the half a strong defensive stand by Virginia to end the half which should allow them to go into the halftime locker room with the lead so Virginia makes three baskets thats it in the final eight and a half minutes but they had the lead well the defense carries them and they got timely baskets so a huge threepointer from Ryan Dunn to give him the onepoint lead headed into rebounds because we know that they will continue to defend and Virginias done a great job limiting those Second Chance opportunities and Reese beakman who is questionable coming into today was a game time decision played 16 and 1 12 minutes in that first half despite a knee issue he had four points four assists and three steals grows for three and it starts off the second half with a triple great ball movement nice attack by McNeely getting in into the painted area and then kicking it out roie had a choice of Shooters done on the left Groves on the right goes to Groves and that was the right decision so theys six of 12 AM is two for 11 from three Wade Taylor one of three just six points in that first half Carters three no good bat it out but a foul on LC but white Taylor is a 20 point per game score had a 35point game last week but kept in check so far in this nice find by mcney and you see its really three onone as Hefner tries to close out to Groves but a long distance to try to come from to stop a shooter has the ability as Groves does from Beyond The Arc heres Ryan Dunn driving lost it and its Texas AM ball that action is run to be able to give Ryan Dun A driving lane however you see something going on on the backside to be able to open up a clear path him to drive it to the rim just unable to handle the basketball good job by grow over the top getting a deflection but it stays with the Aggies Taylor tries to bounce it inside and its stolen away the fourth steal for beakman but you can see on that day Reese beakman does not have the normal burst that youre used to seeing him thats a play oneonone hes going to attack way Taylor on that one a little ginger on that knee still but doing a great job defensively heres Taylor got a little air space but not even close on the threepoint try he has not taken a shot from inside the ark all of his attempts have been from threepoint range and hes one for four with that air ball and youve got to give Virginias defense a lot of credit for that staying in those gaps because hes a guy that can attack the rim with the best of them heres beakman doing just that getting it the fall and the lead is back to six they had a seven point lead to one point in the first half but Rees beakman not waiting till the end of the shot clock recognizing his team is needing him to be aggressive getting downhill does just that on that possession long two no good from Hayden Hefner and mcne has it for Applause Music Applause Virginia heres beakman Blows By One Defender BS it in back to back buckets for Reese Pigman and its an eightpoint lead for Virginia timeout Buzz Williams Reese beakman getting into attack mode to start the second half attacks finishes over Henry Coleman and then the second time going Baseline takes the contact still the concentration to finish it to the Delight of the Virginia fiing the contact able to finish through contact a little reaction for Reese as he flashes a smile we talked about him as a game time decision today but playing very well on the sore knee and a turnover out of the break by AM dun missed the layup still Virginias on a 10 to nothing run going back to late in the first half they have an eightpoint lead their largest of the game and Ryan dun trying to avoid he on that position Coleman inside dun got the block his second but theyre going to count it Go tending violation count the basket for Henry Coleman yeah Coleman got that one on the glass first Roger As right in position to be able to see that but its also something that the officials can go check out afterwards but you look the ball hits the glass before Ryan Dunn gets a hand on it I believe that will absolutely Applause count and the officials can go look at that during a timeout they dont have to stop game action they can do that during a timeout to go over and check it out and thats what they were telling Tony Bennett cuz Tony wanted them to look at it right now and they were telling him that its something they could take care of during the break which is Applause new 3428 Virginia boy missed Opportunity by dun to get that layup you know you have to treasure every possession in these games and when you get a wide open layup like dun did you cant miss that opportunity and he was thinking he was going to take off he was going to highlight dunk that he give he a lot of credit for sprinting back and really just changing it so they done didnt get the easy dunk shot clock down to five mcne had a couple threes in the first half hes been quiet since timer at two Ro and Ro able to bank it in everything going right for Virginia tonight Ros had a couple of wild shots that have gone in he had 11 the finger roll as he was falling down that he made and now a bank in three with a shot clock at one thats the 73 for Virginia and another AM turnover the 10th for the aies and thats one of the things Virginia has done a great job of in this building this season is forcing turnovers its a part of what Tony Bennett is coaching his team more so this year because he has the athletes like Ryan like Reese beakman both these guys are have great anticipation so they use the turnover as more of a weapon this season than they have in the past four minutes gone by in the second half the lead is a game high nine for Virginia neither team is led by double figures as a foul is called here on AM second team foul its on Wade Taylor thats his first personal no fouls yet on Virginia in the first half Virginia didnt take any free throws AM only attempted Applause Music five neither of these teams foul a lot as mne knocks down the jumper to give Virginia the 11point lead the Texas AM only two points here in the first four plus minutes of the second half mcne with 10 points right at of season average and again Taylor with no room to drive against that great defender in beakman the ACC defensive player of the year last year so Taylor has to put up a long three bodies hit the floor and theyre going to call a foul on Jacob grov greatest point guard to ever grace the grounds of the University of Virginia by the name of dawn Staley you were uh playing pretty well yourself during that period of time oh well she taught me some things my first year was her fourth year she taught me some things around here so by the way they called the double foul as the ball ends up in the hands of beakman and the goal tending call was confirmed so its 3928 Virginia Cavaliers ball and Dave that goal tending thats the only bucket for Texas AM in the second half so Virginia has clamped down defensively RO with a push out off the window and this is the offensive production that Tony Bennett and his staff have been looking for from roie of course he got the bank three to go down which was a little unscripted but theyve been wanting him to be more aggressive on the offensive end average 17 points a game a season to go and a 13point deficit against Virginia probably feels like a 23point deficit they got to start hitting threes if theyre going to come back that was blocked but it ends up right in the hands of Garcia Reese beakman is an elite level shot blocking guard to go along with Ryan Dunn these two guys compete in what they call here stocks combination of steals and blocks and these two guys have a friendly competition going all season long beakman drives up top heres grow for three not that time and rebounded by Solomon Washington again ANM is without Tyrese Radford one of their top scores as Coleman gets two inside hes got 14 points four quick AM points to get back within nine Texas AM got down big to FAU in the semifinal matchup at in Orlando came back and made that a game then they got down 21 against Iowa State in their final game for the third place game in Orlando came back and won that game this team will not go away and Tony Bennett is making sure to let his team know that and to your Point Court that was the largest comeback in school history it was 35 14 at one point in that game mcneel is three in and out and last Touch by AM Groves working hard with three agies right around him and M touch it last its going to be important for Virginia to keep their foot on the gas pedal offensively and checking back in is Elijah gertrud who again was scheduled a red shirt but because of the injury to Dante Harris and they werent sure about beakman gertrud is now playing its going to be a for Virginia to stay aggressive offensively cuz Texas AM can score points in a hurry rooies three no good out of bounds again off of Texas AM thats twice the Virginia is able to at least keep it alive and it was Groves again Leon Bond there as well Leon Bond normally provides a tremendous amount of energy for Virginia coming off the bench has played very well in home games and continues to be a factor on the glass theyre going to call Wade Taylor for five just a second fourth team foul here in the Applause half and Taylors got to be frustrated just one basket on the night and again theres been no driving Lanes at all thanks to re Bean Taylor going to get a little breather here as Bryce Lindsay a freshman from Baltimore averages less than a point per game checks in at a critical juncture here Buzz Williams is not Afra to go deep into the bench tremendous amount of depth on this Texas AM team and hes looking for someone to give him a spark especially on the offensive end shot clock down to three roie penetrates lost it Garcia with good defense and thats going to be a double dribble called on Lindsay so as soon as he checks into the game for Wade Taylor he turns it Applause over Applause Music Jace Carter going to come back in for Texas AM the season average for turnovers for Texas AM is nine and the aies have committed 11 so far four in the second half ninepoint lead for Virginia 4132 12 and 1 half to play and many of those turnovers unforced like the double dribble coming across right there give Virginias defense a lot of credit for forcing some of those mcne tried to drive and fire inside but his pass was errant the eighth turnover by Virginia a double Lindsay out High shot clocked down to seven Carter putting it on the deck has it water Away by gertude out of bounds 44 to shoot for Texas AM Elijah Gert burning the red shirt and getting involved in the mix in his first game coming up with a blocked shot forcing Texas AM into a tough scenario with 44 remaining on the shot clock theyre going to bring in a shooter Hayden Hefner with 44 in the shot clock Washington goes to the Ben wait Taylor staying on the bench for Texas AM good job by roie immediately on hner has to hoist a very difficult three with the shot clock running out and again no offensive rebound opportunities yeah Virginia doing a great job gang rebounding you see all five white jerseys in the painted area every time a shot goes up paying attention to detail trying to keep the Aggies off the glass AM still plus six but minus one on the glass to Virginia here in the second half Ro tried to hit the cutter the pass was too hot to handle virgins had his fair share of turnovers on the last couple possessions as well remember no Rees beakman in the game right now he stalled offensively a little bit continue to turn the basketball over and a tough entry pass as Coleman was trying to get position 12th turnover by ESPN 2 after this one lets get back to Pash and CA 4132 Virginia leading Texas AM its a 4 nothing run for AM but its been over about a 3 minute span and a foul called here second on Eli Lawrence fifth on Texas Applause AM Tony Bennett going back to the majority of a starting lineup getting Reese beakman and McNeely back on the floor as well as Ryan Dunn after seeing three turnovers on the last few possessions for Virginia making sure that they try their best to take care of this lead about Virginia still is not taken a free throw in this game were at the Midway point of the second half three to shoot gerud airball so the shot clock doesnt reset and so a shot clock violation here by Applause Virginia so Henry Coleman for Texas AM has 14 points so the rest of the team has 18 lets see if the yies can get on track from deep and thats been the story for really for this game Virginia seven of 17 from Beyond the threepoint Arc Texas AM two of 17 Virginias done a great job guarding the threepoint line which of course is a weapon for way tailor the four and beakman playing hurt with that knee issue has done a great job defensively going to call a foul here on the dunk attempt by L Gert Deon rise block earlier he is an elite level athlete nice find from Henry Coleman but Elijah gertrud not allowing it and this young man is super exciting Virginia fans are going to love him and I can tell you I dont believe hes back to 100 quite yet towards ACL at the beginning of his senior year in high school last year a college football conference Championship weekend is underway on Friday night with the Pack 12 championship game on ABC or oron in Washington and then Saturday Big 12 title game between Texas and Oklahoma State Louisville Florida State for the ACC Championship at 8 Eastern time it all culminates Sunday at noon Eastern with the exclusive reveal of the final college football playoff rankings on ESPN well know who the top four teams are for the college football playoff before it expands to 12 teams next year a new head coach on the football side for Texas AM Mike Elco who had been a defensive coordinator at one point at AM was a head coach at Duke Virginias lead is down to seven six straight points by AM again over the last four and a half minutes or so and AM did waste any time getting Elco in the mix three is Off the Mark by roie thats the third time in this half we seen a Miss shot by Virginia go out of bounds off of a Texas ANM player but when you look at this Texas AM team theyre not a very tall team so they offensive rebounds so well because theyre Relentless in the way they attack but you can get offensive rebounds against them as well because its not as though they have a huge front line meanwhile Virginias missed five shots in a row pman trying to create some space driving has it blocked by LC second block shot by LC on the evening providing some Rim protection hes the tallest guy on the floor alongside Blake Buchanan driving and a wild shot but theres Coleman with the rebound missed the stick back L got it back and another foul called on the Block attempt great work on the glass by Wilden LC played both South Carolina and UMass before transferring to AM but offensive rebounding Henry Coleman comes up with one levette coming up with another one and gets fouled and now an opportunity to get to the free throw line to make this a fivepoint game if hes able to knock down both that was on Buchan and his second personal foul and we talked about how Virginia started off the second half so well offensively but the offense has stalled for them since and Texas AM has just chipped away at the lead now down to five and you see Buzz Williams is going to pick up the pressure full court to see if they can try to speed Virginia up whos turned the basketball over a bit here in the second half been around six minutes since Virginia last scored nine and a half remaining in the second half roie was really aggressive early in the second half not as much of late Dunn puts it on the deck SES to the rim and smashes it that ends the drought emphatically good ball movement into the hands of Taylor hes still got just one field goal on the night and he averages 20 points per game beakman again driving and theyre going to call a foul here the sixth team foul on Texas AM third personal on Eli Lawrence we watched this action from Tony Bennett earlier in the first half trying to get Ryan done a rim run with the basketball in his hand on the opposite side dun turned it over but you see Virginia running opposite side action to occupy the defense so theres no help to be able to take Ryan D away as he attacks the rim and by the way put his head up around the rim last he got a lot of great athletes on this Virginia team but no question Tony Bennett one of the best coaches in the country theyre going to call a foul here on AM I dont think it was on the shot though so it be a one andone rather than a two shot Applause situation thats four on Eli Lawrence Applause again seventh team foul and it will be a twoshot situation here for Applause dun weve got a great womens basketball lineup for you in ESPN tomorrow Cory already talked about South Carolina rank number one in the country taken on North Carolina from Chapel Hill at 7 Eastern Time Angel ree is back back for LSU didnt play the last four games but she will play as LSU takes on number nine Virginia Tech 9 eastern time my two favorite college basketball coaches Dawn Staley and of course my big brother cousin Kenny Brooks in action tomorrow night Ill be tuned in lock in on both those games meanwhile here Virginia scored the last four points to go up nine eight and a half to go Lawrence almost turned it over but theyre going to call a foul here on roie Buzz Williams and official James breeding AC ly collided everybodys okay 14 foul in Virginia Tony Bennett will applaud this effort by Roy getting up and then going after a loose basketball the foul you dont care much about that because of course Virginia is nowhere close to the bonus but he likes the effort defensively trying to guard his yard a re be into spite playing banged up has done a tremendous defensive job on Taylor its a first twopoint attempt for Taylor and it wasnt even close but an offensive rebound it didnt hit the rim so the shot clock doesnt reset the timers at four Lawrence letting it Fly good on the three finally AM gets one to Applause fall and the aies back within six at the 8minute Applause Mark Rose will try to answer and do second three ball this half for Jacob BR 83 for Virginia just three for Texas AM including the last time down the floor gr gross inserted back into the starting lineup hes a better shooter as a starter I know that very well I was the same way but seven for nine as a starter from three and struggled until he got back in the starting lineup here tonight and knocks down a huge one to give Virginia a ninepoint lead Applause Scott cancer research fund honor Stewarts Legacy by Warden grants the scientists who are addressing racial disparities in cancer outcomes and providing opportunities to researchers from diverse backgrounds ESPN and the V Foundation are proud to support this Fund in Stewarts honor you can support as well by visiting vorg Stewart Dave pass and Cory Alexander in Charlottesville as Henry Coleman now 16 points and 10 rebounds singlehandedly keeping Texas AM in this game considering the agies have only made one three this half and Buzz Williams often times goes to Henry coma coming out of timeouts with a similar set Henry takes advantage of it on that possession Groves inserted into the starting lineup tonight because of some injuries by Tony Bennett that move has paid off hes got 10 points they go back to Coleman hes doubled and he throws it into the third row 13th turnover by Texas AM the post trap is another staple of this Virginia Defense that time Henry Coleman whos handled the post trap relatively well made a number of nice finds that time you bring size to be able to get rid of get the basketball out of Colemans hands threw that one a little too high to the opposite Applause wing and again just the job defensively Virginias done on Wade Taylor just two games ago he had 35 points the team right now is 41 and theyre used to averaging about 80 a game roie on the drive missed it tried the bank shot Buzz Williams told us earlier today he knows what its going to be like playing in this game is like a rot Canal another block by Dunn theres some contact there as well Taylor got hit in the face but may have just been accidental as they were trying to get to the loose ball that was a great play by Ryan Dunn though that looked like an easy two for Henry Coleman and Dunn out of nowhere just denies that opportunity well Above the Rim Dunn has had a really good overall game beakman on the Baseline shot clock at eight hangs in the air timer at four Murray nice pass inside and the basket for Groves as the buzzer sounds and Buzz will call a timeout the deficit once again at 11 Virginia does not panic at the end of a shot clock they stay calm they stay composed and even as the shot clock wears down to the end theyre able to get a bucket a great pass from tame Murray that allows Jacob Groves to get an easy bucket but the recognition by grows to keep the basketball high and just get it up on the glass is an elite level basketball IQ chance at an upset here with Virginia leading Hower and his ability to shoot because of course when you got Shooters around you it takes attention away as Reese beakman almost comes up with another steal hes got three in the game a Miss three by Jace Carter and off the leg of lavac out of bounds AM is three for 20 from dve but even more impressive for Virginia defensively is when AM has gotten offensive rebounds the way they walled up that was the 14th offensive rebound for Texas AM but they only have eight forgive me 14 Second Chance points so theyre not able to really capitalize on those that they normally do at a high rate pakman was wide open under the basket throws back out there some tape adjacent to that right eye where he was cut shot clock at five Brody hoisting and hitting at three Applause and H nine threes tonight after eight the previous two games combined and Ros been a Difference Maker in this game for Virginia as Reese bman comes up with another block shot two blocks three steals for ree bman one block two steals for Ryan dun these are called stocks and Andrew Ro stock is rising as he knocks down the three ball on the offensive end of the floor and the accs reigning defensive play of the Year shows the SEC preseason play of the Year exactly why he was named that a season ago I dont know if the Ovation was for that or if it was for one of the ushers who is going nuts celebrating the great Hustle by Virginia Im going to go with the Usher L drives has it poked Away by dun is a 14point deficit against Virginia with five minutes to go too much to overcome they got to get stops first and then at some point they got to start hitting some shots from the outside but it would seem like quite the challenge here for AM on the Applause road throw got the offensive rebound but couldnt hit the putb after the Murray Miss 7 nothing run by Virginia its got to start happening first AM Coleman focked Again by D if my Tally is correct now that is three block shots forgive me four blocks for Ryan Dunn to go along with his two steals so he is overtaken the stocks lead once again from Reese beakman who has five stops nothing has come easy at all for AM thats the closest look that Wade Taylor has had all night at the basket its just his second field goal in his first twopointer lead is 12 four minutes to go McNeely up top no good good look for mcne a little early in the shot clock probably for Tony Bennett but when you get a shooter like that number five and every block is a punch I mean he is spiking the ball on every single rejection but when youve got defense behind you like this you dont worry about a quick shot ree beakman with the block shot Ryan done with five on the evening in Virginia getting it done defensively ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball presented by Continental Tire the smart choice in tires yeah D originally I was on my way to Georgia Tech I was actually on my visit here at Virginia when Travis best committed its actually in Bobby kermans book Bobby wrote about that a long time ago but Perry Clark knows that story very very well Virginia with a 12point lead three and 1 half to go Texas AM three of 20 from three Taylor trying to push it inside and dun forces another turnover hes got five blocks two steals dont know if that will go down as a steal but they forced 15 turnovers as a team yeah you talk about the five blocks Ryan dun had seven steals against Florida so hes had so many games this year and throughout his career where he Pro continues to provide that energy and effort but more minutes for him this season has increased the production in all the other categories I think grow is bleeding again thats why the officials stop STP time yep hes got blood all over his Applause jersey dont know if theyll be able to patch that up though within the 30 second time frame where you have to make a decision well able to do it well done the best in the business Im telling you my man e Ean CA the thats in the business if it can be done hell do it we talk about pressure there youre trying to close out a game you got to get him Ted up and ready to go Ethan has been doing this for 30 plus years but I think they got to figure out he still has blood all over his jersey so I think theyre going to make him exit and and get another Applause Jersey either that or somehow make it look like there isnt Blood on the Jersey anymore which theyll try and do shot clock at four deep three McNeely that might have been the dagger had that gone down and again in a normal game AM scores almost 80 points per game this is not an insurmountable deficit although that certainly will help in a game against Virginia its always harder to come back down 12 a 3 minutes go it feels like youre down 20 but now with a clock stop you get a chance at three free throws second time Taylors been fouled by beakman shooting a three and you will see that on the Jumbotron everyone here concerned about the fact that Taylor kicked his legs out they dont feel that thats part of his natural shooting Applause motion and Taylor the best free throw shooter in the SEC last year misses the first goes to the step back that right leg absolutely comes out thats not part of his natural shooting Applause motion you you dont sneak anything past this crowd especially with these uh huge Jumbotron screens up here one on each side for everyone to see two underneath Ro checks back in one out of three so an opportunity to get points with the clock stopped and Wade Taylor who last year shot 88 from the line a School record misses two big ones here Thats a classic case of ball on lie a pass and probably was not F heres dun theyll get on the three rebound Coleman still down only 11 but with two and a half to go that has to go down it does for Carter he was three for 19 from three coming into the game so again they still are within Striking Distance down eight nearing two minutes to go and this Virginia team only shooting 667 from the free throw line that could be something thats a factor late in this game if Texas AM had to play the foul game pakman fouled its the eigh team foul so itll be a one and one for bman only two free throws have been attempted by Virginia Ryan Dunn and so itll be beakman 69 on the year at the line shooting two it was bman and Dunn that sealed the win against West Virginia going to the free throw line last time out for Applause Virginia and he gets the front end of the one and one the only returning starter from last years 25 win team the Reese beakman of course tested the NBA Waters the best news Tony Bennett received on his birthday June 1st was that Reese beakman was coming back to school so a great birthday present for Tony Bennett and playing through a knee injury tonight terrific game on both ends another deflection deflection by beakman there are no passing Lanes there are no driving Lanes at all for Wade Taylor and meanwhile Carter is injured and Buzz Williams not happy with the officials thought there should have been a foul on Virginia none was called Buzz Williams trying to to get James breedings attention comes on to the floor to hold his guy Applause up theyre going to go to the monitor to see if there was anything flagrant no personal foul was called but Jace Carter in considerable pain and being held back to the Texas AM locker room and Buzz Williams recognizing that came to the court to grab his player who he saw in significant Applause Music pain so were also trying to figure out exactly where and when it happened so heres Carter there and see the contact with roie and theres nothing flagrant there it wasnt even a foul immediately grabs that right shoulder trying to attack on offensive rebound and I like the conversation between James breeding and Buzz Williams Because Buzz Williams did interrupt play yep however I love the officiating by not attacking anything on to that because Buzz is caring for one of his guys you see one of your players in pain you want to help them as quickly as you possibly can I I like the the officiating by James breeding on that one not calling any technical fouls no none of that and if there was something flagrant the officials of course dont want to miss that either right 90 seconds to go Virginia ball down 10 the lob the done Off the Mark but right to roie missed the shot Texas AM ball Taylor skip pass over the head of OAS and out of bounds for the 16th Texas AM turnover our player of the game brought to you by Continental Tire sophomore Andrew roie so many different players to choose from for Virginia throughout this gam it could have been done or beakman of course but they did what they normally do jaob Grove stepped up off the bench I mean forgive me in the starting lineup today but in my opinion it was Andrew roie Who provided the spark for Virginia especially to start the second half offensively you go back and you look at the bank threepointer and then his ability to be able to make shots didnt shoot it great but close to doubling his scoring average on the season the high for him coming into this game have been seven points 13 for him tonight more importantly being aggressive offensively one more free throw for beakman the lead is 11 five players in double figures including Ro and AM basically with as many turnovers as field goals in this game and they did not have Tyrese Radford they certainly missed him but Henry Coleman back Virginia play without Dante Harris beakman as we mentioned playing through injury so both teams dealing with some ailments and Virginia is going to come out on top its a great win for Tony Bennetts team theyve held opponent under 70 points now here at home in 46 consecutive games one of the best home court advantage advantages in college basketball here in Charlottesville and again when you consider 79 points is the average for Texas an and theyre one of the top offensive teams in the country held to 47 by Virginia tonight rebound Music grows Virginia with ACC chance from fans behind us knockoff number 14 Texas AM 5947
