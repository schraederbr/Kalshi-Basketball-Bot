this is a Georgia Tech team that only plays somewhere between six to eight healthy bodies the old beheim special I was going say some teams are trying to figure out what to do with six bodies and I looked at you and said now thats like Tuesday yeah thats a regular Tuesday I mean listen it may seem like guys are out here getting tired but you know what I mean theyre out there competing hes putting his best five on the floor at all times I cant meanwhile Cal has 22 on the roster heres staka McDonalds AllAmerican with three on the shot clock and he does get one off around and out the rebound down to dungo thats a thats a tough shot by him his teammates got to help him out and come to the ball Lance Terry back in the lineup for Georgia Tech today he was out with a hand issue in the last game so again talk about the dwindling and rotating numbers theres Terry zero and white Duncan Powell throws that to somebody yeah they had a uh they had a they had big they had a a mismatch down low that Wilkinson got caught up on the center and they triy to get him the ball but you know it was the pass was thrown off a little bit try to get it to uh Dongo playing really really well Ive been super impressed with his play of of late hes been a big spark for this Georgia Tech Team having a battle it down low against Mar Soko today along with sto yakovich and Wilkinson we talked about in the starting five rebound Dongo got beat to it and that stays here with Cal dangos got his money cut out for him today Cal is one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the country not just by numbers theyve missed a lot of shots so theres been opportunities but by percentage Yeah Rus is a guy thats always crashed in the glass he he does the little things for Cal hes getting offensive rebounds hes making hustle plays so it its got to be some hes got to be a guy that you look at and say we need to take him away and Wilkinson has the lid lifter its on the board coming off a loss at Duke hey you know Wilkinsons going to try to have a game tonight hes in front of front of his hometown his family um you know happy to see you know his supporters here and Powder Springs Georgia about 20 minutes away yeah you get his familys making some real noise behind me I can hear him already Terry with three on the shot clock Terry against Wilkinson and he missed front iron rebound down to sto yakovich Wilkinson thought that was going up hes hes super aggressive man I love to see it petrius rejected Suare and chasing into the back court that is a Georgia Tech ball in all of the moving bodies for the yellow jackets this year Damon STM said that young man has taken the most Advantage yeah I mean that was a great block hes hes definitely cleaning up in the paint uh big praise from coach St what changes for you when you go from a a 10minute guy to a 25minute guy I think you know when you get 10 minutes in the game you show different spurts of what you could be right and then you you start to build on those minutes and you get those 25 minutes you start to relax a little bit in the team you find your Rhythm a little bit you really can show you know what you can do out there shot clock inside 10 heres George for the first time and were even up at two thats a tough pull up right there for Nate George getting him going early is key for this Georgia Tech Team and doing it again with the shot clock winding down both teams playing a lot of Defense early and he let the bench know about it one for their first four here for Cal little floater rebound pulled down Soko tra good offensive rebound just shuffled the feet a little bit love the hustle though you can take those turnovers Mark Madson in his second year is the head coach 10year vet with the Lakers and Timberwolves well talk about it today uh the NBA is all over this game between David STM and Mark Madson and we got a Marberry and a Matumbo yeah its its awesome to see you know the the the ex players of the NBA and then the offsprings coming in hooping in college its its a its a great for for basketball kicked on a back door bounce like how old are you well start talking about peoples kids playing in college basketball exactly ston STM the Mighty Mouse Mighty Applause Mouse heres Suare air ball caught and the put back leads to a foul Dongo is headed to the line right time yeah told me to tell you that that was actually a high low pass to to Dongo just looked like a shot Derek Wittenberg is actually his mentor there it is yeah fouls on Rus petritis you never threw any of those Music no Dango averaging 12 a game the sophomore out of Sagal hes been great lately though yeah like I was going to say like I said before hes been playing unbelievable lately last four I mean look at his stats 1511 three double doubles but again you talk about a guy starting to find his footing because of the injuries Georgia Tech has 12 guys on their roster averaging double figure minutes because theyve had to plug in play hes playing more and more and hes getting more and more comfortable yeah it was it was like a you know it was a little bit of a a gift and a curse for them right it hurts obviously it hurts them for having their guys go out but theyve had a a guys really step up and show that you know we they can play this game of basketball and its really credit to coach uh ster with the next man up mentality stovic he has struggled shooting lately and that was a very dramatic point to the sky after that one went down yeah he he had two his palms up to the sky like where have you been about time but good to see Steel by wi hey with the twoand flush at the Music crib welcome home I cant tell if that was the bench getting excited next to us or the Wilkinson Family behind us yeah its a little bit of both I mean theyre theyre practically in my microphone at this point Applause Wilson mismatch knocks it away from Dongo blacker running good recognition to pull it out yeah smart play to pull it out great pass petritis off the heel rebound Georgia Tech and Duncan Powells going to slow it down what a name that is rtis ptis I mean you got to theres certain in your life you have to do when you got a name like that yeah being a great athletes one of them yeah rebound put back underneath for Suarez petritis is 31 in blue little brotherly shove once he ran into Suare down in the lane there this is going to be physical yeah its a physical game this far both teams are really digging in on the defensive end and battling on the glass little ducking travel takes us to the under 16 but its Wilkinson letting us know Im from Georgia and Im home and Im home and he gets a steal right here takes it off the bounce two hand flush letting him know Im back baby two hands Applause Music play re will up Georgia Tech playing really well as of late winners in three out of their last four starts to get the train right in here theyre now 6 and eight in conference and knocking on the door of a first day Buy in the ACC tournament Michael Carter Williams what impresses you about this team I just love the grit that they play with right when when things get close and and and things get you know mucked up theyre theyre theyre always the team that can get that loose ball and get that offensive rebound um you know in in in close games they got guys that come up really big and and I love watching that about Jordan Tech whats crazy too they are favored in four of their final six games they have by win percentage the easiest remaining schedule in the ACC very sneakily could be a team that winds up in the top third of the conference yeah I I dont I I dont see why not right I mean they theyve got great talent on this team they got guys that are hot at the right moments um their schedule lines up for that right their schedules not super tough um you know they have every indication to you know sneak up in that that upper third the tricky part Javen McCullum Luke OBrien colossi Reeves all out today are expected back at some point how does that play with your Chemistry down the stretch well they they they got some homework to do right they they got a little bit of a feel out process to to to go through um but you know Im sure coach coach statamire will handle that Im sure its its a good problem to have right and you just have too many talented guys coach yeah hes got one of them checked in for the first time Daren Sutton 10 in white middle of the lane played 56 minutes the last two games because of injury for freshman out of overtime Elite here in Atlanta shot clock inside 10 thought that was about to be a deep three from Wilson instead its a car crash and the shot clocks at three and did looks like some contact there but maybe he got all ball and it was a strong take 3 seconds on the shot clock they got 3 seconds to get a good look off here Christian Tucker checks in 22 in blue statistically the best threepoint shooter for Cal DJ Campbell as well three in blue bottom left corner yeah ideally they get a Stak let him create a little bit surprised he put that in his pocket and still gets the runner off one leg I didnt even think he knew how much time was I think he heard the bench Scream 3 21 he still got it off he shot faked and realized what the situation was he has the defensive assignment now on must takes over the point guard duties from Nate George at the moment feed it inside and a big man bucket by Dongo is playing great thats a strong move I mean if if they keep switching that pick and roll action that thats going to be there all night Tech still down by Applause two sto yakovich running the point yes the son of Paia he is at every Cal game at home and that ball is out of bounds dont let that impact what his talent is three turnovers now for c yeah C Cal needs to focus on taking care of the ball and just getting quality shots its thats such an underrated thing in in in basketball nowadays just getting a shot up right taking care of the ball making sure that youre getting the same amount of tempts as the other team is so important its funny Damon STM said in shoot around today theres a lot of Shooters there arent a lot of scorers in basketball today thats very true right guys that can just purely put the ball in the bucket heres mustaf a little bit too strong tip up pulled down by Campbell Cal running Tucker Cant hold on to it its the idea that like there are guys that are comfortable putting it up but do you have the Moxy to go get the points when you need them right and that thats thats important right the getting the buckets when your team needs them um at specific times I I think thats what Damon St is talking about and it its so essential in this game what was the process for you to go get points excuse me what was the learning process for you to go get points for me I I love getting out on the break I think getting on the break getting a rebound and pushing the ball and getting to the rim or or finding a guy out at the threepoint line right I always used to start by trying to get into the paint and look for guys you know on the perimeter so that the next time I drove you know I I could you know use my pace and then get to the rim five turnovers trying to get out on the break for DJ Campbell yeah you know I I think its Cal is really they get theyre getting out on the break oh what a monster rebound that was he got up there Dango tried the paint to paint pass and its C Cals doing a great job of getting out of the break now they just got a capitalize right they they have numbers and they they just keep turning over the ball just being a little Smarter with the ball um you know on their fast breaks and you know they could uh that that wow look at that Sky elbows at The Rim inside P yes the Shag thats his hairstyle by the way its a Dallas thing its great with the headband cuz it looks like hes wearing a wig yeah I it looks like it all comes in one the headband plus the Shag has the rebound and he pulls it back Pals the transfer from Sacramento State played his first year at North Carolina AT jumper mustaf missed short gross thats gross coach Georgia Tech four for its first 10 Cal Four for 11 deadlocked at Applause n turn around dorz in the Vanderbilt transfer with his first bucket I like that move over the right shoulder you can tell he works on that just a simple dribble drive to the middle of the paint a little shimmy and get the ball up over the left the right shoulder ball deflected by Campbell upset at himself that all he got was a deflection thought he had a steal georia Tech down by two at home Music one Music for Music Music for Music Music Music Music Music Music Music do not adjust your television screens those are the California Golden Bears here in Atlanta Georgia record coming east of the Mississippi since 2010 3 and 19 we wont say anything about that win over Syracuse that was after you left and were rebuilding as long as we dont talk about it were good yeah Mark Madson was pretty Frank about it though he said NBA travel is not as difficult as what his team has had to go through because its been frequent trips out east and for short amount of times as opposed to those kind of week long trips yeah I when were tra when we used to travel out west you know it used to be you know a week and a half where we wed hit you know the wed hit the Sacramento uh Clippers Lakers maybe see Portland you know travel to Denver so its a long period of time when were down there I cant imagine going you know across the country for a short amount of time to play a game thats rough a lot of these guys have online classes some have inperson classes theyve got their study breaks but no joke at either one of these schools when it comes to academics so a lot of time effort energy goes into it all foul is going to go against Cal Mark Madson also told us that they brought in two sleep scientists one from NASA wow to focus on how they can deal with those time changes part of the reason they didnt shoot around today because an 830 am shoot around feels like 530 am Pacific try to keep your Rhythm normal yeah I mean beheim was never a fan of shoot arounds either we never had shoot around though any time that I was there um he just thought that sleep was just more important and uh Im not mad at him for it you know when I got to the NBA and we had shooter around I was like what is this I was like we got to get up early whats going Applause on Wilkinson little step back and the rebound pulled down by Georgia Tech I tell you though even though Cal didnt shoot around woke up doing all right here early feed it inside Dongo scores we are ti hey man every time the ball gets into to Dongo its something successful I think Georgia Tech needs to really prioritize it getting him the ball down there 69 240 lbs just a sophomore in this era of transfers and Cal is made up almost entirely of them four of Georgia Techs biggest players are homegrown yeah I think theres something to be said about that right like you know putting a bunch of guys together you know from that that have transferred is tough to do right if you got guys that are playing with each other I mean when I was playing over at Syracuse our our team chemistry because of the year before was so good that the guys our new guys just came in and kind of just followed suit so not having that is tough now the great irony is that one of the transfers just buried that three L thats also thats also help rebound offensive right back up with it and an airball from Ola Joseph and he was fouled its on Jayden mustaf for his first yeah I mean you could tell by Ola Josephs reaction there was some contact there I couldnt see it from my angle but you know the immediate reaction looked like there was some contact there see if we can see it on the replay still cant see its tough to see youre getting the same look as mustaf cuz hes peered up at the board although they get the foul on Powell May was a slap down couldnt see oh well dont lie though thats what they say next Saturday mens basketball triple header on the ACC Network it is Georgia Tech and BC starts the day at two Eastern followed by Chase hunter in 23rd ranked Clemson in Dallas against SMU and then Virginia Tech Miami capts that triple header second meeting between BC and Georgia Tech that was a yellow jackets winner here back in December and Ola Joseph misses both and the way they cheered I I have to check Im assuming everybody gets some sort of free chicken tenders I was going to say is it ChickfilA is it chicken tenders what were we eating tonight tater tots tater tots some fries get that out of the way early Shake Shack there it is the Shake Shack Burgers and milkshakes man get to going in college and one thatll get you going also Nate George is a scorer now listen Nate George is getting hes getting buckets nowadays hes letting the world know like listen I dont just pass the ball I could tween in and out pull up on the dot and one give me three the oldfashioned way awesome recognition with M Soko on him 69 240 just put the little move on yeah just get him going get him leaning on you a little bit and then know a quick pull up um you know he he really ate up that space in between him and his Defender tell hes good at that he tried to do it one one time earlier in the game didnt get the call for it but this time he got the call and immediately goes into the full court pressure I love it six points largest lead here for Georgia Tech largest for either team Wilkinson was great early in his homecoming here zero and blue yeah Cals really struggled in the half court offense right when they get out on the break theyre a lot better team but in the half court offense they have a little bit of trouble with his long toal tech team for to shoot oh yeah excuse me DJ Campbell is a 21 threepoint shooter just got to put the pressure on yeah just got to tell them that theyre not doing well in the half court offense and theyll start sparking he just broke out of a three for 24 Funk with that well now four for 25 foul on Cal on black Shir the switching for Cal is giv them trouble Man Down Low theyre getting taken advantage of and then on the on the when they switch on the guards their their bigs are just leaning on the guards and it for Georgia Tech so theyve been successful lets see if they still been able to keep that up sakovic had a chance to get on the break instead opens the door for Duncan poell Duncan pow making plays creating something out of nothing there but now he gets settled in the half court and physicality is bugging Cal sto yakovich in the lane and the rebound Georgia dech what happens when teams are more physical when they make it hard fore to operate well you just got to start locking in a little bit more right use that aggression against them right get to the line a little bit get them to soften up their defense George another triple get call time yeah get him the call timeout but yeah you know I I think to relieve relieve pressure you you attack them and you be strong and you try to get to the Lane here goes Nate George with a Trey Ball man he said listen I score the rock now watch out St e e e e Applause the accs committee for racial and social justice in conjunction with its member institutions have identified February 13th to the 23rd as ACC Unity week as part of the initiative members of Cal and Georgia Tech teams joined one another on the court to demonstrate that their commitment to seeing each other as equals and treating each other with respect and dignity at all times recognizing that our differences dont divide us but instead make us stronger back here in Atlanta where Georgia Tech has opened up a 133 run and its all about Dongo and George these two guys sophomores and a solid future yeah real solid future for this Georgia Tech basketball team I mean these two guys have been unbelievable the the the scoring that theyve both been able to do um Dongo on the re uh the rebounding end Nate George just you know really facilitating this whole offense and getting buckets George right now has the defensive assignment on jovon black Shir top of your screen shot loock inside 10 kick out Wilkinson misses long rebound ripped down by Suare talk about recruiting in this day and age though I mean you were Player of the Year in Rhode Island everybody knew who Michael Williams was Nate George had no offers his uncle is Jamal Murrays agent knows Damon STM good kick and Terrys three short cold STM hey I got this guy for you to take a look at takes a flyer turns into your best player yeah I mean the luck that you know you get from that is is is crazy you know its funny you spend all this time recruiting guys like you said earlier right and then you just get the the one guy thats now the best player on your team team uh just falls into your lap turns it over there black shirt back into George good job to deny petritis with the caram they needed that friendly roll petritis is living right my man and give him a three draws it back to within five I dont know if it takes the stress out of it or adds stress into it in the recruiting process right nice move by Powell maybe got away with the travel and a foul on the rebound well if he did travel ball dont lie it was an air ball yeah he smoked that one he should have finished that one I wish he knows he uh wishes he had that one back howw checks Applause out fou was the first on Sutton freshman out of overtime Applause Music Elite six to go here in the first petrius again yes backto back triples cows back in the game one possession difference Rus ptis is getting his team hype two backto back threes big shots for the big fell Junior can score averaged 16 a game last year at Air Force yeah you can put the ball on the hoop hes got hes hes not lacking any confidence Ill tell you that three to answer Dongo has a response now Dongo starts hitting that we might not see him in a Georgia Tech uniform next year he has eight 69 240 Let it Applause Fly active hands he his arm Sutton reaching around from behind getting a great opportunity as a freshman yeah you know its its you know like I said its a its a blessing in disguise a little bit when you got guys hurt and you got hungry guys on the bench itching for some minutes that finally get it now theyre going out there and playing as hard as they possibly can for youer beauty of sports shot clocks inside 10 Campbell trying to break down Terry he does campells feeling it today got two very swaggy buckets a bunch of swaggy buckets out here still a one possession game George has eight for Georgia Tech has some space p trus gave him too much my man is feeling it and I love it too after every single bucket both teams are letting the other team know we are here Nate George is going to be a problem that guy is one of the best assist men in the the ACC and he can score also has the foul 21 a game over the last five and because of the injury is a lot out of necessity thats a meme hes got 11 here 13 straight games in double figures for the sophomore Wilkinson comes in late and theyll switch out the guy that is on George here as blacker comes Music Applause out might need to think about doubling Nate George off that pick and roll instead of just switching out floater down the lane offensive rebound put back sooko no still ping ponging and finally Suare comes out with it and a late reach Ted Valentine underneath with the call Clarence Armstrong and Adam Fior the rest of our crew thats a tough call right Applause there Rus is not happy about it looking forell B Pok the ball a little bit second on petrius yeah comes out yeah well see him in the second half all right what happens if they set the pick and roll here they will probably switch but theyre trying to deny Nate George the ball right now yeah we didnt even get that far George commanding so much attention that Dango can just go to work Ill tell you this he is showing an array of moves that NBA Scouts would love if he can knock down the outside shot hes putting it on the dribble a little bit we know he can score in the post thats a NBA NBA Talent right there nice kick Ola Joseph no rebound to soo and weve got a whistle as he pulled it down that goes against Georgia Tech thats going to be two on Nate George so see if George stays in or if we see him in the second half his teams up by Music eight e he yeah Georgia Tech in a really good position at this point up by eight and its two guys doing most of the work yeah I mean the two guys that going into the game you know you need to stop right Nathan George and Dongo you know those two guys have been the heavy load for this team and theyre coming out balling today two sophomores who have made tremendous growth points and strides and a whole lot extra has been put on their shoulders because of the injury situation for Georgia te turn around jumpers good for myty Soko great play out of the timeout first bucket for the Cal big man Damon STM said one of the fun things about this season has been trying to create the puzzle moving guys around see how they do with different roles see how different guys Blossom George Well short on the three but a rebound right back up Dongo another rebound rejected with a foul yeah see that that thats thats that switch right there you got Dongo on a on a guy you know whos a lot smaller than him and um he gets the rebound theyre in good position right Campbell was guarding him on that possession on the switch Dango us his size and his length to get the the rebound and get back to the free throw line so yakovich is stunned that he was called for that foul Dongo at the line is a 61 Music shooter 12th rank Tar Heels highlight our Thursday night ACC womens basketball double header Alissa usby leads Carolina against Georgia Woolly and Syracuse the Buffalo transfer thats at 6 Eastern and then Carly wsel in Virginia Tech hosting nno Agera in Stanford should be another great night of Hoops Georgia wooly having a career year can pull off the upset for the Orange lets hope us to go out to the doome and support the ladies I know I need I need to get back to the uhoh Al Al to coko I like that set whatever that was they got to go back to that oh makes it a sixpoint game and mon Soko has the last four for California look at I love how theyre denying George ball make it tough for him anything he does just make it hard for him DJ Campbell bottom of your screen has that assignment its a five on four matchup right now mustaf is open though and he buries the three Georgia Tech makes them pay that was a great play by Lance Terry just getting in the lane finding the open guy I would love to see Lance Terry step up a little bit more right kind of be that be that glue guy be that guy that defends gets in the lane makes plays uh kind of like Zachary for Soko wide open for a Dunkey has six straight for Cal give it to the big fella let him work Michigan State transfer and the senior from moli cow coming out a little two3 and now hows Georgia Tech going to adjust you know the two3 quite well I do get the ball in the middle thats thats thats the plan or in the corner Powells three no rebound Applause camp Oh find 12 in blue right now pick and roll instead sto yakovich Soko drew the attention though its stovic with the triple yes hes doing a great job a rolling to the rim you know he scored the last three or four times down now he got the defense collapsing on him and you got sakovic out for the three fourpoint game Cal is right back in in this thing rocking the rim Soko Soko sakovic doing what his daddy taught him Music fourpoint game Mar Soko six points six rebounds six straight points for the California Golden Bears as well thought it was funny listening to the guys on Wednesday night when now was at Duke and Tyrese Proctor asked the Duke coaching staff is this the same mon Soko that we played at Michigan State cuz he looks like a different guy and Mark Madson told us this morning we take pride in finding guys that are maybe underutilized in the transfer portal and they think Soko has a continued ceiling even though hes at the end of his eligibility yeah I mean thats a great Niche to have right seeing potential talented guys that maybe arent getting the necessary opportunity giving them that opportunity and coaching them to their potential um is special as a coach wow what a great set by d d still wants to be in this big man mix though yeah thats what Im saying hes so versatile right hes hes a a 69 34 man um that can that can catch the ball on the post and and finish down there but also play a little bit out in the perimeter 14 points for Dongo good ball movement finds an open three Spencer Mahoney wazu transfer and Lee Dort doesnt like that that went out of bounds off Applause Applause here be it inside Dongo again if it works it works yeah hey if its St broken dont fix it keep going if youre cow though how do you stop it yeah you got to swe you got to either bump on the pick and roll like right if youre going to switch and you got a guy thats a center right or or you got a big down there you you kick the guard out so you you take as as a big you take the the other big roll into the hoop and then you kick the guard out to the perimeter well the best threes they say come off of offensive rebounds and Wilkinson now has seven for Cal and the shot clock is off for Georgia Tech here they go get one Im sure theyre going to oh theyre back in the Cals back in the two three Zone done such a great job denying Nate George he has the ball here the thing is I dont know if you want to force him to give it up thats what he does best theyre going man George does give it up inside and a foul Suare goes to the line Nate George is a problem yeah hes a problem in the pick and roll man cuz hes got you know hes a taller guard hes got that Vision you can see here coming off the pick and roll pretending like hes going to shoot the shoot the pull up and then finds his big fella rolling to the hoop to get to the free throw line it just seems like he has everything clicking for him right hes making the right decisions hes shooting when hes supposed to shoot hes passing when hes supposed to pass hes being a true PG out there first free throw for Suare hes only a 29 shooter coming up on the auto owners insurance halftime ort weve got your analysis and update from Durham and then story lines from around the ACC Duke number three in the top 16 released today by the committee and 0 for two rebound to Dort and with a final second Wilkinson gives the crowd a souvenir fiveo difference at the break we got a game here folks getting buck tonight theyre playing team Music basketball Georgia Tech basketball to begin the second half and its George a screen and an air ball and out of bounds that goes to Cal unceremonious beginning yeah uncharacteristic of Nathan George um he Im sure hell sure that ones out the window and hes on to playing a better game next play mentality right he and indongo were eight for 11 at one point in the first half he cant make them all yeah I mean but if you you let the two best players on the team go eight for 11 blackshire misses the corner three and the rebound pull down by and Dango oh its the lob this time Dongo couldnt control it nice pass across the paint draws the foul even when it doesnt go right it goes right yeah exactly I mean listen the balls rolling to them tonight its been like that for a couple plays make George Through the Alley little little too high should have just you know put it close to the rim catch and finish foul on sto yakovich is his second we talk about that pick and roll oh its George to Dango out for a three to Powell buries it Pals been shooting the ball well hes been really essential in this starting lineup as he as he used to come off the bench and now hes the starting lineup hes been a big help for this Georgia Tech Team I think its got to be because of the Shag it it comes with a certain amount of confidence yeah you got to have you know you got to have confidence you got to have some swag to pull that off his hairstyle by the way if youre at home never seen it before never seen the Shag before shot clock is at five black shirt got around George little midrange game rebound Dongo and hes fouled this guys going to have a double double by the under 16 its his eighth rebound hes hes on the glass and listen Rus got to stop filing 99 feet away from the hoop man hes hes essential to his team he cant keep picking up silly ones I mean move the ball youre going to find open people yeah I mean these two guys Dongo and Nate are are acquiring a lot of attention on the court so hes going to have spot up shooters that are Music open Cs going in this two3 now team made 16 shots in the first half Georgia Tech 11 of them were either made or assisted by one or 11 George and dungo yeah I mean they theyre high power in this offense man shot clocks already inside 10 aggressive and a call thats an offensive foul but thats how you guard these guys right mix them up a little bit get underneath them make it tough for them get a charge here right like you got to play mind games with these offensive players that are really good rusy takes it right in the chest say if youre at home wondering how to play defense guard with your chest guard with the chest good inside Wilkinson nine in his homecoming from the Georgia Atlanta suburbs man dides he attack the ram agression hes got people here to see him today hey hes got a show Terrys open pinned down couldnt hit the three all right Cal has made some adjustments here defensively downhill Wilkinson slips out saying that his arm was hint looks like he got the call its going to be the three on Nate George yeah he he cant get in foul trouble he cant pick up an early one for a couple reasons uh one they dont have enough people to play exactly you know they only play five and a half dude so and then two obviously is hes hes the best guy only seven have played for Georgia Tech they only really have 6 to8 on any given night 51 games lost to injury by critical players this season thats tough the injury bugs going around there usually its the flu this time of year yeah but now if youre Cal if youre Cal you got to attack Nathan George on the on the offensive end man hes got three fouls hes going to want to be careful and really exploit him Wilkinsons free throws give him 11 makes this game a fourpoint difference ball is out of Georges hands with mustaf back in the game three and white he goes though with the roll and again when it goes wrong it goes right you want to be by Dongo right now yeah its tough though because hes again theyre switching on the pick and roll and hes just rolling and a foul on Georgia Tech goes against Lance Terry how do you combat that like what does c have to do differently I think they got to they got to bump and close they got to bump the guard out and and have a big step up or you know hedge on the pick and roll and let the guard get through and try to stay in front you know right now Dongo is getting easy looks man he hes really good at taking advantage of guys that are small than him so you cant cant just put a guard on him and expect you know them to handle that task but Layman at home would say well why dont you just stop switching yeah I mean that that could be the goal but I think you know the the idea of of trying to switch is to keep this Georgia Tech defense out the lane um but they are doing a good job of countering that and rolling into the lane and their guards are doing a good job of finding them you know Georgia Tech has big guards so they can see over the top on the defensive end I mean I mean on the offensive end excuse me and theyre finding the roll guy and and you know those roll guys are making plays eyes on one and 11 take out take out take out well there was the pick there was the roll ball stays with George kick out Powell of three Powell wants three great dribble drive its crazy because you can watch everything build off that one Central piece of Georgia Techs offense the pick and roll is working and everything else branches Applause out inside 10 for sto yakovich black three short rebound George poked free petrius with a fresh shot clock and theres a loose ball but trus is coming up with it and hes going to get a reward missed the three third opportunity triple Wilkinson that is his second trailing three off an offensive rebound tonight and hes hype about it too hes hes hes in his mode right now hes got the family here hes got the cousin the brother the sister the mom the dad hes got everybody here watching him show out they call this place the Thriller Dome were throwing punch for punch right now George misses the three chance to tie with a triple for Cal you know Wilkinsons thinking it good look too just a little bit short got it back to the rim onepoint game onepoint game this Cal this Cal offense is alive time out Georgia Tech they were going to get one at the next dead bull but Damon STM cant wait Wilkinson pulling up for the top of the key letting it go then he gets it on his own Miss and finishes it with the right hand man hes having fun out there in front of his family Music un Music Music Music Jeremiah Wilkinson got one vote preseason for ACC rookie of the year that says a lot cuz Cooper Flags in this league uh this is why yeah man he hes doing everything tonight hes driving to the rim hes got 12 points in this second half hes really electrified this offense he can do everything out there shoot the three uh hes just a hustler hes in his Hometown doing his thing 12 points in the second half he has all of the points as you take a look at the Wilkinson behind the cow bench making the track across country he was Mark madsons first High School commitment when he took the cow job and he has been a massive Difference Maker whats his stealing man I I mean I dont know man hes shown so much improvement from coming off the bench to a starter um you know I Id love to see him you know come back next year and you know start getting all those accolades in the AC and then you know see see where he goes but its going to be a fun watch said to Mark Matson this morning when did you know he was going to have a great year and he said when the second team started beating the first team then we had to move Wilkinson onto the first team hey I can relate that freshman year for SRA for me we we had some battles with our first team we definitely had a lot of wins good drive by Musta he will head to the free throw line thats the under 16 in a onepoint game here in Music Music Atlanta e e e e its like a reunion of late 90s early a names in the NBA bonsy Wells and Damon STM on staff Stefan marburys son is a walk on at Cal Andre sto yakovich at Cal where Mark Matson is the head coach and then Ryan Matumbo plays for Georgia Tech so of course coming into this we had to think uh who are our favorite names not our best names but our favorite names from the 90s I grew up in jerseys so you had to have uh Allen Houston Jersey Terry KD as well you went you went all big I went all big and and I thought we were you know know I I may have thought we were doing our best 90s players now our favorites I might have had to have Alan Iverson in there I might have put MJ in there little Vince Carter in there but these are the guys that I thought you know in the ACC did you know had great careers there mustaf with another free throw coming I joked with Mark Madson said hey uh you got any good Damon STM stories and he said we never really played on the same teams but our moms became great friends through the NBA mothers Club oh I know all about the Moms Club my mom was in the Moms Club shes closer with Mrs Curry than you are with Steph that is correct shes closer with Mrs Curry than I am with Steph shes closer to Shaqs mom than I am with Shaq its its backwards its not right Mark Madson said his mom already texted Damon stms Mom first thing this morning they are hyped for this game sto yakovich misses from the lane but he got it back chance to tie or take the lead Wilkinson right to the rim and the rebound pulled down by Powell some contact there theyre not happy with it I agree I thought it was a foul as well good advaned pass ball movement to mustaf rip down rebound and Soko can run petrius leaves it off layup is good see thats what Im talking about this Cal team they can get out on the break they can they can push the pace and put real pressure on the defense they just have to make better choices like that when they do push the push the ball in the break Cal has not LED in 17 minutes of game time now weve got a foul underneath called on Applause Soko get some home some home cooking love right now Georgia Tech and I think Lee Dort is going to go in and grab sasoko sokos great for them does that throw off your Rhythm a little bit youre feeling so good you pick up your third you got to come out at a critical time oh yeah you know you hate to come out at a critical time in the game especially when youre balling inside here to George creating for himself he is such an assist man but youve seen the scoring come to life yeah youve really seen the scoring come to life these past four or five games he had 31 game this year um hes really shown that he can put the ball in the hoop and facilitate so now hes hes entering dangerous territory theres sto yakovich slipped was able to avoid the travel but Cal cant avoid the turnover transition he just punched it on him that might be one of the best dunks of the year we just saw I have no words and thats our job Applause we might have to take three looks at that one Wilkinson an answer that is a huge bucket for cow thats a huge bucket they needed that one I mean hes got 22 now hes balling you knew he was going to ball today though with the family in the crowd you knew he was hooping 22 his career high is 30 and that ball will stay with Georgia Tech despite Cals benching or benchs call Applause sto yakovs reaction is the best part of this yeah mean there was all three of them in the moment realizing that hes going to be on an autographed 8 by10 yeah he got it looked like he got a little bit of the ball too still finished it but yeah hes definitely sakovic is on that poster when do you make a business decision there and just get out of the way never never unless youre going against a Zion Williamson or somebody like that but other than that you got to try to make a play for your team man thats just the part of the game you see the some of the best players in the world get dumped over here comes Wilkinson right to the rim stovic for the lead Cal back in front for the first time in almost a full half stovich is up now he said you may may have dunked on me but you ignited the flame so here we go answer time for the Yellow Jack its George off the elbow and a foul on the rebound we talked so much about the pick and roll but Georgia Tech right now kind of searching for some offensive answers when they get settled five on five yeah you know they theyre theyre looking for answers theyve missed a couple shots they theyve given up momentum a little bit you can you can see that in their faces a little bit that they dont have that same momentum they dont have that same energy on the offensive end because Cs on a cs on a run right now they need to stop the bleeding fou was the second on jovon blackshire inbound to Suare was trying to hand it off to Terry really good denial by Campbell Georgia three answers both sides they got the study guide what a game what a game both sides are going now theyre feeling it Ill tell you what both these teams play like this in the ACC tournament we might have an upset its what theyre B Bing on uhhuh sto yakovich telling you sty yakovich is up now hes awake Cal came in a game and a half out of a first day buy for the ACC Championship and Georgia Tech is a team that has won three of its last five has beaten two of the top three teams in the league and has the easiest remaining schedule both these teams like the road ahead good defense Applause shot clock at five underneath Terry unaffected by the pressure but do you think that Georgia Tech sometimes plays to their competition a little bit right to go out and beat Louisville and to beat Clemson and then have you know lose to Virginia have you know those are I look at that and Im like man they theyre so much better than you know some of the games that theyve lost Corner Ola Joseph three Off the Bench he hasnt played a t first bucket and now Georgia Tech finds thems here down two to a 59 team in conference Bullet Pass Powell oneonone in the paint hes good down there too youve seen him post up a bunch in in the other games in the past and he can really you know put pressure on the defense Biden being down there in the post Im surprised we havent seen him down there a little bit more tonight hows that happen Georgia Tech has two of the best wins in the league but then it plays down what happens psychologically yeah I dont know I mean it it seems like to me they just have a little bit of a play down to their competition and and you know who whoever theyre playing against you know they they maybe its I Im Im not sure if its on the defensive end you know weve seen them flourish on the offensive end I mean look they beat Stanford they lose to Virginia and then they beat Stanford right just a team that doesnt make a whole lot of sense it could be the injury bug that they dont have a a set lineup but you know at least you can say they for the most part theyre in games off the window Powell unable to finish blob up ahead here for Campbell thought about pulling the trigger instead he gave it away George with numbers bounces and a foul reaching with Powell downhill one thing about Georgia Tech that Ive noticed is that they they lack a little bit in that transition defense they really need to fix that right now they got to ch just to breathe yeah time out Music Applause he Applause Applause e e accs committee for racial and social justice in conjunction with its member institutions have ident ified this week February 13th through the 23rd as ACC Unity Music week Cal making a furious comeback here in Atlanta now up two on Georgia Tech and the people that you expect to do big things have done big things almost identically it was George and Dongo in the first half for Tech but sto yakovich and Wilkinson second half Duo today whats been great it has been great I mean listen in the second half stokovich and Wilkins have have been on fire right it started with Wilkinson you know creating shots getting to the rim and then sakovich came along a little bit later hes has hit some hit some open looks from three and uh you know hes really found his rhythm Mark Madson talked about staying on West Coast time with your body clocks when you travel all right it makes sense its about 230 in the afternoon right yeah theyre fresh fresh heres George got to give it to him give it to Dongo down low hes got the mismatch hes got Campbell down on the Block Powell instead takes it right to the rim and the dunk back if you dont give it to me Ill go get it Ill just do it myself Dongo has 20 George has 16 your leading scorers for Applause Tech feating sto yakovich he was looking back door instead of three and Wilkinsons feeling it at home Wilkinson stays Applause hot 25 for the Freshman sometimes you just have those days when you know youre playing in front of the home crowd and that foul is on the drive not on the shot Jeremiah Wilkinson from Powder Springs Georgia he went to high school in Atlanta the last year reball Music talking it over with Ted Valentine career high is 30 that was against Miami earlier this year first free throw is good for Nate George who has played all but seven minutes the last excuse me all but 10 minutes the last seven games and he has played all but 3 seconds today I didnt even know it was possible I didnt know there was a timeout that short I I think I think it was the end of the game end of the they were at the free cows at the free throw line with 3 seconds left and they sub Nate George Applause out coming into crunch time here Georgia Tech has never beaten cow only team in the ACC thats true about it in three prior meetings three is short fight for the rebound and Suare could not hang on to it stays with Cal in a fresh 20 fresh 20 for Cal getting those Second Chance Music opportunities first match up between these teams as members of the ACC they last met in 2012 the two times previous to that were backto back in 1950 of course we all remember fondly 1950s a while ago Campbell Wilkinson they got the hot hand too hot shot clocks at seven and a double dribble I thought he lost possession yeah I thought he lost possession too I thought there was thought Georgia Tech hit the ball a little bit too exit s hey thats the ninth turnover which was a problem early yeah they they settled in a little bit both teams started taking care of the ball a little bit more three combined turnovers in the last 12 minutes of the first half three for George George attack back in front what a game this is look at Cal pushing the ball up the floor unfazed by giving up the lead black Shir down two right to the R rejected loose ball Dort off the glass this is a heavyweight boxing belt theyre battling underneath there I love to see it the physicality ref letting them play I Love It 6666 with 7 minutes to go someone got a flash to the middle well it was Suare Powell Applause three looks like theyre going to review that one to see if it was a two or a three Duncan pow coming up big with big shots not only are these two teams that could cause issues in the ACC tournament this feels like an ACC Tournament game 100 the intensity is there theyre battling guys are making shots Ola Joseph had nowhere to go found Campbell late Campbell wants three three the Quivers are full neither team can miss right Music now Georgia Tech six for its last eight Terry a wideopen three of course he misses rebound to Cal Bears are nine of their last 11 Campbell downhill great find petritis is fouled getting to the line for two no one in the conference gets to the line better than cal Its a good place to be late in ball games but if you cant get to the free throw line Michael Carter Williams the threepoint line will do threepoint line will definitely do there both teams are hot from the outside off the dribble off the catch this is a great game Music he e e e Music Applause take a look at tonights experts at work brought to you by principal pick and roll Music here we goes the pass outside to the three for Duncan Powell and he knocks it down man this pick and roll has been working all night long you see it again he rejects the screen the pick and roll between Dongo and Nate has been working all night he goes left dribbles hesitates a little bit and pulls up for the Trey Ball I mean theyve been working all night at on this pick and roll theyve had a lot of success out of it this has been a great game Cal has shown a lot of hustle I cant wait to see this last 6 minutes 10 seconds Jim beheim said on Wednesday when Cal was at Durham theyre just a team that struggles to shoot this year and that has been very true statistically not today Mark Madson told us we are a better team than our stats show and theyve got a season High 12 made threes in this game yeah I mean they theyre shooting unbelievable from the three it doesnt seem like they dont shoot it well if you this is your first time watching Cal you wouldnt say that 17th of 18 in the AC from behind the threepoint line but they let it fly live by It Die by it the talent is there inside Dongo could not Corral the pass from mustaf and Calls made some adjustments you know we just talked about the pick and roll but it has been more difficult for Georgia Tech in the half court yeah that was a that was a good idea you could see what they were going for he had the mismatch down there just the pass was just a little bit off Georgia Tech needs a stop in the worst way though man they havent got a stop in a little while CS nine of 11 shots Wilkinson they got this man right here whos dribbling the ball well hes got the defense guarding him deep too teams have been sagging off of him because of the shooting three to shoot for sto yakovich he lost track of it mustaf right to the rim mustaf is real good on the break man hes really explosive he can get to the hoop tough tough guard you know Id love to see him get out on the break a little bit more you see them denying Wilkinson at the half court Mark they dont want him touching the ball at all sto yakovich George tremendous sophomores matchup pocket pick sto yakovich got it back three no just off the heel for blackshire 71 all under five to go George pass Uber High leaves it behind petritis twopoint lead for Cal petritis man making all the little plays running the break hard cutting to the hoop getting the offensive rebounds hes so important to this team I love the way he plays man hes really selfless out there had nine ties 10 lead changes George heres Terry Terry spinning on Wilkinson with the shot clock at four the janky bucket he has seven everythings going in tonight Applause Wilkinson thought he got knocked misses the three Mark madsons assistants were yelling youve got timeouts if you need them they have three Applause remaining theyre in the horn set here the lob and Dango is fouled thats going to be on sto yakovich his third Dongo working guy needs a break different kind of break tough layup Georgia Tech relying on Terry Mak it a tie Music game e e e e e Taylor thank you tie game here in Atlanta 7373 and the I mean no boots for that guy today Jeremiah Wilkinson who has struggled to shoot 30 for the year but Mark Madson told us you have to shoot because if youre open and you dont you hurt the team so dont deny if teams give you the opportunity and I I love that out of Coach you know that thats the epitome of giving your player confidence right if youre open shoot the ball because if you dont you know that that could hurt the team you dont know whats going to happen if you pass up an open shot a guy could get a a contested shot after that or a turnover right you know I I I love that you know from coach and you know thats thats everything you want as a player and because something tells me hes going to have to take a big shot at some point in the next 320 absolutely missed free throw by Dongo keeps his tied Wilkinson air ball Dongo the Applause rebound Georgia Tech 11 and3 this year when it scores more than 70 Cal 4 and 11 when it allows more than 70 two teams that dont play a ton in this area power oh thats a strong move right there there by pal like like we talked about him in the post right hes really good down there he might not be the tallest dude but hes strong hes tough around the rim yeah I I I think they start going to him this last three minutes he has 17 thats his average over the last eight St yakovich thought about it and then throws it off the foot of sissoko and its going to Georgia Tech and not to micro analyze but you could see the gears churning right St yakovich has to take the three there he was open yeah you got to take the three when its open man have that confidence you just hit two shots in a row before that take it you know shoot the ball you know score the ball when your team needs it that thats what they need out of Stak Mission thats what hes going to be maybe thats his Evolution got a timeout well step aside with it Music tomorrow morning it is our Shriner childrens Clearwater softball Invitational coverage continues with fourth ranked UCLA going off against number go go going against excuse me Virginia at 4 and three theyve played all those games on the road this year they get a crack in a top five team with UCLA tomorrow at 1000 am Georgia Tech up by two with the ball it has been a twoman show George and Dango Powell has helped out lately oh Terry missed Powell cleans it up and well head to the free throw line you know its funny I say twoman show Powell almost very quietly has those 17 points theyve come in critical moments though theyve come in big critical moments his last four minutes right hes had four points you before that he hes hit a couple threes from the corner right he hes come up with some big buckets in this game when this Georgia Tech Team really really needed it that was petrius is fourth sto yakovich also has four hes a big free throws for Mr pow Mr shag hes only a 67 free throw shooter Tech is now nine of 14 at the line tonight big possession here just Cal just needs to get a good look and dont force anything just get a good shot like theyve been doing the whole Applause night its back to a fourpoint game watch sto yakovich oh its Soko inside fading away rebound petritis rebound you know who its going to be petritis is there 12 points for petritis he does all the little things for the best offensive rebounding team in the conference and if youre Georgia Tech man you got to box out you got to find him you know what you know hes coming you know hes crashed in that offensive glass big possession now its back to a twopoint game 92 mark back po back in the post looking to distribute mustaf physical into sto yakovich is rejected great defense heres petrius on the leak out sto yakovich missed the dunk he is fold Music here you see great defense good help on the block shot and then Cal getting on the break making the right decisions fortius finds sakovich and he gets the Applause foul Im Im not sure Im not sure what theyre looking at man that was a a close to a touch foul yeah yeah he looked at it for about5 seconds Ted Valentine is yelling that was a foul into the Georgia Tech huddle theres another look at it for Applause you now the cow bench was yelling he undercut him but it looks like sakovich just unfortunately came down Awkward watch the right hand yeah he does get the first free throw for sto yakovich he has 14 missed four games in January it threw off his rhythm middle of the Season trying to get back into that guy that averaged 20 a night yeah I mean I I think its a little different though right like you come back to a team where Wilkinson is really really playing really well and its like as a as a teammate you dont want to take that away but then also you know you got to come in and and and establish yourself again you know as as a you know as the the leading score of this team so I think them two just trying to figure out what that looks like is going to be key for them timeout taken by Georgia Tech so one remaining for STM Mark Madson has two Cal has a full and a 30 Georgia Tech has just their fulltime out left Music this is what you play college basketball for right meing games meaning games 7777 a minute 15 where you going if youre Georgia Tech here I think Im going for the pick and roll right pick and roll with Dongo and and um Nate George its been working the whole game I guess as a secondary option you could go to look for Duncan pal in the post Powells been the man of the second half 15 of his 19 Dongo was the guy in the first half 16 of his 20 theyve quite literally had flipflopped halves of phenomenal nights the luxury of having great players on your team they only got seven y they hit the jackpot looks like theyre going for the horn set you can choose either side now Dongo should go into the pick and roll here there it is theres the roll oh hes going to reset it reset it hes got the mismatch now shot clock and 10 for George downhill rejected put back Dango One Way or Another Time Out Cal hes been there all night hes been around the ball that is a skill to have being around the ball at all times hes hes cleaned up misses hes cleaned up block shots man hes got just a knack for being around the ball and finishing strong at the rib is that an assist listen its a great just all you got to do is get the ball up there right and make things happen you got three guys trying to block your shot you got guys crashing there is something to like a a making things happen n right and Nate George just has that he makes things happen its been for other people now its become for himself and because of that other people benefit around him yeah when youre when when youre a guy that can make things happen you start to generate your own luck right just like that play right he gets to the rib hes in the paint yeah he may not have made the shot he didnt get the shot to the rim right it got blocked but he draws attention and then Dongo comes in and cleans it up right thats something that thats theres theres something to be said about a guy who always puts people in a good position you know some luck follows that career high 22 for Bongo who grew up a soccer player because of course hes from Sagal theyre playing soccer over there for sure hes one of those guys that had height you should try basketball his sister got into it first and Georgia Tech is darn thankful she did yeah I mean you can tell hes got great feet right hes got great feet hes got good footwork you know hes he can post up a little bit he can finish with both hands and the soccer comes into it cuz understands shape understands where he needs to be 100 yeah understands angles understands you know the the amount of shape that hes probably in from playing soccer his whole life is is probably hes in Elite shape and then the footwork think the footwork is the the biggest thing the footwork is so key in in basketball thats what Im trying to get my son to be in the so be in the soccer for a while then been transition in the Hoops theres a plan got to be 50 seconds to go Cal down two and a hold its on mustaf the first only six on Tech and they got a bunch of waste here double bonus next time Tech is Applause fouled heres sto yakovich big second half sto yakovich off the window ties it up at 79 yeah if youre Georgia Tech you got to shrink the court a little bit you cant leave Lance Terry on an island with a score like sakovich out there you got to show some help show some bodies 17 now for sto yakovich nine of it in the second half hes helped bring his team back no timeout here for Georgia Tech driveing kick Terry misses the three rebound Dongo travel time out is a timeout Cal and whos up whos coming up with the loose ball rtis ptis hes been doing it all night wash him in the Music past theyre hype over there they are hype over there in that cow bench this was almost the perfect moment for Dongo again being in the right place at the right time y both of them both of those guys Dongo and tritis theyre theyre they make it happen great steal great steal in the in the heads up play to call the timeout as soon as you get the steal with 18 seconds to go they give Cal a chance for a game winner now if youre Cal who do you go to here is it sakovich or is it Wilkinson no no thats my job who do you go to oh sorry is youre going to Wilkinson or St I think you put them both in the action put them put them in a pick and roll see what happens if Wilkinsons got the angle let go if he doesnt give it to sakovich and clear him out just like you did on the last possession and see if he can score I like I like sakovic is match up against Lance Terry hes taller hes longer he just scored on him so well see here we Applause go CS put together a tremendous game on the road cross country season High 12 made threes trying to snap out of a one and4 stretch over their last five we got Duncan poell on uh yovic now it looks like theyre going to go to Wilkinson here game and a half out of a first round Buy in the ACC Championship 10 seconds Wilkinson is going to try to send them home here we go the pick and roll like we talked about Wilkinson down to the crib missed rebound Terry Georgia Tech had a timeout does not call it and we go to the end of regulation tied at 79 overtime he got a great look too Wilkinson downhill and Soko was in the right place but 40 minutes Michael Carter Williams is not enough 40 minutes is not enough theyre giving us an extra five take a time out well reset when we come on back Applause Music Applause best ACC win Music head to overtime Cal and Georgia Tech last time Cal played in overtime at won that was against Miami the last time Georgia Tech played in overtime they they just kept going yeah I was I was in studio for that night so I I know that I I would know that live and well they had me up till about 130 in the morning its one of the best wins in the ACC this year Georgia Tech beating Clemson in three overtimes that coupled with teex win over Louisville two of the top nine wins according to the net in the ACC this year so it leans into the theme weve talked about of Georgia Tech being a really talented team despite a 6 and8 record never doubt this team theyre always up to the challenge they know how to win an OT they certainly do when they make big plays in the stretch they made a big defensive play you know to to go into this overtime so watch out for Georgia Tech in this OT theyve played Seven guys the rambling wreck they tired how do you how do you dig down here for 5 minutes man come on theyre 17 18 19 years old no such thing is being tired at that age I love how you said that as if like an old man yells at Cloud moment Soko and Dango foul picture as we start over time sto yakovich two and blue has four petritis has four hes got the ball now everybody else in the clear St yakovich a three unafraid to take that one remember he hesitated towards the end of regulation right I mean thats his what is his third make in a row I mean hes got to keep shooting keep pulling it be confident its a new season High 13 made threes for Cal Ill tell you one thing too you go down you know a team gets a three at the start of overtime it its a you become a little bit discouraged not Nate George though floer for George she has 23 yeah its like you make that first bucket in overtime for some reason 5 minutes doesnt feel like five minutes yeah it it almost feels like you have such a head start in the game were already down to four and yovic throws it away no numbers for Georgia Tech although Dango wanted it he was for the pointed up throw it up gor Tech at 54 for the game one of their best shooting nights this season driving George no good tip out of the rebound but Powell in the right place and sto yakovich Tech whated a foul Applause petritis back tapped stays with Cal petritis a three no cissoko the rebound outmanned Cal wants a held ball or a foul going up oh there was a two call there was a foul and there was a jump Applause ball they get Powell for his Applause third and free throws forces sooko so itll be all the way up big free throws for Soko Applause here 68 seven and 10 for Marty Soko Music played in four NCAA tournaments with Michigan State guy knows big moments graduate Music transfer threepoint lead for Cal and timeout largest lead is only four for Cal theyve had momentum but they havent been able to punch themselves away this is about it timeout for the Bears Music Applause all oh my Applause Applause Applause year Music shades of his father four of five in the second half Andre sto yakovich and hes making it rain making it rain what strikes you about him his potential this a fivestar recruit coming out of high school who didnt take the World by storm as a freshman at Stanford he has blown up as a sophomore yeah I I mean I think this opportunity for him just to be the star in this team was huge for him right to play open and to play with confidence hes really shown that what he can do in this league hes still young hes only a sophomore he can shoot the ball very well he can put it on the floor a little bit and create his own shot and hes got great size to him as well so all those intangibles make him a great score St yakovich is one of four in this game with 20 points Duncan Powell has 19 for Tech bottom of your screen 31 heres George turnaround in the lane rebound pulled down by petritis he has been Applause everywhere inside 3 minutes to go largest lead for Cal is four heres sto yakovich largest lead for Cal is five thats what we were looking for and thats what you talk about at the start of overtime buckets are back Breakers in the extra frame 100 right you start staring at that clock a little bit it starts ticking woo big shot by Nate George my man and a pretty good close out by sakovic it was a good close out just too much room any room is too much room apparently Now cal milks a little bit of clock but its pushing him out he said get out the way let me work lets can we have this dance tough good defense Georgia Tech on the break layup time the game we got a ball game folks as if it uhoh oh man oh sto yakovich is down no its uh oh excuse me its Wilkinson teex bench came onto the court real quickly afterward and I thought they were being pushed back cuz they were celebrating and that may have been the case as well but Wilkinson underneath the bucket is the chief concern hope its just a cramp right well you could see him pull up earlier in the lane looks like just a calf cramp his leg was like a it was stuck in the cramp so it looked a little funny I was like man I I I prra nothing too bad happening Wilkinson is from Atlanta Georgia Powder Springs Georgia so his family is in attendance today his family looks nervous hes okay hell be good just a crb 25 points in his homecoming his career high 30 was in Cals other overtime game a win against Miami as they take a look at Wilkinson we will step aside sub number 10 helped to the bench Jeremiah Wilkinson has been the engine today for Cal 25 points hes had a great day from behind the threepoint line but you can still see that cramp is not his friend at the moment Michael Carter Williams you got to sit on the bench with 2 minutes in overtime hell be back in in about 10 seconds its a cow basketball I think thats excruciating more so than the pain oh absolutely absolutely sto yakovich has a huge Target on him now two and blue yeah St yakovich is going to see a lot of attention without Wilkinsons out there somebody else is going to have to make a big play hes got the angle got the lob he was the guy that went on that six nothing run at the end of the first half to get Cal back in the game Ill tell you what Dewan Campbell has played a really really solid game tonight right not everything so up on the statute but hes been playing well oh wow thats some travel shuffled his feet a little bit Nate George has played such a great game tough time but yeah Campbell I mean he he does does do the little things hes finding people yeah hes doing the little things out there hes hes hits some Big Time Shots tonight at timely moments yeah I I really enjoyed his performance today shock clock inside 10 petrius pops off of the screen Campbell and he Applause travel timeout taken by Georgia Tech woo I heard somebody shout timeout from the cow bench and I said no no they dont have any and I know that cuz they got a guy with a sign that says no timeouts in the Huddle no timeouts Im sure Chris rubber would she could use that one same colors same colors yeah you didnt have that at Syracuse sorry Chris I didnt I didnt need to take a shot the NBA you didnt have the no timeout no we didnt have the no timeout thing NOP its a good its a good idea do you ever find yourself wondering at the end of a game no I I I would say Super Hyper aware of how many timeouts left how many fouls we had that was just a thing that was but i i Ive had you know teammates in the past that were a little lost in the sauce on timeouts and and how many fouls you know we had to give or uh twopoint game Tech down by two you have the ball you probably get the ball back but its not guaranteed what do you do I think you go with your B but right is is Wilson is Wilson back in the game hes got to be oh this George uh yeah I think you go your B and butter you got Nate George and you got Dongo the high pick and roll right you run that you try to get the switch if possible wison is not back in yet right Im saying if youre Georgia Tech right on on this play I think you just run the high pick and roll early keep an eye on that clock right you dont want to get it two now where where Cal can just hold the ball want to give yourself a chance to get another defensive stop look to score quick here got the mismatch give it to him there is the mismatch Dongo is fou chance for the lead all day theres been the mismatch in the post dangos taking advantage of it career high 24 I mean if I know what theyre going to do maybe Im a little bit smarter than the arena but the arena knows what theyre going to do as well fouls on DJ Campbell the thing is is Cals also got to know that and be able to rise to the occasion 100 right you know that D you know that pick and roll is coming you know maybe you should put a a big on Nate George CU then you if you switch on now now he switches on to Dongo in the post and theres no mismatch there so big big free throw here Dango oh he misses it 60 shooter no timeouts left for Cal tie game Cal coming to Atlanta blacker being guarded by mustaf inside petritis bobbled around and its a Georgia Tech ball tie game shot clock off but they will review this Ah thats Georgia Tech ball saw it in 4k previous play is under Music VI yeah its thats right off the collar bone right there this should be a quick one so Georgia Tech has possession with 21 seconds like guarantee here you take the last shot you cannot go early right after review plays confirm you know I I find myself Cal has no timeouts left right so if you want to give yourself a second chance to get an offensive rebound taking the shot with four 5 seconds left doesnt kill you right its you know its going to be a hail marry for Cal to you know throw the ball down forward and get a clean look at it right so I mean you got Dongo has been great at on the offensive glass you got you know I I think you try to get a shot up with four or five seconds left and give yourself to get an offensive rebound or a tip in or something but to answer your question I I think so right take the L you get you milk the clock down as much as possible of those 50 Nate George has 26 Dongo has 24 on 10 of 13 shooting and 12 rebounds its his best game theyre on their feet here across the Thriller Applause Dome waiting for that pick and roll to come heres Dongo with eight George got bu 5 Seconds George downhill inside nothing tip back yes oh and its game Dongo oh game
