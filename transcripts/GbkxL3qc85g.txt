tonight Syracuse leads the ACC enforcing turnovers in fact they have the top two steel artists in the league and Malik Brown and Judah men we are underway Clemson controls the tip our officials tonight Bill hington patris and Brian oconnell a veteran crew here and hul on senior night and theres going to be a little bit of nerves for PJ Im not sure thats the reason for that but there are a lot of emotions given his background in this state twotime state champion as a high school player investing four years here one of the most beloved stars and accomplished ones in Clemson basketball history that was one of the things brand Brownell talked about was settling down early with the emotions of the senior night ceremonies just completed a few moments ago strong move off from JJ Starling transfer from Notre Dame has been playing great Sean well as I walked into the Arena tonight PJ Hall was talking to one of the guys at the scorers table said shook his hand said one last time I get to shake your hand theres an emotional factor of it we see it across college basketball this time of year how you can exhale and take that breath really important on senior night not just Hall but Chase Hunter who just missed that three also playing his final game here and we mentioned starlings been playing well and he gets the scoring started with a three ball for the orange big part of why Syracuse has been charging down the stretch of ACC play is not just Juda Min I mean Judah Min is the headliner but Starling has been sensational also playing his final game in Little John is the man with the ball who just bounced past it inside Joseph Gerard the former star and Ian shein has a chance for a threepoint Play Just p and seal angle scorer on the Block right I mean he just he just plants himself down there like hes in the over 40 league and says give me the ball yep youre going to bounce off my shoulder Im good with that Im going to be able to finish through and thats where I think Clemson has got to continue to go early and often play through Hall play through sheflin get them on the Block and then cut and move off of them if youre going to shoot threes shoot threes off of the ball getting at least a post entry and give yourself a chance three from the perimeter and one on the other end tied at three in the early Applause going heres Jud men really Adept at getting it Applause inside how about men getting Hunter out of the way but couldnt get it to fall Here Comes Gerard going past his old teammate now finding PJ Hall great job by Hall to shape up on the drive have his feet set parallel to the driver so when he caught it it was a simple move straight up backtoback possessions Clemson got the ball exactly where they wanted to be in the paint the start difference too from Saturday against Notre Dame when they were just five of 28 from Beyond the AR and almost half of their shots coming from three which is not typically The Way Clemson operates the way Syracuse has operated has been in large part because of the great play of Malik Brown who gets a bucket there screens and Dives every single time great hands catches keeps the ball high heres hall for three nerves are gone by the way reys you throw the ball out of bounds on the first possession yeah no worries go ahead and get Five Points quick he was just two of 10 from Beyond The Arc against Notre Dame so off to a good start here Judah almost turns it over kept those feet planted when he threw it to himself so no travel its one of the most exciting players to watch on the drive in all of college basketball in men go up shot Chris Bell has just been tored from Deep over his last eight games thises from inside the arc there heres Jack Clark another senior transfer from North Carolina State Gerard Jeff an offensive Applause rebound all and now lob to sheflin and a good defensive play For a Moment by Justin Taylor but sheflin recovers now Hunter has it in the corner the fly by and Halls left alone he shot fake get into the lane and score composure and Poise on that possession multiple ball reversals the ball got a piece of the paint multi times and then that allowed on the close out a little shot fake and drive for Applause Hall good start for Applause Clemson get Hall started with seven quick points Jack Clark picked up that foul there is Brad Brownell the tiger coach in his 14th season here another 20 win season already trying to get that double Buy in the ACC tournament improve the NCAA tournament seed heres men that will sideways three you take that all day long if youre Clemson what you cant afford him to do is allow Min to get a piece of the paint you you force him into more of those shots even if he hits a couple youre going Youre tip your cap and say at the end of the night hey great job out of character for a guy that shoots sub 30 from Beyond The Arc Clemsons made four of its last five kick back from Gerard theres Hall again for three have yourself a night kid into double figures already and Clemson has jumped out to an eightpoint lead one of the things that red ay told us that hes been most impressed with with his Syracuse team as they get down they lose a game they fight back and found themselves in an early hole here another Miss rebound by Clark Hunter on the Applause break Gerard need a Music Applause timeout you love pizza just as much as we love pizza he reached the 2000 point mark precisely against Syracuse from the free throw line needed 18 got 18 and that when what a move by Pence to put in the bucket and then to come back here and play your final home home game as a college basketball player I guess in many ways fitting that it is against Syracuse for Joe Gerard yeah Halls been off to a great start but Gerard has three assists already to go along with the three points and the ball movement has been just crisp for Clemson theyve assisted on five of their first six made field goals on the game sheflin working on Taylor Chase Hunter thought about it hes got three on the shot clock somebodys got to let it fly they do and Jack Clark beats the buzzer but cant get it to go I like that last possession out of the timeout with getting the ball in Judah minz getting him to a spot where hes comfortable and confident Chris Bells another guy that could really get going and help this offense out right now mens and Bell almost missed connection there mens has a real old school kind of game and I think I think like really dating myself or rman roll or somebody you know just kind of showing the ball to everybody and then putting it in is Syracuse has backto back baskets to sort of stem that t Clemson run it reach to your point about like good shots lead to allowing you to set up your defense when you have poor shots and the Way Clemson can rebound the basketball and have dominated the glass so far early in this game it allows them to force you to get in your rotations at the defensive end and you you made the last two buckets now you get an opportunity to really establish your defense and how you want to play the position wise counting down the shot clock for Hall and why not thats a dozen for for PJ talk about position defense how about position offense if that guys in that position youre losing Applause defensively Starling trying to H his second three of the night all had the rebound for a second chefling corals It Here Come the Tigers up by nine Chase Hunter hes off and sheffs going to get call for that one being Chef lall for giving Justin Taylor a little shove thatll be his first I would say if you got two feet in the paint that you got to get in the ball and he had two feet in the paint and they got pushed out a little bit and then just watch the way that PJ Hall is able to get to that left shoulder and finish up over the top and the the way he utilizes his bounce with power to create that movement and momentum to go up and finish all has been perfect so far quite here Copeland has checked in for Syracuse he had a big game against the Tigers in the first meeting with 13 hes had a few explosive nights versatile guy excellent passer mince off the curl what a look from mince inside I think he surprised Malik Brown and Browns got the excellent hands he leads the ACC and steals with maybe a little too much there and hes called for the foul mince got caught in the air and left his feet and really had no other option and usually as you mentioned ear Browns really good at coring those the ball and being able to finish you go up there he was ready to rebound whoops hes like okay I went from a box out to a catch and then the Miss but Clemsons ability to dominate The Glass I think right now its a 9 to3 advantage on the glass Chase Hunters brother Dylan is into the game PJ Hall has finally missed a shot RJ Godfrey number 10 is also checked in for the Tigers pull them thats enough shooting too much young man when working on Hall under the basket used the rim and couldnt get it PJ with a rebound Here Comes Dylan Applause Hunter go in the zone theyve played a little bit manto man theyve gone to the Zone shorter bench The Zone has been good at keeping out of foul trouble their rotation been pretty good Jack CL no PJ Hall yes the problem with the zone is you got to be able to rebound out of it and if you allow a Baseline Drive everybody turns their back you can crash and a great job by PJ Hall to get into that position Syracuse has offset a lot of its rebounding woes by getting steals which theyve been great at it certainly helps when rer copelan can come off the bench and knock down to three his first points of the evening hes back in that zone you know for years and years obviously played it exclusively now the crosscourt pass Chase Hunter going to try again it and there it is the senior has a three ball his first bucket yeah just trading buckets right now but great ball movement against the Zone they got it to the high post kicked it out to strong side and then over the top skip pass to wide open shooter who was shot ready but youre right I mean that you go back to it and you go back to it though with purpose and I think thats what red ay has done here with incorporating more of that zone as The Seasons gone along I dont know who says the midrange game is gone but they havent seen Judah men you always say is he a three level scorer hes a two and a half level scorer I give him a half from Beyond The Arc hes going to get better at that too I think as he goes along she right around 30 PJ Hall is just going off hes got 16 of Clemsons 25 PJ Hall is plus two over Syracuse as a team right now think about that where the shots are coming from Brown the kick out starling shakes Dylan Hunter and JJ Starling now has seven much better flow to Syracuse offense so far after that initial timeout they came out of that set that first timeout and all of a sudden now theyre starting to get better quality looks but if they dont figure out how to stop number 24 at this end of the floor theyre going to struggle hter hit one that was way long barely got the rim Here Comes Copeland Syracuse down by nine Copeland goes all the way to the bucket and he draws the foul tremendous move by quader Copeland and Clemson behind PJ Hall up to a great start hes played like a first team All Conference hes played like an AllAmerican all season long why stop doing it now on senior night handle the emotions Channel them in a seniors The Pride they take in in being here being part of a program and this is across the country over this week youre going to see nothing but a bunch of seniors the tears the emotion theyre real because the commitment and the sacrifice and the realization of your journey no matter how large or or small Your Role may be to get to feel that what did John Wooden say to you right before you walked onto the floor for senior day you CLA you called me over and said Sean well done three of the most important and powerful words that have ever been said to me because it was from coach how cool was that I was the only senior it was really Shan faram day which you know me Im a very humble person who doesnt like a lot of attention well you you believe most days are Shan faram day as RJ God I thought lunch my Smoking Pig was was because of f it was because of Davis well but what a what a kind thing from the the people with Smoking Pig and also the great Ben winterroad who is the Sid here at Clemson who let us hey smoking pigs closed on Tuesday but I believe I can uh help get you guys some if youd like it we will yes please that was that was some great a lunch today Syracuse starting to eat a little bit too your cop went into the game and after that hot Clemson start the orange back to within five you know since that loss that they suffered to the Tigers they won five out of six they won four in a row and we talked about the top tournament resumes a quad one victory in March matters in particular on the road Syracuse knows they have work to do still even with a win here tonight theyd have some work to do to probably get in the NCAA tournament but this would go a long way men sort of settled for that last three and now heres Dylan Hunter shefflin thought about it Chanty Wiggins he doesnt think much because hes a he is ready to shoot when he catches the ball and has a chance to be a really really outstanding player as a stretch four type guy one of the biggest keys so far in the game has been only one turnover for Clemson you mentioned how oh look at that look at wait are you kidding me Jud hes looking hes looking up in the people sitting on the thr you see that yes we did and all of a sudden we got a threepoint game and Judah can get it to a bucket judahs attack and thats one of the things that he does as well as any guard in the country he can absorb contact he knows how to utilize soft touch off the glass and he gets to the free throw line about as frequent as anyone you know what Sean I mentioned when these two teams played the first time Judah only shot two free throws and you might think hey look theyre going to be games like that guy averages 6 and 1 12 free throw attempts per game hes had double figure free throw attempts 11 different times this year and he makes his first year to complete the threepoint play and the surging orange on a N9 nothing run over the last 212 and theyre back to within two you how aggressive you have to be to get the free throw line that many times and how many times your body hits the floor and youve got to get back up and do it all over again Chase Hunter stops the run that was Clemsons first make after missing five consecutive field goal attempts and its back to a fourpoint lead little dribble handoff action curl that action right into the paint and pull up at the logo little zone now from Clemson tasting their own medicine Clemson will do from time to time this year worked on this at shooter round they talked about being active within that zone they are okay with having the center close all the way out to the corner Kyle cuff has checked in for Syracuse now jard and PJ Hall back for the Tigers PJ with 16 thats already one more than he had in the meeting in Syracuse What A Catch got it back hall will try it again and hell go to the free throw line and shoot a couple those arent hands those are fight scripts he hes a strong dude right here but how about the fight they getting into the NCAA tournament as good as Syracuse has been they put some perspective on what a good job Audrey has done here this is their first 20 win regular season you know not counting adding ACC and NCAA tournament WIS in 10 years and hes brought hes brought a good amount of energy and has started to carve out his own path of how he wants this program to look and how he wants it to feel hes been a lot of change and he said what one of the things he focused on most since the start of the season and the growth that he had he said he got more patient mhm said had a slow down and realize I dont have to give out all the information at once how Im delivering my message matters and how my team takes it that information and is able to execute it on the floor is essential for their success and lets I should haston to point out before I start getting Texs from Sha MCD during that run where maybe they didnt reach 20 in the regular season there is a final four trip and a couple of sweet 16s in there too so its not as if they havent been good they certainly have you said MCD do you want to add the other 75 playbyplay guys that work at ESPN that came from new house might as well as Kyle cuff Ducks down the three and s Syracuse back to within two Dave Pash on line Music one always feel added pressure when we do a Syracuse game cuz I know every single one of our playbyplay guys who watching it and half of our Applause execu Chef now has five boss called me up F you want to do a Clemson Syracuse game yes why every exec will be watching Im here baby with Rees lets do it Judah menz will pull up Gerard has the Applause rebound good flow to this game Syracuse as we mentioned has responded made it a two possession game Clemsons still been able to execute the way they want to and PJ Hall goes to work on brown big size Advantage there nice job by Brown making him take the tough shot just bodied him walled up and didnt bounce and give an inch when PJ Hall dropped his shoulder into him oo men slipped on the floor hope hes okay good job just not to travel Copeland with a Nifty move and scooped it underneath Wiggins and scored Copeland Has Come Off the Bench and hes been ready to go he has all nine points that Syracuse has Off the Bench of the game have come off the hands of 24 and you know Ill tell you we havent heard from him hes been on the bench for while is Chris Bell who over his last eight games is like 33 of 62 from three but theyve got a good group out there right now it has him with a chance to tie the game cuffs hit one three and oh he stepped out of bounds itll be a turnover on the orange that was a really good defensive possession by Syracuse on that last possession and that was a settled look for Clemson you know is a I think when you watch film I always go how many are are the great a shots so you can tell that they got the ball exactly where they wanted to and they got the shot they wanted how many of them are good looks where its a good look its not a great one but its good and then how many do you have that you force them into a one pass Jack or a contested look and the more you get in that area the more success your defense is going to have early Clemson was really moving the ball well that last possession they did not round go out there to chase down Chase Hunter now hunter gets to the Elbow Paul this time spins right past Brown and score yeah I love the variety of how he approaches every post up that he has you know the previous possession he took his time that time he felt and had awareness of where the defense was before the catch which allowed him to spin and utilize that momentum to get that scene to finish you want a nit pick PJ Halls first half he missed a free thrower hed have 20 already steel from Jack Clark working on Starling and itll be goal tending and Clark will have the bucket theyre going to review it now have a look lets see Chris Bell bading the Syracuse case now looking up for the video monitor lets see if it got to the backboard first oh yeah yeah thats easy one refer signaling lets go they theyll go back and look at it the next stopage of play if they do it wont take long no they look thats a one looker sometimes I wonder if the officials stare at the monitor more in reviews so that they get more on camera time well thats just you channeling your thoughts about how to work that out well Ive tried to work in on cameras in my contract and its been continually denied by the execs lets see what we can do about it tonight theyre like less for them the better Starling lines one up rattles out shefflin kept it alive and Hall pulled it Applause away PJ have to take it himself might as well just keep it good look but sheflin couldnt handle it Ian diving to the basket now here goes mince by Clark off the window shefflin just sacrificing his body and no Covington the ball hit the Baseline itll stay with Syracuse back of depth Uh Kevin mcculler has missed some some games hes been back now and their inability to win on the road is problematic cuz last time I checked the final four is not inside Allen field house this year it is not in boy did they put a whipping on Houston and Allen Fieldhouse there might be some payback in mind when they you saw Houston last week what you think uh really tough defensively LJ CER can shoot it Jamal sheds probably the only guy in the country who can miss 14 consecutive shots over two games and still dominate the game I I wonder about the injuries that are starting to mount up they lost JoJo tuger for the season so kelvins going to have to do some things shot clocks getting late here shefflin beats the shot clock and will go to the free throw line but I I I think theyve got a chance I think with prior um it gives them maybe a little little more explosive offense um than you might have thought they had a little bit earlier in the season defensively as a lead as anybody theyre out standing in Second Chance points which can manufacture and and break up some of those scoring droughts but to win a championship theyre going to have to make shots yeah you know I did not realize this one of the analytics guys keeps up with his Houston lead the nation in 10 nothing runs thats awesome how about that that for everything but you can see why because they can just stifle you on defense their defense its one of those things thats like you know the annoying kid that you you knew in the fourth grade that every time you were standing in line to go back into the classroom the teacher had you line up in line and he was the guy next to you going Reese Reese Reese thats their defense you catch a ball you turn around theyre staring at you and like why are you still here I just ran off of three screens shefflin sha with 77 rebounds hes the only player in the ACC to average 9 and 1 12 points 9 and half fors and two assists hes well on his way to that he just continues to grab boards theres eight number eight on the rebound Gerard trying to turn the corner shefflin Brown in the air now Jack Applause Clark Clark shot it from 22 and shot at 24 theres number 24 another turnover for SRA CL has done a nice job taking away some of those late dishes and fourth turnover of the half for the orange un particular getting back in transition on the air ball those are opportunities where Syracuse could potentially run out Gerard creating a little space Copeland got a hand in there and took it away from him the ACC leaders in steals the orange get another one havent gotten Chris Bell going still Syracuse down just by eight they d sced Min to shoot for three and you said youll take that youll take that as opposed to him getting in the paint I think you got to attack there if youre not happy with it then pull it back a little bit allow a screen to call for a screen to come up and try to get downhill one thing I will say if Min hits a couple of those and shefin tries to power it in and thatat Driscoll is going to get away theyre going to yeah theyll come in and Brian o Connell saying no that Chris Bell was GL to touch it what else was going to say about men and shooting the three CU I think you cant just turn it down every time as we take another look at this because then if they have to come out well then youre in much better shape yes I agree with you Bell has to touch it CLS some possession but I think you can get those threes through rotation through ball movement instead of just catching at the top dribbling a couple times and seeing that theres a gap and saying lets go ahead and let it go 95 seconds left to in the half we take a 30second break right here from Clemson one of the things that you can look at too is Clemson has really limited the number of assists for Syracuse which means theyre forcing them to play oneonone and the more oneonone you get your opponents to play the better off it ISJ Hall what a half he has had the lead is 10 and PJ is now up to 21 in the first half nine of well from the floor the high hand off and finishing is Malik Brown yeah beautiful little screen in the center of the paint I believe it was by Judah minz they rolled Brown and thats a play out of the timeout in execution even though its on the other possession and get an easy look a much needed field goal snapping a drout of more than four minutes inside a minute to go here in the first half chefin has it deep and theyll call Copeland for the foul on the floor trying to handle big strong forward from Clemson and watch this on the on the screen youre going to see its not Judah minz actually that set that screen Brown and set roll yeah that was a great Roll by Brown to the rim and you little Center screen in that center of the paint and then you just lob it up to the cup and let him go get it Copelands having a lot of fun man hes talking to the crowd hes talking to the official hes sitting on the bench and hes still clapping hes had a really good first half he was a big reason why Syracuse got back in this thing after the Way Clemson started and just before the half the Tigers have pushed the lead back out to 10 Gerard now with five and the Bounty 13sec difference shot clock and game clock we wind down the first half see if the orange can go in feeling good about something men spinning and now Clemson can take take the last shot of the first half and it appears thats what theyll do you and I were talking at Round want to see points scored you love baskets you love teams that execute this has been a very entertaining first half Clemson is going to go to locker room feeling very good about how patient they were and how they got almost everything they wanted and that is emblematic of the first 20 minutes right there Chase Hunter with the dunk off the feed from shefflin and he has his senior night moment in the Tigers are up by a dozen thing that Clemson did a good job of not turning the basketball over Syracuse leads the ACC in steals he only got two in the first half meanwhile only four assists for the orange quer Copeland came off the bench had a nice first half Syracuse at one point got the game back to within two as Jud men gets him off to a really good start because Clemson finished that first half on a 122 run judahs got nine moved him off ball put him in a position where you know on the catch hes going to elevate and feel confident that he can score good possession coming out of halftime its now comes down to this thing can they sustain stops how many stops can you string together here in the second half PA off The Mark with his first three h a couple of those in the first half now the orange trying to claw their way back within single digits man its nice and soft backto back possessions same exact location way of getting to that point on the Music floor and the double figures with Music 11 and as it turns out they found a wide open Bill Covington Jr Covington not ready for the pass because hes an official not on scholarship with Clemson good shot by Judah minz getting right there to the nail and elevating up over the top may not have have that touch from three but he certainly has it when he gets to that P portion of the floor hands up Bill JJ Starling draws the foul and and JJs grabbing his right foot fou is called Jose Gerard Gerard picked up the foul its his Music first and hes reing the shoe lets have a look at this now jodas stepped on his foot and JJ appears to be none the worse for the wear mop up the deck shoes tied Starling will go to the free throw line you see a different level of aggressiveness though by Syracuse in the first three possessions here at start of the second half theyre getting theyre getting the ball where they want theyre forcing it to where they want it and thatll allow them to shoot a better percentage here in the second half but you got to make these opportunities when you go to the free throw line Starling a 72 shooter missed the first one had seven points in that first half its the first bucket of the game for the orange one of Applause two 4235 oh Gerard was wide open and cheffin the former High School quarterback couldnt quite pull the trigger on the pass Chase Hunter for three why take two when you can get three their their ball movement has been really Sensational tonight even in a missed opportunity where you could have had a wide open layup theyre patient enough Gerard curls off of it finds Hunter on the outside they go back to the Zone on this possession theres men to that spot and a little too high for brown itll be a turnover that ball movement again for the Tigers nine assists in the first half and you can see it gets swung multiple possess multiple sides of the floor right first side second side third side offense if you shift the defense multiple times in a shot clock youre probably going to end up with a high quality look 18 field goals theyve assisted on 10 of them so far theres the quick hands of the accs leader in Steels Mal Brown knocked it out of bounds Brad Brown L was talking about that this morning that in their first game he said PJ and shefflin would get rebounds and all of a sudden Brown would just pop it free for a moment just kind of in awe of the great hands on display he averaging over two steals per game men is second in the ACC and steals now Clemsons done a nice job for the first 22 minutes and 4 seconds in protecting the Applause basketball lets go Tigers theres an example right there Brown knocked it free from Hall and and that dislodge just changes the timing of the entire possession now theyre deep in the shot clock Halls going to have to let it fly from really deep got enough iron to reset the clock shefflin fighting for it itll be a tie up and possession arrow is in Clemsons favor but its a little thing but its its important and a great point that you brought up when when you can disl the ball from the offensive player whos either looking to reverse it drive it move it in a manner that is conducive to the offense you disrupt the overall flow because now the the guy that youre passing to the defense has recovered coming off the Baseline screen that that that option is no longer there it force that possession to be stagnant just by punching the ball away and theres a steal beautiful anticipation from brown to get that pass third turnover now Min Ducks inside Hall and oh finger roll Judah men showing all of the creative tricks he was angry going to the break he was mad he was pulling on his jersey he was looking at our cameras dont dont come dare me right now hes got six really quick points here to start the second half and sheins got Taylor buried and decides not to shoot it Gerard will he hes one of those few players in college basketball look he he doesnt even see you you close out youd be right there in his face he doesnt even recognize that youre there and he doesnt need a lot of space to get it shot off you know when JJ Reddit and Curtis Staples have made more threepointers in ACC history than Joe Gerard pretty good list Starling lets it Fly foot on the line the calling it are two theyll take a look at it to make sure thats its the moment 10 for Applause Music starling red ay on you saw him on the S he sort of trying to will his team to stay in the fight here shefflin lines it up three ball for Ian shefflin hes now into double figures with ten on his way to a double double with the way he works on the glass trading buckets is not a recipe to come back in a second half on the road lead is back to 12 the orange tur it over heres Jack Clark not quite type of pass to get Hunter a step in three so theyll take their time and run it and Ian cheffin goes bowling his way into Chris Bell not far from where dble Sweeney has said who believes that Chef be Steels leads this game in steals a game which features two guys a top the ACC in swipes and judt and Malik Brown Take into Syracuse at the half Guys Clemson is four 14 from three they are killing us in the paint we cannot give up anything in the paint to take away the paint Clemsons three of five from Beyond The Arc now back to the paint with Hall and chefin almost got that double double and PJ have hes not even going to argue with Pat Risco on that one ran in got our friend Bill raford old nickel dier there kind of running in and having a collision with a couple on Hall who probably worth noting with a 21point first half that is career high just uh kind of caught brown with the hand tried to pull back to late his career high is 31 set back in January against Georgia Tech that was a double overtime game though and a loss here one of the its one of the things about Clemson this year for all of the good wins and for the Improvement there have been a few loss is mixed in that you kind of scratch your head and go how did that happen how that happens is Chris Bell shoots and finally hes got a three going I mentioned over an eight game stretch Sean hes shooting well over 50 came into this game having hit 33 of his last 62 from Beyond The Arc and thats one of the first times he got a good look on that last position again Syracuse offense has been much better here as to start the second half than it was for a majority of the first half the ball movement is better theyve already doubled up the assists that they had in the first half but its this end of the floor theyve got a sustain stops you know you get it underneath 10 you 14 minutes left to go have plenty of time you get an eternity in college basketball but by the time you get to the 10minute Mark in the next four can you get it down to five and then you can start to feel really comfortable theyve scored 80 points or more in six of their last eight game so this is an explosive offensive team that can get points in bunches shot clock is getting deep Clark plent time takes his time and knocks down the three Jack Clark four of six from Beyond The Arc here to start the second half from Deep you just mentioned Clark hadnt scored hes done a lot of other things right coming off that piece with his grandfather he might have heard you and said okay Reese I got a three for you Syracuse by the Ways hit all six of its field goal attempts here in the second half and theres another one for Mintz one of the things Clemsons done a good job defensively doing is they have not allowed Judah minz to get to the free throw line only one one free throw attempted so far in this game but good ball movement here once again shot fake Bell goes flying by forces the long close out from the secondary defensive player and drills it last foul holding Joe Gerard was called on men its his first and good hands knocking it away keeping PJ Hall from having a dunk pretty sure it was brown who got a hand on it first no surprise there inside 14 minutes to play Syracuse final regular season game one more win than Clemson and the ACC standings both in the race for the fourth spot and the double bind the upcoming ACC tournament Syracuses body of work as it pertains to the regular season will be done at the end of the night no game this weekend weird to have a buy on the final weekend yeah somebodys got to get it but give you a little extra time before that Gauntlet in the ACC tournament this quader Copeland in Syracuse remain scorching here in the second half seven for seven from the floor and its a sevenpoint game Copeland remains extremely confident tonight like he is playing played with such good energy Off the Bench hter working on Starling juse showing they understand this new fangled mantoman defense as Clark goes in and scores again barks got five quick points to put him up to seven on the evening surpris Copeland didnt let that go never a bad time for a heat check withad here Maders been patient taking good looks and boy and yeah I thought I thought maybe Clemson had gotten away with that that was clearly a foul and Gerards going to get hit with it thats his second only the third team foul for the Tigers Brad Brownell whose team has threatened to pull away numerous times just havent been able to do it and PJ Hall gets beat to the basket by brown and has to foul Malik to keep him from scoring Browns movement without the ball whether its its a slip screen action in the half court from the top or actually screening and just rolling to the rim he can jab he create space with his movement and excellent job on an out of bounds underneath to earn the trip to the free throw line it is worth noting thats three on PJ hall now brown makes the first dont forget as soon as we done super Tuesday presented by Progressive takes you to Allen Fieldhouse number 14 Kansas taking on Kansas State the J Hawks a little battered and bruised not really their customary run still looking top four seed one with think in the NCAA tournament very capable especially they can get Kevin mcculler healthy talk about Hunter Dickens anding obviously in the inside dwan Harris one of the better lead guards in the country the key for them is getting production consistently out of Johnny Fury Chase Hunter passed up to three the first time probably got a better look that time but couldnt get it to fall you talking about a team that has no bench yeah thats Kansas not much of a margin for error theyre third in the country I think in minutes off the bench I think Air Force and tan are the only two teams in front of them you think thats the thing that will end up costing them in the tournament I because one off Night by one of those guys in the starting lineup all of a sudden now you get exposed a little bit oh about getting exposed the interior of that defense starting to get softened a little bit you mentioned foul trouble for Hall and how much does that change as far as rotation how they are able to defend he goes to the bench it opens up things around the rim Gerard answers in red arre seen that before and didnt like seeing it that time Clemson needed a bucket Gerard now up to 11 and the lead is back to Applause eight ify orange can continue this torid second half shooting hit eight out of nine Starling pulls up make it eight of 10 another rebound for shefflin whos got a big double double Applause tonight Gerard loses mens but Copelands there to stop copin almost takes it away Clemson fortunately fortunate to retain possession shot clock deep again RJ Applause Godfrey I think brown lost his shoe and mik just bailed out Clemson on that they said before potentially the Big East tournament and then before the NC of tournament an oblique injur jur hopefully hes going to be okay hes hes the best lead guard we have in college basketball this year and without him Marquette is an extremely different team and with him healthy whats their ceiling I think their ceiling could be final four given the right matchups I the way they play Shaka Smarts got a bunch of guys that play his style and are much more him M and kok is the leader at both ends of the floor on Applause that that was a what is commonly referred to as a miscommunication and that led to the seventh turnover of the game for Clemson you had two guys in the corner and they rather than either of them catching it knocked it out of bounds PJ Hall who had that huge first half hasnt scored in a second on the bench right now with three fouls air offensive rebound for the orange heres men whos had a great second half leaves it with brown but he got fouled on the drive and hell get to the free throw line as I mentioned he has not been there often tonight and you you talked about in the first half one of he gets the free throw line as frequent as any player in the country top 10 in free throws attempted and made on the season and only one so far so hell get to line for his second and third free throw but the level of aggressiveness that weve seen from Syracuse to start the second half they have an 82 advantage in points in the paint in the first 10 minutes thats a complete flip of the script from what we saw in the first half that is the 255th free throw that judan has shot this season but as you pointed out only the second tonight only went to the line twice in the first meeting have a chance to get his 10th point of the second half here seeing some fire for the sophomore from Fort Washington Maryland one of two Godfrey has the rebound sevenpoint lead for the Tigers inside 10 to play here in Little John Rees Davis Shan farum glad to have you with us on acc super Tuesday two teams fighting hoping to finish in the top four in the ACC standings Syracuse with a chance to have its best conference winning percentage in a decade how about a spinning inside Bucket from chony Wiggins thats his first score of the night he had a dozen on Saturday against Notre Dame and Clemson back out to a ninepoint edge men get shefflin in the air tried to draw the foul didnt get the call much to his chin wiggin driving again on Bell same spot spins back this time couldnt go shefflin with his 11th board puts it up and in man he just hes always there hes Old Reliable 12 and 11 tonight CU every time a shot goes up and you look in the paint I dont care what end of the floor youre on number four in white is standing there he may not get the board but his hands will touch the ball finishing third in the conference and and again we mentioned this off the top of the broadcast a large part of that is because of their success in the nonconference and the resume that they were able to put together I joked you last year it was the nonconference that kept them out of the NCAA tournament they made such a strong turn this year on their schedule there there is a happy medium between what they did this year and what they did last year buter copin another acrobatic shot this time it wont go Godfrey running ahead of the pack man in the air you got to worry with travel the travel and instead through the foul but you look at those standings and I think as you mentioned Clemsons a lock to get in the NCA tournament this year uh and obviously a a win tonight really helps that out but start looking at Wake Forest a little bit after backtoback losses they kind of took a lot of that shine off that win against Duke and now theyve got some work to do here in the final week of this regular season of course that match up with Clemson at wake Force this weekend and avoiding what would be a tough loss they still have Georgia Tech that also at home now Steve Forbes has done a great job with that team though some transfers like Hunter Salis Fon Reed those two guys from Gonzaga made a huge impact for the Demon Deacons you have Salis as newcomer of the year I do in the ACC heres men they need a bucket Judah tried to give it to him instead Malik Brown on the follow when you have a guard like Judah minz if youre a big just crash follow him down the lane because everybodys going to go with him right everybody hes the known on The Scouting Report youre trying you have an awareness of where he is therell be space to get offensive rebounds Chase Hunter knew it another three ball for the senior and the leads up to 14 and Chase has 13 its final game in Little John Coliseum six of nine from Deep here in the second half complete turn Saturday is what cost him they were five of 28 against Notre Dame theyve had a couple of games like that had a 1 for 18 night in the game against Carolina here the one they lost but when they final opportunity here so far and I mentioning this in the towards the end of the first half Syracuse had been great in first half of games and so effective efficient in their scoring that they needed to have a 60 type second half theyve done that the bigger problem though for them is their opponent shot 67 from the field here in the second half it has not been about the offens of struggles for Syracuse its been their inability to sustain stops in particular from Beyond The Arc Chris Bell hit only one threepointer which has been his strongu but got a short jumper to go Paul looking for his first two of the second half and hes got it and he checks right back in and goes right back to the block and just spins and Applause finishes Vader C who Scoops it up again hes got 14 Off the Bench I they have a couple of guys who are so crafty men moves sideways with the ball about as quickly as anyone Ive seen this year and Copeland just finds little crevices to get his shot up and he has the quick hands to get the steal mens now on the Run draws contact from Hunter and almost had a chance for the threepoint play but Judah will go to the line where he probably has to pay property taxes over the course of the year its kind of like us when we file our taxes we work in so many different states youre like okay how many games do I do in that state like his ability to get there in his Knack and and great job by Copeland though at both ends of the floor he gets the bucket hes frustrated he doesnt get a foul call instead just goes down and gets a steal at the other end and throws it ahead to Judah minz has had some struggles at the free throw line tonight though now just two of four Applause brother rolls in his 17th point of the night now PJ Hall as much time as he SP off we saw him on that first possession they got on the ball Id go right back to him here on this possession try to see if you can get him a Music touch inside six and a half to play PJ trying to discard thats the second time weve seen Clemson handle ball with two guys that close together and sort of treat it like its slathered in baby oil and wrapped in rattlesnakes what right out of bounds like you dont want to touch it okay cant handle it theres TJ Hall another rebound for the big F anything anything rattlesnake related by the way whether you put baby oil on it or not Im probably not going in just so you know me either do you know Andrea Carter has a pet snake yes I told I told her I did not care to meet it no and Bill Covington reaching there like before he calls the tell the travel hes telling Chase Hunter you grabbed him thats his third and thats what caused the Applause travel not sure Im with Bill on that one Im going to disagree I think thats one of those things that look A looked awkward you think surely someone made him do that Chris Bell started his high school career at myma moer D sou High School in Conquer California before going to wasach Academy a tremendous Talent at a very young age and has dealt with the spotlight and the pressure and I think his improvement over the year and Coach autrey told us hes he grown Leaps and Bounds defensively can it still get better yes theres no doubt about it but moving well without the ball competing more at the defensive end of the floor the ceilings still high for him I dont think hes close to it yet he added 10 lbs of muscle in the off season Wy does that again just an elite shooter twice this year hes had games in which hes hit eight three Music balls always animated what here Copeland my favorite thing about like the college kids now they think everything can get reviewed like cops going review that thats not a foul hes this isnt the NBA theres no button to push on the sideline that says hey lets review it Vader would have to settle for his third foul and his old teammate Joe Gerard might just have a a fourpoint Applause play every single time Syracuse has made a little bit of a run got it close Clemson has come back with the with the answer that foul was on cuff and Gerard completes the fourpoint play and Clemsons back up by 13 Joe has 15 against his former Applause Squad oh gets it knocked out by PJ Hall lot of emotion on the floor this spoonfed though I mean thats thats a Belles got to look in front of him and realize the person thats standing right there but thats a senior thats wanting to go out the right way for all the emotion in the building they didnt stop Malik Brown from just going right to the bucket Applause well hes a good looking sophomore too this red ays got some Talent got some pie now and look and how they played coming into this game if youre looking at this if you dont look at the entire resume and youre just looking like the last six games youre look at the Syracuse team youre like theyre an NCAA tournament team they looked apart they got good guards resume is going to hold them back though unless they can really do some damage in DC well the fact they dont have another game before then like they had to win this one and do some work I dont know how much work you can do in the ACC outside of winning it it might be true for them particularly but its been a successful season I Tre oh for sure and to differ because sheflin shefflin going back to his old football days it looked like he there was a collision down in the Applause corner trying to clean up a wet spot down in that corner eight on the shot Applause clock not the most ideal spot from which inbound the ball Gerards having trouble doing it to throw it all the way in the back court to Hunter and shot clocked at five Chase Hunter great stop and chefin another rebound and again he gets it tued away and red Ary is incensed on the sideline wanting a travel instead theres been a foul Music call thats three on Brown just not going Syracuses way theyre fighting hard and the emotion of the game you can kind of feel it the students that are literally less than 18 in behind us right now theyre feeding off the motion of the players and Syracuse is trying to respond too I mean shefflin just does such a great job of carving out space now did he get away with the travel Applause potentially but he is a load to box out and you go back and you see this Clemson team and then you see how they perform against opponents that arent familiar with their system in their noncom you start thinking this is a team that could easily advance in the NCAA tournament cheffin has 14 and 12 and mence now has 19 well hes just been spectacular in the second half that is the third jumper from the ACC logo that hes had in the second Applause half tough guarding Gerard Hall down to shefflin got a little bulk on Copeland can he get the shot up he can and he score make it 16 and 12 for Ian shefflin is nice to throw it inside and have two guys that you think are going to probably finish at above a 60 clip in the paint mens little sideways spin on that three ball and Syracuse might be on a last gas they desperately need a little spurt down 13 inside 4 minutes to go clamson trying to close the deal heres Hall took a little contact there no call PJ wanted the foul didnt get it theres Copeland and lets see which way they go here on this hill theyll talk it over and theyll call the Applause Music block the block call on Gerard is Clemson trying to hold on to a 13point lead Applause right here Copeland missed and of course shefflin got the rebound because who else would orange putting on some pressure in the back court 10second call now theyre going to going to ask if did they get the timeout and time yeah you get time out Applause before sare okay 10second violation itll be a turnover in Syracuse ball surprised him with that full court pressure there is that was a look of a man who was displeased with that turn of events as Brad Brownell is shaking his head right across the way from Applause Applause us Hunter its right up on Chris Bell which is a really good idea with the way he can shoot it Copan drives and Clark swats it away 47 on the shot Applause clock defending off the bounce has been an issue for Clemson at times and so when you have issues defending the ball off the perimeter you need great rotations and you need really good help side and awareness theyve done that for a large part of tonights game copelans got to let it fly he does just in time beats the clock and HS a three ball and its back to 10 hes got 177 points off the the bench he has had himself a g this time they beat the pressure Halls by himself and PJ dont you very much if youre going to press you beat the Press by pressuring the press to score Copeland at this time chaye Hunter running ahead of the Music Applause defense the Press worked really good that one time catch run it out and dunk cuff hits another three its his second of the nine Syracuse gets a quick timeout 30 second break here as Syracuse trying to pull off the miracle and Clemson trying to finish with 16 and 15 his double double Gerard and Hunter turned in 15 a piece no trouble getting it in now Hunter numbers if they want to use it they pull it out silver remain impressed by Syracuses ability to get deflections on the dribble they even got one on Chase Hunter there copin that long wingspan making it tough Hunter trying to put the final touches on this one in the final two minutes and it rolled out so 11point game just under two Syracuse going score quickly theyve got a chance and cuff does his third three and its back to an eight that was a rare zero pass possession by Clemson that last time down the floor there was Zero passes and what have we said all night long great ball movement has created open shots theyre Shifting the defense after pulling it out of the press they didnt do anything with it that allowed Syracuse to lock in defensively and then come down and hit the threepoint shot with a minute 41 left to go Clemsons got a couple of timeouts left here Syracuse with just one final 141 and this was a celebratory crowd moments ago little bit of nerves here as you take a look at the lineup Saturday big city greens live animated NHL telecast with the you love that Venture cartoon animation series absolutely ABC and ESP the Sonic Blockbuster one there I will be in Cameron indor for Sonic blockbuster college game day will be there in the morning starting at 10 eastern time NBA Saturday prime time Celtics and Suns on ABC at 830 eastern time and then UFC 299 World bantamweight championship between Al and Vera all coming your way on a great lineup on Saturday a variety of platforms here Clemson trying to get its 11th win in ACC Play Cant run the in line obviously the ball was inbounded so yous got to stay stagnant here it makes things a little bit more difficult against this press now they get it into the corner again the worst place you can get it but Gerard got rid of it quickly and red Entre did not want him def foul Joseph Gerard and theres a really good reason for that he shoots 95 from the free throw line hes 98 to 1003 think theame PJ Hall I have no idea why he was throwing that ball backwards by the way he just dribble once or twice youre over the timeline and it was almost a 10second violation again that foul by the way was on Copeland had a great night this is Applause four rare time when he grew some iron now made 100 free throws on the season 17 points tonight men creating space stepping back Gerard has the rebound and Clemson ought to be able to escape with a win its the Syracuse team thats fought him every step of the way first half it was primarily done inside second half its been done with a threepoint shot PJs wanting to dunk down there he was by himself for a Applause moment Brown L wanting everybody to spread out and Hunter go to work on Bell goes by and lays it Applause in I love that man almost fell down heres Copeland cuff again chefin another rebound and Clemson is going to get the win the 16th rebound for Ian chefin tonight really impressive performance by this Clemson team on sing night and the way that they performed and the Precision in which they played with and Judah Min is getting really close to getting a technical foul right Music now frustration Syracuse wanted this one they knew they needed this one and that four seed as you mentioned Syracuse will go home Clemson will have one more at wake Force coming up this weekend lot of tiebreakers to be sorted out for that spot in the ACC but adds an extra game to the plate and after this loss and this Miss opportunity might have been the case anyway but now Syracuse has to win the tournament its that simple Its Been a Good Year one would think Music anyway men hesitating that was like a guy taking a PK you know like when they go in to take a PK in the world cup and and all of a sudden they stop right beforehand and then they kick that was Nifty do you know what kind of strength not only in your legs but your core to hold yourself like that just still off that stride without traveling look at me do you think I know that strengthen my core because well me too but just because we might not be able to do it doesnt mean were not aware of it or can Marvel at it m shooting for his 20th point tonight just three of six from the free throw Applause line I really enjoy watching him play Im not going to lie about that hes had a great close to this season rolls it in 20 points on the night more work to be done obviously and Jack clar no trouble with the 10sec violation again see if Gerard tries to put the finishing touches on his old school instead hell be fouled coach off did you listen to me stop foul get said no foul no foul why dont you play aggressive defense but no foul and just out in front of everybody at the midcourt line you just giving him points at the free throw line especially if you foul this guy in his only season as a Clemson Tiger in his final game in Little John a walk out with a 20o night maybe 21 if you can roll this one in and now his crowd will pay tribute to a couple of their seniors PJ Hall three of them actually Chase Hunter Jack Clark theyll leave tonight with a victory in their 21st of the season a lot more basketball to be played for these guys in the ACC tournament in the NCAA tournament and now Gerard will get his walkoff Applause moment see it he finished with 21 Hall 25 Hunter 17 and Clark seven points but a complete floor game for the other senior and Clemsons going to end up winning this one comfortably as they can dribble it out the Clemson Tigers wanted to regain some of that momentum that they lost and its not just about getting the four seed its about bouncing back from the loss against Notre Dame when they make shots they are extremely dangerous because you know what youre going to get on the interior and when theyre hitting threes that margin starts to expand out a little bit more and this is a team that could be a second weekend team in the NCAA tournament this has been fun tonight
