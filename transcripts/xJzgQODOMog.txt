containing dribble drives in particular though taking care of the ball and keep those two out of transition interesting match up at the five as well as they jump Center I want to watch Lynn Kidd who leads the ACC in field goal percentage and is so much better this year and how he battles with Malik Brown Syracuse with it first Judah Min trying to post up Hunter Couture kills his dribble brings it back outside to Brown here is staring getting downhill as he does a little strong off the window and coming away with it is Shawn padulla good close out by Mintz P can shoot it as well as anybody MJ Collins also a key part in the back court Bobby Baron Lin kid the starting five for Coach young in the Hokies well theres why Lyn kid leads the ACC in efficiency shooting the basketball and all set up though by a great postentry pass that time lobed over the defense as we take a look at the starting five for Syracuse dou Virginia Tech and starts out in manto man again keing the ball screen defense four shot with five on the shot clock Bell missed it Shan padulla listed at 611 195 a junior from Edmond Oklahoma although he has New York Roots hes still got lots of cousins in New Jersey and in the greater New York City Applause area tough runner in the lane Off the Mark by Robbie Baron the Northwestern Brad transfer great job on the defensive glass that time blocking out by Syracuse heres Brown gathers goes up and thats why he shoots at such a high percentage and the key thing both these uh bigs call wings I they do so much post entry passes thats twice now both teams High lobbing post entry passes pinpoint all they had to do is Catch and Lay It Up Syracuse is coming off a rousing victory over Notre Dame on Saturday on Jim beheim day padulla misses the reverse 8885 the orange opened up a 29point first half lead and then held on for dear life JJ Starling was one of five double figure scores on Saturday hes got his first two here tonight thats the key right there transition G for Virginia Tech that time JJ staring just beat everybody up the court of these guards of Syracuse they are fast and they want to get up and down make or Miss Baron no long rebound Tracked Down by Justin Taylor who was so good in the win over the Irish and he has struggled so mightily with his shooting this year his teammates recogn a difference and that was a big part of what he did against Notre Dame not settling for the three which hasnt gone for him this year make a cut and have a teammate find you and brown that is a beautiful pass underrated part of Malik Browns game his casting ability thats a beautiful dime that time to The Cutting of Syracuse player again theyre going to need more of that paint touches and then get guys moving you know orange associate head coach Jerry mcnamer says Malik Brown is as good a passing big as there is in the country Hunter Couture with his first two points young man out of goth of Florida just outside of Orlando makes it 64 orange on top with a basketball this match up right here Couture against Jud and the whistle comes against Couture and so Judah Mintz who only Zack Edy in the country among power conf players goes to the free throw line more and Mike young is acutely aware of it his fifth yearss head coach at his hometown school hes a 60yearold native of Radford Virginia who Malcolm grew up going to hoke games Alan Bristo was his guy he loved watching Alan Bristo play in the early 70s as a hoke and now living a a dream come true now he played at emry and Henry College back in the 80s a D2 School in Virginia but at his heart at his core as a kid he was a ho he is and obviously that uh fits him doing a great job with this Virginia Tech program two NCAA tournaments uh postseason so again right going in the right direction but it starts with his back court Couture and padulla two of the best as weve seen around college basketball this year its a lot tougher to win as a road team and so far this season Virginia Tech has won only one true Road game they are one and eight out side of blackburg in two Road games thats a great job of transition D that time by Virginia Tech LEL potit into the game he Hedges Brown takes the pass kicks it out to Starling under 10 to shoot again tries to attack from the left side and again a little too strong off the window pure in transition in the same vein that Tech has to have good transition D so too Syracuse in spots like that yeah thats a break that time though anytime you give Couture that much space hes one of the better threepoint Shooters in the history of the ACC over 318 threes made in his career Browns pass deflected out of bounds Syracuse will have it when we come back in this late season Showdown the orange with a fourpoint lead over the Hokey ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Progressive Insurance bundle home and auto and save visit progressivecom really a remarkable moment and certainly one that I think they will remember for their life and we saw Andrew there doing his thing behind the Syracuse bench in anonymity except for when our cameras catch him and quader cand as Bell has to put it up again with a shot clock down hes now 0 for two Copeland continues to be that local guy in the Syracuse huddle on the floor and in the Locking he is and we got a chance to see him last night in practice here as we take a look at a beautiful post up by potit and again when he catches it that deep hes almost underneath the basket hes going to score every time great job fighting for position but back to your point about kopin he has turned into their vocal leader BR couldnt handle the pass from mince it goes out of bounds coming up next Texas squares off against Texas Tech over on ESPN and the app K 3000 Point score Max aith lead the Longhorns to a road upset in leit hokes with the basketball down by Applause two Tyler nickel to the North Carolina transfers come into the ball game number 23 in Chicago maroon and burnt orange a white letter andj Collins gets a friendly bounce and were tied at eight great job that time of footwork using that reverse pivit by MJ Collins under control then raised up over two DeMent and Collins plays such a big role in the back court so much is made about padulla and Couture but Collins is that guy who does a little bit of everything Bell gets tripped on his way to the basket and we saw some of the offense for Collins who averages about 6 and A2 points per game just a sophomore and it will continue to grow into a bigger role I would imagine in the coming years for Mike young yeah and again thats I think the key thing both these coaches Player Development uh get a guy in and they continue to get better yearoveryear offensive foul in illegal screen against Malik Applause Brown red ay not so sure he agrees well we had a pretty good look at it and Teddy Valentine right on that and I hard to argue that call again he got the leg out and certainly thats not a foul you want him getting right there just stay home cant have him getting into foul trouble padulla pulls the trigger nothing but Nets thats his three from the corner to put Tech on top well I love the comment by Mike young he said he has no break hes all gas and Ill tell you what he is one of the better scorers uh in college basketball you give him any airace he will make you pay well after the practice last night as nickel goes in off balance Taylor with a rebound pulla told us you know I hope they do better than the last time I was here I had a great shoot around the game the night before last years game with then was really bad shooting the ball he had a great shoot around last night early today well he looked good on his first shot attempt well I didnt see him Miss many last night in practice we were at it so again uh maybe hes looking for a change of events Len kid right to the rim again points back to padulla who picks up the assist whats happening and both teams are utilizing their bigs theyre setting high ball screens at the center of the court and theyre diving them right down the middle of the lane and the help is not there so again its all set up though both teams doing a great job spacing the floor Starling gets it back from Brown working on foua mince pulls from three he wanted the call didnt get it Virginia Tech with it on top by two Collins Slams on the brakes left it short and Brown tracks down the rebound thats a great contest that time by JJ staring no surprise Teddy Valentine and Judah mins having a conversation coming up mince has it poked Away by padulla hes on the floor Syracuse peeps Starling finds Bell no change of possession so the shot clock at eight as bell Miss fires that shot went down it would have been set up by juds hustle twice in that possession diving for a loose ball keeping possession for Syracuse nichel air ball our officials tonight the forementioned teddy Valentine John gaffy Tommy morresy working this Tuesday night game inside the JMA Applause Music down darling inside Brown cares out space and has the easy Deuce Doug early on Ive been impressed both teams postentry passes The Bigs have gotten easy opportunities because the wings and guards have done a nice job passing the ball and entering into the post linkid off the feet from fedula had it taken away great quote from Mike young yesterday he said what can we run to not involve Malik Brown he is so good at poking basketballs away on defense and there was another instance Bell hanging in the air for two and I would agree with that Malik Brown so key to them both ends uh but especially the defensive side he does so much on their rotations rebounding and rim protection neither team is shot it well early from the perimeter Oki one out of four orange one out of five and with that we have another media timeout competitive start to the ball game its a twopoint Syracuse lead Jud Min getting into the act as Music well well Virginia Tech has done a nice job of identifying opportunities to score inside in the Clemson transfer ly kid has been excellent so far yeah look at the post entry passes right here poti two feet in the lane thats got to change if youre Syracuse and then right here again another nice post entry pass by padulla to kid again the spacing has created that those opportunities for those bigs to get points in the paint there you see the hokes what we were talking about earlier only one true Road Victory and it really is puzzling sometimes why their shooting doesnt travel as well I mean padulla and Couture are both tremendous Shooters Couture especially and yet theyve never either of them had a good shooting game in this building yeah and if you look at the numbers in their uh Lost first pit three of 20 from the threepoint line 15 and certainly again thats something that cannot happen if they want to get a road on the win against a Syracuse team like themselves that is playing for a spot pulla says my fault I dont think he recognized how low the shot clock was when he gave the ball up to poti so no basket its a shot clock violation the other part of that Malcolm is that Syracuse defensively on the perimeter is not very good they are last in ACC play at 39 so you would think the combination of that porous perimeter defense and the way the Hokies can fill it up potentially could spell Doom for uh for the orange but you know shooting comes and goes and their loss at Pittsburgh on Saturday the hokes were only 3 for 20 so again theres another road game where it just didnt travel from blackburg yeah and I think also I think for Syracuse that number you alluded to opponent shooting close to 40 from the threepoint line a lot of that with men again not gambling staying solid hes done that early on in this game not giving those open looks up theres mince finishing with the left hand got to step on Collins hes so good getting to the Lane and thats a concern and problem for Virginia Tech containing those quicker guards off the bounce seven points for Min to lead all scores you see the scoring drought for the hok now over three minutes poti draws the foul on the reserve big just into the game Peter kry and so potit who is every bit of the 265 Hes listed will go to the line for a threepoint play grown man move right here again take the hit through contact and he has been huge for them F providing that post presence I think the problem right now again for Peter KY whos in the game right now and also Malik Brown you cannot let him get two feet into paint but he is just too big and strong if he catches it with two hes either going to score or youre going to have to bring a double team quick potit began his college career as a rice owl he is twice once at rice and once with Virginia Tech earlier this season scored 18 points for Tech carry fights for his own Miss Syracuse retains possession Min draws the foul and hell head back to the free throw line thats great work by carrye again keeping that play alive and then Jud mens doing what he does hes one of the best in college basketball and getting to the free throw line again so Shifty so crafty knifing through the lane tops in the ACC in free throws attempted and free throws made this year top 10 in the country in those categories can there be a point Malcolm where somebody like Judah minz tries too hard to draw fouls and get to the line or no uh never and I think thats where hes at his best attacking again in particular in transition uh but in their half court I like that hes not settling a four jumpers youre either going to draw the defense and kick to a teammate or try to get to the free throw line or score for yourself well that is Bens equation this year now nine points to lead all scores hes only shooting about 30 from three on the year defensive breakdown Syracuse catches a break as Bell recovered defensively and the orange Come Away With It heres Kyle cuff gets around pulla right to the basket what a move by the former Kansas jhawk you can see thats what Syracuse wants to do turnovers are on miss baskets get out in transition and run well he has carved a roll for Coach arrey with this short bench hes been practicing well and they love his toughness and theyve rewarded him and that toughness on display right there in transition and we got a chance to take a look at him last night in practice and the key them energy I think thats what he brings when coach ay goes to the bench hes in there to provide that energy and you can see it on that last play come up with the loose ball push the pace and get a transition bucket padulla at the line an 80 shooter makes the first yeah kff Jr I dont know did you play against his dad Kyle senior at St Johns he he played for Mike jarous or maybe it was a little after you were at Boston College well you are you trying to age me I mean I think but no I did not play against his dad uh but again its sad when uh youre getting up there in age and you see guys out there and said hey uh I played against your dad you and my dad played against each other that happens to all of us welcome to your Music 50s Justin Taylor back into the game for Syracuse heres C taking the dribble handoff from carry Jack clock at six Copeland back to who Rises up and connects that was the best half court possession of the game thus far early on for Syracuse very patient good spacing ball went left to right and then they got a wide openen look well both these teams fancy themselves as Bubblicious what does Mr Bracketology think about it we will hear from Joe lonardi on the latest about both the orange and the hes when we come back March and I think its so key as were going to show some of the standings and the brackets going into the ACC tournament still a lot to play for both these for both of these teams wer Copeland draws an oo and an a from one of the announcers and about 20000 people in the building shot clock down to six now quader is going to call his own number off the window Syracuse now six of its last seven from the floor and the dribble penetration continues to be an issue for Virginia Tech again shot clock winding down unable to keep uh the ball out of the paint mince what a finish Jud Min Jud man body control off the charts right here hes going up the dunk great anticipation on the steel and then watch him take the contact eyes on the rim the entire time that is beautiful body control and finish and one for Jud Applause Min seven different Syracuse players already in the scoring column theyve got five averaging double digits during conference play mince leading the way first to double figures here tonight and the lead extends to double Applause digits well a couple things early on that Virginia Tech was doing a good job of this right here they need to get back to that and then transition defense and keeping the ball out of the paint on this last three to four minute stretch that has been PL problematic o slicks the double team hangs in the air and goes all George gerin on it a nice finger roll to make it 3120 Syracuse and thats a great split of the screen that time by Copeland and again the help is late because of the spacing andj Collins with a lefthanded shot Here Comes Copeland again one on Three what will he do goes a little Southwest Philly on us but misses the shot now weve got couple of them tied up theyre both okay Copeland gets up helps Robbie Baron back up as play continued get a whistle down at the other end great show of sportsmanship right here again and again you like to see this obviously no ill will two guys just going going after it and and helping him up but right now 11point lead for Syracuse and Malik Brown back into the game and I think those minutes that Peter kry gave greet arrey Off the Bench really huge thats something he talked about getting that production when he goes to his bench just give me four or five good minutes great back door pass and the Slam by Hunter Couture give the assist to Robbie Baron Couture showing off off the Hops all set up though because hes such a great threepoint shooter you try to overplay beautiful pass thats going to be an offensive foul on tuck over his shoulder and standing there waiting for it was Couture and you you reference Couture off the ball as we take another look at his defense is he the best in the ACC Malcolm at moving without the basketball he really is Young Players every time you watch a Virginia Tech game watch Hunter toward number zero for Virginia Tech watch him move without the ball again 318 threepoint field goals made hes the leader at Virginia Tech pass Malcolm Delaney but watch him move without the ball fer Copeland trying to stay with him after fighting through the screen heres poti lost it regains orange with it by the way that foul was on Kyle cuff you saw he take a took a seat with the his third personal mince gives to Brown gets it Applause back under five minutes remaining in the half Starling hes so good at the midrange and you know the last 12 games hes averaging nearly 18 points a night and they will do that again if they feel they have a mismatch they just break off the play let JJ Starling or Jud Min go to work excellent offense early by syus mature blocked by Starling looked like he had a clear path down the lane mince takes his time little slowmo Euro and able to finish back to Super Tuesday presented by Progressive with mol Huckaby Im Doug Sherman little end to end action Syracuse turning that defense into offense yeah and thats really the name of the game right here in transition off of Misses on turnovers this is where they are lethal we talked about it in the open Judah men one of the best in the open court right there with the Euro Step and finish so we talked about Syracuses resumee its not great but the reality is they are still in consideration for a possibility to get into the field to 68 you know those 18 wins so far for red ay in his first season as head coach are the most in the regular season for Syracuse in 5 years its been a really strong first year for the rookie head coach hes done an outstanding job and really the job that hes done with this back and then you look at the guys that have come off the bench how they provided some option for him really again in his first season red ay and Staff jery Mack uh and Coach Allen as well too doing a great job with this program they got those two quadw wins the best came here a couple of weeks ago against North Carolina as Starling puts it through and then the other quad one win on the Syracuse resume is at Pittsburgh and so you know its not what some other teams have but but they dont have the bad losses on the other end and theyre hanging around and as we said in the words of the immortal Al Davis just win baby Chan padulla hits the three he is so tough again uh one of the better guards not just in the ACC but in college basketball right now sixth in scoring points per game in the ACC close to 17 Again you give him any air space but he is a difficult match up inside the men trying to post up on padulla well padulla is not going to back down he is New York tough and uh he was proud to talk about that last night the uh the battles with his brothers in the driveway in Edmund Oklahoma he said the people of Oklahoma would look at them and say youre a little different hes like yeah were not here just to play were here to play and to win Judah minz just trickled off the iron no look inside Taylor does doesnt come down with it and lays it in off the feed from Copeland Copeland is one of the better passers in the ACC that is a beautiful dime again lookoff alyu pass to Taylor 10point passing and thats what he brings to this Syracuse lineup kit draws a crowd of white shirts now brown defends by himself Oakland with a burst right to the r we talked about transition defense uh its been a problem in this game uh but Copeland first with the dime to Taylor and then in transition my goodness Copeland almost taken off the credit coach red ay Jerry Mack Allan G Griffin the job theyve done Player Development but also to Copeland sticking around he could easily left yeah stuck around and he is the heart contr his team in terms of the verbal communication he is their leader and their focal leader theres a great set coming out of the timeout kid with the dime and the easy layup by Robbie Baron and theyre going to need more of that Virginia Tech again Syracuse a team very aggressive in the passing Lanes again we talked about it they lead the ACC in steals but theyre going to try to get out into passing Lanes those back door cuts are going to be there celand going oneonone you know hes every bit of 6 s and he sees Robbie Baron trying to check him and hes like I can go and thats again continues to be the problem area for Virginia Tech they just cant keep guys out of the paint whether its in transition or in the half court thats got to change nice feed inside Baron goes up and over but he couldnt find the range bar took a hard ball there slow to get up and slow to get back andj Collins back into the game for Tech Couture tried to hang with Starling who misses final minute of the first half the Hokey trying to finish strong before heading into the locker room heres padulla off the screen and he misses badly Syracuse will get the basketball back only a few games remain in the womens basketball regular season Thursday weve got two of the biggest on the schedule Elizabeth kitley and number five Virginia Tech take on freshman Phenom Hannah Hidalgo and number 17 Notre Dame at s Eastern on ESPN then on ESPN 2 Angel Reese and number n LSU will square off against Georgia well we talked about whos going to win the ACC rookie of the year on the mens side we pretty much know whos going to win it on the womens side Hannah hadalo for Notre Dame has won 11 ACC rookie of the week Awards is unbelievable I I would say uh yeah thats going to be pretty easy one to make and right now in this first half if youre red ay you have to be pleased with how your team has defended and then gotten out in transition and really have been unselfish with the ball un is led the way hes got 16 points timeout Syracuse well take the break with him and be back to the dome in 30 seconds Doug uh Syracuse with the 4527 lead uh but their defense uh take a look at this play right here again uh look at Copeland hes guarding MJ Collins now he knows 27 from the threepoint line padulla one of the better threepoint Shooters he breaks off his defense to go contest that shot and forc an airball thats a great job of recognizing who you need to be out on and then also understanding The Scouting Report great job a team defense that time mince gives the foul before padulla can shoot Syracuse had a foul to give and so now the hokes will inbound from in front of the scores table Padulas got it 6 seconds 5 Seconds badulla has an opening pitch to The Corner Collins beats the buzzer but the hokes road struggles continue and for the third straight game Syracuse heads to the locker room comfortably in front they had to hang on to win to beat NC State and Notre Dame can out for NC State Notre Dame to not only get back in the game but almost win those games so does the message get home from coach ay coming out right now that youve got to keep playing in the second half we were in practice last night and that came up uh as they were going over the game plan for Virginia Tech uh he said its 40 minutes in particular though the first 5 minutes of the second half Syracuse won the Battle of the boards in the first half 18 to 11 something the orange have not done much of this season padulla has it taken away and thats been key right there again guarding p padulla and also Couture well those two guys again one of the better back courts in the ACC they did a pretty good job in the first half Jud Min leads all scores with 16 points heres his back court mate JJ Starling 43 and in talking to him after practice last night he acknowledged that he was a little too differential when he got here transferring in from Notre Dame trying to fit in but he said the biggest turnaround the last two months has been the everyday work as Lynn kid slams at home the everyday work outside of practice hes been putting in with Jerry McNary thats a pretty good guy to learn from uh he certainly could fill it up but you can see the confidence I think the biggest thing is the confidence again uh hes always been a talented player but hes playing and shooting with no hesitation yeah and I said to him as a Layman heres Starling getting to his spot as he can do nor Donalds AllAmerican last year at Notre Dame you were First Team all or you were all ACC all rookie team how does your confidence waver but it just happens to the best of them well I think also too youre coming into a new system obviously youre playing alongside another highscoring guard in through to men it took a while I think for him and also men to figure out how to play off of each other you can see that now and theyre combining for one of the better back courts not just in the ACC but in college basketball when they get it going in particular in transition they are very difficult to match up against Starling a 64 sophomore from nearby Baldwinsville played three years for the Baldwinsville bees before transferring to the Midwest but dou with the steel Mak sure Starling cant get to him with that little shoulder and he gets the easy layup thats a great use of the body that time by padulla and in that first half again that wasnt an issue for Syracuse PCH got into the paint as easily as that dumps it off and brown has the layup and thats obviously not a strength of Virginia Tech in particular against these quicker guards trying to pick up full mat after a good close out by Bell ball goes through count it and so Robbie Baron gets credit for it 1734 remaining in the second half the Syracuse lead is 17 thats a great job by Baron on the glass and again T took two people with him leaving Baron wide open for that offensive rebound putback Here Comes Bell who had a quiet first half only scored a couple of points and Justin Taylor unsung again for Syracuse not settling for threes anymore he had 4 point six rebounds in that first half and on Q Bell gets another twopoint shot both of them not just living on the threepoint line yeah great job moving without the ball that time by Bell poua able to finish with the left hand obviously if youre Virginia Tech you cant just trade buckets with Syracuse they got to do a better job it starts though uh with keeping the ball out of the paint thats something theyve been unable to do but throughout this game thus far catch and shoot for Bal good job to crowd in by Hunter Couture Colin steps into a three and knocks it in nice Rhythm to that shot for the sophomore from Clover South Carolina and his shot looks good again came into this game shooting 27 percent from the threepoint line thats nice footwork coming off for pend down and a big three to try to cut into this Applause deficit they find Bell open in the corner that is his shot seven points five quick ones here in the second half for the sophomore from conquered California red arrey has to be pleased with that last possession again ball went left to right extra pass Robbie Baron on second effort Taps it in Taps his own chest to say sorry teammate I just cost you an assist just like that again 15 points uh Virginia Tech hanging around trying to cut into this deficit and we talked about it second half concentration for Syracuse ke Starling frees himself from 17 heaten up in the second half now 11 points for Starling quick answer at the other end by padulla he is tough again thats not bad defense uh by Judah mens thats a guy switching midair to his left hand Taylor was fouled on the shot and so he will shoot two look at his ball Movement by Syracuse Bell with the corner three Syracuse still showing some good ball movement but then on the other end padulla with the tough finish of Syracuse basketball course beheim was said coach for 47 years but uh what red be uh red beheim red ay has has done you know theyve already won 18 games they could easily win 20 and they are still in the mix for a possible NCAA tournament bid and you know this 18 10 record right now thats the most wins for Syracuse in the regular season in five years well I had a chance to speak with Seth Greenberg before this game and red got his start in college coaching at Virginia Tech under Seth Greenberg and he said look it always stuck out with me how good he was in practice and we got a chance to watch him operate last night in practice we see him working his team right now but obviously uh playing for a Hall of Fame coaching and spending so much time under coach beheim as well afterwards obviously theres a lot of knowledge of that red austrey has picked up doing a great job first year with this Syracuse team and you know what Malcolm and weve talked about it off air five to shoot fell fir you know its not always easy transitioning from associate head coach to head coach and how you carry yourself conduct yourself and we saw after the last game in the press conference coach a sticking up for his players and in particular Justin Taylor and then we have seen more fire from him in game as The Seasons gone on we saw some of that fire lob inside for brown during that last timeout and it just its not a fate of compete that youre going to move one chair over and just immediately know what to do and how to do it and how to talk and relate to players that were always your best friend or good friend when you were the assistant it just takes time and he seems to be making that transition way he does and its certainly right now team doing a great job defensively but Ill tell you what Hunter Couture 39 threepoint field goals made uh his footwork and his movement off the ball some of the best in college basketball that is a tough three as he just ran all over the half court and buried a three who touched it last padulla is going to be called for it Bell was close pulled his hand back and then looked at the nearest official John gaffi and said I didnt touch it wasnt me but back to my point on Couture again just so remarkable what hes been able to do and amazing that he originally committed to wford and hes talked about it look he was content with that and obviously Mike young gets the a Virginia Tech job he goes with him and hes turned into one of the better guards and the history of ACC not just Virginia Tech but what hes been able to do in his numbers Aur picks up his third foul John gaffy telling him what he got called for and hes part of a long list guys who fouled Judah mints Juda will head to the line to shoot a pair two of the top teams in the Big 12 square off Saturday in our ABC mens basketball featured matchup seventh right Kansas squares off against number 15 Baylor coverage begins at 1 Eastern noon Central Jayhawks been making do without a Kevin mcculler Jr as they gear up the Big 12 tournament theyve got other options but Kansas will be a threat come tournament time and you know what nice feed inside malel poti on the pass from Couture you know the big dance pass a little too call starts 3 weeks from tonight we are getting close three weeks from tonight and games will be played in Dayton Ohio pulla now with 16 points and some of his finishes that one right there a little running hook high up over Malik Brown just like that a Virginia Tech trying to get this thing to within single digits now what was a 21point lead is down to 14 similar patterns as we have seen recently for Syracuse Copeland misses Brown had it knocked out of bounds to Virginia Tech the hokes just keep coming so at this point does it start to creep in at the Syracuse bench like uhoh here we go again well I think it starts on this end right here again but theyve done a good job thus far in this game El limiting the threepoint opportunities but they got to obviously could in on this guy right here otit and brown get tangled that foul is going to go against Syracuse to the Chagrin of the faithful in Orange back to the he said look I drove on to the campus but good meet with the coaches and obviously not too many folks around out and about but uh sign with him and the rest is hist grou grew up in Edmund Oklahoma as an Oklahoma State Cowboys fan looks the double team finds his Marksman in the corner and I tell you what coach young raises both of his arms in Triumph a beautifully run set coming out of the timeout all set up by padulla who also leads them in assist as well too thats a beautiful d time you cant set it up any better dribble Drive pitch it to the corner for a wide openen three Thea called for the foul thatll send figher Copeland to the line just the first foul on padulla yeah both his parents are native New Yorkers his dad was actually a lefthanded pitcher at forom University class of 82 hes now Dr Dom padulla a cardiologist in Oklahoma City but he and the whole family still New Yorkers at heart New York fans but uh they are watching from home tonight here on ESPNU he does have cousins in the metropolitan area Northern New Jersey but uh it is something the toughness that he brings is apparent and whether you want to assign that to his New York City roots or not he is you know he looks like a choir boy but he is tough as they come out there you could tell by the way he plays there is uh nothing sof about him at all love his toughness and his ability to score and score through traffic and through tough defense really impressive opening into double figures lead back to 13 here is padulla Tyler nickel into the game Lin kid doing Lin kid things tonight his stat line seems like every night is efficient on both ends Copeland going to be called for the foul just second against the orange in the first N9 minutes of this second half and Lin kid four five shooting 87 rebounds just another night and does and and does it such a quiet fashion again you would never know that stat line but thats what he does does all those little things for his Virginia Tech Team you know he wasnt even a starter on his high school basketball team but theres a reason for that Lyn kid went to IMG and was a backup for get ready Zack Edy Jaylen Johnson Mark Williams Musa diate and Brandon Huntley Hatfield I just want to know whos playing that team he was a top 100 recruit in spite of not starting at IMG and had a couple of nondescript years at clemon for really blossoming in blackburg mince strong to the hole Couture got a piece Brown knocks it out of bounds Hokes basketball well the defense has tightened up and thats been the adjustment for Virginia Tech theyve limited those easy dribble drives and uncontested the layup by Syracuse now theyre trying to still get this thing to within single digits dribble hand off to nickel from kid who sets the screen for Couture Kyle cuff fights through that screen inside the kid and what do you know another lefthanded layup for number 15 in BT orange and Couture has done that multiple times again he does a such a great job moving without the ball hell bring two Defenders with him and then hit L kid with a little slip screen that time nice pinpoint passing by Couture and that defense you talked about for Virginia T had held Syracuse without a field goal until that for almost four minutes but Judah Min with a runner give him 20 points on the Applause night nichel puts it up off the back iron Min quickly up ahead cop Virginia Tech gets back cop spin missed the reverse everything but the Finish Now red a telling his team to get back they do and now the hes will run some offense H posting up on Brown love this match up tonight kid goes to the left hand again and finishes again thats great job of Patience by Virginia Tech nobody came for Syracuse he waited to see if theres a dig or double took his time thats a nice little soft jump hook well kids best game statistically he went 14 of 15 for a careerhigh 31 points against American nickel blocks the shot the hokes can get back to within single digits Couture dribbles through the defense and lays it in 6758 and thats what happened late in the Clemson game gambles well if youre duude Deens again youre not trying to steal the ball from Hunter Couture just keep him in front of you dont give up those easy dribble drives padulla went to the deck as judin made the midrange shot looks like Padulas okay and again if youre Syracuse right here no need to gamble for skills just make the ball in front of you for contested shots do his pass a little low kid able to gather again he spins to the left hand scores again ly kid once again makes it a ninepoint game they found the matchup they like and theyre just continuing to go at it Chris Bell one and done with a quick three for Applause Syracuse I think thats a quick uh jumper again run clock if youre Syracuse you get that shot any time adula hes able to get right to the basket uncontested timeout going to be called by Red ay as the folks in the dome are getting restless the hokes back to within seven can they finish the comeback on the road Virginia Tech run hes done a little bit of everything but in this last three minute stretch his offense right here nice pass by Couture the great hands to finish and then they continue to go at the Malik Brown matchup nice spin over to his left uh right shoulder and he is continuing uh to be patient and hes getting high percentage shots but he has been the difference in this last 5 minutes stretch to cut this deficit to seven well Syracuse controlled the glass in the first half 18 to 11 but its been all Tech in the second half 12 to5 and so the battle of the boards is even the energy of Mike Youngs Club has been better here in the second half than Syracuses energy couple things Virginia Tech has kept the guards of Syracuse out of the paint on the other end Syracuse has been unable to control the paint kid and then also padulla and cure have been able to get into and get high percentage shots lets see where Syracuse goes out of the Timeout tff on the floor with mince Copeland Brown and Bell tend to shoot well that worked good action to find brown right down the lane for the slam Brown so crafty went like he was going to set a hard ball screen and just slipped it Syracuse with the takeaway Copeland to mince but he missed it big sequence here if the poys can cash in team had his shot pinned by Bell back and forth they go give it to copelan mince with the di Collins misses the three Brown rips the rebound away what a blockout up by Mal round to keep poti off the offensive glass Tech playing without ly kid coming out of that break and Syracuse has tried to retake control celand missed it gets it back FES the pass around Applause poti on the switch Brown doesnt take the shot inside instead its fell from the Applause corner nickel for three got it back to an eightpoint game and righted ay hot right there again simple pin down no communication the Bigs either got to step out and hedge or Bell has got a lock can Trail harder clean look that time for nii mince crosses over padulla and is able to finish 24 points for the sophomore from Fort Washington Maryland well he makes that look so easy but that is a difficult finish with the left hand through traffic poti gets it back strong to the bucket for the dunk all set up by Hunter Coutures movement without the ball again multiple times because hes moving so much hes forcing the big to have to come out and hedge and then hes making some pinpoint passes off those little slip screens its looking to go oneonone with padulla able to finish again gets to that left hand the fifth leading score in the ACC now up to 26 points eight better than his per game Applause average Couture spins away from cuff under 10 on the shot clock under four remaining on the game Fly Collins backing down tck no potit on the offensive Applause glass the senior from Reedsville North Carolina is putting together a really good night for the hokes who are back to within eight poti and both lent and Len kid have provided excellent opportunities on their offensive glass for Virginia Applause Tech okis have done a nice job getting out on the shooter Bell tonight good close out there by Couture and weve got a foul on the floor that will will take us to break but Malik Brown has done a little bit of everything for this sycu team with the block and then Copeland with the beautiful finish off the alleyoop Couture continues to show his pinpoint passing Syracuse though up eight making four of their last eight Hunter Couture always in the middle of that the alltime lead Le threepoint shooter in program history and youll remember two years ago he was the ACC tournament MVP when he put 31 points on Duke in the championship game Victory a big game player yeah both he and padulla more than capable of going off for 30 plus as is Starling and Judah menz mince draws the contact and hell have a chance for three 28 points in counting for mins career high is 33 and that takes us to our next media timeout ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Progressive Insurance bundle home and auto and save visit progressivecom 28 points eight assists or six assists three steals for Judah Min who is trying to seize control of what would be a third straight Syracuse Wing well this is what he does uh hes one of the best at scoring the ball in the paint difficult Runners and floaters so quick and Shifty he makes it look easy but for me Doug uh he set the tone defensively as you take a look at an and one he set the tone defensively in that first half against a very good back cour of Virginia Tech and I think that is the reason why they had the big lead going into the half one of the other things he does is get opponents guards in foul trouble Hunter Couture just picked up his fourth foul mince has drawn five fouls and so now with that threepoint play he has the Syracuse lead back to 11 Copeland saves it to the back court nichel wins the race to the ball Applause now Collins with Applause it nichel turns shoots left it short back to nichel hell try from De and JJ Starling has it pulled away from behind by padulla Collins wide open and now Starling secures the basketball three pretty good looks of for Virginia Tech cant ask for more wide open looks Nicholls and Collins and just unable to convert and now Syracuse going to run some clock Starling didnt see the pass coming from Copeland nearly took it off the Applause nogin Collins has it poked Away by who else Malik Brown it is remarkable as he leads the ACC and steals per game he may not get credit for that steal but its amazing how many many times he deflects it away some of the quickest hands Ive seen again in the post in the passing Lane it seems like hes got his hand on almost every pass that Virginia Tech has made around him five to shoot kman lobs Brown the down beautifully executed by Syracuse padulla Applause Music Syracuse has it with a minute 20 and on top by 13 the Hoke he still giving Applause Chase heads up play that time but by Starling not to take that shot again obviously still runs some clock staring gets downhill and lays it in hes got 13 and Syracuse putting this thing away what has already been the best regular season for Syracuse basketball in five years is nearing a 19th Victory Lyn Kidd scores again and the timeout called from the Virginia Tech bench 16 points for lin kid and then getting out in transition because of their defense to me that is going to be the story line of this game Malik Brown 12 points on six of seven shooting eight rebounds and again Rock Solid on defense hes credited with two steals so far tonight and the hokes content down 13 to just let Judah minz dribble out their shot clock and this crowd of 20000 244 appreciates the effort here on a Tuesday night in central New Applause York and theyre also going to appreciate a warm walk back to their cars its late February and it was 70° here today well I tell you what snow hot outside uh coach red ay and staff uh certainly uh will be pleased with the effort of that there team put together but make no mistake about it Jud men had himself a night 29 Points perfect eight of eight from the free throw line I think this you number right here Doug six assists in that game it wasnt just about him scoring he set his teammates up with some easy opportunities uh to go along with excellent defense in that first half really great allaround four game for Jud menck Syracuse to a big lead in the first half bent but didnt break in
