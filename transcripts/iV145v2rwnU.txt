officials tonight Bert Smith Ry Steines and Tony Henderson and Georgia Tech controls the opening tip this is a yellow jackets team while theyre three and eight in the ACC the three wins have come against UNC Duke and Clemson those are three teams in jool lardys projected field theyre three of the four top teams in terms of the net ranking in the ACC starting lineup for Big Forest Hunter Salis is the accs third leading scorer he went for 24 last time out cam hilr at 19 against Georgia Tech last year and Fon Reed the big man in the middle to transfer from Gonzaga Miller is lightning quick gets a step and cannot finish we had really good ball movement that time and thats what they want they want to move the ball and move the players against this Georgia Tech manto man starting five for Georgia Tech Miles Kelly Techs leading scorer went for 20 and 10 Saturday against NC State by Dongo has not been a factor the last two games got hurt early against North Carolina last week and then on Saturday was in foul trouble before fouling out against NC State kaasi Reeves who hit 43 Saturday opens the scoring tonight and Georgia Tech can be a dangerous threepoint shooting team in ACC play theyre making more than nine a game wake has had it struggles on the road hildr for shot Reed gets it back big to Big Carr banging down low wake is on the board this is a wake team you watch them at the Joel Its one type of Team theyre 12 and0 at home on the road theyve lost four straight only one true Road win this season and we talked to Steve Forbes about it he said hes not making a big deal about it with his team but hes felt some second half lapses with turnovers sloppiness and on the boards has led to some of those Road losses well they had a chance against Florida State they had a chance against North Carolina State they had a chance against pit and to be perfectly honest with you I think they got out toughed at the end of all those games and so Steve Forbes yes hed like him not to be sloppy but hed also like him to be a little bit tougher George no good the rebound to hildren Yellow Jackets back on defense and a foul theyre going to get danana you problem with toughness on that guys part hild well you mentioned toughness when we spoke to Damon statamire at shootter around he said we want to make this a physical game we know wake is good we know theyre a finesse team we know they can score they want to challenge wake physically and I think thats a pretty good strategy but you got to worry about foul Applause trouble one of the interesting things Ive seen here in the mantoman defense that Wake Forest is playing its Andrew Carr whos matched up against against Dongo so they dont Steve Forbes has decided at least to start hes not having Reed go against Dongo trying to keep Reed out of foul trouble and Dongo actually picked up that Applause foul oh with the bo both big men Dongo and Reed foul trouble is a concern well it is and Reed sometimes picks up some silly fouls I I think that if he would avoid those silly fouls he wouldnt have the foul problem so well have to see Kelly off that 2010 game no good rebounded by wake demon deakon the best defensive rebounding team in the ACC also the best threepoint shooting team of the conference Salis the Gonzaga transfer coming off a 24point game hes got two and Salis is very good at getting into the that lane for that midrange jumper and what a job by hild to just push the ball up the court Reeves using the shot fake driving on Carr stood up battle for the board and its ripped away by Andrew Carr the senior from Westchester Pennsylvania that was great defense by Carr going straight up Carr backing down Dongo they go right back to him dangos already got that one foul Carr drops it off to re waited for that big big double well what he what Carr had to wait for was Reed to stop standing there and cut to the basket and and when Reed finally did Carr gave him the ball both bigs for Wake Forest to pass the ball extremely well heres the lob for Dongo its broken up Miller the other way look at him going acceleration turbo and the Applause basket and an early timeout by Damon Stout W wake has been able to get out and go theyre on a 10 run and Kevin Miller he can really get down the court this is transition basketball wake for of course if they can play this way its going to be a long night for the yellow Music jackets when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks volume three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winning his program in division one most of any kind its not bragging if its true greatness is what we do the ACC a Wake Forest off and running a 10 run here in the opening minutes against Georgia Tech a team that averages 80 plus points per game in conference well running literally not not just a good start but they have been able to get out in transition Georgia Tech can not set its defense and when you let Miller go like that youve got a problem Miller all over George Millers trying to be very aggressive and thats what he needs to be but hes got to watch the fouls as well airball from Reeves Claude and Carr tied up it comes to Fon Reed and now wake again looking to push Carr catch release splash we saw this team Saturday against Syracuse shoot The Living Daylights 66 from the field one of the best shooting performances in school history well they made 12 of 19 from Beyond The Arc and when you get shots like that its understandable youre going to shoot a high percentage Dongo from the corner theyll give him that Carr another rebound and wake wants to run Miller thought about that didnt he but again that time Georgia Tech got back on defense Ben hildr is just pushing the ball out him knocked Away by Dongo it comes to George thats good defense but that was a bad pass Reeves the Up and Under cant finish out of bounds last touch they say on taian Claude ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball version one 0 that started 4 and three they were missing two big pieces who have returned through the course of the season when Fon Reed was declared eligible in early December it was a game changer and then just last month they get one of the best threepoint Shooters in the ACC back toari mon Santo and thats one of the reasons Anish that an example like that is why I think the metrics that we use in all this bubble nonsense and everything are flawed because you dont give a coach a chance to build his team and to put things together basically by the time conference play starts your net is already hit put in place even though the team is different and now Wake Forest theyve done a pretty good job building their net up to 42 but this is a very different team than the one that started the season and a much better one and a much better one yes hildr off the feed from car count it wake is rolling 15 unanswered now hildr I mean he moves so well without the basketball and this is just a tremendous move the fake get clawed in the air and then somehow hes able to worm his way past him and shoot it from underneath the basket but a great cut and a great pass by Music Applause Carr hildred an 80 free throw shooter missed theres a lane violation thats not what you want to do if youre Georgia Tech give an 80 free throw shooter another shot and Wake Forest in conference play leads the ACC in free throw shooting Aton Reed is down well I didnt see what happened hes going for that rebound and Dongo just comes down I think step on his foot in his ey that uh Arm coming down yeah its I mean its totally by accident theres nothing there but that does not feel very good its you know Reed is saying no no hes fine but that does that feels very Applause unpleasant 16 no run for Wake Georgia Tech had that early three from kaasi Reeves nothing since K stent in the game at point guard Dongo setting the high screen wake is really trying to attack the ball in their mantoman defense Kelly driving car the rebound Georgia Tech now one for 10 theyre taking tough shots Salis knocked out of bounds stay here and an when I say Georgia Tech has taking tough shots when you take tough shots that is almost like a turnover it allows the defense to get the rebound and push quickly down the court a breather for Reed Matthew Marsh comes into the game cars three offline now if youre Georgia Tech you need to settle into something here move the basketball heres Claude back out stent open it rims Applause out conference play Stan shoots 39 thats a good look Georgia Tech just missed that one hes been a valuable piece Off the Bench this year hildren in traffic 8 18 unanswered for Wake hildr is hes one of most aggressive players in this conference hes got seven so far not close that was T Fara gari the UMass transfer and Georgia Tech is missed 11 of its first 12 well theyre not taking good shots and when youre struggling to score you dont want to take that kind of a shot that gari just took so early in the shot call call working on kapari gets over kapari 20 in a row for Wake wow and Carr is showing you some versatility scored from outside he scored from inside making some nice passes hes played very well on the defensive end Tech has not scored in its last 11 trips down Applause Court clauds pass picked off by The Freshman Frederickson and theyll get gari with a well Frederickson picked it off but this guy here Andrew Carr is the guy who made the play defensively and this is just a really tough strong move on the offensive Music Applause end into the game for Wake Forest its the Sharpshooter deari Monsanto last February against NC State he Torres left Patel attendan came back last month in his first game against Louisville all he does is make his first four threepoint shots but wake is going to keep that ball and Matthew Marsh is a guy he can be very effective around the basket but you have to throw him lobs you cant be throwing him bounds passes its just too far down for the big guy to go Marsh last year shot 88 from the floor well shot selection was the big part of that ready made got to throw it up to him not down its like me when you dont have to tie the tie you just clip it on Salis rebound George thats really good defense a little bit of a force by Salis wait for us theyve been very good at moving the ball they got to continue to do that you dont want to be playing oneonone basketball almost a 7minute scoring drought here for Georgia Tech this will stay with the rambling wreck Wake Forest has been very active defensively theyve had their hands in the passing Lanes we know how gifted this Wake Forest offense is if they get that defensive component look out ACC offensively its one of the best teams in the country they can put points on the board shot clock it one Stir of it to Claude and that is a shot clock violation and Wake Forest in transition and on the defensive end making an early statement they really are and March that time you know its good to have a seven foot guy back there and Marsh moves very effectively catching up with Claude I dont think Claude even knew he was there four turnovers one field goal for Georgia Tech through the first eight minutes front rim for Salis now you dont if youre Wake Forest youve done a nice job moving the ball getting good shots you dont want to start to shoot the ball quickly against the set defense George spinning throws it up toward the rim and again Georgia Tech has not scored uhoh Monsanto almost got the three look good coming out of his hand Georgia Techs last basket at 1901 of this opening Applause half last touch on Frederickson will step aside Tech has missed 13 of 14 from the field wake has scored 20 unanswered pen with Dan Bonner Denise shro this wake for is team 12 and0 at home this season theyve won 43 of their last 48 games at the Joel its been on the road where their struggles have manifested this year 1 and four in ACC Road games one and five overall in True Road games well its its always easier to play at home than it is on the road but what you have to do is get good shots and they really have gotten good shots particularly early in the game now theyve only made three of their last eight which isnt a disaster but I mean Monsanto coming in the game when he shoots the three from the S and kremens thats not exactly the shot early in the clock that Steve Forbes is looking for Georgia Tech with one field goal in 16 possessions so far we played eight and a half minutes theyve only scored one basket George driving around Reed and nothing going in for the yellow jackets now one for 15 from the field Miller again hits the turbo button looking for help Frederickson Reed bats it back to boy Miller Monsanto catch and shoot true he passed up the first one theres no way he was passing up the second second one nice job by Reed to get the ball right back to him I think I mean Reeds thinking what are you throwing me the ball in the corner for George battle for the rebound think they got foul on Coleman wake wanted to move the ball and there the ball moves to Reed re the expression on his face what are you giving it to me for now mons Santo he hadnt played very many games but he has not attempted a twopoint shot yet in this is his fifth game back he hasnt attempted to two 20 shots all threes and hes made 10 of them there you go why would you do anything else this after not playing for 11 months 23 unanswered for Wake Forest lob inside for Reed goes a Applause and Wake Forest defense has been a key here I think because theyve really forced Georgia Tech into some tough shots almost 9 minutes since Georgia Tech scored and theyll have a chance to end the spell at the free throw line its the Freshman ibraim aako to shoot two and he got the foul on Reed and Reed went in there he was in good position and he just went for the fake I mean Sako is quite a bit smaller than Reed and hes underneath the basket Reed just got to stand there now these arent gimmies for Georgia Tech Sako one for seven at the line this season hes six Ines smaller than Reed and thats one where Reed just has to stay down not even have to jump to block that shot that ends a 230 Wake Forest run and bit of a sarcastic Applause from this mamish Pavilion crowd gets him both the scoring drought in all 8 minutes and 45 seconds is of game time thats a long time to go whether at home or not now you got to tighten it up on the defensive end thats the way youre going to come back in the game youve got to use your defense to create some easy shots on Applause offense Miller to the basket locked and lets see who this is on if its on Dongo his second its stur his first well sturen is all over him from the time he starts driving but Miller hes a little guy but he is a strong guy Kevin those two were bouncing off one another all the way down the Music lane why has Steve Forbes been so successful in the transfer portal well I think that he has obviously its tough you it takes a talent to find guys and you look at hes Salis is a is basically a high major transfer even though from the West Coast Conference bit Gonzaga for heavens sakes and Reed he played at LSU and then at Gonzaga so hes a high major transfer and so if you look at his history you know Alis Williams was a high major transfer he doesnt you know bopy Miller is a little bit different because hes from Central Michigan but he he gets the right guys and hes able to blend him in but hes not having a he doesnt have a lot of guys who are stepping up from a lower level and I think thats a factor Miller coming off a 21point game on Saturday was 10 for 14 from the field Sako to the the rim blocked by Carr Salis pushing barely poked Away by Dongo thats a nice job by Georgia Tech to get back but now that floor is so spread and its Carr again making a great Applause pass largest lead of the game for Wake Yellow Jackets still only have one field goal George with 10 to shoot rebound Carr see theres 10 to shoot but thats 10 seconds he didnt have to drive it into that crowd and take a tough shot hrth is fouled before the shot and this is just a situation where Kelly loses Salis but he loses him because the floor is completely spread and Carr once again finds the cutter Georgia Tech just cant get anything going on either end and Wake Forest is theyre really going well how much of it is wakes defense how much of it is Georgia Tech with maybe some poor shot selection as hildr gets an easy one down low your offense has to help your defense and poor shot selection puts a lot of pressure on your defense and I I think that wake Force defense has been very good but Georgia Tech has been a little bit impatient Applause Kelly tried to thread the needle and Damon stamar putting Sako in putting Amari Abram number 24 whos checked in the Old Miss transfer hes looking for a spark he told us to shoot around hey we might have to make some tough decisions here down the stretch and know figure out the guys that can help us well Abram is a guy who started the season for Georgia Tech at point guard and his playing time has greatly diminished so a big opportunity here for him he was hurt hes only played in nine games here comes Miller Abram tried to poke it away Miller throws it up toward the rim and the rebound by Reeves he just got off balance that time he got was too fast for himself Reeves the three that doesnt go again Georgia Tech only one field goal weve played almost 12 minutes in this opening half and theyre only getting one shot each time Wake Forest doing a great job on the defensive boards they are the best defensive rebounding team in the conference Salis leans in Marsh bats it away he got a whistle against wake the Demon Deacons have come out like a bear who missed breakfast 295 756 to go opening half they have made one field goal in 19 attempts that is 53 and Wake Forest has been able to get out and go and you can see why theyre misfiring theres tough shots now this is a wide openen uncontested one but Georgia Tech simply hasnt gotten very many of those its been the nightmare of real things for Damon stams team are you think of some of the lowscoring first halfs weve seen in the ACC this year theyve all come against Virginia right Miami last night scored 17 Louisville had 13 NC State couldnt do anything wake as great as they are all offensively no ones mistaking their defense for Charlottesville well theres no question about that but they have done an excellent job theyve been extremely aggressive we talked about toughness theyve been pretty tough so far today theyre doing a great job pressuring the ball theyre double teaming screens theyre doing a great job helping out on the inside when they double team off a screen and then getting back I mean Andrew Carr has a steel and two blocked shots and go along with five rebounds and seven points hes been in the center of the whole thing Abram grazed the front rim Georgia Tech now one for 20 Applause shooting I dont know that Ive ever seen anybody be one for 20 Ive seen be one for 20 from three but not one for 20 overall at some point you would think the law of averages will step in Applause hildr from the corner rebound to Rees and the other thing Wake Forest is doing theyre getting back on defense there hadnt been any transition opportunity at all for Georgia Tech Reeves the shot fake against the trees shot altered now thats Marsh now Reeves had an open three and I know they havent hit from three very well and so he was afraid but he passed up an open shot to take it into the middle of the lane where there was a lot of Defenders you just have to shoot that three with confidence particularly if youre Reeves whos an outstanding threepoint shooter hes got their only field goal of three that came a minute into the game thats amazing Georgia Tech has missed what 19 straight Music Applause shots Steve Forbes wants to know what everybodys waiting Music for Andrew Carr against kapari turns and hits nine for Carr this was a Georgia Tech Team Just A Week Ago knocked off off North Carolina on this Applause floor almost a turnover again the pressure on the ball has been Applause outstanding Reeves from the outside that doesnt go Monsanto the board you just cant dribble it around make one pass and shoot a three thats not the formula for Success Carr with great position follows his Miss and draws the foul S7 foul on Georgia Tech and that puts wake in the bonus foul Carr catches the ball and hes hes sort of a little bit off balance he gets fouled the second time around gets fouled on the rebound but car as I said Carr has been in the middle of everything and line can you remember a shooting start this cold no I really cant and Im sure its happened before Ive done this for a long time but these are the kind of things that you like to forget the only game that comes to mind in recent memory it was pit I believe against Virginia where in the first half Im not sure they cracked 10 points Applause well I mean the problem is they dug themselves a hole to have Georgia Tech and one of the things when you dig yourself a hole the first thing you have to do is stop digging and theyre they you know theyre taking tough shots and theyre not helping themselves now right now theyre halfway to Beijing it has just been a rough night and the you know it be interesting to see what happens if they can get the ball to go in the basket a couple times and sort of get their legs underneath them a wakes defense has not given Georgia Tech anything easy thats an open look for gari and he cant get the bounce the rolls even at home not going the way of the yellow jackets well thats true but gari in ACC play is is a 4 for 20 threepoint shooter so the guys who are open for shots sometimes theres a reason why theyre open Scouting Report doesnt lie wake forward has had a 20 run in this half theyre in the midst of a 10 run it was 3 nothing Georgia Tech at one point 332 wakes since then Carr turns Fades now again thats the ball stays in one spot everybodys standing around and even though theyre way ahead Steve Forbes is upset about that particular play and Dongo is fouled by Monsanto this is a situation where Georgia Tech finally gets something going on the screen and roll situation and Monsanto coming in with the body but thats really the first time that Georgia Tech has made Wake Forest pay for that heavy pressure on the screen and roll situation did that count of half Applause wow as a coach watching this whats going through your mind going through your mind is I hope we get to halftime really fast Dongo only a 55 free throw shooter in conference play a crowd trying to hang on to something anything Georgia Tech had a 8 minute 45 second drought earlier in this half that last free throw ended a 4minute 45 second Music drought Reed on the smaller George thats too easy he did a nice job navigating there was some traffic in there gari went to block the shot and flew right by George is fouled on the shot hell have a chance at the free throw line but still George tech only has one field goal thatll be itll be three for George and again he got fouled on this play but Im not sure this is a good shot he its hes not really open there its a contested shot now he did get fouled you got to move the ball get that defense moving before you take the shot before you drive to the basket and and wake for and Georgia Tech has just really struggled with that tonight and the Wake Force defense has been the primary factor George a freshman we have seen him get better and better as the season has gone on and you go back to the Clemson game when Georgia Tech won an overtime he hit the two big threes at the end of regulation at the end of the game last Tuesday he drove for the game winner against North Carolina hes becoming that kind of point guard for Damon statamire and you know theres been some pretty good point guards here at Georgia Tech and hes those are pretty big footsteps to follow in but he has started down that path pretty successfully early they had a good one recently in Jose Alvarado you go historically Kenny Anderson Stefan Marbury Mark Price Travis P Jarrett Jack will B him its a good list Craig Applause Music Neil the lob for Reed it hits the rim well theres a little traffic in there a couple of guys fell down and Reed couldnt get to the ball Jo George working on hildr offensive rebound Claude and thats Georgia Tech second field goal of this first half thats what you have to do youve got a create a turnover get down the court get the shot out before the defense get set so you can get an offensive Applause rebound they went almost 15 minutes between field goals Monsanto you cannot leave him that wide open and you cannot give him that much time but the Wake Force passing drives the defense to the Applause Baseline George over Reed backto back baskets for Georgia Tech thats another tough shot though hildr weaving and navigating Atlanta traffic and and even even after a made basket wake Force pushes it up against against Georgia Tech theyre not set theres a steal wake Force punching downhill Tech Milling in retreat but Dongo with the Applause block and Miles Kelly gives it up officials time Cameron hildr in wakes win against Georgia Tech last year went for 19 points hes got 11 to lead all scores hes almost outscored to Georgia Tech by himself Music pns exclusive presentation of college basketball presented by Progressive is brought to you by inspire sleep apnea innovation no mask no hose just sleep some of the first black students to attend and graduate from Georgia Tech honored today while the game on the court Dan boner reminiscent of a substitute teacher being asked to monitor detention its really been a struggle for Georgia Tech now theyve increased their shooting percentage to 112 from 5 but you can see hildr and Carr both have almost as many points as Georgia Tech by themselves but Georgia Tech they theyve got a little bit going on offense theyve created a couple of turnovers on defense they got a long way to go but you just have to keep chipping away Tech shooting three for 26 from the field in the first half one for 12 from three stur ofan knocks down the triple and that and now stent thats the second wide open look hes had hes knocked that one down youre not going to make them all but the Georgia Tech defense Georgia Tech offense made the the Wake Forest defense pay for their help that Applause Music time Salis getss gari in the air gari running the floor hildr got in the away and well get a foul you take you take that long three that allows Georgia Tech to get a long rebound and push and this is a nice job by Georgia Tech and gari does a nice job he doesnt pull up he goes right at the basket and hildr I mean he gets in the way but he brings that arm down and thats where the foul is called second foul on hildr kapari 59 free throw shooter the UMass transfer and mon Santo into the game for hildr and you dont want hildr to even though you have a big lead you dont want him to pick up that third personal foul so Georgia Tech has a little bit something going now you get a couple of stops in a row and he build some momentum before the Applause half Reed backing down Dongo to the jump hook nice move by Fon Reed thats a nice job because Monsanto is the guy who standing outside so you cant help against you cant help off him and that me leaves Reed Applause oneonone kapari down the lane blocked by Reed out of bounds to wake well Reed I mean he is s feet tall and he gets down inside and hes going up against Dongo and you saw no help coming from the outside and thats because monsano is standing right there George is hugging him and he has to so theres no help available and thats a tough matchup for Dongo Steve Forbes acknowledged to us a Monsanto coming off a major injury his offense is well ahead of his defense right now he hes a legitimate weapon on offense weve seen him knock down Breeze defensively youre going to have to live with that he just cant move like he used to well thats thats very true except I would say his offense has always been well ahead of his defense one and one coming here for Wake Miles Kelly picked up foul number two well you got to get out and you got to make Monsanto dribble the ball but you dont want to bounce him out there you dont want to hit him that far from the basket cuz hes not only a good threepoint shooter hes a very good free throw shooter as well he led the AC in threes per game last year former socon freshman of the year at Applause ETSU wakes led by as many as 29 and another whistle down low a nice job by gari to attack the basket but I think if he looked up instead of putting his hand down to drive he would have seen Dongo open on the inside the line I mean you you take any opportunities you get if youre Georgia Tech and gari did a nice job driving it to the basket Applause Georgia Tech trying to apply some pressure its hard to pressure boy Miller Music Applause though Salis Monsanto lets it Go track down by George he didnt really get set that time nice idea though he did a nice job moving to the open spot Kelly stepped out of bounds yeah thats the way the first half is gone for the yell jackets seven turnovers to four field goals for Georgia Tech in this first half we get a timeout well take one two wake rolling on the Music road when you have a history of greatness ESPN will take you to wakeo its number 15 Texas Tech taking on 18th ranked Baylor at beautiful Foster Pavilion in Waco 9 Eastern on ESPN right now nine projected teams from the Big 12 are in Joe lardys bracket two more on the bubble ACC currently has four teams in Wake Forest one of Joes first four out 6sec differential between game clock and a shot Applause Music Applause clock seven to shoot Salis puts it on the floor in traffic gets the roll wait when Salis can get in the lane for that little shot even Under Pressure hes really tough kapari time running out and thats how the first half ends Wake Forest had runs of 23 to0 and 10 ZIP Georgia Tech started 1 for 24 from the field and went almost even though the margin is 26 think of where wake sits very much on the bubble jool lardy has them as one of the first four out but margin of victory in the grand scheme of things with the net rankings it matters how they finish this game and how many they win by that could give them maybe a significant jump in the net rankings before their next game and thats really true Anan they will tell you they Capa the margin of victory at 10 points and they may do that but one of the big factors in the net is offensive efficiency minus defensive efficiency and dress that up any way you want to thats the Music score Cameron hildr to the free throw line 11 points in the opening half and again wait for us right back inside we saw that they scored 26 inside points in the first half they had 40 in the game against Syracuse so again wake for shooting the ball well wake for scoring inside thats nothing new today that game against the CES where they shot 66 from the field it was wakes best shooting performance since November 2019 and an ACC play it was wakes second highest field goal percentage against an opponent in school history Miles Kelly still looking for his first points well he only took two shots in the first half hes Georgia Techs leading score hildr too easy again they Rush the ball up the court and thats a great job by bopy Miller to see hrth coming behind him and whether he comes first or he comes behind you know hildr is coming Dango over Reed nice job by George to get through that tough double team off the screen if youre Damon stoutamire what do you think the message was at halftime well you just want your guys to keep their heads up say guys dont forget about what the score is lets just go out and play Lets do what we do Salis offline and Im guessing if youre Steve Forbes hes saying its z0 absolutely you dont want your guys to let up George hoisted up why did he shot I think he was looking for the foul Miller Nifty dribble and knocked out of bounds last touch wake Miller being a little bit too fancy in traffic that time and David STM George has come out of the game and David stms talking to him basically saying what are you doing you know he really likes his freshman guard and everybody makes mistakes from time to time hes made made some plays too though oh Kyle sturen in for George pick and roll with Claude and two shots for the Western Carolina transfer this really a nice job on the screen and roll there and the foul occurs because Reed just takes that hip and puts his hip into him greed just stands there then he doesnt get the foul but its hard to just stand there when some guys come coming right at you and hes saying I put my hands up in the air and he did but he came with that hip and got him last Tuesday in Georgia Techs win against North Carolina I thought Claude really stepped up Dongo left that game early with a head injury a lot of folks probably thought oh with Bott down low Georgia Tech is toast and oh danana played well defensively even though the Box scor didnt show it Claude nine points eight rebounds three blocks in that game well Claude has had some good games hes an important factor can be an important factor for Georgia Tech Miller gets around stur aent yeah there you go uh thats what Wake Forest to 6 foot guard 511 guard you post him up see now thats you thats not the kind of shot you want to take youre not going to get back in the game by taking wild threes going to move the ball they almost get the sense its like a poker player on tilt Miller step back three good poker players tilt tilt its okay when youre out of sorts youre out of sorts okay youre going all in with 27 off suit if you say Dongo facing Applause upo and they found him inside again theyre trying to pressure the ball theyre trying to pressure that ball screen nice jump shot by Dongo he didnt try to take it at Carr Reed had good position hildr will drive and he gets the foul thats great passing and you move the ball that quickly that creates a driving lane and if if anybodys going to recognize a driving lane its Cameron hildr now he got hit in the nose and thats doesnt feel very good but heres hildr he fakes the pass and the defense all goes toward the guy hes passing the ball to and he just pops it right in the nose you see Stan and Kelly both run the other way and he just attacks and gets whacked in the nose now if youre hris you have an opportunity to free throw on youre great free throw shooter youre not coming out it doesnt even if you eyes are watering to the point where you cant see youre shooting these free thr remember his nickname is Applause bangers numberi and number two Nathan George George back in after a brief talking to from his head coach on the bench kapari in there as well you just got to hang in in there if youre Georgia Tech just keep plugging away thats easy to point the Georgia Tech struggles this year theyre 10 and 12 we mentioned 3 and8 in conference but the three wins UNCC Duke and Clemson the vast majority of games they have been right there this is an aberration theyve played in 16 games decided by single digits thats tied for most in division one kapari gets some separation and hits Music kapari thats a nice job getting hris to fly by and kapari is a guy who they think is really going to be good he can shoot it a little bit hes got good size hes seen the floor more of late as well Reed as no foul was called well there wasnt a foul there that was a great job by Reed to get stopped get himself collected and get the ball up to the basket thats a really good play Salis all over Kelly now gobbled up by Reed ahead to Salis and he splits the double wow thats a one on Three fast break but thats the way things are going for Wake Forest tonight largest lead of the game for awake and Damon stoutmire wants a timeout one of the true Pioneers in this conference one of the true pioneers and one of the really great guys I did an interview with him years and years ago it was a halftime interview during one of our broadcasts and we were asking him about one of his big games where he scored a lot of points and he talked about what a great feeling it was when you were hot and in the middle of his statement hes talking about how great it feels he turns to me he says even you may know that and then continue right on with his story so a guy with a sense of humor too absolutely sturdivan off the feed from George offensive rebound Music Dongo shot clock into single digits that was only the third offensive rebound of the game for Georgia Tech again another tough contested shot that time by George he got to give a lot of credit to wakes defense oh theres no question Georgia Tech shooting 19 from the field 5 minutes into the second half when you have a history state in the Octagon of Doom here its been a kind of Doomsday for Georgia Tech 6127 thats not not a typo and I think you got to give wake some credit we talked about their struggles on the road coming into the game they had lost four in a row on the road they came out on fire we had talked about well Georgia Tech being a pretty good offensive team wake having its issues at times defensively this has been a superb defensive effort by wake wake has pressured the ball I mean Georgia Tech has had very very few clean looks at the basket the defense have been has been aggressive and theyve been able to take that aggressive defense and turn it into offense Georgia Techs ACC numbers offensively much improved and well get a foul down low Carr had a mismatch and thats the other thing Wake Forest has been able to find those mismatches inside and I think the reason is theyve had pretty good ball movement there have been times with the Wake Forest offense where this year where the ball tends to stick theres a little too much dribbling well not so far tonight and the danger is look at the five on the floor for Wake Miller Carr hrth Salis Reed any of the five could be your guy on a given night yes absolutely its been hildr tonight with 17 last touch kapari well hildr that time he took the ball hard into the lane saw traffic there really good reaction by Georgia Tech Damon STM going deep into his bench Carter Murphy is in the ball game Reed from the Music Applause outside and Murphy well he can make the three Reed can but I think if youre Georgia Tech youre comfortable with him shooting it out there Murphy forn white he is a grad transfer from Air Music Force Music George has his pass tipped again looked like he made a move and didnt know where he wanted to go with the Music ball Miller over to Applause Carr thats a pretty good pass for a pretty good shot Bo just nothing doing on the offensive boards for Georgia Tech and again that was a contested shot stur ofan did a nice job creating a little bit of Applause room Miller off the skip Applause pass well wake you know they have not relied on the three tonight theyve only made four theyre now four of 14 from out there Dongo unable to finish inside but we get a foul I its fouls oh its on the Reed I thought might have be on Miller sorry he puts his arm right across thats a foul on the rebound not on the shot he just puts that arm right across his neck and pushes it down third foul on a reed Marsh Frederickson and Monsanto into the game for wake and as we have discussed it probably isnt going to make any difference tonight but Reed has a tendency to pick up Music fouls Debo Coleman has checked in for Damon Stout got a Music kick Damon sonar just looking for anything you know just you know just the smallest run any positive that he can create this has to be disheartening oh it is when we spoke to him yeah he felt this team was close yeah hes very confident hes very pleased with his guys he thinks everythings coming together a little bit but sometimes you just have a clunker you got a young team especially George and Dongo Claud the veteran draws the foul on Marsh now the upside for Georgia Tech though assuming George and Dango both return youve got two significant foundational pieces to build you sure do you sure do now you got your point guard and you got your post guy and those are fairly important positions Music and for all the trouble Georgia Tech has had tonight up until right now theyve been pretty good from the free throw line they were 11 for 13 now 11 for 14 but thats where theyve been very productive mil Kelly Miles Kelly checks back in he does not have a point and thats hard to imagine you know but hes only taken three shots you cant score if you dont Applause shoot at Kelly remember against pit was held scoreless as well that was a Georgia Tech loss Kelly is is very important to their offense when hes making threes that spreads the defense out and they suddenly become very very good on this end George working around hildr put too much on it thats pretty good defense by hildr and again that was a close shot it was not an easy shot tied up by Coleman look at this guy one speed its not the English man who went up the hill and came down a mountain he is driving down the mountain full speed M of four game Road losing streak in the ACC they were hot Saturday against Syracuse theyve cooled off but just a smidge well they have cooled off but their defense has really really stepped up for the game Georgia Tech is shooting 7 for 40 say that again 175 and an awful lot of that has had to do with the Wake Forest defense Georgia Tech just simply has not had that many open looks I can only think of two or three open you know wide open shots that they have missed and a few of them came from guys who were wide open for a Applause reason Tech gives it right back numbers for Wake nice defense by Coleman gets it back for the yellow jackets but look at Frederickson just Chase it Kelly still without a Point Marsh snags it s of it almost took it away and wake is still pushing mon Santos thre does not fall he wont miss many of those wide open ones when he gets a chance to get set Kelly Georgia Techs leading Music scorer Kelly open does not go thats a great rebound Monsanto will try it again and hell keep trying it he thinks he got fouled Murphy back iron nice job by Monsanto hes legislating for a foul there but he gets back down the court and gets the rebound out 6328 sometimes you dont get Laughter Applause that Salis able to save it five to shoot Frederickson does not go Steve Forbes called him the best shooter hes ever signed Murphy misses and you heard the chorus from the Wake Forest bench dont dare Music him theres Marsh and thats what he does you know we said you know he turned it over before when they threw him a bounce pass well dont throw him a bounce pass throw it up and let him go get it time out Georgia Applause Tech and this is what were talking about you just throw it up to him and Marsh does such a great job cutting to the basket making himself available and Solace does a really good job forcing Claude to step to him before he makes the pass to Marsh you mentioned it earlier you said shot selection was the reason Marsh shot 88 from the field this year or last year thats a very telling statistic only seven made field goals the entire game for Georgia Tech and theres something to remember you might be watching and going well why is Wake still playing some of its starters why have they not called off the dogs theres a reality here wake is very much on the bubble theyre trying to build their resume so much of your resume is dependent on net rankings and part of the net ranking formula is how dominant you are in a game a big part of the net this isnt running up the score no no you know you really help your net if you beat the Daylights out of somebody and coaches have told us around the league they hate that part of it heres George a rare open look for Georgia Tech thats a nice job by Georgia Tech to move the ball and Wake Forest overh help that time but thats one of the very very few wide openen looks that the yellow jackets have had yellow jackets now three for 22 from Deep Carin gari good tied up and they get kapari with the foul Wake Forest is just scrambling around on defense and bopy Miller just overh helps that time and leaves George all alone but thats the kind of pressure on the ball that has worked so well for Wake Forest tonight so youll take that I think if youre the Wake Forest coaching Applause staff Reed backing down Dongo kapari looked like he was going to come help theres that hook well Reed needed to get that ball back out you get it back out to Miller and then Miller reenters it and you get a better shot karis three not there batted out of bounds by Reed and again that was a wide open shot maybe a little early in the shot clock gari now 0 for three from three but remember in ACC play he came into the game four for 20 from three so if youre Wake Forest its okay if hes shooting the three JG Tech really trying to fight hard through those screens Monsanto over Dongo and monsano he can shoot it off the dribble as he did right there he can shoot it when hes standing still the one thing you know hes going to shoot it theres an old line the fox has many tricks the Hedgehog one good one Monsanto one good ones a pretty darn good one 748 to go in regulation it has been all Wake Forest tonight in Atlanta days its one of those nights and its been that way for Georgia Tech those are their four leading scores and all of them have had their struggles to varying degrees tonight Miles Kelly the teams leading score 0 for five does not have a point Dongo only has five Reeves 1 for n from the field George two for 11 from the field and I think that most of the credit for that has to go to the Wake Forest defense theyve been very aggressive theyve pressured the ball theyve disrupted the ball screens and the interesting thing about this were sitting right next to the Wake Forest bench and their coaching staff theyve got a 37o lead but their intensity during this these this timeout off the charts and we mentioned it again this isnt about running up the score this isnt about any of that stuff in the world of net rankings and how you win and the efficiency on the offensive and the defensive end those things matter and you have to you have to isue the the scoring margin and play like its z0 the net is a seriously flawed metric because of its emphasis on offensive efficiency minus defensive efficiency and so its not really running up the score but the bigger your margin the better for you Miller gets fouled by Abram Miller just dribbled right in front of him subs for Theon and you a Wake Forest has 16 assists assists in each but theyve been distributed throughout the team Carrs got three of them Reeds got three of them Miller two hildr four Salis three it has been a balanced scoring effort six players have at least eight points George is the only player with at least eight for Georgia Tech Carr the follow gets it back and two shots Georgia Tech called for the foul Lake Forest bench wanting a goal tack Char number well this is really good contest by gari but Carr does a nice job going straight back up and hanging in there and L and thats a little greedy on the part of the deakes wanting a goal tending Applause there car is one rebound away from from a double double hes got his seventh straight game in double figures hes really been a big factor for Wake Forest and on top of everything else Anish Wake Forest is now 15 of 15 from the free throw line 38point lead and George makes it a 36 point deficit hes got 10 hes the first yellow jacket into double figures thats the first time I can remember in this game that Wake Forest hasnt totally attacked George when hes coming off a screen and George showed you when you give him that kind of room coming off a screen he can hurt you Reed doubled forced it heres George the other Applause way Abram off the shot fake and makes it happen Applause now again we talked about the intensity of the Wake Forest coaching staff they do not like the sloppiness theyve seen here on that Applause Music Applause possession nice job by George to anticipate that drive the the phrase you keep hearing from the weight quarters bench is move it move it and again you established legal guarding position both feet on the floor facing the dribbler and then you are allowed to move to maintain that position Abram Baseline Drive bounces around the rim snared by Reed throw it away eight turnovers for wake and Steve for hes asking him what are you doing Dongo tough shot and it flushes in thats foul on George nice job by Boy Miller to just attack George in that particular Music situation so a one and one for Wake as Georgia Tech was in the midst of a 60 run line you watch this wake team when they play to their full offensive potential defense be damned quite frankly they look like a team that can play into the second weekend of the NCAA tournament offensively Dan I I Im not sure there are many teams better than wake one through five well I would agree with that wake four is particularly when theyre moving the ball as I said sometimes their offense has a little bit of trouble when they start to get a little too much oneonone a little too much dribbling when they move the ball and move the players around they are very difficult to guard because they have so many guys who can hurt you in so many different ways and now you added Monsanto a few weeks ago a guy who can come off the bench and remember he was a double digit scorer before the injury last year Frederickson at times has been a weapon Off the Bench knocking down threes thats a good job by gari thats a mismatch for Carr outside hes not quick enough to stay with gari out Music there Miller against Dongo throws it inside for Reed kicks it back out hildr paused excellent ball movement Salis got a clean look now Wake Forest they have not shot the three well today and that was an open one off some pretty good ball movement and a double double for Andrew Carr his fourth of the Season Miller all the way when he hits the gas hes hard to stop well lots of times you know you get a little guy going in there and you say hi how can he do that well hes been a little guy all his life and so hes used to attacking the bigger guys five players in double figures for Wake as Dongo slams it home a car went for the steal and didnt get it but Georgia Tech you know theyre getting a little bit of a rhythm going on offense its way too late Reed backs down Dongo to the left hand Dongo did a good job just holding his ground and you saw wake cleared that whole side so there was no help for him Miller whistled for his first 16 foul for Wake Forest this would be a quad two win its still a team in search of its first quad one win of the season but they will have opportunities down the stretch number 10 zanka AB bro zanka into the game for Wake Forest the UCLA transfer originally from the same Hometown as Christopher Columbus Genoa Italy I didnt know where you were going with that but thats a good one n a dozen for Nate Music George and as the defensive pressure has slacken George has sort of assumed his normal role with Georgia Tech Reed off the feed from booby Miller Wake Forest continues to pass the ball very well you dont shoot the kind of percentage theyre shooting without good opportunities and theyve gotten them in converted Dongo Dongo again Music from been a balanced scoring effort for Wake six players in double figures Zano leans in out of Applause bounds going to to Georgia Tech 10 points seven rebounds for Fon Reed everybodys chipped in tonight for wake a 30point run in the first half Wake Forest is led by as many as 38 in this game Georgia Tech opened the game by missing 23 of their first 24 Shots and for Steve forbes team currently projected as one of the first four out this would be a qu quad two win tonight they dont have a quad one win but look at the opportunities Duke Virginia Duke again at Virginia Tech and Clemson at the end of the year theres a chance that could have a possibility of being a quad one win should wake get it Mike young told me when he was talking earlier this year about his Virginia Tech Team he said we have put ourselves in a position to be in position and thats exactly what describes this Wake Forest team theyve played well enough that theyre in position to make a move now they just have to make that move Dongo slips inside so realistically if theyre able to avoid any pitfalls and so far they dont have a quad three or quad four loss so theyve done a good job of that you can get one out of two against Duke and lets say split with Virginia Tech and Clemson is that enough well you dont know it depends on what other teams do it depends on upsets in conference tournaments but this Wake Forest team I dont know how you can watch this Wake Forest team tonight and tell me you dont think theyre an NCA tournament worthy team the ey test says they most certainly are but the metrics also say Wake plays NC State this coming weekend in NC State is a quad three win should we get it and the IT test tells you NC State is much better than that but keep in mind that the quads arent actually set in stone until the season is over thats what it is right now and NC State is another team that has everything out before them if they play well down the stretch then that improves their net ranking and that helps the other teams in the league and Joe lardi entering today as wake is one of the first four out right now he projects four ACC teams to be in the tournament UNC Duke Clemson and Virginia wake knocking on the door well not to disagree with Joe but at this point in time there is nobody in the NCA tournament and the only teams that are not in the NCA tournament are those on some kind of an NCA restriction so uh minus those teams nobodys in nobodys out we still have a lot of basketball to Music play all right rare twopoint field goal attempt for Frederickson 94 of his shots had come from three he picks the pocket and goes in for the dunk well if hes if hes going to make shoot a two thats a pretty good one its a high percentage shot nice defense that might have been the first time this season hes attempted backtoback twos I would say that thats 100 correct coming into this game he had attempted 90 shots and 85 of them more from Beyond The Applause Arc 55 seconds left in this one awfully impressive performance by the Demon Deacons oh they put to b a couple of things today this Georgia Tech Team I know people can point to their record and say wow theyre 10 and 12 theyre 3 and8 got to remember they beat beat Duke they beat Carolina they beat Clemson they beat Clemson at Clemson and offensively theyve been a pretty good team in conference play the questions about wake were twofold can they win on the road can they play enough defense theyve done that tonight and the interesting thing is theyre a pretty good threepoint shooting team and they have not been very good at all from three tonight AB Abram gets the layup 80 51 and awake will dribble out the clock an early Blitz by the decks put this game away Georgia Tech cold to start missing 23 of their first 24 wakes defense had a lot to do with that Wake Forest used a 230 run early in this game they snap a four game Road losing streak they get the win offense scores 80 for the 13th time this season the defense holding Georgia Tech to 15
