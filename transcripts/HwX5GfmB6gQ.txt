2017 they are flying high Wong and the Hurricanes all smiles 24 wins during the regular season they won a tough one to clinch that top seed over last weekend beating Pitt 7876 and we are underway Wake Forest winning the opening tip great to have you partner great to be back with you my man you Moonlighting on me last night Jay billis he kept me up late very late well Ill tell you NC State look amazing were talking about their guards all year is Clinton up top and picking up where he left yeah let me tell you who looked amazing not only Clinton but cam Hilda both these guys have been a great Duo to help out Howie Appleby here in ACC tournament Miami Hurricanes man they can shoot it they deserve that number one seed they hit about 49 37 percent from three is packed right away off Target and one of the things to look at OB is we get opportunity to see the Wake Forest starting five of course led by Appleby we talked about a number of guys in this mix but when you think about this game this is a perfect matchup of size four Wake Forest normally teams are bigger than they are but this one they actually have a size advantage over Miami now Miamis done a great job playing despite not having a lot of size tipped the shot clock down to three Hildreth on the move and that time could not make another spectacular shot like the one he made yesterday I havent seen a more creative shot than the one he made to tie the game at 74s yesterday long working downstairs no rebound tipped and controlled by Miller Applause my favorite name in the tournament a whistle here in the lane as were just underway here in game one on a very busy day the quarterfinals and theres Jim larenegger 39th theres head coach 12th year in Miami was a naysmith Hall of Fame nominee took the caves to the elite eight last year there are a lot of people who feel this team is even better and this is team 10 years removed from his first ACC tournament regular season and tournament Championship so maybe some Deja Vu for Coach L here in Greensboro Applebee with the foul by the way North Channel mirror at the line six seven third Team all ACC and rattles it in and Steve Forbes on the other side hes had a top three scoring team all season long in the ACC an excellent threepoint team as well they can be so dangerous one thing for sergeant Steve Forbes can coach offense hes always got teams that understand how to put the ball in the hole and normally have they got leading it like Appleby although he misses on that possession 19 points a game the accs number one score his Poplar around and out one thing to keep an eye on the turnovers for Appleby the extraordinary stat that when Wake Forest took on Miami earlier in the season Miami winning that game Appleby was turned over by the Hurricanes 12 times thats a lot of turnovers thats one guy Obi I was a guy who was known to turn the basketball over I would do that but it might take me two to three games to get to 12 12 is a lot and that just shows you the lack of depth that Steve Forbes has at the point guard position because an enormous scenario once you get to seven or eight youre coming to sit there can I say it again 12 times he also had nine assists in that game which is rather incredible Slams on the brakes a little far away no Applause Music Applause lose pack you can hit that three Miller on the move he can frankly do it all but hes going to turn it over and thats a traveling violation great job by Bobby Clement defensively and we talked about the two x factors for these teams one of them a freshman in Clinton the other a fifth year in Jordan Miller both these guys matched up against each other going to be a great opportunity to see the youth going up against the experience so a chilly start for both sides maybe a little early for each until they get warmed up juice Hilder at the 64 sophomore from Worthing England its real English Connection here for the Demon Deacons shot clock down to seven well kick it out and Williamson star of yesterdays game and a foul on the play Music Williamson with an absolute money shot with half a second left there were no timeouts remaining Joe Gerard missed a chance to give Syracuse the win and smart play by Tyree Appleby to be able to push the basketball and get it to David Williamson but itll be one of the things that you always like to look at when you see this matchup of course Miami the number one seed a double by not only did Wake Forest get an opportunity to come in and practice on this court but theyve already played a game you would expect for them to have an advantage early while Miami has to find a way to settle into it great point maybe need a few minutes to do that Applause so about four minutes in total of five points on the board this is two teams that can really score denied Miami getting up there on the iron is wrong he scoots in for two its more play by wall not selling for the jump shot continue to attack the basket seeing the ball go through early getting that layup builds that confidence for the jumper much later in the game on Career against wake hes done really well as the averaging 20 points a game against the Demon Deacons killed this around the back Clemson averaging 12 points really fine Defender two trying to back down trying to make a move there Banks it and a miss but a foul two he and Poplar are going toetotoe Isaiah Wong not number one seeds Tyree Appleby with 35 against North Carolina this season also had a big turnover game as we mentioned lets toss it to Gray well thank you Dave listen last time these two teams met it was a scoring Showdown Wake Forest put up 87 points they had six players and double figures they hit 15 threes but you mentioned it the turnovers 19 total turnovers and its one thing to have turnovers its another thing to have what even basketball coaches refer to as pick sixes Miami scored 34 points off of Wake Forest 19 turnover so taking care of the basketball is pivotal you all talked about Tyree Appleby having 12 of those turnovers Corey what have you seen in Appleby in this game compared to last time against Miami so far draf seen from him early a focus on making sure he takes care of the basketball and of course she was a point guard did a little research your career high was five turnovers in a game after that when you play the same team again did you have a different mental approach when you went against them just a different level of control and decision making and being a little more intentional especially to start the game do you know how you start the game and youre going so fast and youre playing so hard against the Miami team that plays such a fastpaced defense for me I came out a little bit slower a little more intentional the next time I believe weve seen exactly that from Tyree Appleby in this one by the way a great player all ACC first team number one score in the league we see the second most votes for ACC player of the year over the shoulder omir cant hit it and here come the Demon Deacons everybody has a bad day but thats the most turnovers in the ACC since 1999 by one player and and this is a guy whos normally very shorthanded with the basketball hes not a high turnover guy but that also speaks to Miamis defense and the way that they can get after you put pressure on you on the perimeter you see when he comes off the screen hes got two guys around him and her car got an open look only 33 percent from the threepoint line Applause Wake Forest hits 37 percent as a team pack cant hit it rebound tipped up and in we talked about Miller with that little left hand flipped there and the variety of things he can do with his game hes got 611 wingspan but thats him I mean hes a lefty but at the same time hes one of those guys that does everything its not as though hes the leading scorer or even a leading rebounder but hes second in everything hes second in assist hes always the guy making plays and what he does defensively as well he runs out over the shoulder caps knocked Away by Williamson a nice play to recover there defensively great job by David Williamson getting back but Jordan Miller we talked about him as the X Factor and OB this is the reason why in my opinion Jordan Miller was the accs player of the year because you want to talk about the best player on the best team and to take nothing away from Isaiah Wong but they win because of Jordan Miller hes the guy that does all the little things and leads them on and off the course as you say lefthanded so hes got that extra weapon so a tough shot by Isaiah long as he drops it in but thats ACC Player of the Year type stuff right there maybe they should have been coach ACC players of the year and I believe one of the reasons why Jordan Miller actually was not on the ballot to be ACC player of the year was because it would have taken votes away from Isaiah wall listen there Joseph will commit the foul trying to stay with Appleby Jesus said than done but guarding Tyree Appleby is something that is always going to be on the minds of the Miami Hurricanes they recognize how difficult he is to defend so of course the greatest compliment in the game is to is to command a double team and you see Tyree Appleby does that against these Miami caves Applebee first ACC tournament came in leading the conference in points assists and minutes played just a standout year hes free in the corner and airmail that one that didnt touch a thing long to push the tempo Miami running Joseph got Airborne didnt know what to do with it heres Hildreth he finds the lane and he will slide it down I can tell you right now Jim larenegger does not like that Coast to Coast with the easy finish for Cameron Hill but the one thing that coach l wants to do is make sure they get back and set their defense on every possession not able to get it done on that one 106 the Kings Walker coming off the bench in a misfire Clinton with another rebound youre talking about a guy who had 17 and 11 yesterday as you said a doubledouble in the first half points four rebounds a game those are his averages he just blew those out of the water against Syracuse but Obi one of the things that we know and the coaches will tell you at all times at this point of the Year freshmen are no longer freshman you played an entire season you understand the speed of the game the physicality everything thats involved with it and Bobby Clinton is growing up at this point and being relied on more so by his team what a great time to have your best performance by far against Syracuse and a thrilling win for Wake Forest last game in Jim boeheims story career as it turned out we didnt know it at the time but no longer the head coach for Syracuse after seven years and an amazing job Hill Road tough shot he makes those Applause and one of the great shots of this ACC tournament so far against cues yesterday and whirling dervish to tie the game with 28 seconds to go on set top here for Beverly Applause Beverly getting it off the long shot clock inside 10 ACC Player of the Year cant knock it down Applause were trying to tie or take the lead behind Appleby over the shoulder and its by March what a beautiful Applause thats the Towery app type of screen action and they did not Blitz him and Jim learning not happy about that you have to take the basketball out of his hands not allow him to make plays for a teammate hes going to bring Nigel pack to six footer back right now Miami remaining pretty cold from the field 1010 tie Applebee and Syracuse was just one for seven from three four for 13 overall so hes yet to really warm up in the tournament Music Around the Horn they go and the corner jumper wont drop for Williamson and with 10 27 to go itll be right here we are familiar with their park well right now Wake Forest is familiar with this building not only because of the fact that you know they had opportunity to practice and play in this building yesterday but its also the Greensboro Coliseum so the Demon Deacons get a couple reps in this building normally each and every year Miami collapsing on d pack cant convert tip wont go that one is and again its Millis the guy that steps up and make big plays for Miami all season long and again its not though you have to run sets you dont have to run plays for Jordan Miller he can find his way to score and have impact on the game without you calling his number 67 plays a lot taller than that doesnt he but you know what hes legit six seven hes one of the very few guys that is actually his program height I know thats your thing you you want more accountability in the actual program theres Applebees short Marshall the big rebound and up man and well he never misses hes only making 88 of the shots and going up now hes super two today so his percentage is only going up he will end up shooting most likely 90 for the season hes 81 for 92 heres Miller on the spin another Spin and another one three times and this time you call his number you need a basket give it to Jordan Miller whos playing against a player thats at least three inches taller than him on the Block but still not deterred now Miller has scored eight of the last 10 Miami points so hes taking it on his back frankly hes done that all year edelbrook really working hard in there makes another difficult job but speaking of making plays hes done that Tyree Appleby comes up with the Steal theyll get it back to him for the three rebound popped out High controlled by Carr and another opportunity here for the Deacons tied at 14 quick moving first half to these two teams Ray mentioned they like to get up and down the floor Miami scored 97 points in the first matchup between these two Bill Lewis got to get a shot blocked by Beverly and a shot clock violation nice D by the canes and we talked about that X Factor Jordan Miller who isnt as tall as Andrew Carr but hes Nimble and able to find a way to score over top of Carr even though hes given up about three to four inches in that matchup Jordan Miller off to a great start 46 from the field four rebounds already with eight points and he stepped up at 17 points for Miami in that win at home over Pittsburgh where they were able to clinch the ACC regular season championship and his number one seed he had 27 against wake in February and a tie up here under the basket with 8 18 to go lets go to Dre well you all are talking about Jordan Miller in that spin move that he just put on and he said from playing 21 with his older brothers he has three older brothers Javon Justin and Jeffrey he said that was instrumental in helping him become the player that he is today the one closest in age to Jordan is still five years older than him he said I was the runs of the group I had to work on my touch and being able to finesse around my older brothers now he said once he got to be like a sophomore he started winning those games they didnt play as much but the younger 21 games helped him build his Drake when you look at that pitcher strong genes from the Miller family because they look like they look like all they like theyre all the same twins yes or quadruples whatever they are at that point but again they all look alike you can tell the difference in age by size but look exactly like I had to ask which one is actually Jordan earlier Beverly lets fly and knocks down to three Ireland Beverly six six Junior out of Detroit Applause and if the ACC had a comeback Player of the Year award it would have been Harlem Beverly he has given Miami such huge performances especially in big games all season long not only offensively but defense of Israel so Miami beginning to get hot Appleby jumping in and backing it in Miami of those started four for 16 and now four for their last four and its Miller really leading them more than anybody yeah we talked about you know Wake Forest with the advantage of having played in this building yesterday but the disadvantage is fatigue and thats something that you could possibly see happening with Tyree Appleby as this game goes along Beverly with a floater and an offensive foul that goes against the canes and a time I talk about you know the X Factor as a guy who can play even bigger than Sebastian for the Miami Hurricanes attacking the basket coming up with offensive rebounds the putbacks the finishes and of course his ability to go oneonone what he learned against playing against the Big Brothers at 21 its a smaller guy playing big on the Block eight points five rebounds so hes on his way to a doubledouble in the first half hes made four of six almost as if he sensed hey things are going in a choppy manner offensively everyones a little bit sleepy were not making shots took the team on his shoulders and now Miami leads 1916 there will be four of those five rebounds of offensive rebounds so thats just hustle place itll be tipped out later on weve got Duke the number four seed and pit the number five seed at 2 30 right here from Greensboro is anybody in this tournament playing better right now than the Duke Blue Devils well after the the explosion I saw yesterday from the North Carolina State Wolfpack coming into the tournament no ones playing better Applause gets it to go the performance by the guards if you missed it last night of the wolf pack I mean it was incredible they combined for 50 points like 15 rebounds 13 assists one turnover but the difference the way to cravion Smith attacked the beginning of the game the way that he started out shooting the three attacking the basket he knows that he had been in a scoring slump and he broke out of it in major fast man did he second effort omir boy is he strong but Miami right now their best offense is just throwing up on the glass theyre going to go get it we talked about the four offensive rebounds for Jordan Miller that has to be two or three already for norchado mirror and they have dominated the second chance points over here the former Sunbelt Player of the Year at Arkansas State 167 plays bigger kick out for Hildas shot clock down to eight Applause eldruth were gonna make a move caught underneath got it up high for Applebee and he sticks it Tyree Appleby continues to get it done whether its facilitating or scoring hes the guy thats called it for him thats his first make from Beyond the threepointer one of five but seven points two assists already for accs leading scorer and assist man he has the last seven for the Deacons another with another Spin and draws the contact and hell be headed off to the line where he makes 80 percent Tyree Appleby has to have the highest usage rate of any player in the ACC and just squaring up Nigel pack one of the very few guards that he has a size advantage over and shooting over the top of pack again he made only one threepointer against Syracuse yesterday on the topic of Jim Boeheim in Syracuse I want to get your opinion on how everything unfolded yesterday for bayheim and New York start with the fact that you know it didnt go his way with David Williamson knocking down that three to end the tournament for Syracuse but you know the press conference afterwards of course it was very Jim Beijing he left us guessing he didnt want to give any absolute answers he wants you to think about okay you know I want you your guys interpretation on what it is but the reality behind it is Jim behind leaves this game is a true legend thankful for the opportunity that Ive gotten to know him since theyve been in the ACC watched him of course growing up and Im an ACC guy and I know how big the North Carolina Duke rivalry is not as big as a Georgetown Syracuse Robert was in the 80s and 90s not sure anything was right no nothing was there nothing was I dont think Ohio State Michigan football is that big my goodness so again when you look at that I mean I grew up making sure I tuned into Jim behind every time they were on TV all the way for the Stop nobody got in the way of the 67 sophomore they went thundering home for the slam George Chad omear doing it all and right now Steve Forbes not happy with his teams out its an exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal when you take care of your team they take care of business Nicaragua the first player from Nicaragua to earn a D1 scholarship at any school so an overseas influence certainly in this game absolutely we talk about of course you look at just Miamis International flavor in itself so many different guys from outside of the United States but then you go to the other side Wake Forest has it as well we talked about Bobby Clinton as an X Factor reigning from Sweden and then Hildreth and Matthew Marsh both from England so youve got a lot of international flavor in this Music see a lot of college basketball players from England do you that one Zips and all the way to the bench but tipped with 403 to go here in the first half Miami grabbing that fourpoint lead see the attention to detail defensively by the Kings whatever tari app he has the basketball especially when he comes off the screen and Jim larnego of course this team a very good offensive team but doesnt get the credit for how well he coaches defense coming off the timeout lets go to Dre W yeah Dave just listened into that Wake Forest title and so far they really like the pace they want to play on their terms execute in the half court and not play as fast as the Hurricanes want to run big emphasis though was what they call Three Points too many offensive rebounds and too many points off of turnovers for Miami they said we have to make them earn their points thats why Steve Forbes was screaming into his hands you know up and in for two more mirror can be really tough downstairs 14 points 10 rebounds a game and Steve Forbes going immediately to Matthew Marsh after seeing North Shadow Mirror just played bully ball with Andrew Carr on the Block right there and theres nothing Carr can do about that thats not his fault North Carolina is the strongest guy in the ACC car with a spin and two 610 Junior out of West Chester Pennsylvania but thats the way that car has to battle back youve got to go at him on the other end because youre going to take this punishment defensively youve got to make sure you make OMeara play some defense hurricanes Catching Fire and they stay hot gets Miller again with a triple and on top 3023 ACC tournament quarterfinal the first of the day tournament has been downright fascinating with all the headlines coaches leaving their programs jumper on the way off the back of the iron comes out High to Long Nifty feed there to Poplar lines up a long one and its Miller again to tip it to himself of course after knocking down at three on the last possession Jordan Miller coming up with another offensive rebound and thatll go the other way offensive foul on Isaiah long thats number one Obi we showed the pickup game at the park earlier I promise you its a guy out there that plays bully ball and this is the definition oh right to your chest nothing you can do about that movie about four feet back and then Im just going to go lay it up and Im not sure if if North Shadow mirrors made the jester that hes too small a guy thats four inches taller than him Im not sure if thats what happened on the way back but if he had he wouldnt be wrong he has had a really fine year for the Kings third Team all ACC ENT its not bad for a baseball player huh right that will be down the lane Scoops in two of course more Chad omearas first sport was baseball would have to say they maybe outgrew the sport but Aaron Jones is about six seven in the Outfield correct yeah he wasnt born he was founded absolutely astronomical great block there by Marsh as he denied at the 10 on the Rhonda Williamson got it he hits the triple and here comes Wake Forest again and weve got a timeout 38 for four half and a tight one here we have to be first team all ACC listed at a generous six feet tall as is David Williamson this backcourt for Wake Forest Mall in stature but theyre big on production and theyve been just that here this afternoon Miller again theyre kinging and another block for Wake play by Clinton he tries to go down the lane Toe to Toe there with omir and a whistle as he hits the deck Bobby Clinton he at six nine and OMeara will pick up number two with a minute 18 before the break the north Shadowmere oftentimes is penalized for flat out just being stronger than everyone else and again omir goes up vertically but hes so strong that the Freshman Bobby Clinton just Falls backwards and again I dont know that though mirror did anything wrong with that he went vertically but hes just strong and is going to knock Clinton you know on his back trying to challenge him hes useless by now people just bouncing off him like pingpong balls and hitting the bench in with two fouls so larenaga gets him to the side so as not to pick up another one where we talk about his first sport being baseball and of course hes excelling on the basketball court but if this doesnt work out for him long term Im sure theres an NFL team that may want to look at him as they tied in he may want to cover all the majors more another major leagues for it Alex Cora of Miami Hurricane a big fan of these Ks watches them all the time keeping an eye the Red Sox manager and its Wong to knock that one down Isaiah Wong getting to that midrange where hes so dangerous Miami up 3229 see how they have heated up after a one for 10 start and a whistle with 459 seconds Music and thatll go on Clinton of the Demon Deacons off the ball number two they check out the bracket still to come as mentioned Duke and Pitt that should be a Dandy 45 game is always terrific good Virginia North Carolina Clemson NC State Nancy stages rocking and rolling last night Kobe all five days are the of the ACC tournament are great but Thursday this is the day when the Heavy Hitters get into town and youve got teams who have earned their way to that match up against them in the quarterfinal Poplar midrange Shan knocks it down Applause so Miami intent on going to the locker room with an advantage here against Wake Forest and our first quarterfinal today back for Hildreth Mildred gives up the dribble and another whistle and that ones going to go against Wake Forest underneath believe they got Tyree Appleby there trying to set a screen and thats going to be the second foul on Applebee see Tyree Appleby trying to set that screen on Walker and Appleby is a right to wonder how he got the foul on that like a wrestling match but thats the second foul on top reality so he comes out of the game in a scenario where he rarely ever sits down you talked about he leads to ACC and met his play still doesnt want to come out 91 to go Taylor with the foul wrong with a chance to get one more shot away heres Miller has been a hot hand for the canes nice block by Carr transfer he by hildred Applause but Cameron Hildreth who hits the most spectacular shot of the tournament yesterday in the lane Clemson Tigers and where they are and of course the North Carolina Tar Heels moving forward later tonight can we put away this kind of vague notion that Pitt needs to win a couple of games here to get to the NCAA tournament so disrespectful thats all I can say about it hes been disrespectful all year hit Clemson have been the most disrespected teams in college basketball this season oh 3429 underway in the second half Miami the top seed looking for their 25th win of the season Applause Poplar with a Fall Away shot and connects thats a tough bucket right there Wilco Poplar has become the other guy for the Hurricanes we come in talking about the fact that they have four guys that average over 13 points per game for them well go popular made six threepointers in that you know cleansing win over Miami hes becoming much more of an offensive threat move his legal name is Nicene but he prefers the nickname that his grandma Gabe is able to get in close 3631 Grandma Colin Morgan thats simply the way it goes so he goes by good shooting range thought about the three there up top for the ACC Player of the Year Isaiah Wong 16 points four assists the game Music off the front iron wake on the other hand 19 wins after their thrilling victory over Syracuse yesterday the man who nailed down that win Williamson yeah Williamson primarily known as a threepoint shooter but a number of times in this game doing a great job going off the balance finishing up the rim Miller to the paint strong on the dish and one as well on the Finish By omir lets check in with Dre thanks Dave well I caught up with coach for coming out of halftime and he said a few things that they have to fix theyve got to get back on defense take care of the basketball which those two things go hand in hand and the other thing he wants to look for is them being more aggressive in the half court early in the shot clock he said we cant just pass it around the perimeter which is what we saw Williamston do just a possession ago you know one of the things also Drake for the reasons why theyve been passive is because Miamis done a great job blitzing Tyree Appleby when hes coming off those screen row actions so just as you mentioned David Williamson attacking the rim Wake Forest is going to have to have someone else step up and be a playmaker for them with Applebees drawing so much attention Bobby Clinton out now with three fouls so thats a major development with 18 minutes to go who had such a huge game yesterday 1711 against the orange hes now on the bench but Matthew Marsh started the majority of this season so hes more than capable of taking care of those minutes and hes a bigger body to have to defend northshadow mirror so he can help Wake Forest in this matchup Miami looking to build on their lead and they can do it that way absolutely drained it hes 41 beyond that line and you put in a tough predicament when you have Nigel pack coming at you and a shooter on the wing but suggestion take the ball out of pax hands hes the most dangerous guy from Beyond threepoint Arch Williamson shut down trying to get to the lane car will fire and a whistle and that will go against Wake Forest Matthew Marsh its 71 from Cornwall England and thats number one on the big fella you know we had a shot of Steve Forbes there a moment ago before the second half began he called over one of the officials Bill Covington and they had a pretty serious heart to heart and it was fascinating to watch Jim larenega standing about 20 feet away looking at them he had kind of an amused look on his face heres Miller Applause big rebound Again by omir and they finish it with some empty passing as well Poplar and that leads to timeout 44 is 33 Miami Applause the second chance points Miamis really dominating in that category over Bill Covington they had a fairly lengthy chat actually it seemed more like one way but Jim larenaga was off to the side about 20 feet away he was kind of watching and then building smartthing came over and explained what they were chatting about for more on that lets go to Dre yeah I just got word that the conversation was about a play that happened in the first half and you all talked about the play Tyree Appleby sent the back screen pretty physical back screen and Tyree Appleby ends up getting the offensive foul on the screen so coach Forbes was spiritedly looking for some clarification on that call and more importantly to that Dre it was the second foul on Tyree Appleby who leads to ACC in minutes and of course is the most important guy to his team in this league so Steve Forbes recognizing how important that call was but the lips and connects as he will bury a threes and of course as we talk about him he continues to show his importance twoway for us and their chances to be able to win knocking down the threepointers no rule by the way that says Bill Covington very classy official that he had to go to Jim larenag and say this is what he was asking about he did it on a decency there in courtesy and there is Jordan Miller on target again well and also Bill Covington didnt have to go over and talk to Steve Forbes so lets get Bill Covington a lot of credit and thats one of the things about this league the relationships between not only the officials and the players but also the officials and the coaches I think is a strong one Applebee got to get his teammate car out of the way and now he throws that one away those two unable to get together as they fumble a Carl kind of caught in the middle right there Appleby wasnt sure if he was going to cut to the basketball if he was going to pop back behind a threepoint line led him toward the basket the car never moved 4736 Miami looking to move on the number one seed Wake Forest coming in as the number nine seed they want to be the Cinderella here long on the dribble pulls up and Pops yes sir hes so good in the midrange and thats one of the things about Isaiah wall his ability to go create shots when you look at you know everyone else for Miami they have a lot of guys who play well in their roles but you can put the basketball in Isaiah Wongs hands and you know what we like to say on the playground he can go get one Williamson Slams on the brakes and down it goes what a nice variety of shots it has been a lot of shot making great shot making of course still no one will top with Cam Hildreth did yesterday to tie the game at 74 however a lot of shot makers in this game isnt that interesting because David Williamson hit a threepointer almost at the buzzer to win the game and hit the shot you remember is Hildreth and thatll go the other way 1518 remaining in this contest thats amirs third foul 4938 Miami remembering each others remembrances is fascinating but you notice how Randolph never remembers anything negative about him himself see thats the thing I remember his positive I remember when he had the best ACC Tournament of all time now the Asterix beside that is I was injured I didnt get to play which means that he was able to make that happen it wouldnt have happened if I was on the court but Randolph never remembered any of the bats like when I kicked his butt in 1993 and sent him home so therefore that he never remembers that part he only remembers when he wins I was at the dinner I was right next to you guys we were there for three and a half hours I didnt say a single word you did I just listened to you guys go back and forth it was the most entertaining part of the whole night you did you ordered your steak Joseph went for the scoop and its going to be knocked away actually off of him and out so its going to be Wake Forest ball Im just here to jump in and say I dont think you can believe any veteran for player recounting their experiences I think you got to go to the tape you got to go to the stat sheets because its all skewed all of its going to be stupid Dre I got receipts Dre thats one thing I carry receipts you can look up 1993 Virginia burst Wake Forest in the ACC tournament I got receipts so I mean its true Everything thankfully is on record so lets go to the tape and now again Im not on this team Im injured because one thing for certain I am not on that tape he did my boy touche AKA Jeff again its dirty on that one that was the dirty part the wave and hes forces touche didnt see him afterwards Randolph is doing a lot of media right the two wasnt happy about that but youve got to make the shot youve got to make the shot I mean again the single best performance Ive ever seen over a threeday span he earned it he deserved it Joseph nothing but net Ensley Joseph a sophomore 38 from three and that lead is up to 5238 Miami and now Miami starting to get a rhythm offensive we talked about the fact Wake Forest had played in this building yesterday Miamis starting to look now like the Miami Hurricanes weve seen all season long Applebee to the Baseline tough sledding underneath still trying goal Here Comes Jordan Miller and thats a travel on Poplar were 1349 to go champ week on ESPN presented by principal in the tournament presented by New York Life the Pac12 mens tournament UCLA dealing with injury issues but Arizona had a great nonconference schedule a little inconsistent in Pac12 play but two great teams coming out of Pac12 a chance for the west coast to regain a title this season I dont think there are any Elite teams in college basketball right now I think its going to be a wide open field in the NCAA tournament out of the double shot clock down to six the kick per car and Carr into the lane and hes tied up long nut in there and the possession arrow goes over to Miami and Obi while we have a chance I want to send out our thoughts and prayers to Bill selfie we see him back on the sidelines soon speedy recovery indeed scary news there coach self Miami the top seed Wake Forest the number nine and Miami beginning to look like the number one seed here in the second half Isaiah Wong ACC Player of the Year this is a mismatch right here tough for car to be able to stay in front of this guy heres the three oh yes thats like Christmas morning thats like walking down the stairs seeing the tree like I got a brand new toy I know it when you get a big guy on you trying to guard you on the perimeter like that Isaiah Wongs eyes just light up Miami eight for ten shooting it in the second half and now they look really comfortable that is not good news for the Demon Deacons and the top of the slab for marsh with the feed and a basket way desperately needed Applause and a 15point lead for the Kings long at work again and Hildreth took it away from him nice defensive stop there by Hilda regardless of the score Cameron Hill just continuing to do the job defensively Beverly trying to hold up Appleby commits the foul one thing you dont want is getting switched off because Andrew Carr finds himself on the island stranded trying to defend Isaiah Wong at the top of the key who steps back and knocks down to three and you see the big smile like a I hope he thats Christmas morning right there you get that match up Carr has to get him back on the other end of the floor it might be the player of the year clip you should use I mean again that is definitely one to go with this highlight reel Applause pull up by Williamson denied back out for Hildreth Applause Music inside left it behind and thats going to go the other way thats going to be an offensive foul thats going to be number two on Miller the number two seed in the Big Ten Tournament by 30 but also they have wins against Virginia wins against Miami and two wins against North Carolina in the ACC this season those should be a terrific battle against a Duke team that is clicking on all cylinders theyre healthy 11 50 to go here and a lot of work for Wake Forest to do trailing by 15 you mentioned the Blue Devil is the hottest team coming into the tournament winners of six in a row and John Shire having a full compliment of player Applause Clinton back in playing in foul trouble and a misfire there you and I talked to Coach Shire earlier today and we asked him are you playing your best basketball this season he said absolutely and the offense is starting to catch up with the defense they have been the best defensive team in the ACC this year as Nigel Todd gets inside and is able to get the easy layup Duke has been by far the best defensive team in the ACC this season and now that offense is starting to catch up as Jeremy roach continues to recover from injury and starts to become their perimeter score on the outside do the Dean deacons have an answer they had one yesterday for Syracuse Appleby has typically been that man all season long but he cant hit rebound popped around into the backcourt for Hildreth Hildreth down the lane and itll roll in as he took the foul Cameron Hilda going all the way to the back court and straight to the rack and Wake Forest has had a difficult time trying to give Tyree Appleby good shots throughout this game again Miami a lot of credit defensively as you see not just Appleby but as well know all the end of the floor Miami sharing the basketball getting easy looks and thats what happens when you have so many different offensive opportunities on one end youve got four different Playmakers for the Hurricanes when you consider a Nigel pack of nor chat OMeara on the interior and of course Isaiah Wong Jordan Miller on the outside so a lot of different options for Jim larenegger to play with on the offensive end Applause long resting at the moment on Jim larenegas bench Applause back up for Miller seven to shoot easy bucket easy yes but but OB it is not just the easy bucket because Bensley Joseph gets the layup look at the play Man play Man handling the basketball in the on the perimeter and dropping a dime for the easy layup for your point guard 5943 the canes coming up on 10 minutes to go Clinton measures it cant hit just has not had a repeat of the day he had against Jim boeheims orange yesterday Applause Music Pat negotiating his way through all the way to the cup Miami outscoring Wake Forest 2714 in the second half and this is really kind of what we assumed would happen Natalie after hes every step I knocked down to three the number one seed they just kind of get their sea legs when youre when you come out in the first half but the second half theyve shown us why theyre the number one seed yeah theyve found those legs theyre 11 for 13 in the second half Applause Miller to the Lane swatted Away by Clinton and at times here the second half it has felt too easy it really has been a UC Jordan Miller once again just as simple the eye contact and Bensley Joseph with the back door the easy one and weve mentioned all the different playmakers that Jim lager has we didnt even mention Bensley Joseph your Boston guy Applause so to Arlington Applebee swings it Williamson to the corner too strong car will control and right back up for two nice battle by Andrew Carr theyre coming up with the second chance opportunity but as you see the jump shot starting to come up short or a little right a little left the fatigue starts to set in now for Wake Forest Tyree athletes played a lot of minutes in these past two days Applause Beverly left open a fire Appleby a oneman fast break backs away for three and thats just a tough shot I mean thats a tough shot on The Fast Break for one you may want to consider attacking the rim Joseph short and we go the other way Miami thought they had it but itll be Wake Forest ball at 8 15 to go 6148 the canes Applause yesterday was the demon Deacons first ACC tournament win since 2017 and a great Victory against Syracuse to eliminate the orange the last game in a legendary career for Jim Boeheim as it turned out Clinton though pack lays it up and a foul a whistle there as long on the pass went for the dunk 7 53 to go Appleby with his third foul just under eight in the team where they showed you the effect of a shot fake you see not just one not two but three shot bakes to get a open look with David Williamson in the corner unable to finish it but because of the shot fakes all Miami Defenders are out of position allowing Andrew Carr to come up with the offensive rebound the easy put back Garf would be proud after watching that so big big teaching point in those camps absolutely right there did station 13 was the optional station when you went to Five Star basketball camps back in the day but it wasnt optional for everyone if you were one of the stars and you didnt show up golf would have a nice talking to with you much later our Garfunkel Legend and his time Miller going up strong no London there for the rebound and Wake Forest needs to make something happen quickly Applause Corey when were talking shot fake most important key to a shot fake hands eyes feet Im going with all of the above you have to sell it as though youre actually going to shoot the basketball the eyes have to go up the ball has to move in an upward trajectory and you have to have your feet square before anyones going to believe youre actually going to take that shot and speaking of taking that shot we have seen David Williamson taking his shots at the rim and finishing and this time amongst the trees are contacted and one the jute shot yesterday 17 points against Syracuse theyll shake it up here but outstanding at the foul line at 89 percent Applause he has 11 so far nine of those come in second half and Carr wins it back with the hustle and Wake Forest isnt going to go away we saw this team come back yesterday and end up getting a huge win so right now as this game gets closer to the end if they continue to maintain their legs they can make it a close one at the end five to get off the shot hes swing for Williamson he goes in quickly but no and the shot clock went off there he has that basketball hit the rim so that shot clock shouldnt have gone off but play stops just in 40 conference at the mom was at the monitor was all about 702 to go and the ball will be underneath it was actually before the foul was called the reset so 18 seconds on the shot clock for Wake Forest Damian Williamsons basketball course hit the rim great job by officiating crew so wait to put it in under seven to play car spinning put it on the deck and theres a foul Music Isaiah Wong will get number two with 6 52 left Applebee to put it in on the Baseline Music Bill Covington have a quick conversation with Cam Hilder Ruger popular Applause love it I love the fact that he let him know hey next time it happens Im putting the foul on you but he doesnt right then and there gives them opportunity to clean it up on their own Applause heres Hildreth got to get a shot up here shot clock at six he makes a lot of tough shots Carl with a big rebounds none of the white shirts around him Applebee no the one thing were seeing without omir on the floor Miami is susceptible to giving up those offensive rebounds weve seen a number of those from Carr as of late a pack sprawling down thats number four on Applebee Tyree Appleby the number one scorer to Mars Burton in there with the headphones on hes locked in Poplar launches yes he rattles one in thats a twopointer a lot has said about the transfers and the new players for Miami but youve got to give Jim learning and his staff a lot of credit for the development they recruited Isaiah Wong they recruited Ruger popular step back three and a big rebound here by Poplar and Miami not looking like they are ready to give up this lead inside its Miller Applause essence you gotta love the way they share the basketball though Isaiah Wong is a scorer but he also League Miami and assist so hes willing to give the basketball up Williamson left switches into three we needed that one they really did David Williams is stepping up weve got to mention Demar Monsanto the leading threepoint shooter in the ACC making it with 32 a game out injured for the last two games for now long will release and thatll glance away and now it goes back over to wake Monsanto 13 points a game the accs number one threepoint man in terms of threepointers made yeah they lost him to that knee injury yeah 32 a game they lost him in the first half against NC State and again trying to be able to come up with someone to replace that type of productivity is difficult long one Clinton yes Ryan driver for three theyre still hanging around but thats one guy who has stepped up and monsantos absence Bobby Clinton has grown as a basketball player and that three right there gets the game back into single digits and puts just a little bit of life into the Demon Deacons with 451 remains Music now Steve Forbes team hanging in there 6556 so Miami takes the time out Jim larenegger gets North adamuir back on the floor recognizing his importance he gets a touch going up strong theyre ejected by Clinton and Clinton has done the job defensively as well I believe thats at least his fourth shot blocked in this game enough will be flipping it up he hits the deck but he gets hits and Nigel pack he went down holding onto his arm back will get his third foul with 428 to go Applause and well see if he can continue both guys holding on to their arms Applebees got to go to the line where hes 82 percent will be received the second most votes for ACC player of the year which went to Miamis Isaiah Wong this year and of course Appleby and David Williamson cam hilders making up one of the better backcourts in the ACC as do Nigel pack Isaiah Wong will go popular and when you look at the matchups that we have in these quarterfinals the backcourts are going to tell the story we talked about NC State with jaquel Joyner to Cleveland Smith and of course Casey Marcel but does Virginia have the best back for it when you consider Kihei Clark Reese beef in the Defensive Player of the Year rock solid and Arman Franklin the leading scorer so its going to come down to the back horse in my opinion that who walks away with that ACC tournament trophies only you look at Tyree Applebys season I mean hes been special Wake Forest just down the road their fans urging the Demon Deacons with four minutes to go pack stepping back cant drain it battle for the rebound it comes to Hildreth this could get real interesting oh hes that he got to step to him though you saw cam hildred coming down he had a little bounce in the step on that one he knew he was going to the rim and challenging Ruger popular and will have two free throws when we return on the floor power especially after you got warmed up like Miami but like wig Id have some good fight for you Dre I would agree with you having a lot of good fight for me but my offensive power went away a long time ago with arthritis set in this right hip which means Im not moving at all if I cant move you with a jab Im not going anywhere youre too good of a Defender for me to get loose on right now I was thinking that when you were on the treadmill this morning by the way why does nobody ever pick me Im just sitting over here and I I dont have an arthritic hit I feel great I picked you the other day I said you beat you Joe Berry yeah Luke Hancock we could win some games we can win some games I put you on a squad Stone Pastor Brian and were fine Davids because we didnt see you in the gym this morning thanks for rubbing that one you guys were there I know along with everybody else on our crew well a 154 run and an eightnothing run for Wake Forest and they are in the game at 6558 and give wake force a lot of credit no give but important free throw Miss on that last possession again you need every point that you can get over this game simply because its going to be difficult to stop Miami on this end I jump back with a terrific shot going up and over the trees 6758 not many foul shots for Miami Appleby turns a long one yes a threepointers sixpoint game will be three minutes remaining an eternity in a college basketball game and all of a sudden we questioned Wake Forest ledge theyve got some juice back in this building quickly to the other end gotta look out for number one thats what theyre trying to do back with the foul that will be so dangerous and we wondered how much energy Tyree app we would have late game simply because he played so many minutes and he answers that question with more than enough on the Move raising up knocking down a huge threepoint that release is lightning quick it is hes not a big guard but he got elevation on his shot allows him to shoot over top of taller players lets go so hes back to the line 6961 demon Deacon surging here at the right time he said it about four minutes ago they needed to make a move they did they absolutely did and now they find themselves in Striking Distance right now can they get some stops on the other end of the floor well determine whether or not they can make this a close game at the end takes one or two but they get the rebound back to Appleby 19 a game for him slice a rejected by omir he said no sir Applause at six foot seven plays as though hes seven feet I mean again we talk about his strength but just plays like that you would never realize that hes undersized as far as height on the interior look at the difference between these two guys and again hes about three inches short and hes got three inches of hair bow there before the inbounds and thats going to go against Pat and thats number five hes fouled out huge loss for Miami weve seen pack step up and make a number of big buckets for him them down the stretch and now playing without their starting point guard now Bentley Joseph more than capable of stepping in he finishes a lot of games for Jim larenega but he normally finishes those games alongside Nigel pack having to replace him here a big moment for the sophomore packs 13 points a game last time Miami knocked off Wake Forest he hit 24 points in that game he is done for the afternoon Appleby missing now doesnt miss many hes missed two straight now and wait for six of 13 from the freethrow line in this game and of course oftentimes when you lose games you go back and look like you look at what happened normally its turnovers offensive rebounds you give up and missed free throws made number two 6963 the Wake fans really coming to life here in Greensboro and not just wake fans will be theres a lot of Duke Blue showing up over there well rooting on the Demon Deacons they want all the North Carolina teams in the final four of the ACC tournament here after the turnover no once again it was omir defensively the pack by the way its the first time in his career hes ever fouled out of the game wow well I mean again hes only had to play against Tyree Appleby twice and thats a lot of pressure you have to put on John spans off the window hell draw the foul and Isaiah 1 doing the smart thing going in spawn and remind you whats coming up winner this one on into the semifinals weve got Duke and Pitt four and five thats at 2 30 later on tonight two and seven Virginia and North Carolina and Clemson and NC State three against six thats at 9 30 with Dan Schulman and Jay billis coming your way for the night session and lets just say the Blue Devils are in the building right now if you span this Arena you will see a lot of Duke Blue here to cheer on the Blue Devils come on excellent at the line extends the lead to 7163 wake takes one here and then looking to come back and do what they did yesterday winning a thriller with half a second left on a three by Damian Williamson whos 38 percent beyond the threepoint line championship game coming up on Saturday by the way 8 30 pm on ESPN its when a champion will be crowned in this legendary tournament legendary you said it I would like to say this is the 70th ACC tournament the granddaddy of all college basketball conference tournaments and in my opinion of course Im biased still the best tournament that you will ever see from a conference standpoint one memorable finish after another for some its a little too loud Music but shes locked in Music it sure is shes into weight too 206 to go nap will be here Applause Tyree Appleby Applause for Glendon tend to get off the shot he gives up the dribble B with five to shoot the Carr will launch it got a good look and the car force is capable of knocking down the three ball got a good look on that possession but took a lot of time they need to stop on this possession to keep this keep the hope alive sure did Im here with a double double for Miami and they can run some time long so reliable the basketball in his hands ome youre backing into the paint and left that one short rebound zip control by car Williamson wants to push oh whirling dervish in the lane that may have hit the backboard first e Forbes wants a goal team good thing he didnt get the goal team because they got the three instead Steve for corpse having a conversation with Justin Porterfield right now but if Im Steve Forbes Ill keep the three instead of the two well his team is boarded in the second half and Hildreth in the clutch is Wake Forest gonna do it again tremendous recovery here and again on the offensive glass they have out rebounded Miami 102 in the second half he has been a tale of two different halves with these teams especially on the glass D4 got across to his team exactly what they needed to do to make this a game during that halftime conversation that theyve been able to come out and execute 59 and a half seconds Jim lareneggers team several times in the second half has threatened to put this game away but wake has refused to let them do it now I want to say that Miami at one point had an 18 point lead here in this second half so give Wake Forest a lot of credit cutting it down to five right now but defensively can they get a stop trailing by 18 with 9 51 remaining comes over the last nine minutes theyve been able to cut that lead down 13 points still down five needing a stop on this possession to keep it going of course were talking about the number one seed in the tournament getting nervous now the Miami Hurricanes and the number one seed playing without Nigel pack who fouled out of this game so not only do you look at pack as a shot maker but also a free throw maker down the stretch one of the guys when youre going to get fouled whos able to handle the basketball and take care of business at the line so here we go last minute of the play at least in regulation 7166 Steve Forbes coming off the timeout even Dickens trying to win for the 20th time and pressure here as Wong looks to check it in he does for Miller hes doubled up and gets a timeout that is a great trap great possession the timeout will reset the shot clock the clock so you still have 10 seconds to be able to get it across half court but it will be a dead spot you cannot run on the throw in now which gives you a few more options for Wake Forest with your tracks Music 7166 and he had trouble getting free underneath here this is the wingspan this is what youre looking for from a defender on the basketball and more importantly in a trap you see the Trap once again Bobby Clinton getting over and just taking up so much space great job on Wake Forest utilizing that press to be able to get the timeout call and more importantly to put that pressure on Miami to handle the basketball in the back court trapped like that normally calls turnovers Miami is one time on remaining wake is out of timeouts Music hurricanes basketball Kanes have the reliability of Isaiah Wong and Jordan Miller remember Wong cannot run on this inbounds pass he has to stay in that spot which makes that wingspan even more valuable Miller back for Wong hits it across mid Court Music taking that bucket in comparison to try to pulling it out and putting the pressure on the free throws a great effort to try and steal it by Joseph but its back over to Appleby heres hillbrow Appleby unable to get off one shot trying that one a threepointer acrobatic triple 7369 Miller pressured great job by Andrew Carr recognizing when North Shadowmere catch that basketball hes the guy you want to put on the line for Miami and UC Tyree Appleby hes done it all afternoon long stepping up making big shots the threepointer as you mentioned acrobatic but its still good now to your point omir just a 71 foul shooter nothing awful about that but the other guys are 83 8789 and a lot of iron but he drops it in with 33 seconds to go and the Keynes at the U trying to play their way to semifinals Applause 14 and 10 for him he gets one of two up ahead Appleby another one coming too strong another cradling the rebound and they are going to foul him with 226 the Tyree hopf we got another great look unable to knock that one down weve got a great look the nice kick ahead pass from Cameron hildre but still 226 down five a lot of time left remaining in this game Miami is going to have to take care of their business at the freethrow line Wake Forest can afford for Miami to split when they get there one and one here for Miller 80 at the foul line for the year and misfires Applause Applebees on the drive that one tips High out for Clinton down to 11 heres Williamson the star Yesterday cant get a shot away Hill Ruth off the fake a three headset with 33 to go a twopoint game the inbound for Poplar theyre going to foul him charge to Wake Forest with two seconds to go Appleby has fouled out but you got the shots you want it the only problem it took so long to get it now with only two seconds remaining this game can be sealed at the freethrow line if Miamis able to step up and knock down both of them a fourpoint game can end it and again knocking down the three with shoes with Wake Forest The Tyree affle fouling out of this game gave it everything he had 24 points for the first team all ACC performer man that he hits a big shots he hit big shots he made big plays he did everything Steve Forbes and the Wake Forest Demon Deacons could have asked of him throughout this game so they added a little more time 27 472 Miami looking to hang on and play their way into the semifinals here at the ACC tournament what a comeback for Wake Valiant effort from the Demon Deacons and its not over yet 27 seconds remaining a Miss at the free throw line gets them an opportunity for a Time Ruger popular has not attempted to foul shot but hes 89 percent at the line has not tried one yet today 27 seconds to go and its in and out of his car up at Williamson Miami does hang on theyre into the semifinals boy when its Williamson you got to hold your breath because he won the game with the three yesterday Miami wins itself
