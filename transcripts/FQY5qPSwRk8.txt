in Syracuse on a Saturday night in The Gnome Jer Davis beats Van Allen luin for the tip Ron gr Jamal Spearman Brent Hampton are officiating crew and away we go with the Syracuse possession orange coming off of a loss at Miami on Tuesday 9184 Eddie lampin had a monster game that day he is double team now and dribbles the ball out of bounds a good trap for Carolina and a Syracuse turnover as we look at the starters for North Carolina they are brought to you by CDW same five as last game for Hubert Davis RJ Davis with K and Trimble the guards then Alan Luben and then Jaylen Withers making another start having been on the bench most of the year a challenge for Carolina has been getting RJ Davis the ball enough so he can impact the game with his playmaking and his experience in field rolls it into lugan very high percentage shooter leaves it short starting from drive for Syracuse JJ Sterling 19 a game their leading score Taylor and more the guards Davis of Delaware transfering lamin over from Colorado his only year in Syracuse leading the ACC at offensive rebound second and double doubles he has been a beast heres Starling out of a double into Davis good midp player and Davis bricks the first Syracuse shot like the look though that short roll is going to be there particularly against against the smaller lineup you just got to be able to shoot over a smaller guard and it is going to be a smaller lineup most away for Carolina as its been all year Pau lot of assists a lot of turnovers there is the ladder heres Lucas Taylor and Davis will get rid of it to Applause lampin lampin working against lubben a drop off deflected away from Gyer Davis and a steal for RJ Davis with three turnovers between these teams and not yet two minutes I think the challenge for Syracuse is playing to your advantage which is lampin down low but not being too obvious about it which allows Carolina to just adjust to the ball the do tough catch for Lu he misses another one the ball deflects out to Withers the will take it himself this time right into the body of Taylor and roll home the games first points I like when he does that more and when he does it early he can get where he wants to go off the bounce and you and I have done enough game for Herman say that like the guy that can get where he wants to go off the bounce is the most dangerous guy on the floor but he needs to be able to score it first Davis passes up a three they get lampin isolated with Luben and he bullies him under the hoop l and a whistle called by Bren Hampton under the play that was a proper call Kevin that was a bully move and if thats the thing if lampin is quick about his decision making down low when he gets a catch its going to keep away from the double team much easier if you make a quick decisive move avoid the double dominate The Possession down low Caroline is going to have to adjust quickly defensively lamp at 22 and 13 plus six assists no turnovers in the win or the loss to Miami Tuesday and Adrian a said he felt like they should have gotten the ball more despite the 22 heres what Eddies done the last couple of games eight double doubles in the last 11 and playing 30 minutes a game for Syracuse even more than that most of their games in ACC play most importantly he was really friendly today and he complimented both of us on our suit he did he didnt make fun of your glasses what glasses nobody saw glasses in the open sometimes you just forget a cck lens you know happens to the best of us and the worst of us foul was on Starling toau as the first four points for North Carolina which brings Jaylen Washington onto the floor for the first time replacing Ruben there a little pressure I like this I I would like to see this from Carolina from 40 minutes and it leads to a steal Trimble no withs no out for Kad and Davis will get a clean look and he will miss a three care send it no keep sending it up you just saw Hubert Davis keep it on keep it on if youre going to go small youve got to capitalize on that as an advantage right make your disadvantage an advantage pick the pace of the game up which also means pick up the pressure in the game make Syracuse deal with urgency early in this one I saw it late last game and I loved it fits into what Hubert Davis told us at shoot around today weve got to be dogs weve got to know who we are Starling tipped Away by Washington and another rejection much more emphatic on the second for Washington whos been a shot blocking machine of late but thats what the the little extra pace and urgency does it makes huse play Fast which you have to get the game fast and make it your advantage if your Carolina Davis from Kad shop fake Taylor step back three grab by lamper just 1 for seven but there are some really good looks early I as you like to say clappable misses for clappable misses Im glad youre catching on you Elijah Moore very good threepoint shooter The Freshman his pass knocked away back to Moore rolling with Lin leads it short gets his Miss Washington was in the way maybe to alter the trajectory or his mind and Kad turns on the Jets leads the layup short I dont mind it I like I like the tempo that theyre putting on this game and theyve been really consistent about seeking that out now we got two Young Guns about to check into the game for Carolina fresh bodies Jackson and Drake Towell Davis rocks his way to the right side of the paint Davis physical senior of the Newark Delaware drer Davis averaging 8 and a half on the year in Washington Starling mson and that is a significant one already the second foul on Syracuses leading score saw a tough decision for Adrian alry coming up we take a look at the state of the ACC when we come Music back optimism and positivity which is hard to do in the face of this every time he says to us he is he loves his guys he he has a real genuine Joy about him and its just a team hes trying to get to understand the rhythms of the Season understand the little things that can take him out of games for a couple of minutes here there look I I think part of why its so tough for the ACC right now is because of the strength of the SEC right you see another conference seemingly doing this and this is a new world the last few years its a new world in college basketball the SEC has just figured it out well a lot of things were in place leading up to this and in a way the accs played a little catch up I I dont like that that the reality is its about money yeah thats just kind of how it is and at some point weve got to figure out how to make it not the case right lets find some consistency then you keep good coaches around people understand how you can actually compete and win at this level with consistency 54 the Carolina lead here Washington went one for two as we mentioned that was starlings second foul but he stays on the floor for Syracuse got Jackson shot fakes the three step F and Ian Jackson who did not hit a field goal on Monday scores on his first touch hes just got hes got a great feel for the game hes got to have that short memory we talk about just go out and play make mistakes play through mistakes get better because of the mistakes cuz his potential is off the chart J CL Carlos Chris Bell on the floor for Syracuse lampin finishes over the log on to Washington Carlos is like s uses K right you know youre not going to worry too much about him shooting times that could hurt you with space on the floor but his Crea ability is what just opens the floor Gs second turnover I just like that I mean the the field Jackson has the the little pump fake fly by side step step back behind the three smooth he creates great rhythm with that bounce and lamin great find by Carlos lamin almost got this blocked Wasington Applause everywhere Syracuse brings in patar my storic freshman from Serbia for the first time lampin oh my storic just sealed off some space inside for a clear pass he doesnt get enough credit for the little things he does right theyre always beneath the surface hes physical hes tough he communicates and he does those little things like clear out space for someone else to score now were going old school in the D two three Zone the last couple of possessions and Syracuse has forced back to back turnovers now the the zone is disruptive especially when Carolina was trying to put Pace on the game but really this this is all about the clear out good move yes but create space and play for one another so some Carolin got to figure out how to do if youre a smaller lineup you have its not about playing with one another its playing for one another how can you maximize the potential of the guys around you make the game easier for you l again short Doric Washington and Trimble on the floor its Carolina ball on the Arrow all right big day college hoops continues after this one in Austin Texas another one of those teams squarely on the bubble host number 15 Kentucky and then 17th rank Kansas visits Utah its a new Big 12 matchup West Coast prime time at 10 Eastern Kentucky a three seed in the ncaas initial early reveal of the top 16 seeds today the had five of the top six jaon misses his second threepoint try that was good stuff though they got a little offensive action somewhat of a set against the Zone screen the side draw one and this is good set too Jackson takes it away from Bell and finishes fi Ian Jackson Jacksons at his best if if he brings energy right and thats both sides of the ball and I think hes a guy like Drake pal they put a certain energy on the game if you start to press with that group I think thats where you can start to see how dangerous they could be he and Jackson with Five Points early back to back games where he had made a field goal before that and Jackson flies in for the rebound here off the Miss three pushes for Davis Washington a rare threepoint try he hits his second of the Year good Rhythm though into the shot as a trailer if youre set youre stepping into it it feels like a higher percentage shot than it may be on paper by storage for Bell Syracuses best threepoint shooter is Off the Mark was he wanted it he sure did Carlos and Starling at the top of that zone which used to be the only thing Syracuse would play Trimble High close space Lampton tips it to himself cir is a very good defensive rebounding team and Starling is fouled here Ian Jackson looks to eight tough season for the tar Hills who are trying not to miss the NCAA tournament for a second time in the last three years Hubert Davis had some Val very telling comments last Monday on his radio show with voice thear Hills Jones Angel this was part of it the old model for Carolina basketball just doesnt work theres so many things in play with the nil the portal agents International Players you need a bigger staff so I can do what Im supposed to be doing and thats coaching basketball and and part of that he said John was that I never would have thought in the four years that I took the job that Im 100 on what I need is a general manager so he plans to hire a GM after the year and changed the model after Carolina had some highprofile misses as nem McLoud finishes in the transfer portal this year and I think the more teams go to that model we talked to hbert about this the more teams go to that model the more its going to force the NCA to find some consistency with how things will be done because look some people will fare better in the wild west than others and the old model is yeah its its gone in this sense doesnt mean you cant make make it work but that ball was taken off the glass by McLoud Luben two theres a part of me that I think what were living through right now is is like the massive adjustment period but its not the stabilized adjusted period right weve got to get to that until we really start making longterm decisions right now its like the next few years were going to do what we can do to win but we need some Applause stability Carlos Davis with the block shot got it back from the cloud Kyle cuff is seen the floor for the first time going to spark off the bench at times Carlos and of the clock Davis takes it away a block and a steal on the same possession and Jackson and It swatted Away by Carlos on the other side three on one you have to capitalize theres just no way around it sometimes its best in a threeonone to give it up early get it back lets get the defender on head on a swivel RJ Davis get the score for UNC Luen again over the 74 in the cloud my stovic a rebound no startling on the floor for Syracuse right now theyve gone to five reserves wonder where will the scoring come from for this group lean score Off the Bench Bell at N9 and a half thecloud over Luben to strong and the gets it back my storic little flip is in my storic has to be utilized more in some way I mean even just put him in action because he does good things like sets hard screens rolls has his head up talks like all those little things help everybody Davis three and hes missed his first three good box out there by movage too I just think the Zone sucked the Rhythm out of the game for Carolina they havent been able to press it there you go inside my stor again Carlos with the find that its a onepoint game but but you got M stovic involved in screening action and he made the right play by slipping and getting an Easy Pass just get him involved in the action good things happen into l m Cloud was late off the ball screen and a stuff for ven Allen Luben who has for the first time they were really able to get that defense extended out Syracuse I keep when I can on a ma basket I keep in that zone to just slow the game down Carlos sloted by Powell Trimble sees Jackson down the floor the explosive freshman is fouled by C set things up and and you run good action right heres just a little screening action he slips it hes open for a long time Carlos has to get to the left side to be able to make that pass good Roll by Luben as well look ball screens are the hardest thing to cover once teams opponents Im talking about figure out how to counter whatever youre doing problem is not a lot of offensive players know how to counter ball screens meaning whatever you take away are you prepared to instinctly excuse me instinctually adjust and counter whatever the defense takes away with with a better action first free throw Miss for Jackson who had been really struggling the last seven 19 from three just s and a half Hubert Davis told us he had a lot of long talks with Ian this week a lot of film watching reminding him you are not just a scorer which youve been your whole life how can you impact the game in other ways can you get an assist can you get a steal a big box out hes done some of that today well he just impacted this Arena they get like a free ChickfilA for those two misses t r and Miss Davis squeezes in there for the tip in Davis they struggle to shoot Syracuse but they are a good rebounding team and they are staying in this game on the glass plus two four offensive rebounds Music overall the D back on the Flor a couple of early turnovers and there is his third that is the 18th time this year Elliot kados had three turnovers in one game hes also 18th in the country assists yes no no look look kind of both go hand in hand to some degree now part of that is They Dont Really respect him as a score thats why I say early in the contest if you can get to the basket and score make that defense respect you as a score so passing lanes open up well that was thrown away by Carlos his first turnover Carlos gets in there Trimble no and its Jackson again flying all over the court hes got seven I like how Carlos kind of show there but pulled the chair on him tremble just got to jump over mainly cuz its fun for us but he should be thinking about us when hes on the way up obviously matter Eddie L certainly thought we didnt we saw our fancy suit through foul away from the ball just the second and a half against Carolina Syracuse is not LED back and forth we go Adrian arre will at least be much happier with his teams defensive effort he was steaming Tuesday after that loss in Miami well get some of that reaction from Adrien ay when we come 69 team went 9 and6 under Roy Danforth and obviously most of those years this was a consistent 20 game winner as Chris Bell hits a three for Syracuse your two under Adrien Entre longtime assistant for Jim beheim how can this program get back to if not the full Glory Days back to being Contender of perennial tournament team I say time and stability I mean some times its also as simple as you catch lightning in the bottle you get the right guys a tree goes down for Jackson but I I think its time and stability its not like the program was great when he took over like they were they almost had to reinvent themselves a bit yet how do you really do that with all the instability in college basketball Davis SL it last Touch by Withers on the floor itll be Syracuse ball and and some Geniuses out there would say its money right a check but does that stabilize you going forward or does it give you a good year does it give you a couple extra years as a coach say if youre going to put money into the program you have to have a longterm plan tough stuff by Washington Carolinas fifth block Syracuse unless they go a crazy run in Charlotte Wood be four straight years without oppos season longest drout since 67 to 72 Withers found space and Jaylen Withers has his first B I think that the other point to that is you want to find identity silly foul you want to find identity but its really hard to do that when you really cant build teams or programs the way you used to right with freshmen who become sophomores sophomores who become Juniors Juniors who become seniors it it just doesnt work that way anymore so to find consistency you got to get I love what Duke did dont get me wrong good luck finding that model but you got good incoming freshman yet you get the right Juniors and seniors to maximize their potential and Syracuse maybe wasnt thought of as a quote unquote developmental program in the way that say like a modern day Virginia was but they really were often under Jim baham You have players that would come in L in the zone for a year or two some notable transfers West Johnson about 15 years years ago sat out a year took Syracuse to a one seat I mean they have so many great developmental success stories and obviously were not the first to say this when people asked uh its just not that model anymore like it or hate it that is not the model in college basketball its a different world its a totally different Applause world six to play first half winers same spot and rattles it out Washington what just got in there and scoop tipped it in you know good for Carolina on that possession is one of the better offensive possessions theyve had against the Zone where the ball really moved around the perimeter it got back in little ball fake pass fake throw the thing inside they got a good look and bit of a prayer on the tap end cup from Carlos Syracuse has not attempted a free throw in the game just one made three six turnovers cup for three no good and a strong rebound by Withers its hard for Syracuse to get to the basket off the bouns with one through four switching for Carolina times one through five just hard to be able to turn the corner Powell in the withers again out for Davis yet to score chases down his own Miss oh there were a lot of hands up on the Syracuse bench as RJ Davis was following the flight of his Miss Adrien Audrey takes a timeout and were back at 37 to Syracuse Music Applause Music Music North Carolina has opened up its largest lead nine straight points for the tar Hills heres the last bucket yeah and you look at the Zone look the zone is not about like hey Im covered my area no there needs to be urgency particularly when a shot goes up Chris Bell you know is he leaking out is he expected someone else to get the basketball I mean there has to be urgency particularly in the Zone because youre not on a man youre just in a space and if youre not locked in engaged physically with somebody else then you got to go find that body let alone go get the ball I always make fun of pickle and coaches who will say things like grab the ball right like you hear that from some youre like yeah of course I know well that was a case where grab the ball makes sense JJ Starling back on the floor with two fouls he had been out since the 11 40 Mark Bell goes to the bench Syracuse breaks the pressure Taylor will score it first basket for Lucas Taylor I still like the Press I dont care that they gave up a basket what they get his pace and they push it right back up the floor and youre playing against the man which youve had more success against Davis gets a Washington screen rolls it back to him Jackson big step back there and another three Ian Jackson exploding in this first half with 13 hes just really special with his ability to create his own and the more space he has the more dangerous he is a 122 Carolina run theyve gotten hot after a lot of good looks didnt go early Lam on a hand off for Starlet he has yet to score Syracuses leading score on the year here sets up Davis his three is rebounded by RJ Davis good recognition from Withers trying to take the charge Washington again so what about hes been wanting that for the last 10 minutes one for 12 on the year trying to hit two and a half Starling just kin himself into danger and hell shoot the first Syracuse free throws of the game okay theres a term in basketball we like to say Get it while youre hot right I mean Ian Jackson yeah we know that Washington thinks hes hot too need the big man he and Jacksons been done good though oh what kind of Madness is going to be upon us in Charlotte we just know that there will be Madness and Hubert Daviss team probably going to need a couple of wins there to get into the NCAA tournament right now just hoping to get to 15 and 11 here in Syracuse I think thats why both coaches talk about you know finding that consistency building upon that finding continuity so you can put together a nice run because the game of basketballs fluid and the fluidity of the game kind of affords for the hot team to win a lot of games see that in the Nate tournament see in the the conference tournaments NC State prime example they just got hot at the right time they played with great confidence a Fearless conviction and then you become really dangerous were going to have the easiest broadcast opens ever that day one the AC tournament why does this game matter one of these teams can go to the F for youre right there you go theres your hook yep Starling will take a seat with the two fouls he gets his first points of the game theres something to it as well because youre also hard to scout if youve kind of been boo boo biscuits for most of the year then all of a sudden youre youre really good what team are you scouting boo biscuits I was trying to sounds delicious DAV step back three and finally RJ Davis gets it three to go his first half an0 for four start hes really struggled from three this year and the struggle started early because it was just a different Rhythm right the the position hes playing the role hes playing is different so the shots he gets feel differently ni scage off his own Miss play him 40 minutes I just I just think he contributes in a lot of ways that lie underneath the surface been a little more above the surface scoring today six points averaging two seven on the year trple two hand tap off his o miss trible a good job just getting it up on the rib knowing that hes got to Advantage rebounding that thing Carolina by 11 heels of not frail Carlos asovic cleans it up Taylor shot ready a three three Lucas Kor just Syracuse is second of the half and the lead back to eight for Applause UNC Davis gets around the Washington screen they had Trimble in the corner a little bit of a late catch Withers from the other Corner North Carolina 6 for 12 from three and A2 Carolinas going to hit shots its going to be a Music tough just a tough stretch here for Syracuse got an interesting lineup on the floor youve got to run good action if this is going to be the lineup you go with Carolina just 271st in the country in threepoint percentage one of the reasons theyve had such an inconsistent season but they have been getting great looks in this first half the challenge is you got a small lineup but at times with Kad on the floor you have one guy that you dont respect from three so you lose the space required to capitalize on having a smaller lineup its kind of like your your advantage really became your disadvantage at that Applause point has missed a lot of this half because of two fouls because of early turnovers Jacksons been terrific lampon takes it all the way and one Eddie Lampton with a chance at points 78 and number nine coming up at the line kind of attacked with good body control right it was almost like the two three years body control where you think someones going to step in to take a charge look howy kind of guides himself he does just doesnt go full bore he probably could have just attacked with no inhibitions Washington the foul L threepoint play by the way not a terrible foul there not sure how much he got in sure slight slight displacement of that Applause Dan thank you welcome to Central New York where North Carolina leads Syracuse by 8 minutes ago in the first half that lead down to five with the orang starting to get hot from three Lucas Taylor hits his second if youre just joining us you miss a great shooting start by North Carolina a team that struggled to shoot the three this year they are 6 for 13 and Ian Jackson a freshman leading the away with 13 points heres Jackson again give him 16 and is four three and a half thats where you break down and discipline you dont stay on the hip of a shooter on that Baseline Runner you go over the top and you get beat and it kind of nullifies the good offensive possessions youve had if youre Syracuse Ian Jackson backto back games of no made field goals six for eight in this first half after a lot of conversation and meetings with his head coach this week and of the shot clock a three for lamp that is deflected to tremble Carolina will get fouled here Syracuse has a few to give but Hubert Davis does have a timeout so that can allow him to set up the final play coming up the Jeep halftime report many you just saw one versus two the first one versus two meeting ever in the CC Auburn beating Alabama in a game that absolutely lived up to the hike and the game of the century for two putting 106 past Stanford game summary tonight we mentioned Jackson Starling who averages 186 a game hampered by early foul trouble for those just joining John what else are you taken away from this first 20 minutes or so I think theres a lot of positives for both teams to be honest I mean cleaning things up for Syracuse maybe doing a better job of applying that zone which was really disruptive in terms of the Rhythm you talked about how Caroline has gotten good looks most of those looks have come against man their action has been much better I will also point out that some of these good looks are coming with Elliot kadoo off the floor I think they have better spacing see Jacksons just a spectacular talent and if Washingtons going to step out and knock down threes look out but a lot of this just comes down the playmaking ability the shot making ability of guys like Ian Jackson getting RJ Davis going good but the key is having good action and good spacing when you have it you make a higher percentage of your shots Syracuse still has fouls to give and Taylor reaches in to give one on Davis first on Taylor fifth on Syracuse not bad for Syracuse that JJ Starling those fouls came early and its it look even if hes playing in the game hes not the same guy when you have two fouls hes not the same guy on defense cuz he cant touch anybody hes not the same aggressive guy on offense because he has to be careful of charges its just its not the same player when you got fouls Jackson final shot at a half oh thats not indicative of the way the rest of his half went four for six from three Ian Jackson to break these first couple of minutes youre talking about Syracuse right now I was barely listening uh look you youve got to be aggressive getting back into this game and thats certainly how you do it but the key is getting your defense set you know thats what coach was talking about we talking right before the game said weve got to get our defense set we got to see the basketball a great way to get your defense set is to make a couple baskets Adrian arrey said to us time and again weve been in the fight all season long he wants them to stay in the fight down to the ACC tournament they give up an easy basket there though to Luben the problem for for Syracuse is that Carolinas been good on scripted plays right those are usually the things that are easiest to cover you force a team into a counter by taking away the obvious Carlos on the floor to start the half for Syracuse and place of Elijah Moore Davis was the Miss RJ Davis had five in that first half for UNC one for five from three Tar Hill 7even for 15 from three Withers as open as you can be hits his second hes got eight I actually thought he took Rhythm out of the shot by waiting right usually the the footwork into the shot creates a rhythm and you stop its hard to make that three you still got to to go Starling penetrating Davis hot C into the lane Starling just create so much attention if he can get to a point where hes a threat multiple Defenders come that way he makes the right decision get an easy basket how can they get a stop tble they cannot nice easy thing there Starling didnt want to pick up his third yes that thats exactly what it is and I think for tremble the best thing he did there was recognize that hes got the advantage because hes going against somebody that doesnt want to pick up a third foul J ging Starling now Low by him got hit up high by lopin no no call despite the contact it is Syracuse ball with to shoot did you want to call there I thought he got hit around the neck youre so sensitive some of us just like the game to be played you know a little contacts okay we got freedom of movement Im more about like freedom of contact Im all about freedom of movement I got a bumper s that says freedom you cant see it in the snow on the back of the car Davis with a three for Syracuse there for it kind of stayed in there with some late threepoint shooting in the first half Lucas Taylor hit a couple hes got eight he pulled the Archer out at one point hit two in a row Withers and jayen Withers is tied a season high with 11 just a few minutes into this second half thats important because its another spacer on the floor if hes making threes you got Kad on the floor where you lose a little your spacing and hes not really respected from three Withers can space the floor make three look out season High third three Starling no lampin the ACC leader offensive rebounds throws it out to Taylor back into lampin double teams around it good for Eddie lampin he really worked in that possession got the ball back out and ultimately got right back into a position where he held it seal got the ball back and finish 109 Carolina in the first 3 minutes of the half and free throws coming for Kad threepoint shooting Carolina right now 9 17 if my stats are being updated theyre getting good looks and I think thats the challenge if youre Syracuse youre getting open looks but heres the seal I told you get the ball back out being assertive about getting that post position again thats where Carolina if the ball gets back out you got to have the presence of mind not to allow him to get another seal kind you get a little Lazy by not really keeping your urgency up understanding what what can hurt you the most and look this has been one of the worst threepoint shooting teams in Carolina history and if youre an optimist you say youre D for nights like this with all the talent on the team you sound like my mother when Bryce Harper was like one for 12 hes do do hes always do Bryce Harper this is probably not on paper though not the 271st best threepoint shooting team in the country Lin has it knocked away well its its interesting because you have individuals that can make shots but a team that just cant create and sustain a rhythm to make a high percentage so what is it about the created sustained Rhythm weve had tonight I think a lot of that came with kadoo on the bench oh Withers just fell asleep there you had better spacing the defense was faing more thats why I say kdo if hes going to be on the floor hes got to be thats going to be a foul right on Q hes third hes got to be able to get to the basket and finish if he doesnt finish they never really respect him enough to get open looks right they dont have to fully help so theyre staying home it doesnt force a long close out his third foul displaces him from the game with Luben Jackson the big score and Washington he had a very good first half too Off the Bench for UNC see what you did there with the whole displaces thing thank you pretty you must have gone to school here oh I dont think so I think I would pick up that kind of education here please such a h hin a fouled before the shot called by Rod Gro its Washington second I like where lamin got the ball there because you werent going to double at that elbow area and he made the right decision to just attack and theyre not theyre only going to double when he gets closer to the basket here you just set the high ball screen gets it on the short roll and then just has the room to make a make a play I like it made a few plays off the dribble tonight lady Lampkin by stovich Carlos opening the corner gets it late sees Starling late catch no shot there Starling stepped out of bounds was good action though I dont know jrey over there saying hes being pushed he Pro hes probably right its funny how we did the freedom of movement thing and we went crazy about came no touching basketball and weve kind of forgotten about hand checking again hand checking whats that Withers Carolinas first Miss of the half after a four for four Applause start Syracuse has not LED in this game hovern around this score most the game game down 5 to8 lampin will get two when we come back so North Carolina trying to move up on the bubble theyre going to need a really hot finish to the season to make the tournament well look at the league around them when we come Music back joelan s bracket and the NCAA early seed reveal Clemson and Louisville projected seven seeds Clemson El leite8 team a year ago Louisville maybe the best turnaround of the country and then heres the group on the bubble Wake Forest and SMU playing right now on acc Network a 3434 game pit and North Carolina and look realistically well talk to Joel andard a little bit later Carolina probably has to go six and one in the last seven to have a realistic at llarge chance theyre just one and 10 in Quad one were saying theres a chance on paper theyve got a good chance to go six and one or 52 but theyve had trouble finding consistency John along way yeah that that look that I think thats been the issue for a lot of teams in college basketball but its something Hubert Davis talked a lot about where hes like we we just need to do the little things consistently well and then build upon that because they have the talent to win at a high level see that since the Advent of the Quad system 5 years ago 12 teams have been an atlarge selection with 10 or more quad one losses Illinois had the worst record two years ago they were 2 and 11 in Quad one and M Carolinas 1 and 10 Duke will certainly be a quad one game but they got crushed by Duke a couple of weeks ago they really need SMU to win tonight that was a home win for Carolina this year and then they probably have to pick off a couple of neutral sight games in Charlotte so it can be done you can go 3 and 11 3 and 12 and make it with a tough enough strength to schedule and Carolinas nonconference TR schedule ranked eightth but you do need a couple more of those High Caliber wins I Im kind of selective with the like okay see you got a lot of quad One games but you didnt win any of them like I want to know who you can beat not just who you can be beaten by or youre willing to play at the same time there are teams out there that like this team in Carolina the more they play together the more theyre going to find each other the more theyre going to find themselves the more were going to see an actual identity its a different look for this team no Armando Bott no big right smaller you have to be committed to being small you have to be able to create space when youre small you got to make it your advantage L kick taken away by Jackson instead of rimrocker after the c three at the other end a year from now I Jackson takes that away cuz he anticipates Jackson 16 in the first half and hell go to the line here in a second the late whistle Adrien ay is incensed I think one of the better things weve done in college basketball outside of fix the whole block charge which is thank god um weve weve rewarded the wall up and Eddie Lampkin is the guy who just got the foul call but I felt like he walled up pretty well if you as a driver make contact with somebody like lampin who went straight up I dont care what your body does after hitting that wall right its let me see Maybe Im Wrong maybe hes leaning a little bit I would agree with the um the point Im trying to make just not maybe not in that situation fair enough fair enough and that was only one angle so were not sure but I it wasnt obvious it wasnt cut and dry Im just saying I think the wall Ups been a good thing we have more plays at The Rim Davis fires away one for six now from three here goes Starling F and he he really just does not go to that left hand on the left side of the lane leaves the righthanded layup short you will get two Jackson second are you one of those guys where like hey youre going to your left so you got to learn how to finish with your left hand theres a point where you just stop using your left hand like there is you can do it cuz youve practicing it its got a second nature but I can tell you most of the time when I went to the left I would go up use the body to protect the basketball and still finish with the right unless it was like a big koreem Skyhook which was rare for me well the other part of it you see theres tape on the right thumb but he fractured the left hand in practice earlier this year missed seven games so how comfortable is he right now clearly not cuz he shoots a lot of righthanded layups from that side and thats part of the story of Syracuses season Big Stretch without Starling and they may without Donnie Freeman whos done for the season with a lower leg injury freshman who was averaging 13 and a half eight rebounds and his 14 starts and that points back to struggles to find consistency and then eventually find continuity with the group on the floor the group is different week to week I think people realize how fragile winning is every time I talk to a coach and mention that I think they all agree like wow yes some of the best teams in the country will tell you like winning is fragile one for two at the line for Starling Syracuse back in that zone Bell on the floor to play one of the Wings we were thinking about the Syracuse Texas game in Brooklyn early Syracuse right there in the closing minutes Atri hun said we win that game you just dont know you dont know what it does to the confidence level of this group well then do you win Texas Tech and then what do you build upon like youre a different team at that point and the funny thing is when you really start to build on that you start to think how different would the ACC look and feel if thats the case if if there are more quad win wins one wins available I mean its a Fickle game hey look no Syracuse fan wants to hear that they say win games Win Lose results thats it but its the reality of how quickly things not saying this would have been a tournament team but just how a game or two changes the Outlook of your group Starling with a jumper and heres Syracuse starting to find its Outlook in the second half within five points was good stuff offensive I mean good action they really lifted the defense got him wide comes off the screen hits a midrange jumper its good stuff trimbo couldnt finish lamp in there for the rebound one possession game on a make Starling no I like it you know what that shot was better than for anybody who thinks that was a bad shot turn better than a turnover yes get a good shot Applause early Applause Washington Carolina having trouble probing here Davis passes up a deep three tries to create space Jackson Washington pushes it up to Davis and thats the second time he has bounced in a three off every other part of the rim I mean just a killer when you understand again we talk about winnings fragile lets just go back to the last possession JJ Starling makes that three now its a one possession game they come down Second Chance opportunity RJ Davis touches every bit of the rim and it goes down I mean its just the way it is there fragile moments where Syracuse has struggled this year theres a foul on the shot attempt by movich get a pump up from Edie lampin I mean second chance opportunities you keep it alive youre in the zone so rebounding is different you got to adjust to itj gets that one back well call it soft touch Shooters touch touch every bit of the rim whatever it just goes in good stuff interior passing for Syracuse I was surprised I thought they smacked the glass a little hard I thought they would call basket interference of some sort foul was Washington third and nben will replace him McLoud comes on for lampin hes huge can we just say not like the first time Ive seen him but like hes just a fallen completely out of rotation until the last four games hes played 10 minutes a game and theyve been very valuable minutes whos a starter last year till he got hurt tallest player in Syracuse basketball history qualifies as a giant I think so sevenpoint game under 12 to go Zone again for Syracuse and Movic blocks the shot right to Luben Carolina gets Another Second Chance can Davis deliver with it feeds Withers too late on the pass and a Carolina turnover good defense by McLoud hes had active hands in that zone I actually like the Zone with McLoud on the floor Starling got it starting to feel it 10 for JJ hes able to attack matchups and get to that midrange and I just think thats where his game is a lot of Syracuse offensive players like that through the years Jackson that kadan Withers back on the floor for Carolina Applause into Withers the clouds all over its Kad awkward shot down to McLoud and once again Syracuse can make this a one possession game McLoud in the middle almost allows you to man up he just covers so much ground staring very high off the window and more free throws coming feel like Old School Syracuse here at Zone disruptive with a big guy in the middle and Syracuse can getting this down to three its a game Carolina absolutely positively has to win shelard will have more on that when we come back its Joey brackets time of the year midFebruary Jolan Arne is with us first reveal of the top 16 seeds in the NCAA tournament today at least the early seed list by the committee so Joe lets start ACC where is the state of the league with those four teams how close are they to getting some of those four bubble teams into the field Music Music back the line the for Two Shots yep Applause yeah Joe look you start doing the brackets pretty early in the season we all get the emails and I wanted to ask you at what point in the season do you start to see the postseason picture a little clearer and are we Applause there yep Applause Music yeah Applause right GJ Starling at the other end just plows into Withers and the paint makes the basket and Syracuse can tie this game at the line not sure if RS was inside the restricted Arc or not but I love the fact that we reward the offense and its not that crazy Block charge Kev Im so glad about that that another one youre probably glad too you dont to hear Joe before we let you go while we have Carolina here at 1 and 10 in Quad one do they realistically need to go six and one down the stretch in the regular season with that Duke game as part of that to have a shot to be an at large team right number his first number Joe we appreciate it I know well be hearing from you and seeing you a lot more over the next month so get some rest while you can my friend thanks Joe Joel lard ESPN bracketologist Carolina 1 and 10 this will be a quad three game so this is less about a resume enhancing win its more about a game you cannot really afford to lose they already have a quad three loss which was the home game to stand for yeah its like maybe not a Resume Builder but its a postseason Destroyer feels like that but this Syracuse team they found a little something I think a lot of it was the clouds coming off the floor now but he was really good in the middle of that zone and it just sucked the life and the Rhythm out of the offense for Carolina who yeah you look at the threepoint shooting that they have really found it right now 1124 from three but the Rhythm was different over the last few minutes when Syracuse climbed back into it here we go now one shot guys pedy lampin was riding the exercise bike over there back in for McLoud Davis snapped an 80 run best free throw shooter North Carolina history thats two Applause more 6260 Carolina has not Trail like the lineup on the floor for Syracuse its a good offensive lineup now you got to capitalize on extension they did it that was Lin and my starage set it up look its really set up by JJ in terrible spot yes for the offense but really you extend your defense that that far out you get one pass and youre beat 16 at seven for big Eddie lamin six tie of the game still zero lead changes in the corner of Three its good for Jackson 20 on the board for the fabulous fresh from the Bronx go back to it though stovic the best thing he did was not make the pass to Eddie Lampton the best thing he did was making himself available as an outlet for JJ Starling those little things you talking about L for Applause Music Bell D trying to get it to lamp they better into the shot clock he missed everything but he was fouled Washington had the vice gript its his fourth foul with 8 and 1 half to go look we look at him we say hey great pass by my stovich yeah but really he got up he was an outlet opportunity look at he flashes to the basketball its the little things like I shouldnt get that excited about that but I am be the outlet allow JJ Starling to pick up the hockey assist and then a big response me and ACD has had a terrific night now the officials are going to review whether or not the shot clock expired what did you pick I I thought he got it off and if thats the case is just a silly silly foul like look if he makes an amazing play so be it first off take the Baseline away if the clocks ticking down do not allow the Baseline then the last thing you want to do is is just a little reachy grab at the end thats been a point of struggle for Carolina All Season we knew coming into the year they didnt have a team filled with big guys Washington and Luben have had trouble with interior defense and when I mean the whistle comes after but the the question is not necessarily when jaml spean raises the hand its when does he blow the whistle we we cant hear stand on the on the floor 13 of North Carolina will be charged a personal foul should say the ra f whist came I live in a world and you know me Im Im the guy who says Im not wrong but does mean Im right I live in a world of nuance and we should be able to officiate with a little degree of nuance too they should be able to go over to the the Monitor and say yeah hey look I called the foul after the the shot clock expired but the foul happened before and I should have called it sooner I like function in that world well while we have a minute tomorrow its pick the ball slam three The Duel in the desert from Vegas Stephie graph and Andre Agassi against jeie buard and Andy rodic right here on ESPN for Eastern no more football Sundays fill your Sundays with pickle ball Andy rodic neutralized by the underhand serve welcome to tennis for the rest of us tennis for the rest of us is a great marke ex its like yeah you gave it away for free hey if youve played pickle ball youve been beat up by a 75yearold with a Kickstart knee brace and you know exactly what Im talking about they work you I havent played pickle ball which is solely because I dont want to be beaten up by a 75yearold with a kickstar new seriously man theyll tell you about it too lamin just 58 of the line has got three for four tonight hit the front end of what was a one and one a non shooting foul he rolls in both another great game for ED lamin here they are I mean heres Syracuse showing that they can stay in games can can you keep it together I think this Zones been good its been disruptive Withers gets the roll in a new season height 13 for Jaylen Withers thats where its different right McLoud can Gap a little bit more with his length Lins got to be up on the ball which means that backside guys got to get back underneath to take away any eye low away from Starling by Powell withs on the switch starl Here Comes Jackson transition defense by Bell Powell inside Withers again Jaylen Withers with the best performance of his season his graduate season for North Carolina and he has come on late now a season High 15 with one more to go at the line when we return feel like Carolinas at their best when theyre on the attack right we always say things like the aggressor I would say the aggressor usually always wins aggressor always wins for Carolina when theyre the aggressor they are a dangerous basketball team both from the perimeter and inside flag D Cooper flag things as well Duke hangs 106 on Stanford how good must you be when the compliment is like coopa Flags just doing Cooper flag like if I ever played well I was probably compared to someone better which I thought then was a compliment we saw super flag do it here about a week and a half ago he was pretty neutralized offensively but still impacted the game in a lot of ways Withers again that is some finish by Jaylen Withers who has owned this second half the whole playing fast is really what makes them tough and and you got got to be committed to it we know the transition game for Carolina is huge but we talk about make your disadvantage your advantage well thats how you do it you attack against a defense that isnt set Lin wasnt set he was moving its going to be a foul and then a remarkable finish from Withers that wasnt easy man I know you could do that in I IM there but you know nothing Jaylen Withers double figures his first two games of the year that great game at Kansas thought maybe hed step up in a major way and then double figures just once in Carolinas last 23 none in the last 19 he has exploded tonight 19 overall and a 9point lead for UNC just moments ago this game was tight lamin continues to Beast hes got 20 hes too shy of a career high as is a Wither its just one shy of a career high beg you pardon Withers has been playing multiple positions though I actually feel that that they go actually feel for it more I think its hard to find consistency when youre asked to do a lot as a four five when really youre more like a three you know guys that have to play out of position in some sense of the way or play a different role that maybe isnt maximizing your skill set its hard to find consistency Carolinas made this push without go or Trimble on the floor oh theres something to that Howell Jackson Withers Reuben and Davis the five lampin again long pass and Adrian arrey just cant believe it he was saying no before he threw it and thats how coaches understand the Tendencies of their own players and in that situation like lets just get a good one a post repost is a great option Adrian arrey needs a timeout cool down the steam coming out of his eyes 7366 Music Carolina said time and again the margin FR a for Carolina very slim uh a game they need to win and they have look really good offensively with Jackson stepping up after a cold stretch and J Withers in his 144th career game just one shy of a career height and I just I I think theres better spacing in movement when RJ Davis has the ball in his hands this lineup right here may be the most dangerous Carolina lineup they can put together tremble and Kau tremendous potential but in terms of winning basketball this groups done it what that travel is what it wasth Carolina turnover youre welcome no rhetorical questions on todays broadcast kadoo three fouls and three assists but uh four turnovers Trimble just two for eight shooting in the game so those two have been on the sideline Trimble for about two and a half minutes could do much longer than that Starling Syracuse run the offense through lampin hes double teamed and he is fouled its the ninth on UNC so another one andone opportunity coming I like the double on the bounce but you almost have to anticipated so we really cant turn I thought that one was good but just stay in your ground force a tough pass out quite often the tough pass out of a good trap is stolen and those are the pick sixes that you look for and thats a big foul thats the fourth on Withers did you just see what he did with his eyes did he just Go full Undertaker with his eyes pleas SC tell me someone else saw that Eddie The Undertaker just go Undertaker see if he does it again Im Im pretty sure Im look its cool but Im a little creeped out I may have nightmares sorry sometimes it just turns into a stream of Consciousness I didnt go to school for this Kevin I dont think we needed to inform the audience to that thank you fivepoint game lamkins tied a career highight 22 kadoo is back out there Withers sits with the four fouls the defense by lampin show it high taking RJ Davis away and then getting back hes working hard and he had limped off the floor after the under eight he knocked knees with Withers now he steps up to guard Kad trying to bend it in K will shoot it instead and pull off the bench delivers if if hes going to on the floor hes got to be a willing scorer meing you got to seek it out the more you seek it out the the easier the passes are going to be for assists Carlos mvic Starling and an offensive foul against mvic negates that possession that might be my least favorite thing in college basketball right now aside from a lot of other things that just arent recent is theres so many calls on screens like the handoff screen you should be allowed to hand the ball off and make make a little bit of contact I get the butt screen right the hip check the the roll and take a guy out we want to clean that up but you should be able to make a little contact on a handoff otherwise as a Defender you know what I do I run into guys and get the call ends up as the 16 foul so Carolinas in the bonus Jackson trying to penetrate The Zone again like where theyre putting K though playmaking position in the middle of the Zone he bounces to Davis R and is third three part of the issue against the zone is kdo theyre flattening out right its making it harder to move the basketball they close passing Lanes by flattening because theyre not worried about kadoo shooting you put him in the middle hes a playmaker from that position Carolinas just tied a season High 13 made threes L fighting for his own Miss couldnt get it onehanded chance to really pull away here now for the heels really working you got to give him credit he hes been fighting riding the bike when hes not in the game limped off doesnt matter he hes really competing 22 and8 in 30 minutes Jackson inside Carlos driver finds Powell and a rebound High pointed by Applause Taylor nice job by that was smart and the basket will count wa a continuation for Carlos who collects Kido fourth foul in the process that was a smart play I mean got to put your head down get your shoulder into a Defender thats not set and then the presence of Clemson theyre a really good but sneaky good team less quiet after last Saturday certainly they beat Duke but and they beat Carolina on Monday which was tied for the largest win in Clemson history over UNC go back to 1977 for that Im thinking more so in terms of a quality team that could win games in the post and part of that has been like the The Superficial knock on the ACC I I get it but thats a good basketball team so Louisville Louisvilles a good team threepoint play for Carlos lead is seven Carolina has not trailed in the game theyve hit six of their last eight Davis Kos on the floor with four fouls Washington Withers on the bench with four and that is a really silly foul against Carlos its going to send Jackson to the line for a one and one its a silly foul but its the foul that a really dangerous offensive player is able to get right hes just so dangerous with the ball that you want to disrupt you want to make him uncomfortable you get up into him try to make it tough to handle the ball he just I Gs going to take another beat here 75 free throw shooter surprised they dont sell like the Jackson wig at the the bookstore have you been to the Carolina bookstore if one was for sale Id know about it he thinks Youve Got Friends in all sorts of places Jackson again scoreless Saturday against pit did not score until fre throws in the final 92 seconds Monday so great return to form for him with 20 one and one gets the first I just want to see if Eddie lamp goes back to the free throw line here the lers the last seven for Jackson Five threes ties the season high and this is the second its an eightpoint game with three and a half to play Syracuse has not made a sub in the last 4 minutes Starling boy what a tough shot that is thats I mean thats a remarkable play overall and a good job by Eddie lampin not not rolling too hard he he actually allowed for the space for Starling to make that play Withers is back in there four to go three to play Davis sets is an opening missed it and pows there on the spot couldnt finish rebound Starling S dods one Starling cut off Carlos will call JJ back to the ball hes got 17 just shy of his average of 186 would be third in the ACC with enough games to qualify Starling long steps and pow gets that out of here Jackson all the way lays it in 23 foran Jackson thats a big shift Starling had lampin on the roll just missed it Taylor they tried to hand it off to Lin Lu stepped in the way and then l knocked it out on the way its North Carolina ball we talk about the fragility of winning right I mean heres a great opportunity if you can get that ball to lampin hes there on the roll it goes the other way a layup for Jackson and then another Music turnover 10 turnovers for Syracuse minus two in this game they are minus 50 turnovers in ACC play 30 second timeout well see if Carolina can close this out 220 to go back in 30 seconds foruse number3 Davis Music 8173 North Carolina Ian Jackson 23 for shy of a season High Jaylen Withers a season High 19 Eddie lampin has been awesome but Carolina which has struggled to shoot all year long has gone crazy from Deep 13 of 28 from three tonight and Jaylen Withers again no double figure games in the last 19 as come to life a little more free flowing on the offensive end and hes a guy whos really its not about the position you play its about the role you have to play and the truth is in a fluid game like basketball Your Role itself becomes fluid so you have to adjust to each game and I think that kind of what kind of what points to some of the inconsistency weve seen from Carolina the roles have been different so the consistency hasnt been there hes been terrific tonight needless to say I think he likes the role hes playing this evening he likes his opponent too its his fourth career double figure game against Syracuse couple of those at Louisville where he started he was an ACC all rookie selection four years ago youre full of nuggets thank you I think Syracuse going to put some pressure on a deflection by my storeage Carolinas got to get it across here with possession its a Rugby scrum theyve got the arrow they barely got it across half court in time always wonder there are teams that like they have to put the Press on late to maximize possessions down the stretch and pick the pace of the game up and they look great like Syracuse looked great in that press you wonder is it that they should do that more often or is it because Carolina hadnt seen it at all and they didnt really prepare for that so they struggle against it heres a troubling sign JJ Starling just holding the back of his right leg moving Applause gingerly hes had to he hes really worked on both sides he has not had a lot of easy shots all season and hes still scoring nearly 19 a game Jackson turbo charged to the r just miss it deep didnt know his own strength Carlos Withers gos it right to an onrushing star down and scores just twisting himself into a pretzel the body control in some of his fin finishes has been remarkable I mean fun to watch and he is working and Withers I mean as great as hes been foul troubles been the problem theyre I thought they were trying to foul Withers he picks up his fifth on that one minute 45 is still a lot of time right now the pressure is picking up I guess I it look like they were trying to foul Withers did really early to start fouling but it worked out and Withers does foul out of the game so one shy of the career high still a fabulous game but he exits with a minute 45 to go he had 19 and now Starling has 20 hes 8 for eight at the line tonight no Cloud no lampin theyre putting the pressure on they got two timeouts Davis to Powell Carolina struggling mightily but now its a nearly a two onone good play by Jackson he could have thrown the law but smart play he almost eist it across the timeline but Carolina can reset and then Adrien ay might blow a top as movich is called for a foul at Mid court and he fouled the wrong guy too yeah I was going to say I mean you dont want to put RJ Davis on the free throw line you did your job up until that point sometimes you just go out there casually and a great player like RJ Davis knows how to work the foul well Davis with a one and one best free throw shooter by percentage Carolina history hes not going to leave them in scoring which he has done in seven straight it doesnt appear hes got 14 tonight but six assists one turnover playing more with the ball in his hand that was going to be the key thats what Im saying like this this team when hes got the ball in his hands I just feel like they create a better Rhythm they were able to do that tonight A surprising Miss its a two possession game if those possessions are worth three Starling out couldnt finish but hell go back to the line where he has lived and Trimble whos barely played in the half picks up his second its hard to contest tough shots while not fouling right its a bad angle shot you almost have to train yourself to just contest the shot dont stop the shot thats not a high percentage look from Starling and if he makes it so be it but but the last thing he want to do is foul 18 of his 20 in the second half Starling 9 for9 at the line tonight hes been good I mean a lot has been asked of him do a lot with the basketball bring defense away you know hes getting double team out top of the ball screen hes able to pass out of it theyre scoring hes made tough shot after tough shot couple circus shots in a career that has been set back by injuries time and again shoulder and knee injuries started at Notre aame fractured hand here hes been doing a little slowly down the stretch but he is just an awesome shot maker with the game on the line and hes got 22 fourpoint game and Powell throws it into Kad quick trap comes and a foul I think Adrien a wanted that a very quick whistle one and one for kdo who is only a 68 free throw shooter he he didnt want that maybe little something said grab on the shoulder I mean thats like a thats like when you on somebodys shoulder and go the other direction I I just as tough and physical and contested as this game is who knows maybe its a ball on lie situation that was called on Taylor his second one so this is the last one and one in the game oh wow it was a ball dont lie situation brilliant foul Adrian arrey great strategy Starling slashing no got it back and got it back from Carlos trimbles all over one minute to play Starling determined to get the shot off and a foul against Carolina lampin was fouled whos this side its Washington its his fif wow so two Carolina players have been disqualified and Eddie lampin will shoot two its just what the the attack from Syracuse makes you really difficult to cover youre not going to help off and give up an open three darling she just working his way there yeah its just look at lampin hes going one on the whole Carolina team basically here hes going to go Undertaker on youre from the free throw line boy and Syracuse which is not a great free throw Pro shooting team has got 19 of 21 theyve really worked and this is where you do feel for teams that are struggling to win games like they still practice they still care a lot of their identity is rooted in their rooted in their ability to win games right and theyve been there theyve been close and they fought their way into this one Jackson back for Trimble lamin one of the best free throw shooting nights of his life hes eight for nine but look its been the whole game he is working his tail off man absolutely both offense and defense and now the crowds few seconds left theyre into it now Kad 15 to shoot spins around Carlos a big basket for Elliot Kad two possession game again Carlos swings it Kyle C barely played in the game bricks a three and Syracuse has to foul now this will be the guy to foul you cant I mean they fou the absolute wrong guy in Davis great situational awareness by North Carolina Adrien a cant believe it and Davis will go to the lineup four cadell I mean this might be play of the game and Carlos cannot get beat to the basket in that situation that thats the one thing youve got to wait kyp know your personnel that goes both ways offense and defense you got to know who youre covering you got to understand The Scouting Report the little things those little disciplines are what make you win or lose basketball games but a good play by kdo which is a VAR on what both coaches talk to us about today little skirts little bubbles of time that have taken their Seasons off course and Carolina hoping theres still a chance to get it back on here and a lot to play Fortin bubbles Kevin so one more for RJ Applause Davis now its a sixpoint game and Hubert Davis will use his third Applause timeout all right quickly lets go to Kevin Conors back the studio Kev thank you to the most polished most notable Kevin on our college basketball coverage today Mr Connors nicer Kevin thats right proud itha bomber so look Carolina Syracuse down years obviously but two of the seven winnings programs in division 1 history they havent had a ton of nights like this but forget the records this has been a really fun game maybe not if youre a fan of these teams and youre having uh some palpitations but very entertaining to watch great offense great Rhythm specifically for UNC and can hang on a lot to feel good about I think first and foremost you got to look are both teams fighting are they competing and thats what you ask for the most there are games out there that Ive watched where it didnt look like Carolina truly competed and there are games out there where it didnt look like Sarah use competed both teams are competing tonight thats really all you can ask for and now Syracuse only hit four threes thats some point theyre going to need one well see if this is the point Sterling will drive it try to draw the foul miss badly lampin got to be at three now Carlos around and out and its Syracuse ball with 124 to shoot probably not enough time to get two here Carlos will inbound it with bell Taylor Starling and then lampin whos only attempted five threes on the year need lampin as an outlet there I mean lampin right its a two but its still a two possession game now you have 96 to go but by the time you pass the ball out you start moving around that the games pretty much over you got to take the shot at that point he was just an outlet and a screener so heres what were talking about for UNC can they go six and one yeah in the final seven these are the percentage chance scoring ESPN to win the remaining games NC State in Virginia theyll be big home favorites in those two and in Miami theyll be a favorite at Virginia Tech Florida State little bit of a tighter game and then Duke at the end now look they almost lost NC State earlier in the year they almost lost to BC and Georgia Tech atol so they they havent steamrolled everybody but its a more favorable schedule after what has been just a 25 game Gauntlet including the nonc conf I think when you break them down though you start to see the framework for how they can win right I think thats ultimately what you look for as as a coaching staff its not just oh what do we need to do to win well no no no what who are we and and how does that team win basketball games consistently I think youre seeing that here I think RJ Davis with the ball in his hands is its imperative Tribble Carolina has a timeout got it into Powell and hes a 63 free throw shooter so thats the right person for Syracuse to foul statistically The Freshman 19 for 30 on the year its darlings third foul F can just about put it away at the line back to it he talked in the open about we dont just win with Talent anymore its about building a team its its roster formation all these things we talk about its finding consistency and then building upon that to the point where you have continuity there are a lot of talented dudes on both teams thats why we say winning so fragile its not just about Talent OR ability friendly finish for Powell all right lamin was coming in for Taylor then Taylor came back to the court then he double back to the sideline so put the big man in there to rebound Syracuse is going to have to score lightning quick and a great job by Powell who hits both so now it has to be a three Carlos stovic taking too much time and times going to run out and its a two North Carolina wins it a game they never trailed Syracuse tied it a couple of times a great fight Ian Jackson was awesome early and North Carolina wins it 88882 they had to have it they got it on a really entertaining Saturday
