they were going to be no surprise that the Virginia Cavaliers have gotten better and they went through a stress between December 17th and January 3rd where they lost three out of five games but now theyre healthy once again Tony Bennett likes his chances every time his team touched the floor Jim behem of course in the Hall of Fame Tonys plaque is soon to be carved and ready to be hung one day two great coaches and we are underway as the orange win the opening tip they come in 139 65 in the conference Virginia rolling it 163 and a quick theft by Franklin and a block out of the sky the return shot wont go by Jayden Gardner but a quick start here defensively which you expect from the Cavaliers you absolutely do an Armon Franklin doing a great job just getting into Chris Bells airspace stripping the basketball away and Arman Franklin of course we know hes been playing so much better offensively but hes been better defensively as well which is the Florida Tony been in opportunity to keep him on the floor and theyre one of the great defensive teams in the country a quick substitution here for bayheim is hes going to get Justin Taylor in the game by the way Benny Williams the 69 sophomore is not here he is not only on the lineup he is not on the bench and Jim Boeheim will address that situation after the game from what Im told right now Justin Taylor getting minutes into the game fell a little Last todays go early and Jim behind with a short leash for any plays as such Taylor is a Charlottesville native right into the paint Edwards on the spin and a traveling violation so Syracuse with the turnover you give a look at the lineup now brought to you by Kay Jewelers Kihei Clark really playing well you talked about Franklin Rhys Beekman is he 100 hes about 90 right now not 100 but playing very good basketball as of late Bennett vanderplas in the starting lineup starting his fifth straight game for Virginia and they are different with him in the starting lineup and Applause could really stick that three as a team to make 39 shot clock is down to nine Gardner kicks it out and stolen away Taylor with the pick in transition lost the handle on it but was knocked out of bounds by Virginia a new starting lineup now for Syracuse brought to you by Kay Jewelers we talked about Malik Brown a little bit hes into the lineup as a starter for the second straight time by Jim Boeheim started him in their last game even though they lost that game at Virginia Tech he gave him some early life and you mentioned Justin Taylor from Charlottesville Malik Brown and other freshmen right up the road in Culpepper Virginia so some Virginia flavor for the orange Taylor tosses that one to the back court just threw it away so itll go back over to Virginia Cavaliers are coming off that victory over Boston College they have lost to number five Houston by two on the road to a good Miami team and by three at Pittsburgh its a great story in the conference they absolutely are Jeff Capel running neck and neck with Brad Brownell for ACC coach of the year as Jade Gardner sticks that Baseline jumper that midrange hes dangerous from there gotta account for him against the zone so Virginias three losses are by a combined 13 points they have jumped up one spot in the national rankings this week up to number six Applause on the penetration got it Airborne for two he has a variety of ways to score he absolutely does and two defense had 18 points in the game January 7th against Virginia he has some success offensively and that was a close game he and Joe Gerard did their thing they didnt get much help up front Applause Franklin yeah running the point feels like hes been around forever Franklin sticks it nice start here at the Cavs and thats why Tony Bennett loves Kihei Clark in the middle of that zone really would you see a five foot ten guy in the middle of the Zone but hes such a great playmaker and of course always finding his guys on the perimeter Applause and its looking for room to operate nobody downstairs he wanted Edwards Edwards coming off a game where hes played by foul trouble the foul speed doesnt get there and Clark comes up with it Obi with Syracuse his struggle turnovers have been the thing that have done them in often already starting out this game with three early turnovers against the stingy Virginia Defense Applause they move the ball so effectively really one of the great passing teams in the country and thats on the money by vanderplas thats one of their areas where Virginias had so much success first Syracuse in this zone is their ability to shoot the three had a school record 18 threepoint field goals made in this building back in 2019 that year Virginia also won a national championship timeout 16 43 to go first half virgin Bennett vanderpas makes this Virginia starting lineup different because hes able to space the floor you see Reese Beekman attacking the paint we know Reese Beekman is a great passer but when youve got guys that can knock down threes it makes great passers great assist men one reason why Reese beekmans won the top of the ACC and one of the reasons why Virginia is so much more dangerous as a blade such an unselfish team these Cavaliers they lead the ACC and assist per game dumping it downstairs and a nice drive there on the Baseline Malik Brown The Freshman got his first career start over the weekend 11 points and six rebounds against the Hokies Hobie we wear practice yesterday Jim behind told Jesse Edwards we want them to double team you you will create opportunities for your teammates if you accept that double team handle the basketball and get it out of there trip there and a foul it was 1612 to go in the half thatll go against the league round his first Virginia got as high as number two in the National poll in early December theyve always played well here under Tony Bennett five and two alltime in the dome they absolutely have and Tony Bennett of course Virginia winning eight of their last nine matchups first Syracuse and this is a robbery Obi people may not recognize it they say robbery as Jayden Garden knocks down the midrange jumper that goes way back into the 80s these two teams met up a couple of times in the NCAA tournament but in 2016 Syracuse knocked Virginia out of the lead eight advantage to the final four which made this a rivalry in All Eyes of Virginia fans indeed Im expecting about twenty thousand here at the Dome tonight yes its snowing a little bit theres Gerard and his first two Joe averaging 17 a game 14 points in the first meeting against Virginia on January 7th which the Cavaliers took 7366 if Im not mistaken didnt you go to school here Jane Gardner another midrange jumper along that Baseline did you just called this no a little bit I mean its just a tiny bit by the way you went to Virginia where I think it snowed twice in all the years you were there maybe nice feed underneath by Edwards he finds the open man he gets Brown for the Dutch and Edwards doing a great job accepting the double teams staying strong when he has the basketball in his hands and delivering it the problem for Syracuse right now is they cant stop Virginia on the this end of the floor we came to the Dome today for the shooter rounds and Andreas said man its cold outside you said this is like a spring day in Syracuse New York if you were exactly right Ive hung out here quite a bit you know Dre shes from Atlanta shes from the south shes got the thin blood shes got to stick around up here a little while long I dont think thats going to happen get back to Atlanta where its probably about 65 tonight the drive Vince with a spin and another pretty shot and hell roll it and Syracuse can have success against Virginia as long as theyre not turning the basketball over shooting a very good percentage on the field when they get shots at The Rim on the D that ones tapped away Brown getting very active really on both ends of the floor and when you talk about being better from the field Syracuse five for five from the field when theyre getting shots theyre having success starting to hit him and theyve closed the Gap to four Drayas word play coming up when we return Kristen for those at home that dont know our producer Kim Belton spent time in the NBA but before that he graduated from Stanford University and he teaches us things all the time what we learned today was the word Cerberus and what does that mean it is a threeheaded monster youll see that for Virginia starting with Rhys Beekman who finishes big on the inside Kihei Clark is such a veteran it is said that he roomed with Corey Alexander at Virginia back in the day great basketball IQ and then Armond Franklin a true three and D kind of player defends at a high level leads the team in threepoint field goals this group of three guys a true Cerberus if you didnt know now you know wow wow rolling out thats usually a Kim Belton Stanford word right there yeah that was in the thesaurus when Kihei and I were living on the lawn together we would check that out every now and then hes going to say lights out at nine between you guys every night good soldiers out of the corner Gerard cant cash in first missed shot for Syracuse but the offensive rebound Jesse Edwards with the energy on the skin this team the second chance Applause whether its lost him its going to be kicked out of bounds by Virginia earlier 611 senior we saw Jesse Edwards accepting the double team Virginia going to go after when he gets the basketball on his hands but a great job accepting and keeping his eyes up toward the rim finding Malik Brown for the dump and once again Jim behind said we want them to double team youre going to get your teammates open shots if youre strong with the basketball when they come with the double team Virginias notorious for the double team of the folks once again quickly done to Brown hes up to a really nice start here tonight and theyre finding him they are Syracuse sharing the basketball passing extremely well outside of the turnovers they have operated very well in the offensive end of the floor the Jim boeheims team bouncing back nicely after digging themselves an early hole Isaac McNeely a freshman in for Tony Bennett Music heres Clark shot clock down to two and he turned it over on a travel 1412 Virginia our ACC SCC super Tuesday doubleheader coming your way seven oclock Eastern Duke hosting wake at Cameron Indoor then its Kentucky taking on Ole Miss both games are on ESPN and the app big game in Durham tomorrow Wake Forest beat the Blue Devils in WinstonSalem Duke going to try to return the favor tomorrow but Tyree Appleby playing great basketball for wakeboard shuttered nice save there ah the Baseline clock outside thought about a long one son driving flipped it up as he draws the foul as he is hit by Jesse Edwards take a look at those standings now Clemson at 101 in my mind even though theyre up to 20 now in the fold theyre still not getting enough love nationally maybe even inside a conference it is Virginia at 82 I agree when you consider the fact that Clemson over the past couple of weeks has won two out of three games without their starting point guard Chase Hunter out of the mix of course Alex Hemingway ran against still not back with the team so what Brad Brown now has been able to do with not even a full roster has been spectacular we talked about Tyree Appleby Connor Tyson playing firstteam all ACC basketball and possibly in that ACC player of the unit once again the Pete Peterson Events Center Pittsburgh is becoming a hot ticket as it was for so many years because Pitt is a dangerous team the Oakland Zoo is rocking give Jeff Capel and his crew a lot of credit for what theyve been able to do thus far this season especially in ACC play midrange knocked away here comes Gerard on the attack Syracuse guard out of Glens Falls New York mid slamming on the brakes two more for him smart play by two to miss knowing hes going up against a very intelligent Defender does not try to go through the body goes around them use this size to score over top against the Freshman had a strong individual game at Virginia Tech 21 points and eight assists but a defeat for Su and have been having a very difficult time picking up quality wins Owen four in Quad one so thats going to be a dunk right along the Baseline thats one of the things that Virginia will look for with Shedrick in the game that they dont have that opportunity with Vander Falls Caden said it one of the better athletes youll find in the front Court in ACC ra as well Applause she derived from 17 rebound picked up by Brown really playing well gets another one this time a triple foreign game here in the dome another slam and once again its Shedrick beating everybody to the ramp but its a different dimension when you think about Virginia and of course youve got to you know applaud the intelligence of Kihei Clark he wasnt even looking for that when Van de plas was on the back line Applause thats here and Edward slapped away Syracuse will keep it done got a hand on it a play heating up here attacking the basket going to the midrange finding his way to shoot over the top and speaking of over the top Kihei Clark decades Cedric works so nice they had to do it twice 65 so three very close losses nice wins over number five Baylor and top 20 Illinois schedule but you know combined 13 points in those defeats for Tony Bennett yeah and we talked with Tony Bennett about that earlier about that stretch and really after the Miami game he challenged his team before they went home for the holiday break and pretty much told these guys hey you have to be different when you come back and one of those guys thats been different as Arman Franklin Andrea you talk with Armand a little bit about that earlier what did he tell you about that time frame for him yeah Corey he said that coach Bennetts words really hit home with him and when he went home for Christmas break he spent the days with his family and he spent the nights in the gym with his trainer he said he got up extra shots spent a lot of time in the gym and then when he got back to Campus before practice after practice hes been in the gym with his coaches he really took that challenge to heart to be more of an offensive threat Corey and youve seen that absolutely and its paid off for him 168 points per game during the last nine games hes become Virginias leading scorer as he picks up the foul in that possession but it hasnt been all about his offense its been about his defense as well Tony Bennett trusts him much more on the floor defensively which allows him to stay on to get those offensive looks Franklin trying to slow down shoot immense easier said than done he forces a lot of fouls about five and a half a game Taylor got a great look and he buried the three and thats a big bucket for a number of reasons Justin Taylor Whos great friends with Tony Bennetts son Eli and these two guys went to high school together Justin absolutely considered coming to Virginia but he said he fell in love with this place another one Sky High pass this time by McNeely and out it goes looking for another alleyoop Virginias had a couple here early Applause its looking for Girard to make a cut freshman to another freshman scooped up by Taylor six to get off the shot nice fate he earned that basket he absolutely did his hustle play coming up with the loose basketball gave him an opportunity to go get a bucket Justin Taylor playing with a lot of confidence hes got a 25point game on the season hes not shy offensively 100 plus back in over the last couple of minutes Applause at five on the shot clock that are flying away come right to mince Syracuse is pretty much dominated all day long by Virginia Tech thats not happening today and thatll spin in where Jude immense and thatll put Syracuse on top for the first time tonight and thatll get the crowd alive in the building McNeely with a triple Applause Edwards back for minutes into the paint he likes that shot on the Run now the youngster legitimitz leading the way for Jim boeheims team and a 90 run to find some room in that zone cant get it done Vince looking to beat everybody flips it up there cant make the shot and Virginia has numbers here Judy mints out of the play will they play quickly TA Clark riding up the three ball Hobie thats a big bucket and because of Judah Metz running so hard falling out of bounds Virginia had a five on four coming back it was difficult for Miss to get back into play Kia Clark able to stop the bleeding but right now the orange have momentum on their side tied at 26 Edwards going in strong with that right hand but that bounces away Applause and a timeout was 6 37 to go and this one not enough 2626 number six Virginia and Syracuse oh this game is about Youth and experience Virginia has the experience Syracuse has the youth but you see the split between the Freshman seniors Syracuse getting production from both here tonight Tim but hes the only upperclassman with a basket with a point because its been 21 points from three orange freshman that have gotten them to the 26 Point tie with Virginia right now due to mess with 10 of those points he has been spectacular early and he continues to grow and get better under the Tulips of Jim behan as this season has gone along and as a playmaker maybe not as natural way to go its not and this is the first time you know we talk with you didnt practice yesterday this is the first time hes played the point guard position four times in high school he was never the point guard and hes learning on the fly but giving an opportunity to be able to you know learn on the Fly and Dre youre a point guard your entire life how difficult you think this is for a guy like Judah to be able to do this midseason I think its very difficult to switch that mindset you know thats something that Joe Gerard actually went through he was a dynamic scorer in high school and he had to learn to be the point guard when he got to Syracuse so it is definitely a process but you know Corey Judah Mintz has been ACC freshman of the week three times Kyle filipowski of Duke seven times do you think Judah Miss can make a push for him I think he can make a push for it but that push is going to have to happen with the orange making a push to become a tournament team its going to be a lot of success necessary for that to happen as we see another first year thats what they call it Virginia to use freshman thats right but Isaac McNeely stepping up knocking down the three balls I know who came up with that idea too oh a gentleman by the name of Thomas Jefferson pounded his way inside got a great look and it kicks out its going to go the other way itll be Virginia basketball Obi one of the things youve noticed as of late Virginia no longer double teaming Jesse Edwards Syracuse and Jesse Edwards handled the Trap so well Tony Bennett adjusting now allowing Bennett vanderpost to guard him oneonone this is the time where Edwards has to take advantage of that matchup ideally giving it up the Freshman has played well here and the opening half hes hit some shots Applause a little bit around here for Franklin in and out were talking to Tony Bennett about shooting in the dome and I said you know you guys have shot well here in the past thats over the top for Edwards made a nice catch bottled up though in the double team and I said you ever talk to your guys about how to do it in the dome anything special about it he said Ive never said a single word about shooting here and of course theyve shot well here so he probably never will I think youre right with five on the shot clock bench off the back iron so 426 remaining in the half its Virginia by three theyre trying to win their seventh consecutive game and back to Beekman Applause turn and shot by Gardner he was hot early Bruce Bell getting ready to check back in for bayheim Taylor lost it went down lost it again Virginias sharing the basketball moving the Rock and making Syracuse work on the defensive end of the floor you watch it one we speed it up two three four five six seven eight passes for the Isaac McNeely three a great possession for The Who halftime report is on the way coming up well look ahead to the second game of our double header a top 11 matchup plus Impressions from an impressive weekend in the big 12s house Syracuse gotten back in this well theyve gotten back into it by not turning the basketball over they had four turnovers early Virginia had seven off of those good friend of mine told me the teams sometimes the game just takes time to just settle in and they certainly said a guy I like it now Virginias getting a bigger body in the middle of that zone so can see over Kia Clark in there he cant see over the defense Brad Applause he could see over it and score it I like that adjustment back to Obi and Corey in the Dole our NBA Wednesday doubleheader starts in Boston Jason Tatum and the Celtics hosting Kyrie and the Nets at 7 30 and Trey young leading the Hawks against Chris Paul and the Suns coverage NBA Countdown at seven Virginia has been a program that has put multiple players in the NBA as of late and of course when you think NBA and you think Syracuse youve got to look at my little brother I call them little CA even though hes the big CA Carmelo Anthony topper 75 of all time and can still play somebody needs to bring him in ASAP man it changed everything on this campus when he was here for Jim Boeheim and of course won the National Championship in 2003 thats going to be a traveling violation Virginia still by three both teams have all of a sudden shut it down offensively of course we go to practice here you go to the Carmelo k Anthony Center which has been a tremendous contribution to this basketball program its a very nice check from as you say little CA and gonna go the other way Syracuse benefits on the turnover side maritoris coming in making a difference early Jim behan is happy with the Way Torrance has played especially as of late really giving them much more of a defensive presence but also trust him with the basketball on his hand running the point when Jude immense four Joe Gerard goes to Savannah Lawrence a Syracuse native in his own right Edwards nice Spin and one thats what has to happen if youre Jesse Edwards and now Virginia decides theyre not going to come with the postwrap youve got to be able to win that matchup Edwards who struggles often with this back to the basket but when he faces up and can see everything going on with the floor now he has a different dimension to be able to get to his spot to score over the top of smaller Defenders and applies that man to foul him and a threepoint play for the 611 senior from Amsterdam Applause tied at 29 under three foreign if this comes down to the last shot tonight not at all Syracuse in this building a much better team and they are up for the challenge Against The Who Applause Speakman up in there is something there a great play to get it into Gardner Syracuse faithful Jim behind included wanting a walk on that possession Gardner solved the accs best shot blocker and Edwards coming over three as fairness Jim behind had to look on his face at five oclock 217 to go in the half so your Syracuse Alum you can say that I I cant talk about my guy like that thats a classic but you see the kick go to Jayden Gardner who finds the spot under the basket but checking where Jesse Edwards is he does dribble that basketball which I think alleviates the travel Jim behind wouldnt agree with that Jim in year 47 no coach in the country has been at their current School longer than Jim and I am leading the charge Im trying to make behind 50 happen he will not he will not agree play along with it we wont right now right but that doesnt mean its not going to happen how about that Virginia with assists on all 11 of its made field goals in this game that is sharing the sugar as my man dob would say a good shot clock inside town going right at it again and lays it in and so far too much for remember plows to handle but Tony Bennett is going to have a decision to make will they bring the post wrap will Syracuse is shown theyre ready for or is he going to play Kate and Shedrick to defend Jesse efforts because right now Ive been a band across struggling to defend Syracuse big man Applause thank God Clark to the Lane yes thats a pretty move that is ka kind of snuck that one by Jesse Edwards Im not sure Jesse was expecting the shot to go up so quickly by the way came in number two alltime in the ACC in minutes played and if he plays every second of the first half he becomes number one Torrance over the top Ben Edwards with the Ducks 33 all that is the loudest the building has been yet he could check his feet shot clock to 10 Gardner founder Club back out heres mark on the move again is Beekman from the corner right in front of the shot clock talking with associate head coach Adrian Autry earlier today he said Virginia is the most poised team under five seconds on the shot clock that you will ever see its a great point and they showed it once again on that possession so patient absolutely right down to the nub on the shot clock so Syracuse getting up the last shot they hope Torrance will lay it in this time here for Virginia to get off a bit of a heave Franklin way downtown and thats it and a very entertaining first half here inside the Dome with Virginia leading Syracuse 3635 but the momentum is on the side of the orange happy with the way they played here in this first half especially on the offensive end of the floor lets go to Dre with coach Bennett coach 26 points in the paint for Syracuse how do you limit that in the second half yeah we did not do a good job they scored inside they got games here where Virginia and Syracuse has scored 36 points for an entire game theyre right there at halftime here today theyve found something offensively that works so second half underway Virginia with a basketball coming in with a sixgame win streak Clark hunts it down in the corner its going to be off Gardner and back over to Syracuse Syracuse started the game with a possession on the a turnover their first possession Chris Bell checked out after that has not been back in Justin Taylor has been on the floor for the orange now Virginia starts the second half with a first possession turnover Judy Mintz with 10 points to lead the way for the orange Taylor gave up the dribble shot clock to eight back to Taylor its not a good idea to leave him wide open like that but he cant hit him down low about Applause underneath Applause Franklin Clark to drive us slapped out by Taylor on the Block so Virginia from the Baseline to check it out Applause producing dire need of a big win this would certainly qualify as their biggest of the season and OB Syracuse is running out of opportunities to get quad run wins this is a great opportunity for them on their home floor boy thats a tough shot up and in by Reese Beekman part of the Tony Bennett Wisconsin Applause so its Virginia by three thats right with a bounce Edwards beating in the paint and a foul in the play as Malik Brown got hit that personal foul will go against Armon Franklin number two on Franklin lets go to Gray thanks Dave well Coach Boeheim had two main points for Syracuse at halftime on offense keep going to and through Jesse Edwards he said make Virginia defend them and then on defense he felt good about their defense but he said get out a step further and a step quicker against Virginia hes got to make them more uncomfortable thats right hes going to the practice yesterday and Coach Mayhem of course was very involved in The Scouting Report and making sure guys were in their proper places recognizing how dangerous Virginia is offensively this season thats going to be a tie up on the play and with the possession arrow itll go the other end of the floor Tony Bennett his 14th year at Virginia won a national championship hes been a three final fours might this group wind up in Houston and another final four they have the offense to do it not sure if they have the defense to do it which is rare to ever say about Virginia but offensively when they won a national championship that was the highest scoring team under Tony Bennett ERA this team is right on their heels over 70 points per game offense is not a problem for The Who box with the feed Gardner Airborne got it 10 hell be at the line looking for a threepoint Play Taylor fouled him guy was showing the wherewithal to get it to drop and one of the reasons why offense is not a problem for the hoos is because they have not one but two great Playmakers on this team Kihei Clark putting the pass on the dime to Jade Gardner who scored over 2 000 points in his career he knows how to get a bucket Virginia offensively has all the necessary pieces to make a strong run in March theres many outstanding point guards in the country and a Kihei Clark you got a guy who has learned the art of the bounce pass hes among the very best anywhere at the bound speed picks off the rebound and a second effort here for the orange Applause Taylor trying to get it back into Edwards maybe youre overdoing that directive on the run and laid in on the Dipsy do by Franklin and a timeout with 1706 to go and Virginia threatening to open it up a little bit here in the early moments of the second half of 4235 rich and thats a name from the past you dont hear very often but if you talk to Tony Bennett thats one of the guys he idolized growing up turned out to be a great Pro absolutely did Gail gubridge AKA Stumpy Stumpy Stumpy that was the nickname that he used to go by in his Heyday and Kihei Clark you know a smaller guard similar to Tony Bennett and Tony Bennett of course looked up to a lot of guys his size and lefties that he could emulate heres the record that he is achieved tonight and its played in the ACC he is number one now 510 grad out of Woodland Hills California who for so long was 59 but he got tired of Stumpy so they gave him 510 shot clock at 10 top for Taylor Collision and an offensive foul so thatll go against Edwards and he is slow to rise file number two uh Jesse right now Syracuse coming out of the locker room pretty choppy here in the second half Virginias intensity defensively has picked up in the second half making things a little more difficult for the orange Im sure a heated conversation by Tony Bennett to his team in the halftime locker room making sure they identify what their true identity is on the defensive end of the floor that just came free out of the hands of Clark just flung it up in the air a rare turnover he averages about two a game amazing Kihei Clark and we speak the number one number two in the ACC and assist turnover ratio Beekman number one Kihei number two two shorthand to play makers but that turnover leads to two points off the turnover for Malik Brown continues to have a really strong night Baseline Gardner going up strong and hell draw the foul as he took the hit thatll be on Justin Taylor who look at that assist to turnover ratio number one in the country and when youve got two guys who are you know that good at it when you think about Reese speak mckier Park Reese Beekman is number one to ACC with 31 to one assisted turnover Kihei Clark slacking behind him at 30 to one sister turnover so these two guys very shorthanded with the basketball and Tony Bennett extremely comfortable with the basketball on either of their hands Chris Bell replacing Justin Taylor a freshman for a freshman for Jim behind team points for Gardner got most of those in about the first 10 minutes of the game and then it slowed down but he puts him on top 4437 do not want to fall behind Virginia by very much because its straight uphill to get back in it if you do Gerard gets the shot Joe Girard at about six feet tall plays much bigger than his size you know has the ability to be able to create space and shoot over top a smaller Defender oh what a pass underneath there by Clark vanderplas easily finishes that we talked to Tony Bennett pregame asked him hey what is it about you that makes you put a five foot nine guy in the middle of the zone you normally see a six eight guy in the middle there he just raved about kieses playmaking ability and hes putting it on display here today pull up pop by mids got it sad hit as well hell take the foul on the Baseline such a variety of shots that Vince can make and we come back out as well ought to be a champion absolutely congratulations to the orange on a soccer championship I was wondering previously did they actually play in the Dome play football in the dome of course you have enough space to be able to play soccer but a dedicated soccer stadium here Outdoors yes here on campus thats right over by manly Field House 4642 Virginia I got here another grab cant finish it though almost rolled three away from this but he collects that missed opportunity for Virginia there theyve done a great job really throwing over the top and finishing throughout this entire game a stop on this end of the floor now maybe give Syracuse some life Chris Bell is barely played in the game swishes in a triple to cut it to one hes made 39 beyond that threepoint line he can really shoot he can absolutely shoot the basketball Jim behind loves that about him his ability to be able to stretch the floor Gardner again Scoops it back up nowhere to go out to Beekman here comes another long run and Syracuse with an opportunity to retake the lead Applause Vince with a follow away blocked by Beekman right back to him Edwards again ferments shot clock down to five and that one just tossed away and got it back Bell now its free again the shot clock expired Virginia came up with it 1343 to go nice very small thing but by Chris Bell hustling to get to that basketball on the floor Virginia gets the shot clock violation but what Virginia does not get is a breakaway easy layup points off of that turnover so the effort and the hustle play barbell possibly saving his team two points so the Cavaliers clinging to a onepoint advantage Applause frankly catches fires big rebound by Edwards and comes in ripping down 10 per game and they played 24 minutes in their loss to Virginia Tech over the weekend because of foul trouble Applause Syracuse working around the perimeter now downstairs its Edwards banging rebound popped up Edwards won it back Bell the launch and hes fouled and the act of taking a long one as he took the shove in the action of attempting a threepointer Kate Cedric trying to get out of course we talked about his shot blocking ability trying to get out and defend a threepoint shooter but whenever youre lunging at the shooter difficult to control your body and not pick up that foul now Francisco Caporal with the foul and what a college basketball lineup we have for you Saturday on ESPN in the app Kansas and Iowa State tip it off and Ames at noon Eastern followed by Auburn and Tennessee number one Purdue Indiana then North Carolina and Duke squaring off at Cameron Indoor followed by Florida and Kentucky Gonzaga and St Marys caps the night at 10 30 Eastern what a lineup foreign on a 90 run Reed takes the lead 4846 maybe Lee working on Gerard eight to shoot Beekman and a plus hes going to fire that pass away out of bounds it goes back over to Syracuse but this isnt a lineup thats been a lot of time on the floor together for Virginia vanderplas was passing the basketball but Shedrick thinking hes shooting it turns to try to get position for offensive rebound results in a turnover Music Applause Jesse Edwards is a much better basketball player when hes turning to face up in comparison to trying to back someone down you see he has the ability to put the ball on the floor make it play and then the ball fake getting the shot Blocker in the air going through the contact finishing and now an opportunity to give the orange a fivepoint lead at the freethrow arms guy parole will come out for the longest time Franciscos name was being pronounced kafaro Applause Shedrick there with the foul so at the line Edwards and drops it in so threepoint play to make it 5146 and its a 12nothing run Ryan Dunn getting in havent seen much of him is Clark down for Beekman Clark thought about the three hes going to lock one he cant drill it rebounds gonna be tipped up and down big bucket Bob Bennett vanderplas coming in from the top of the key picking up the offensive board in the second chance points to stop the bleeding for Virginia but right now Syracuse confident on the offensive in the floor when Jesse Edwards gets the basketball shove there as Edwards is knocked just about out of bounds Applause and look at the leading scorers he ating up to 22 points a game coming off maybe his best game ever yeah another Sonic Blockbuster involving Purdue another Sonic Blockbuster and Zach Edie Who was the leader right now for National player of the year who has been spectacular all season long Purdue is probably the best team Ive seen live this year Bell cant hit great job there along the Baseline to keep that one alive Malik Brown as he gets drilled Virginia so Obi you talk about the game within the Game Malik Brown from Culpepper Virginia was not offered by Virginia because Virginia already had a commitment from Ryan Dunn games like this mean a little more to guys like a Malik Brown picked up the foul but Syracuse cant connect Jim behinds team up by three valderpost way downtown Bell with another rebound Chris Bell is giving bayham a nice lift here in the second half well he got the message he was subbed out in the first minute of the first half didnt play anymore in the first half Justin Taylor got all the minutes so Bell knew when he got his opportunities to get back in the game he better take advantage of it just like Judah Mintz takes advantage of getting a step picks up the first one number one so itll be mince at the line with his 74 percent to the line a lot he went to the line 13 times against Virginia Tech over the weekend aggressive guard Judah Mitch understands how to attack the rim how to get downhill and has the athleticism necessary to finish once he gets there Gardner back on here for Tony Bennett done returns as well and you look at this Virginia lineup done at 67 Gardner 67 this is a much smaller lineup Jesse Edwards can find his way against this Virginia team when he gets the basketball on his hands look for Tony Bennett to bring the traps Syracuse but Jim Beam is going to make sure Jesse Edwards gets his hands on the basketball to be a playmaker for the orange on the Baseline great defense by Syracuse Edwards the premier shot blocker Ryan Dunn didnt get the memo right there Jesse Edwards leads the ACC and blocked shots right make sure you give him a pump fake black way downtown round and out when it comes to Gerard under 10 to go into Dome Applause let the shot clock go down to seven Gerard around the back working on Kihei Clark and sinking they get it back mints and throws it away many turnovers in this game its been pretty darn clean but you see right on that possession Syracuse wants to get the ball into the hands of Jesse Edwards Virginia doing a great job fronting not giving him a look as Syracuse really passing the basketball around the perimeter got a little too passive on that possession but still one two Dimension Joe Gerard to be aggressive offensively while trying to get the basketball to the hands of Evans Jordan son for Gerard and Virginia with it you missed nine of their last ten not that time though Ryan Dunn out of the sky athleticism on that back line Virginia showed it with Kaden Cedric and now theyre showing it off with Ryan Dunn a freshman from Freeport New York Syracuse for a timeout this was a Dandy it absolutely was when you think about Kihei Clark he understands how to find his guys Ryan Dunn going way Above the Rim for the bucket always a game within the game you see Judah mens able to score up and over Kihei Clark but then against the length of Reese Beekman same shot on the opposite side he gets it blocked because Reese Speakman matches him in height length and athleticism and what you dont see is after that Judah mints drives to the basket and gets into the body of Reese Beekman instead so making adjustments as you go for the Freshman hes learning Corey absolutely and when youre going up against against a guy like Reese Beekman who in my opinion a year ago was the ACC defensive player of the year but another defense for that we talked about the size Advantage for Jesse Edwards on the interior and Syracuse taking advantage of it at the first opportunity alleyoop City tonight it has been Lob City here in Syracuse knocked out by su Gardner leading the way for Virginia with 14 minutes leading the way for searches and 14 they just saluted Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hertz of the NFC Champs its in the dome here tonight on his way to the Super Bowl after crushing the 49ers 317 look at the movement done in tight no follows the miss another tip batted up by Edwards Syracuse up four bell wont wait you okay with that look if youre Syracuse Adrian Autry told us earlier today youve got to take every opportunity against Virginia Franklin with a misfire Gardner wins that battle and draws the foul he just tore that rebound away in the paint he absolutely did Jayden Gardner getting in the mix with Jesse Edwards just showing that Edwards may be taller but Gardner is absolutely stronger in that matchup ripping the basketball out of the hands of Jesse Edwards and getting to the freethrow line Edwards with his third so keep an eye on that with eight minutes to go and Gardner missed everything another one coming but the fans will ride him Syracuse might have the biggest student section in the world and you see career free throws the active division one leader Jane Gardner gets there often Im not sure hes ever shot an air ball though that is new Ive never seen that from him bounces back knocks down the second one hes fortunate the students are on the other end in this half yeah Im surprised that that happens you should have the opposing team facing the students in the second half right Clark tried to tip and out it goes with 753 to play in this contest Syracuse on top 53 weve got a timeout bayheim not delighted right now but he kind of likes the score against the number 16 in the country a little stuff dob in his athletic form I dont know what that towel is for on my shoulder right it certainly didnt work up with sled I know tariko did yeah that was our that was our new house game our waer radio station here is World Famous of course turned out a lot of great great talents Mike tariko right at the top of that list but Sean McDonough Dave Hash a guy Doug sermon in the mix Bob Costas of course a legend heres Franklin on target with threepoint layouts and he really has not been able to get going in this game part of the design of the orange to take Franklin out of the mix not giving him good looks but now the timeout is able to knock down a big tied at 54 Andrews Cross Court Taylor Applause threw it away shot clock at eight defense back to the big out of the double down to three now to the Baseline Taylors got to get it in the air he did beat the clock now Virginia to run McNeely over the top for John and a whistle there on the Baseline and a foul another go against Mintz Virginia look for a spectacular dunk beehive disgusted with the call shooting pounding in a dome as Virginia will have possession Applause 50 to go Applause foreign Applause operating under 10 seconds on the shot clock business as usual Gardner kicks McKinley no want it back Gardner just short lets tip thatll stay down here Cavaliers relentless on the glass Applause still tied at 54 and looking ahead some upcoming games for Syracuse in Virginia on acc Network Saturday next Tuesday Cavaliers and NC State is Gerard on The Lucy lays it and cant hit the shots a big strap for that rebound and a foul with 605 to go and the crowd unhappy with whats transpiring however on that possession Joe Gerard is challenged by a 59 Kihei Court theres no foul there should not have been a call they dont like the fact that Samir Torrance gets the foul on this possession but Joe Gerard has to finish that off important possession and its not as though hes going up against Katie Cedric thats Kia Clark at five nine trying to block his shot that should have been two points for the orange foreign coming in nothing but net by Franklin as he knocks down to three huge response Armand Franklin knocking down two threepointers here as of late and hes been the Difference Maker for Virginia here in this second half Edwards and draws the foul going up against Shedrick and thatll put Edwards to the line with Virginia up by three but there was a threepoint Syracuse lead becomes a Virginia threepoint lead with backtoback threepoint field goals by Armon Franklin and right now Tony Bennett having to make offensive defensive decisions does he keep Jayden Gardner on the floor who is going to help him offensively but may struggle defensively and on the other end before Kaden Cedric who doesnt help him much on the offensive end of the floor but can help the defensively pitch up the foul Radiance makes one of two minutes back in now for bayheim and a twopoint game with a sixgame win streak on the line hope delay by Metz The Freshman drives it and lays it in and were tied again quick movement here for Franklin too strong big rebound by Brown IE ground a freshman from Virginia hes really put a stamp on this one right now you want the basketball in the hands of Jesse Edwards see what Virginia is how theyre going to guard him doubled every time he touches it mids midrange as he gets hit fouled by Reese Beekman but Obi the difference as to why two Dimensions able to get a step on a great defender like Bruce Beekman is because Beekman has to close out to be able to take two Dimensions off the line you see the defensive adjustments the tails are the two halves between these two teams shooting percentages basically cut in half for both teams when you look at the way they start out in the first half compared to what the second half has looked like Applause Vince makes 74 at the line missed the pair 37 all back out for Clark downstairs a tough catch because drives flip set takes the foul will be on Edwards and thatll be number four on the 611 Jesse Edwards and Doug sermons right on top of it again not going to be a popular call here the fact that Jesse Edwards was standing straight up but the reality behind it is when you get into that restricted area if you dont jump as a Defender verticalitys out the window you have to leave the floor and then stay vertical in order to not be called if you stay on the ground thats an automatic call 24 percent foul shooter 5957 Virginia Applause has already won the first meeting between the two earlier in the month Applause the Cavaliers have only lost one game this season at home Applause Edwards again gonna get out of that double and draws another foul with 3 40 to go Syracuse getting the job done defensively two to miss turning defense into offense the finish and Syracuse right now loving what theyre seeing from the home team this last 36 entered it back in the day appreciate the love of course always my man Seth Greenberg back in the studios we get a look at our wooden watch the ACC guys on the list OB Wendys wouldnt watch with Armando Caleb love there philipowski Wong and Smith ACC players on the midseason top 25 here in Syracuse itll be Edwards at the line but Virginia leading by two Syracuse only eight for 15 now the foul line Edwards was three for four before this opportunity now four for six from the line one point game and Syracuse locked in defensively making it difficult Virginia in the second half to find good looks Cavaliers have turned it over 14 times which is five more than their average they came in with just nine per game number four in the country nothing new there Virginia only averaging 92 turnovers a game 14 turnovers for them ties the season High s big dribble going in hard cant cash in though second effort however Clark gets a long look and he drills a three so at the threeminute Mark its Virginia 62 Syracuse 58 interesting to see a better band Applause came in from out of bounds with that possession to get that offensive rebound if that bucket should have actually counted Virginia nine for 20 from three second Edwards and a travel as the shot went up bit of vanderbos takes it to the basket unable to finish it hes out of bounds and then comes back in without play being established and then picks it up Im no official but I know a lot of officials out there watching one of them please text me and let me know if that was legal theres some jump in wait for the bounce yeah touched it Clark deep in the back court as they trap him and a whistle in a Timeout yeah the timeout by Tony Bennett Virginia will have four seconds to get it across half court here we talked with Adrian Archer earlier about the pressure that they like to bring in the full court pressure when they trap Virginia we I mentioned earlier in the game where Virginia had an 18point lead in the elite eight versus Syracuse Syracuse goes to the full court pressure end up winning that game back in 2016 to go to the final four Jim behind the only use it sparingly but right here 236 remaining what the full court pressure out slowed down Virginia and now an opportunity to get a turnover here definitely taking some time off the Virginia shot clock and tip of the cap to Jalen hurt still here got a great game OB well he had a big one yesterday yesterday thats old news man hes got two weeks to try to get that shoulder right for the Super Bowl a very solid year 22 touchdown passes only six interceptions of course you know Im a Dallas Cowboys fan die hard I know that hurt but I do love Jalen hurts respect everything that he did at Alabama short time here oh thatll be Vince with a foul on the Baseline yeah two to miss bailing out Kihei Clark on that possession so 235 remaining thatll bring up a one and one and coming up Baylor and Texas stay right where you are big 12 matchup and two of the top teams in the conference Texas just went down to Tennessee and took one on the chin of course Virginia is one of the great defensive teams in the country I havent seen anybody better than Tennessee on that side yeah Rick Barnes of course playing in the Barnes Bowl in that game they lost at Texas last season so avenging that loss back on his home for now in Tennessee but of course Rick Barnes coaching both programs you and Dicky V hanging out in that game I tried to watch it they had the sound off in the Sky Club so I couldnt hear you but I did see you glad you were with us great environment there Thompson Bowling 6458 Virginia if only nine foul shots would have made Seven Edwards again just Gerard back in he cant hit races but a rebound Vince looking to penetrate scoot said and hits fast approaching two minutes to go and once again the full court pressure PJ clock trying to split it were going to say Justin Taylor touched it last and its not under not under two minutes so still cant go review that yet 208 Applause so Virginia to check it in still only two seconds to get it across half court and Reese Beekman is Tony Bennis going to call the timeout so time out of Virginia we take a look at that play Taylor looked like he swatted away and nobody else got to it before it went out so it looks like they got it right and that time out will buy Virginia a new 10 seconds so by taking the time out now they have more than the two seconds to get it across half court appreciate my God Doug sermons coming over allowing us to know and speaking of Doug Charles Doug sermons done a great job in this game the first time were really mentioning them and of course witness the first time youre mentioning the officials theyve done a great job throughout this one take our hats off to them for a stellar performance here thus far tonight yeah with two minutes to go a game such as this first half was outstanding and here we come right down to the end near the second half with Virginia leading 6460 Applause itll beat Cavalier basketball ERS take a new time is Clark to launch big fight for the rebound still loose and a foul against Virginia plus will pick up number five and Bennett band Applause really just trying to hustle after the basketball but zuda miss getting his hands on it and a smart play by Judah to take the fall gets the call an opportunity to put two points on the board without the clock moving its his second foul its his third event since the first and right now Syracuse moving back no longer up in the full court pressure a one possession game Jim behan can go back into the zone now down two and try to get a stop the traditional way but the focal pressure did his job 140 to go six to shoot turn around on the Baseline wont fall there for Gardner and Syracuse down two with The Rock enough time to try to get the basketball into the hand of Jesse Edwards allow him to be the playmaker play inside out Applause wants to shoot a big Collision offensive foul hell get Edwards gonna charge Applause and even more damaging that is the fifth foul on Jesse Edwards he picks up the offensive foul attacking the basket and he will be disqualified from the game 14 points for Edwards exactly one minute to play and they lose a big number 55 will accept it for Syracuse and here Hema 611 sophomore comes into the ball game hes been sitting all night but I love this right here Jim behind coaching up Jesse Edwards understand you have four fouls in that position youve gotten a double team move the basketball past the ball you have created an opportunity for your teammates with by having two guys having to come defend you under a minute Franklin averaging 13 a game really good beyond the three at 41 Clark hits 39 Gardner pull up pop Simpson big Gardner money there big buck with the Dayton Gardner hes been good all night but he was great on that possession boy mint steal he turned it over Applause 17 for a garden with six rebounds Gerard prevents 19 seconds to go that wont drop Gardner with the rebound and excellent position and a foul here against Syracuse and Malik Brown will stop the clock with 136 to go and its looking like another missed opportunity for the orange we rewind back six days they had North Carolina on this floor where Jim Boeheim and his staff feel like they gave a game away and they were unable to close it out and right here in this one as well made it a one possession game down two Applause and then tough shots turnovers down the stretch have hurt the orange been a recurring issue all season long trying to pick off an opponent like Virginia and gained a huge win unable to do it 6762 mins has to get one in the air cant hit it final seconds Virginia win it they can celebrate a win tonight here inside the Dome hard fought and they win it by a final score of 6762 great team find a way to win even when they dont play well Virginia is showing that theyre a great team by doing so here tonight sevengame winning streak now for the Cavs as we take a look at the Capital One rewarding performance Instagram
