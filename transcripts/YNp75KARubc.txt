that pit likes to run uh try to keep people out of the lane fourth time this season that the Fighting Irish will wear the green they are 1 and two in that uniform and the win was a game in December against Syracuse Pit and the white blue and gold the opening Applause tip Panthers are 16 and 10 on the season seven and eight in conference play shot clock is down to eight low in the paint tough twisting shot and low does have the size advantage against Marcus Burton and look for him to try to get in and use that to his Advantage but that was pretty good defensive standby at the Irish Davis on the cut Mohammad found him yeah and and Jeff capable was telling us that that he could be a matchup problem today for pit a strong body a great screen up top he was wide open Davis averages almost 16 points per game that is 12th in the ACC at 13 points five boards and the lost to SMU at home on Wednesday stop and start Leed pass deflected well theyre going to need theyre going to need to pick up a lot of scoring and uh leged picking up a silly foul that time and in the back court but uh with Braden sh Shrewsberry out for this game theyre going to have to find some other people to step up yeah Braden Shrewsbury third in the conference and threepoint SHO shooting has an abdominal strain suffered against SMU says he cant even lift the ball to shoot it Mike feels that discomfort in the Torso and so he is not available all he can do he told me before the game I can only rest right now well and that is a difficult injury for people out there to one get healthy and two to keep healthy so you really have to be careful with it Panthers have lost three in a row on the road in the ACC Cor turns and scores hes been up and down um hes been double figures twice single fingures twice in the last four games but a good start for him is a double digit score over 10 points per game for cam Corin the transfer from Florida State Burton into traffic at it Stripped Away low low on the drive around two defenders in the kick straight away leg it for three Diaz Graham tried to come over the top Burton comes out of The Fray with it and youll see low and leged connecting a lot during this game and and two two really unforced errors that time by Notre Dame in the last two possessions lets take a look at that Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by mello cam Corin Mike well and this is the thing in this game pit is going to have size at just about every possession uh so theyre going to try to get inside utilize that coming off the win on Tuesday at home against Syracuse 8069 for the Panthers Corin tried to come over the top of ji who got Applause it Jr kesn making his first start of the season with shury on the bench with the abdominal strain Burton nowhere to go cut off by the defending of leing Baseline maneuver Davis well so far he has really used his physicality in this game a couple of nice one that wide open drive but in that situation you cannot give up the Baseline theres just no help defensively trying to go inside to Diaz Graham deflect it away foul coming up heres the looking this is great just driv and Pitch but right here I mean You got to try and unless youre expecting help to come over which would looked like he was waiting for Austin but uh got to try and use that Baseline as another Defender sir Muhammad picked up that last foul for the Irish this is leot trying to put the shoulder down against Applause Davis foul is on Davis Junior from Indianapolis Indiana Music Applause Leed in the corner in a congested area and stolen by the Applause Irish Burton trying to go back door with ji had it poked away and the officials say that is pit basketball so its either been a Davis bucket or a turnover by the Irish up the floor offensively their fourth turnover yeah just uh in again the unfor wor error that time you want to try to have positive Music possessions Ron Gro Lamar Simpson Justin Porterfield our officials this afternoon Corin on the Baseline skillful yeah hes been great really good moves that time the little jump hook on the other Applause side so far its Corin against Davis and its 44 inside J hes going on a double fisted Rim Bender from Burton Ill tell you what and Marcus Burton You know despite the two points his last game he has been content here early on to get his teammates involved not been looking for his own shot but that a beautiful pass just two points against SMU on Wednesday for Burton he was one6 from the floor in 23 minutes of action for the leading score in the conference yeah how about that two point a twopoint game and hes still leading the conference and scoring leot misses that was a three attempts W and I think right as Notre Dame in the game plan would prefer to keep them on the perimeter if possible this is Burton forces up the shot and hits it did a nice job he got Leed on his hip that time kept him there was able to create some Applause space sophomore from Mishawaka Indiana Diaz Graham catch and release for three and its all net well hes a guy you got to respect at 32 uh just enough that youve got to keep an eye on Applause him foul was called on the play despite the turnovers for Notre Dame they are four four from the floor including the jam from chai and a onepoint game Irish and Panthers he Music is Applause all Music youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by All State youre in good hands I talk about good news bad news for Micah Shrewsberry I mean Notre Dame is four of four from the floor with four turnovers you know when theyve handled the ball and run their stuff theyve been perfect and theyve got the onepoint lead right now they do not want to see a situation that happened to them on Wednesday against SMU when they fell behind and Jeff cable told us the same thing Mike he seems like every time his team takes the floor in the first half they take a little bit to get rolling and theyre in a hole scoring wise yeah thats a its its a little surprising that uh you know that the players wouldnt pick up on that and uh you know find a way to get them El going a little bit earlier in games you know you make a habit of that and it you know it just comes too much to to overcome Burton you know decent job that time by Diaz gr keeping Burton in front of him and forcing the jump shot both of these teams make about eight threepointers per game pit does have seven wins this season when they have been trailing at halftime Leed pulls up and Applause hits yeah that uh that law firm of a back court of liot and low pretty special as we mentioned at the top of the broadcast they combin for 33 points per game first lead of the afternoon for pit rer trying to work out out of that corner shot clocks at five for kadne trying to get by low needs to recognize and shoot angular bounce tipped around taken by the Irish and Burton well and guess the size of pit thats a shot you know great job defensively for about 29 seconds but youve got to get the Miss there Notre Dame not a very good offensive rebounding team and a traveling violation on the drive attempt from Davis now wonderful conversation with Coach cable prior to the game in his seventh season Mike they made the tournament semifinals in the ACC last year and then he was the coach of the year in 2023 and they went to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2016 yeah just a a great person coaching in the family his father was a coach his brother on the sidelines with him Jason and uh you know hes been a good friend for a long time full disclosure but uh terrific job not only here but coming to also Oklahoma as well Blake Griffin the player that he coached you may remember that name fantastic passing by his players six points now for cam gorin who finished off that effort at the offensive end of the floor and then Diaz Graham pokes it away low angles to the rim drops it off and the dunk for Corin you know really unselfish by low I mean thats in theory a shot that he could have finished at The Rim but just gave it up for an easier dunk it is a 90 pit run Davis trying to Chisel his way into the panther D Roper up and off the glass calculating the angle constantini and now a Timeout on the Applause floor Nikita constant denovi the graduate student from the Ukraine Micah shury second season as the head coach here in South Bend after being the head coach of Penn State he had remarkable stability the head coaching position here at Notre Dame I visited with Digger Phelps whos a main stay here still at games and then Mike Bray for all of those years and then now michah sh so go back to 71 hes only the Third third coach or second coach fourth coach that theyve had yeah Mike Ray the head coach for that 2015 ACC tournament championship for the Irish youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands yeah there were a couple of years between Digger and uh and Mike Bray that were a

poked away inside of 12 minutes to go in our first half Tom wormy Mike jinsky are outstanding CW Courtside Saturday production crew Austin deflected and stole it and then he got bumped by roper in the foul as Austin made the play defensively for pit with the threepoint lead on the road Music Applause Music how Music MO is it moving noww Music a Music youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years the picturesque Notre Dame campus with the golden dome of the main building off of the distance the Irish trailing by three cam cor and Mike eight points to lead the way no theyve really featured him early on he got off to that good start had the opening jump shot and really has been working both sides of the lane nice nice post up hes got good Applause length Season High 19 points per Corin in a home game against Cal for the Panthers pit Trail by seven at halftime against Syracuse came back to win it went on a 176 run to tie the game at 51 and went on to Victory against the orange that was on Tuesday entry pass Corin trying to get to double digits with the pump fake yeah why not I mean just work over that inside try to build up some files but use your size both ends of the floor Garrett sundra number 12 is into the lineup for the Irish as is Cole Serta number five hes in the corner in front of the pit bench Music Burton complete size mismatch carves his way into the lane one on four ball goes to the floor tie up will favor the Irish looking for a Cable News Network which respects all Americans then you have a new home with news Nation see why news nation is Americas most trusted Cable News Network find news Nation on your screen go to newsnation nowcom you know as great as Burton is he cant win one on four and hes and without Shrewsberry in the lineup they can really lock in on him at Point Burton with a careerhigh 32 points oh off the backboard and in for Davis right at the horn you know it was funny that Jeff cable was talking about the percentages of beaten us all year with guys shooting threes I think that was an example of Music that first three of the game for Davis Up and Under acrobatic low and you know what that shot was an afterthought because he was up in the air as a passer and uh he said well nobody open I think I need to get this one on the rim 17 points for low in the win against the orange this week was mentioning that Burton had 32 Mike and a double overtime win against Boston College this season a career high for Burton with the basketball Nifty behind the back Tribble hton hits the Music jumper threepointer and thats the part of his game hes really worked on from last year 30 from the three this year almost 38 nice step back to create some space Irish are fifth of the conference has a team shooting threes they are two for three in the game well theyre theyre going to have to maximize that in this game Applause Music well this is the unexpected one but you know hey one second you get it up there you never know whats going to happen the backboard can be friendly sometimes especially at home but look at this this is just the quickness youve got to respect his ability to get into the lane it opens up his jump shot Marcus B Penn High School here by Mishawaka Indiana average 30 points for game his senior year and now into his sophomore season as last year named the ACC Rookie of the Year averaging 17 and a half points per game number one freshman of the Music Applause ACC low off the Applause backboard wow yeah you got to defensively understand that hes lefthanded if hes going to go youve got to make him beat you with his is off hand but he got the mismatch outside Jaylen low has a triple double this season that was November against VMI Burton gathers and hits remember I said early on in this game he was getting his teammates involved well now hes getting involved so Burton now with seven points he and Davis are the leading scores so far in the first half of the Irish Corin is into double digits with 10 he leads pitch Applause low hell pump up another jumper come up short Sun the rebound see better job in that pick and roll he got the switch that time Sundre kept him in front forced him to shoot the jump shot instead of get the drive Serta in that corner not enough room to shoot it Diaz Graham defending Imes too strong fight for the loose ball it was a foul of the drive by Music eyes well 9 seconds to go not a bad idea to put the ball on the floor he drew the contact but it and this is another thing you know you have one guy out and and Notre Dame so topheavy in scoring there and you take one of those guys out this is a lineup out there for Notre Dame that has not seen a lot of time together in fact just the 13th free throw attempt of the season for Imes Leon Meer makes her return to the CW in good cop bad cop a brand new dramy about a sister brother detective Duo solving crimes in a small town where things are far more mysterious than they appear catch an all new episode of good cop bad cop Wednesday 98 Central right here on the CW as it falls for IM IMS that only had eight points in this last nine games Mike as he hits that free throw delich is into the game 52 in white for pit low with the kick out Brandon Cummings number Music three delich down the lane dropped it off at the last second for Corin who earns free throws so when we come back cam Corin whos got 10 points in the game to lead all scores to the line in a tie game Music h Applause e youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by fresh pet its not dog food its food food what a setting here on the Notre Dame campus the hurg library off in the distance 19 all pit and Notre Dame the Irish have won four in a row in the series at home but they will not have the services of Matt alako he is The Graduate transfer from Princeton Mikes been dealing with a wrist injury that has kept him out he tried to play against SMU after missing four games prior and missed all three of his shot attempts from threepoint distance and its you know he scoring nine points a game but hes hes the guy who hes got averages almost three assists a game so hes really been a leader for them on the floor so that the those two really important cogs of the machine that are not playing today Bren shury was sitting next to Alo averaging 14 points per game hes unavailable because of abdominal strain you remember that Marcus Burton dealt with injury again a game against ruter in Las Vegas and missed seven games with a knee injury so it has not been great timing for those injuries for the Irish and Mr Korn has already surpassed his season average a with 7 and 1 12 minutes to go in the first half 17 times the double digits in scoring this season for cam Corin this is a time with we talk about this lineup if youre pit theyd really like to try to extend a little bit of a lead with this group out there Im shot clock winding down need to shoot it Davis got it away the last time he tried that banked it in for three wow and thats a function of Burton not being on the court but a sloppy look ahead pass by pit for the turnover IES hesitation couldnt get to the Applause rim work on the Baseline find sophomore from zionville Indiana misses the shot ji to clean up the mess bounces off the rim and he got it back Davis sh and go riding in and fouled take Davis to the free throw Applause line well we Ive talked about Pits height but I tell you Notre Dame is the more physical team in this game and its been GI and Ames who have done a lot of damage inside 152 free throw attempt of the season for Davis tomorrow its a special CW womens Hoops double header first Syracuse travels to durm to take on number 11 Duke then its a battle between Florida State number 20 Georgia Tech a CW womens Hoops double header you dont want to miss tomorrow beginning at 2 pm Eastern 1100 am Pacific only on the CW see thats you know pretty good because Micah Shrewsberry bought Burton a few minutes on the bench in the first half and didnt lose any ground uh in this game and I would imagine short foul trouble that he may not be out the rest of the game Pit by one 6 and a half to go in our first half Panthers have not won here at Notre D since Music 2016 Le it pull up thats just old school midrange basketball you know get to his right hand you stop a little short create some space part of the game thats become devalued because of the threepoint shot Burton grazes the rim Austin grabs it for pit Zach Austin has made the most threes for this Panther team this season thats deflected away Ed to Applause Burton inside chai against Diaz Graham chest to chest Applause in their own right Notre Dames had a lot of success with that pick and roll and taking it to the body Applause inside knocked away kades grabs it some loose possessions by pit the last times up the floor thats now six turnovers in the first half of the Panthers leading by one thats a part of the game in Notre Dame has cleaned up in the last six or seven minutes Davis Around Leed lays it Music in well thats an area that I didnt think that Notre Dame would really win in this game but theyve been terrific in the paint 10 points now for Davis to double digits for the 23rd time this year were inside of 5 minutes to go in the first half un available basketball low diving down Burton Davis several players going to the floor it gets physical the arrow is favoring pit Marcus Music Burton so far in this game for Burton seven points does have a couple of assists including that one to ji and you know Burton not that tall but a good look over the top and that thats just really good footwork inside 10 points for Davis talk about you know pit one of the best shot blocking teams in the ACC does not have one in this first half so theyre just kind of picking up some moisture on the court after three and four players were diving for that loose ball and thats caused Ill tell you too that Marcus Burton is really making low life difficult in this first half hes making him work awfully hard and only four points for Music him gron Gro is still over at the scorers table maybe just taking a look at that last exchange mic as the teams were diving for the ball theyre also taking a look at the shot clock just trying to get all the numbers is correct trying to Crunch the numbers hit Applause basketball low turned back by the defending of Burt Diaz Graham tried to Bank One in thats GMO or the twin brother also on the roster not a great shot in that 11 seconds on an out of bounds play settle for a long jump Applause shot Diaz Graham trying to guard Burton flips it out J theyve got time on the shot clock Burton will fire away not what he was looking for Mohamad alertly grabbing it and scoring nice assist by Burton that time on what looked to be a shot but was really a pass thats what itll look like in the Box Score mik as Sur Mohamad The Freshman from Charlotte North Carolina when youre at home you get an assist on that play Applause low got it back to Corin who was trailing the play and low took all the defensive attention by by a lot he has been their best offensive weapon in this game 14 points now for Corin as you mentioned Mike well above his season average of 105 points per game and were still in the first half with 340 to go passing tight quarters Corin Scoops it up for pit nice hands that time by Diaz Graham eight turnovers in the first half now for the Irish heres Diaz Graham he found his spot for three well he made the play he figures I think I deserve a threepointer here shoots 32 from threepoint real estate thats his 29th of the year at the other end cannot defend the Speedy Tay Davis hes really impressed me off the dribble in this game just facing guys up and get into a strong hand tied for the fourth time in the game Mike 28 Music all with the with the guys that Notre Dame has out to injury thats uh this is a terrific showing here early on low surrounded shot clock is at eight Corin midrange so Davis is the only Irish player in a double digits so far in the first half with 12 Burton has Applause seven trying to direct some traffic thats J moving along the Baseline shot clock to Applause nine Burton elevates they just wasted a lot of time setting up getting that everybody organized in that play Le it treding to find Diaz Graham with a bit of an illadvised pass that goes out of bounds guo Diaz Graham open for three were tied at 28 Music I Music Applause go Applause Music Applause Music thats myv Music Applause lets take a look at todays game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years yeah Tom I mean I thought that pit would have some you know some good success in the paint area with their length but its been Notre aim that it really surprised me on the other end I mean Tay Davis has really stepped up as a scorer hes almost at his season average right now in the first half and they needed that from him Applause desperately so were tired at 28 with 205 to go in our first half here on CW Courtside Saturday game two many of you saw Louisville get a win against Florida State in Tallahassee 8981 Chucky heurn had 29 Points in that Victory theyre just checking on the clock trying to get it set properly right now it says 155 well what a what a turnaround for that Louisville program the where they were the last couple years Pat Kelce comes in and theyre going to be getting a double Buy in the ACC tournament yeah that game was at Louisville Mike and they got the win as one of the three ranked teams in the ACC this week along with Clemson and Applause Duke I think yeah we talk about those three pretty much a lock for the NCA Music tournament two could won 16 in a row before losing at Clemson this season you you Davis just swallowed up by the pit Defenders and a foul was called Mike you want to stay tuned for todays halftime show presented by Subaru love is what makes Subaru Subaru the recap of Florida State in Louisville and the NASCAR xinity series preview that is coming up at halftime I got to send a shout out to my man William Byron backto back Dayton of 500 wins Ive known him for a long watch him rise throughout the ranks he was an Infinity driver uh what a career hes had early on kesn cannot connect on the three ball Notre a now two of seven on threepointers Imes and Davis who banked one in at the end of the shot clock have recorded the made threes for the Irish in the first half Leed off the curl leg it was fouled and to the free throw line probably a little upset with himself for not finishing that play he he had a look after the uh after the foul with a with a shot but nice curl he just kept on coming into the middle of the lane roer just picked up his third personal foul is legged at the free throw line 82 from the line this season next week CW Court side Saturday rolls on with two pivotal matchups first noon Eastern 900 am Pacific Syracuse heads to blackburg to face Virginia Tech then after NASCAR Infinity Series racing Notre Dame these Irish take on Wake Forest CW Courtside Saturday next week only on the CW all roads lead to Charlotte North Carolina Mike in the Spectrum center for the ACC tournament yeah three the next 5 years and uh looking forward my adopted home City and Ill tell you the the scoring pace of this game I think really favors Notre Dame with the people that they dont have out on the floor IMS is wide open Austin picks up the rebound for pit theyre going to take a chance with those guys who havent had a lot of court time theyll rotate out to the shooters that are on the floor first how about Zach Austin has not scored Mike and has not attempted a shot for a guy averages about 10 points per Music game all in all Notre J has done a great job off that pick and roll with the shot clock winding down low shot clock at three needs to pump up a shot had it knocked Away by Davis it is a shot clock violation 288 seconds to go in our first half well on a couple of levels one a great defensive stand you get 30 seconds off the clock clock and then you guarantee yourself the last shot of the half so now Micah sh B going a little offense for defense with his substitutions bit of a scoring drop from Notre Dame they have not scored in the last 2 minutes and 40 seconds both of these teams have shot it well Mike pit 63 from the floor the Irish 55 of the first 20 minutes Burton waiting for the last shot trailing by two trying to get away from legot off the glass its going to fall for Burton Music couple of seconds left for low does not get the shot away the bucket by Burton tias at 30 and he finishes the first half with nine points 30 all to the lock Applause side mohamd J over the front rim really nice interior passing that time good availability and the P looked like theyre a little more aggressive trying to double team the post but the weak side helped late getting there low Corin over ji unsuccessful kesn the Applause rebound I thought early on they might try to get Zack Austin involved in the offense at least get him a shot in this game try to get him going offense l no points and no shot attempts for Austin deflected by low and out of bounds theres 12 on the shock clock this is a thing that you know a lot of big guys arent very good at its the interior passing the double team that was a quick look saw the weak side a little late there six points for ji three of4 from the floor trying to set a screen for Burton fight for the loose ball and rebound its Davis back up strong for two for the Irish well their size got negated that time Notre Dame had pit pushed underneath the basket so gave them the chance at the offensive rebound theyre just getting out muscle 12 points now for Tay Davis Junior from Indianapolis Indiana second year in the Notre Dame program and a transfer from seatan Hall thats off the market to kesn who got his first start of the Season today in place of braon shrew rury out with an abdominal strain for the Irish Curt lost it Diaz Graham try to run the floor one stride lays it up and misses but you know what you really credit kesn on that in transition Mike lets take a look at that Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Melo looks that look hes looky just body white jerseys flying all over the place inside and Notre d a great job on the offensive glass but Ill go back and connect hasnt he really saved two points there on that break by hustling back low reverses field puts it up on the rim and its tapped in Corin and Diaz Graham are in the vicinity Mike I think Corin was the one who got a hand on it try to check and see who theyre crediting the basket to its going to be Diaz Graham for the moment Mike and corn will remain with 14 points he and Davis are our leading scorers each with 14 at this point I always used to look over at the scores table and put my hand up if I was in a crowd see if you can buy a basket for yourself Davis nowhere to Applause go tried to find Mohamad deflected out of bounds by Austin you got a little history with this Notre Dame program Mike I see that Banner for the 1978 final four for the Irish hanging in the Raptor yeah played them in the semifinals that year bigger phelpss only trip to the final four oh wow what a great play on bounds loaded up the right side just forgot about canny his first two points of the game come from a jam for kesn Irish by four deflected out of bounds pit basketball why say everybody concerned with the guy coming off the screen and you lose the top guy just a well welldesigned play good heads up on his part seeing all eyes were looking at at Burton kesn the junr right here in Southbend Indiana they going have to go far to recruit a few of these guys Burton kesn Diaz Graham Applause thats a shot that he makes Mike eight out of 10 times at least Notre Dame drove him off the threepoint line made him shoot a mediumrange jump shot which is the best of all worlds for them Davis missed it corn an aggressive rebound lost the handle to mohamd foul was called its going to be on sh Music see those are the ones I mean you know its probably going to be a tighter bench for Notre Dame second half dont pick up a cheap foul like that he has the rebound youre not going to get the steel go down the other end and set up defensively Mike youre right 10 different players saw the court in that first half for the Irish and Michael shury in his second season low weaving his way magical yeah he gets to his left hand and its pretty much over inside but you know and its not just the 10 guys time its its there were a lot of combinations that hadnt played together for Notre Dame in that first half so it really makes it more impressive who were tied at 30 after the first 20 minutes mohamd what a pass to J looking for a jam Diaz Graham had other ideas low in transition Le it spun past the Defenders it bounces out then its tipped in cam Corin and that was the first block of the game for pit and it starts the break down the other end Panther second in the ACC almost five blocks per game as a team Davis drives and well go to the free throw line Corin was in the neighborhood trying to defend the shot by Davis and he picks up the personal foul so were tied at 36 the sixth tie of the game Davis at the stripe would we come back Music the another Applause Applause we Music Music I Music lets take a look at todays rebound of the game brought to you by Red Lobster so heres the look and we talked about at the uh the physicality that Notre Dame has been playing with in this game ping off with Second Chance points inside theyre just quicker off the floor to the basketball theyre beating pit to it and getting uh getting points as a result but I noticed there Mike was kesn getting in there for a couple of touches and then Davis was the beneficiary So Tay Davis at the free throw line 75 of the season from the line his big game late December mik at Georgia Tech 27 points to tie career high and he was nine of 10 from the free throw line 15 points now for Davis 18 for Corin hes the leading scorer in our gameit you know Im I dont mean to be speaking about Davis like he cant score I mean he has he averages 16 points a game just with the with who they have out of the lineup everybody else had a share in that responsibility of upping their game and he certainly has to this point shury and Alo unavailable today because of injuries for the Irish Diaz Graham pumps it up from the corner three ball in the corner pocket for number 25 in white well and a lot of it is low Jaylen low is starting to be more dominant with the ball hes scoring and hes also finding people out of the pain area thats three made threepointers for Gamo Diaz Graham H is into the lineup number two and Davis put the shoulder down dropped it off the J going on a rim Bender I mean that theyre forced to double team Davis inside and they are not picking up the guy on rotation I mean a lot of that is happening at Close Quarters and its tough to get over low with a defender on his hip spins off Diaz Applause Grant cutting from Corin and foul good sportsmanship by Burton to go over to Diaz Graham so guo Diaz Grand Mike three of five from Beyond The Ark yeah we talked about it and you know just a guy thats so low knowing where his Shooters are and then uh you know ji all he has to do is lurk along the Baseline be ready to receive the ball and they big guys doing a nice job of passing in the Applause paint this Monday allamerican is all new KJ and the team and Beverly are struggling to find a way to win while khil struggles to stay on track at crenchaw dont miss an all new all Amer Monday 87 T right here on the CW out of bounds it is Irish basketball and pit Mike is the number one free throw shooting team of the ACC at 79 thats good for 11th best of the country yeah that uh you know really hurts when you get a shooting fou like that and come away Music empty Burton tried to drop it low kick ball appeared to be looking for Garrett sundra The Freshman from Ashburn Virginia Marcus Burton has not scored so far in the second half he is four of nine from the floor and this is a really small lineup thats out there for Notre Dame right now Irish just two for 10 Mike also on threepoint tries usually make about eight per game Burton just heaves it up as it bounces out to Austin didnt get the shot but man he does such a great job keep on his back once shes got you there speaking of on your back weve got a wedgie on the attempt by Corin coming over the top Music sundra good thing Mike it was not Atomic thats right you cant have those but there you see it right there that is a jump ball and uh hit the beneficiary of the arrow right now so itll be low on the inbounds the biggest lead in the game by either team Five Points by pit in the first half trailing by one Music Austin a fou against sundra W this is this is this could be an issue I they havent taken advantage of it so far but uh right now notams their third team foul they dont want to get pit into the bonus too early in this game with their ability to shoot free throws despite the two misses by Diaz Graham we mentioned pit top free throw shooting club in the league Cummings was cutting it goes all the way across to Leed who comes up short Burton stepping in into the three def flexs out of bounds and that is going to be Irish Applause basketball well and this is a you know pit right now they want to keep him in front Marcus Burton one of six from behind The Arc in this game he needs to think about trying to get into the lane area if he can and normally a 38 threepoint shooter hes made 35 on the season coming into the afternoon as Mike mentioned he has made one so far in the game driving Burton certa tied up by Applause Music Leed right there just like it was overc committing on that right hand that left the drive open for sure a good identification for him second foul on Leed Cole Serta the freshman at the free throw line just his third free throw attempt of the year he hadnt missed prior to that yeah you know this is a a new position for him to be in second half of a meaningful game Applause Music Applause Panthers have only seen four players score in this game amazingly trying to go inside to Corin he andera got tied up well the one thats a mystery is is Zach Austin I mean and he you know he hasnt really been chasing his shot he has yet to take a shot in this game thats a guy who had 19 points Todd for the team high in the win against Syracuse this week at home for the Panthers and he made three threepointers in that game as well Mike Richard senior from Winston Salem North Carolina transfer from High Point University in North Carolina Austin happens every time doesnt it every single time he heard us talking about him amazing not only that he just hit a threepointer his 49th of the season to lead the team well how about your first shot of the game eight minutes into the second half its a three and CA stepping up ripping the ropes for the Irish twopoint Notre Dame Applause Music lead Leed creating daylight and scoring for the Panthers Music Applause tied for the moment rooper on the Baseline into the corner Serta let the defender Move On by and hit it in front of his own bench

a win against Carolina on the resume and the loss we just referenced at home in overtime on the CW 7875 to Clemson looking at a close game first pressure that weve seen coming out of the timeout how about the Irish three and six this season in games decided by six points or fewer rer shot clock at five Burton needs to launch it fires away right how about the Freshman coming in Braden Cummings defensively trying to give low a little bit of a break take him off of Burton and that is Notre Dame sixth foul Tom and that is going to again we talked about pit getting into the bonus thats the second foul on tay Davis in a onepoint game with 1050 to go Tom wormy Mike jinsky are outstanding CW Courtside Saturday production crew with you from purcel Pavilion home of Irish basketball since 1968 and beautifully refurbished over the years lean kick Cummings yeah thats thats tough you havent played the whole game to come in and thats your first shot early in the shot Applause clock another three Ser up for certain you know as as a coach you just got to shake your head at that I mean he didnt even think about launching that from 30 drive it Pas for Applause low so how about Serta it Bears repeating he made two threepoint baskets All Season prior to today thats number three from threepoint distance for him not threepoint distance he was out by the de low getting to his left hand low going for the old school threepoint play and now for the rest for the last 10 minutes of the half uh Pits going to be shooting in the Applause bonus Jaylen low 87 from the free throw line third best in the ACC and hes made it a onepoint game this little press maybe not designed to take the ball away but they using enough clock come on heat check why not comes up cold for Serta low Le Patience by legot to let the defender fly on by see even you know that shot I mean look the guy is the guy is out of his mind from three and you got to go with it but uh thats actually started the break pit getting out into the Open Court a lot more in this second half and now the Panthers have taken a onepoint Applause lead nine lead changes in the game Serta driving against Diaz Graham and a f is call this is where Jaylen loow is so good getting out the opening Court good awareness that time knowing about the defender giving them a little pump fake ish leate thats a senior move playing in his 145th Career College game coming up next the NASCAR Infinity Series in Atlanta where the drafting is wild the racing intense and anything can happen Rising Stars season veterans go head tohead who will take the checkered flag NASCAR xinity series racing from Atlanta coming up next only on the CW when we are done in Notre Dame Indiana yeah Mr Serta comes into the game averaging 14 points a game and he gives you 12 Serta almost perfect from threepoint distance and pit by the way Mike has zero points from its bench but see and thats as an opposing coach thats your greatest fear that somebody who hasnt played you dont know that guy you know and boy the the right hand taking left you know what low can do but C you have no idea what hes capable of and here he is he shows up basket by low gives the Panthers the lead Imes takes the pass off the rim Leed grabs it low against kesn deflected out of bounds look to be off of the fingertips of Austin and Irish Applause basketball heres gets a little bit of a light there and uh you know its you take it back into the defense with that left hand but he was able to get by Davis that time that was 63 low against 610 J yeah and uh and but pit has kicked it up into another gear here in the last 8 minutes or so what an entertaining game Mike this afternoon yep and even with that only up by one point tied at 30 at halftime shot clock to seven got es J and it knocked Away by Corin shot blocking also starting to become a little bit more of a factor for pit second block of the game for the Panthers Austin lines up a three online all the way J grabs it that was the same spot he knocked down his first shot from again I dont know a three not a lot of movement in the offense early in the shot clock J got seven rebounds now Mike leads everybody in that category Burton almost forgot the basketball kesn around the edge off the glass calculating the angle just nice use of that 45° angle old school using the backboard the Junior from South Bend puts the Irish up by Music one Corin Music Applause fouled by ji Jr kesn who got the start this afternoon finding that spot on the backboard and giving the Irish a onepoint lead Music Music it is really cool Music Music Music youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 00 60 years how about the performance this afternoon from freshman H CTA from LeRoy Illinois out of the IMG Academy in Florida Mike he had made two threes on 12 tries all season before today yeah its amazing when that first shot goes down and again so you dont know how guys are going to react to Extended Court time but you could after that first one just all kinds of confidence this one was from ridiculous range we talk about guys how about con disy and Serta on the season they combine average Four Points a game theyve given the Irish 16 here in this game so far Great Lift for the guys who arent playing exactly what we talked about with Coach shury prior to the game who will step up theyve been two key parts of this game with k at the free throw line for pit Junior from Allen Applause Texas one of two for Corin 19 points and that production from Corin leads all scorers in our game way above his season average of 10 and a half points per game tied at 54 Davis unties us nobody really supporting him off the drive hes been really great getting to that right hand Jeff cable told us hed be a tough matchup and hes proved to be that taken by kesn too many bodies inside for low to make that PL Burton spins it in from long range timeout pit biggest lead of the afternoon for the Irish Applause Music Applause this TR Applause back e lets take a look at todays key play brought to you by Hilton Garden in Hilton for the stay yeah uh throw the stats out right now I mean Burton endgame situation hes not going to quit taking threes but thats a huge liit forces Jeff cable to take the timeout but one thing time I keep an eye on Burton three fouls if Im pit Im going right whoevers whoever hes guarding Im going right at him see if I can get that fourth one here early Burton Serta and dve double digit scores Burtons got 12 points two of eight on threepointers its coming off a twopoint performance in the loss this week at home against SMU yeah its interesting theyve got Burton on low who hasnt been a factor in this game maybe to try to hide him a little bit interesting matchup Leed floats it in Music good answer out of the timeout for the Music Panthers so legs got 12 Music points leg it up on Burton theyve thrown all different kinds of bodies at Burton hes had three different guys guard him shot clock to five for Burton lot of dribbling and spinning and shooting and 30 seconds of Marcus Burton I mean the ball never really lik his hand he created that by himself not a bad thing if youre an Irish Applause fan Corin who has tied his season high with 19 points in the game for pit leot fires away Davis looked like he and Burton kind of converged on that ball Davis comes away with it and now gives to Applause Burton deflected by Corin out of bounds 502 to go in Music regulation look whos coming in how about that you talk about yeah hey just you know need a little bit of offense right now see if Serta still got got something in season High 12 points for Cole Serta this afternoon six made threes in the game on 17 attempts by the Irish Burton extra gear spins it off the Applause glass its got got to find a way to get the ball out of his hands Austin he missed an acrobatic chance hes behind the play Davis aggressively to the rim Davis off the glass not aim Irish by9 on an 112 run and a pit Defender actually screamed his own man giving Davis the clear Applause Lane low halfway down and out Diaz Graham had it for a moment and ends up with Davis inside of four minutes to go a very different Irish team mic than that that played Wednesday against SMU and lost 9773 yeah thats they again they just got a really constant theyve got a collapse almost on Burton give up other shots Burton pulls up Corin comes flying in for that mansiz Applause rebound see kesn thats just a giveaway in points kesn over zeis picks up the foul Davis from Burton driving to the rim the Irish leaded by nine Music Applause Music Music out pleas Music Applause Music Applause Music Music thats the white dude lets take a look at todays game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years wellow you look at Marcus Burt in the first half he was terrific getting his own shots been a high volume shooter in this game Tom not shooting a great peren but hes Tak some big shots espe in this second half and then Jaylen low has really gotten into a different gear hes more aggressive getting to that left hand and hes gotten pit on the open court a lot more in this second half 18 out of 20 games in double digits for Marcus Burton with his 16 points Jaylen low 11 points low also with four assists in the game just four made threepointers for pit thats below their season average of about eight per game remember Graham gave away two free throws on a two shot opportunity early on so critical that he converts this one in Applause one hes now 0 for three from the line and he got it back somehow oh its kept Alive by Music Applause Music corn low miscommunication could not collaborate with ish leged low he was going to stay out in the wing turnover number 10 in the game for pit remember they had seven in like the first three minutes of the game yeah Notre Dame struggled on that side of it Mike so its actually been Notre Dame been better theyve only had two since those seven early turnovers in the first eight minutes just two turnovers in the last 28 minutes for the Irish came out a little jittery theyve overcome after being tied at 30 after the first 20 minutes kesn shot clock at six for Burton around the edge against Leed steps under and the soft touch from Burton he just starts and stops so quickly tough for one guy to stay in front of Applause him 18 points Marcus Burton as the top scorer in the ACC leg it for three for Music pit big lift from him and thats what they were thats what he they were looking for him on that last possession but he came off of the threepoint line 15 points ish legett 20th time this season hes gone for 15 or more Burton got it to IMS Davis invited the contact it spun off the rim it goes out of bounds who has the basketball its the Applause Irish now just 156 to go Mike Irish went on an 112 run just a few minutes ago to build the lead which is now Applause eight really the only significant run of our game yeah and this and actually those last possessions for Notre Dame has just been buron dribbling the clock down finally you they they double team him big chai wanted the pass it now he fumbles it away late in the shot clock and a foul and its a double bonus now going out the rest of the Music game and those were plays that Notre Dame was converting on early but they got back to the ball they swarmed to the ball a little bit better in that second half he love the Swarm defensively so loow is at the line hes only attempted one free throw on the back end of an old school threepoint play and he made it two shots on every foul now going out we have mentioned it during the broadcast the number one free throw shooting team in the ACC is pit and thats a point a guy out but Diaz he missed both ends in the of a two shot foul and then the front end of a one and one so Four Points potentially there but good conversion Applause Music Applause inside of a minute and a half to go in regulation the last home win for the Irish was January 28th against George Tech Davis driving and itll go to the free throw line and once they got the ball out of Burtons hands I mean leget basically was fronting Burton doing everything he can to keep him from getting the ball back still just a fourth team foul against pit again that last home win January 28th its February 22nd 7168 against Georgia 10 David has stepped up in a big way they really had have a number of guys give big time contributions despite the Miss 21 points for Tay Davis eighth time this season 20 points or more for Davis hits got to hurry it up a little bit here low Burton got it off the rim nice job you know kesn making him take a tough shot step back three the final minute Mohammad tried to bounce it to Davis its out of bounds and its pit ball yeah you you got to get the ball to a primary ball handler in that situation and uh mohamd got caught up in the air with nobody to pass Applause to just a freshman mistake Applause late sevenpoint game 50 seconds to go Le it individual effort blocked by Davis foul on the Applause Music play all right that was just a physical physical matchup and just right there at the end a little bit of the body maybe that reach in at the end is what cost him that would have been a tough shot for liot to Applause make Leed had been two for two from the free throw line yeah and this the free throw line letting him down right now 10 of Applause Music Applause 15 Diaz grah second offensive rebound off a missed free throw for a basket so the Panthers take a timeout after the Diaz Graham tip for two and now hes into double digits with 11 points that is four Panthers that have scored in double figures they still have zero points from the bench in the game Corin 19 to lead the way let get low and Diaz gram after that most recent tip to make it a fivepoint game 449 seconds remaining coming up next the NASCAR Infinity Series in Atlanta where the drafting is wild the racing intense and anything can happen Rising Stars season veterans go head tohead who will take the checkered flag NASCAR xinity series racing from Atlanta coming up next only on the CW what an afternoon of sports we saw Louisville defeat Florida State 8981 in game one of CW court side Saturday were going right down to the wire with the Irish and the Panthers and then Infinity racing follows us Jeff Capel well interesting with this again offense for defense Ser of back in the game for Notre Music Dame coach Gable needs a late comeback with 457 seconds to go Davis on the inbounds Austin defends it skillfully broken Applause hes and still theyve got to foul quickly because thats only the fifth foul theyve got to give two up two more before they get the Irish Applause shooting and with everything thats happened Mike over the last couple of weeks here around this Irish program this would be an enormous win against a talented pit team yeah and it was there was a lot of soul searching this week with between the coaching staff and the players and uh you know to this point they have Applause responded okay they had uh they had three now that still two to play with so not a bad play with 399 left these teams have shot the ball exceptionally well in this game and you know Tom this is a thing that isnt talk about about a whole lot but in in these situations your inbounder has got to be hes the key guy in the whole thing youve got to have a lot of confidence in his judgment and uh where hes got that that 5sec clock going in his head and the decisions he makes to Music pass hit shooting 51 of the game the Irish 56 Music Irish looking to go nine and five on their home floor and win their 12th game of the season hit game in 16 10 7 and8 in conference play dont forget Infinity Series racing to follow us as we drag down to the end of this one pit is covering the guys in the back court as well try to put some pressure take them off is just kind of cheap in bounders Applause Imes on the inbounds trying to get it to Burton bounc to Davis got bumped and fouled you got to you got to really be careful with a bounce pass inbounds especially a long one like that you dont throw it on the sideline IMS again on the inbounds so really I mean pit theyve got those three fouls in about 4 seconds so now thatll put the Irish at the free throw line oneonone situation kesn 67 but again a guy who hasnt been at the line a lot this year four of five in ACC play first free throw attempt of the night JR kesn big one and one big front end of the one1 remember kesn got the start tonight Bren Shrewsbury could not go with an abdominal strain suffered against SMU in the loss on Wednesday say on this floor how about Serta coming off the bench with 12 points Davis has 21 Burton has 19 two from KES the Irish bounce perhaps the luck of the green uniforms this afternoon Mike Le it just Hees it up he got the bounce talk about the bounce Applause we are not done all right lets take a look at todays player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom Tay Davis 21 points to lead all scorers not just with the points but eight of 11 not a high volume shooter very efficient in this game hes been very physical in the paint area really was physical in the first half against pit and then of course the glass helps a little bit too for a three thatll get you to 21 a little faster Davis that was his 13th three of the Season just a set it pit does not have any that was their last time out Notre Dame has two Music and pit also has two fouls to play with with the one andone before theyre in the double Music bonus Panthers brought a threegame losing streak on the road in the ACC into the building this afternoon tied with the Irish at 30 at halftime we have had Mike nine ties and 12 lead Chang changes in our game yeah even with that run I mean it looked like a couple times both teams looked like they were going to try to pull away but uh everybodys answered HS again on the inbounds looking theyre face guarding Burton time out Irish Applause 29 seconds to Music go its been a very well played game by both teams Mike yeah and uh again the The Freshman Cummings in for pit and uh it was just its an allout face guard on Burton theyre going to do everything they can to keep the ball out of his hands make somebody else catch get fouled and shoot a free throw Burton 85 from the line 85 best on the team number five certa what a performance by him coming off the bench with 12 points and three main threepointers on four tries hed only made two threes All Season prior to Applause today immediate foul Music Music Applause and now three of three from the line kesn Irish trying to solidify and cement this Victory late in the second Music half pit making other guys catch and go make free throws and uh the Irish responding Le it throws up a three and makes it remember no timeouts for pit its a threepoint game Mike they foul Burton well see at least the the beauty of that is on an aade basket its really tough to deny Burton the ball inbounds there watch this this this is a spot hes hit like all of his threes from that same spot he loves that right shoulder but on this made basket if youre noted aim and you get it in quickly you can get it to Burton 12 of 16 as a team from the line Burton with 18 points first free throw of the game which is pretty astounding by given how much time he spends in the lane area Burton has basically played this entire game Mike 38 minutes plus well he had those remember he had that she had that rest early in the first half and then its been all in same spot for legot got it away its offline foul called as Corin reached for Applause Music yeah and its and now the strategy changes that Micah Shrewsberry has got to put hes hes going with ji back in because he needs rebounders from on the free throws two shots for corn Applause so thats 11 of 17 as a team from the line for pit hes got a chance to make it a one possession Applause game out to low shoots a three weak side Cummings over the rim and end twopoint Music game timeout Irish their Music last well I tell you what Miss free throws have just killed Notre Dame just that opportunity and how about the this freshman coming in hes gotten some time in the second half mostly as a Defender but hes in the right place right time how about the first bench points of the game out for the Panthers from Brandon Cummings The Freshman from Midland Pennsylvania the younger brother of former pit panther Nelly Cummings Music 87 seconds to go and this is you know for for Micah Shrewsberry hes just hes just got to be trying to instill confidence in his guys about finishing this Music game no timeouts for either team twopoint game if you really want to take a big risk break somebody long and throw it long uh they they did the last time and they they didnt throw it oh he got Burton taking the well got him taking the ball out of bounds Applause but yeah this is a step in and they wanted to get back to him as quickly as loose ball and the Irish have the have the arrow dangerous thats where I wish they had a jump ball right now Tom you just well lets see who would be jumping well itd be Burton I think hes at the bottom yeah it be itd be Burton and Austin so just the by the uh by the arrow big Advantage for Notre d Music kle got bumped to the back court 57 seconds to Music Music Applause go all right kesy at the free throw line hes got eight points in the Applause game hes looked really Sol in this last minute from the Applause line This The crucial free Applause throw and its a fourpoint game Applause Michael shrewbury waving everybody off no fouls Leed somehow kept it alive till Austin who throws it up and thats it 76 72 the Irish wins it
