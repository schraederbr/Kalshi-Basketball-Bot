points on the board I know Hoke fans are looking for points after a 58e season low on Tuesday night at Boston College its Miami that wins the tip and starts with the basketball this is the 10th different starting lineup for the Hurricanes this season with Matthew Cleveland out for the first time this year yeah I can relate to that being in Philly uh my first year and I had probably the most teammates ever in history so starting lineup change is something that Im familiar with its not really easy to play with its hard to catch a rhythm with your teammates it did lead to NBA Rookie of the Year honors though so it all worked out yeah that was positive you know that that was good uhoh shot clock violation wave off the basket AJ ston McCrae half second away from opening the scoring with a deep three yeah I mean good start for Virginia Tech right you know when you come out and you uh force a team to a shot clock violation on the first possession it always gives your defense confidence you take a look at the Hokey starting five who do you look for offense here after a disappointing game midweek um I think you go for you know look for Toby you know I I think you look to establish him early and um you know try to get him in a rhythm and to be aggressive and Toby low won for the hokes you know malijah potit had a terrific outing against Miami in that first meeting back in early January 25 points which was a career High going against Lynn kid those two yeah Im looking forward to the battle Yeah you know the battle down low Music 100 Jaden shot played limited minutes in that lost to Boston College only played five of them wasnt feeling 100 with an illness you know hes got a pretty stroke Im looking forward to him you know still keep shooting the ball even though he missed one my man Lyn kids great po oh good pass out the post to a nice pull up and pass down to the double team and bethia opens the scoring yeah you like to see that early for Miami getting a good Rhythm Hammond looking for potit on the inside he goes up and cant finish it around the Applause rim pull up transition three front rim Music Johnson lines up the three he cant connect but Virginia Tech has missed their first four shots starting games for Virginia Tech is is important I feel like they are a real Rhythm team and if they get going they can be really good but you know theyve had slow starts well especially coming off a road performance where you only score 30 six points you want to see that offense find its Rhythm early yeah yeah you want to see find the Rhythm early get on the break get some easy looks the W of the corner nothing but the bottom of the net thats a good sign you said they got to get number one going Toby laow right on Q there I mean with a 49 in vertical right I mean you go up you take the ball you go up to the rim its a foul or a dunk Lin kid flushes it on the other end you know he really wants to even this season siries spent three years in blackburg playing his former team only had seven points in that first meeting they lost by a single point yeah anytime you play your former Club I mean its its a little bit of a Revenge game no matter what you say right tough take Toby low through contact great finish on the inside he has all five for the hes early now to if youre Toby dont stop keep going right and your teammates need to know like okay my my our best player on the flooor has five points early right keep giving him the ball and let him Music create down to the post this time a Johnson 5 Seconds to shoot low all over him at the end of the shot clock ly kid knocks it down just beats the buzzer now if linit adds that to his game and maybe even a step further out to the threepoint line its going to be a dangerous guy hes got backto back buckets Miami in front by one the wow in trouble goes up with it man hits Toby the wow has all seven for the Hokies to start its a great time for this Virginia Tech offense ston McCrae B on his way to the rim and we step aside here we go we got we got Lin kid with a nice midrange jumper he felt comfortable with that then we got Toby on the other end a little nice fadeaway Music touchup e not scoring that many points and then I felt like they were feeling the pressure and just trying to put the ball in the basket any way possible instead of really sticking to their defense I mean sticking to their offensive principles well you know Mike young has had his teams full attention since that performance Toby L has all seven for the hoking so far yep hes got all seven the rest of the team is 0 for four but hey when when that happens you look for your star guy thats Toby right now you keep getting him the ball keep having him be aggressive towards the rim getting to the foul line and then guys will start filling in and and and knocking down some shots I think what was so surprising about it is how well Virginia Tech has played on the road before that game four Road conference wins its tough to do L stripped on his way to the rim still a good take though I like him being aggressive you know thats not stripped hes hanging on the Music rim Betha and now Johnson oguk kuu freshman whos been a bright spot for Miami goes inside to LY kid and he draws a foul it seems like Virginia Tech has made a concerted effort to get Toby low involved for Miami its Lin kid yeah I mean this this offense is definitely going to be run through Lin kid he can pass the ball out the post um he can you know he he does all the little things out there and he can score the ball you know when needed and this is what this Miami team needs they need a guy that can put the ball in the hoop especially with Matthew Cleveland out I mean a guy whos been your most consistent scorer yeah you know not having him out is a big blow for them offensively and he gives them confidence too you watch him you watch him when he came back the rest of the guys seem like theyve been you know they they were they were more confident than they were before he when he wasnt playing yeah Cleveland over the last nine games 23 points per game so you take that out of a lineup thats already struggled with inconsistencies 10 different starting lineups and a lot goes on Lin kid shoulders for sure for sure but it also opens up some opportunity for these other guys who you know havent havent had that you know great of offensive performances to go out there and and show their coach that you know it is it isnt just Matthew Cleveland that can score the ball or L kid right we got some great supporting casts Ben Hammond had it a foot behind wesler its Dayton McCrae the steal cant finish Applause it Jaden young all the way to the rim scoop to the hoop for two thats a great take I like them you know forcing a tough shot getting the rebound pushing the ball pushing the break and getting a layup on the other end good defense one thing Virginia Tech did not do on Tuesday night is push it in transition get to the rim like young did Young drains the three from the corner backto back baskets for Jaden young there we go hes catching a little bit of a rhythm Music now Virginia Tech has made five in a row they only had five made baskets the entire first half on Tuesday against BC the defensive intensity is picked up Hammond steals it away and draws the foul now Ben Hammond he has been a real bright spot during his freshman season absolutely right you always want a freshman thats going to come in and do the work on the defensive end and continue develop offensively and thats exactly what hes doing and you know what thats like to get major minutes early in your college career at the point guard position they put a lot on the plate of a college point guard Hammonds done it very well yeah its not easy to come in right away and play and and and be that starting point guard um you know I was lucky enough to uh learn from you know some pretty good guys ahead of me and scoop Jardine and Deion waiters and Brandon Trish um and going against them every day in practice you know really made me better as a player so you know its not easy getting thrown in the fire right away um I was you know lucky to have some some great leaders ahead of me Joe Bay tough take Paul Joe Bay the sophomore on Off the Bench into the box Applause score heres wesler the sevenfooter going against Lin kid on the Block puts it up and in great hey got to make it got to make it go some way somehow it all counts the same yeah the hokes have made six of their last seven Music Applause good defense by wesler denying ly kid the ball and Rex Steiner had his foot out of bounds so hell stay Miamis Music way the shot clock reset here we have control the ball or no they got the shot clock at 20 so not a full reset no Toby and no ly kid right now lets see see where the score wheres the offense going to come from its its going to come from somebody maybe its my man Ben Burnham one of my favorite players in the AC what do you like about him I just think I mean the moments that hes had in this game I mean in the in you know this season he plays really really hard right hes not the most skilled guy in the world but hes the first guy will be on the floor be first guy to crash an offensive rebound um you know hes been a a bright spot for this Virginia Tech Team I love the term glue guy I think he fits that perfectly for sure and you need him every good team has a glue guy my man I think he also has a great white on his bicep I dont know what it might be a shark or a bird I dont know wesler turns it and scores Patrick wesler the 7ot red shirt sophomore two buckets in this first half yeah hes showing he can get to that left hand and finish even on the uh the right Applause block crosscourt pass wide open Austin Schwartz he cant finish it follows his own shot and that one Falls yeah Co coach isnt going to like that one you know when you can test the shot you got to box out and then go get the ball well no surprise this has been a close competitive game the last 10 games these two teams played have been two possessions or weve had overtimes during that stretch just feels like when these two get together it always comes down to the last play Burnham lines up the three and drills it Ben Burnham you got to become this guys agent that listen Ive been pulling for him all year trying to tell him if those an all hustle team my man would be on there they transferred in for College of Charleston spent three years with Pat Kelsey whos now the Louisville coach you see the turnaround that hes engineered there b him again the Defense Forces the miss this is quickly turning into the Ben Burnham show sure it can get like that its been like that a few times this year Rex Steiner misses it gets his own Miss kicks it out heres Tyler Johnson pull up I like Tyler Johnson as well the Freshman came in hes just you know he can shoot the ball a little bit hes had some pretty good moments this year as well transition triple rims out rolled around but did not drop Rex Steiner slowing things down for Virginia Tech sixpoint lead for the hokes about Midway through this first half ah this should be a big T peeve mind when I was playing we get a defensive possession and Coach to tells me to settle it down even though that was a successful play as a player Ive always wanted to be like lets lets push it lets go now Patrick wesler count it plus the foul wesler hes proved a spark Off the Bench of the hokes up by eight hey if we were betting on todays game I would take the over that theyd have more than uh just five baskets and a half I mean its hard to go down right I mean listen I I think on a serious note yeah you know I think you go back you regroup as a team right I think coach coach young says to their team hey you know we we didnt play well obviously right but you get your team together and you focus on you know how you can get better and how you can perform better Music in Miami theyre still searching for their best offense without Matthew Cleveland out there the leading scorer who is missing tonights game big three there AJ ston McCrae drills it to pull the Hurricanes back within five theyve had some good looks it just hasnt gone down like Cleveland is just such a big part of this Hurricanes offense you take him out of it and again a team that has had their inconsistencies offensively the entire season has to find an identity quickly shot clock down to two Rex Steiner heaves it comes up short thats interesting right youd think youd go back to Pat after you know hes hes three for three in the last three possessions with an N1 so see if they can Virginia Tech can find him in the post again and Lin kid is back out there wesler was having that success while kid was on the bench wesler told me to tell you that Lin kid can get some of this work in the post Laughter too now I I love it because those are two guys that went every single day in practice right wesler and kid and now going against it on a Saturday night in the ACC and when you look around the results around the league today Michael you got Boston College at NC State with shock upset win so now Miami they need a lot of help here counted plus the foul for ly kid because the bottom three teams of the ACC miss the ACC tournament in Miami starting to get cut a drift yeah I mean that that didnt help them today with with BC and NC State winning excuse me and um you know they they now they got to go out and they got to get a win here right its survive you know Only the Strong Survive right now and they need all the wins they can get to you know creep in that ACC tournament for the first time ever its not a guarantee that you get that ACC tournament birth only the top 15 will be taken Miami knows they got to practically win the rest of the way just to have a shot no margin for error anymore good hustle potit on the floor and a jump ball possession arrow with the hokes its a quick jump right there Ben Hammond back into the game for Virginia Tech mismatch here going against kid dumped down potit hammers it home that was a great decision by hymon got the switch dragged linkit out a little bit and found his big fell peti down low for an easy bucket kid trying to answer on the other end going against potit risky pass out of the double team shot clock down to five ston McCrae got it again AJ ston McCrae he had zero points in the first meeting against Virginia Tech already up to8 tonight yeah I mean that was just how they drew it up right little deflection to a help Defender and a three ball Jaden shoot answers with a three of his own yeah they need to get him more open looks man if they can get Jaden shoots some open looks hes a pure shooter out there he can really shoot the ball the Virginia Tech four of eight from three a welcome sight after a 58year seasoned low 36 points on Tuesday night oh desperate for a bounce back wi tonight St McCrae staying hot hes got 10 points in this first half for Miami that was a good move used the size over the smaller guard in Hammond and was able to finish with the right hand whos going to step up with Matthew Cleveland at is 16 and half half points out of the lineup ston McCrae got the start potit great patience lays it up and in backto back baskets for malij poti yeah Miami is going to have a problem if they keep switching that that one five pick and roll um you know Lin kid gets on the point guard and then btis just too big and too strong for anyone else on the court Johnson drills it from deep and its a twopoint game oo he let him know after he made it too Miami has made their last five baskets their offense coming alive here at home shoot comes up empty on the three Schwarz leaves it for Johnson in attack mode easy off the window and in to tie it at 28 hes talking to somebody over there on the bench letting him have it thats what I like to see some competitiveness lets go the Johnsons got the last five to tie this game count it plus the foul Tyler Johnson looks like Miami went to a zone right there uh great great offensive set by coach Mike young you know a tall task for them to make the ACC tournament um you know and at at this rate you know the the wins that Virginia Tech has had they probably uh deserve to get in but you know its tough you never know weve seen stranger things right I think a win tonight for Virginia Tech would secure a spot in the ACC tournament right now a threepoint lead although Miamis made six in a row here theyve found an offensive Rhythm as of late paulay off the window and in making seven straight makes for Miami its a good take by Paul jobay used the glass nice and gentle got the two heres Ben Hammond Jaden shoot and now Tyler Johnson 10 seconds to shoot Johnson low in attack mode wesler with two seconds to shoot goes up great defense from Miami Tobys got to try to go finish that one he scored the first seven points of this game for Virginia Tech and has not taken a shot since yeah I mean and thats been you know kind of hiso this year right I I would love to see him you know score that first seven and then continue on to be aggressive right nobody can stop you just go to the hoop try to finish either draw a foul or finish through contact I think if he starts getting that aggressive mindset its going to be better off for him oh he has it here although gives it up quickly youre right tell hes not hes not hunting a shot right now no and its thats what his you know his team needs that right now theyre in a a tough game they need him to be aggressive Hammond draws the foul onepoint game not much to separate these two teams which is no surprise they played a onepoint game in blackburg in January Virginia Tech won at 8685 the last 10 meetings between these two programs have all resulted in two possession games or less foul was on the floor so Virginia Tech inbounds under their own hoop poti calling for it and he gets it elel poti backing down his former teammate poti giving it to LY kid he went off for a career 25 points in that first meeting yeah that was a strong move over the left shoulder just used the shoulder to get in the chest of ly kid and uh got a nice hook shot three onone alyo Burnham couldnt finish it Applause looking forward to it Taylor we got your boy MCW out of the studio tonight I know youve enjoyed your time in the ACC Network Studio this season oh yeah she knows Im her favorite cohost of all time well Joel Barry Luke Hancock and Carlos Boozer Taylor tanom and theyll have you covered not only at halftime but nothing but net to recap a busy day in the ACC Lin kid a Miss Q on the allei upm a that was a great set too great play they had it just how they drew it up just couldnt finish it just couldnt come up with the finish I notice Mike young likes to run a lot of sets for a shoot to come off to shoot that three ball shoot has it here they got the switch oh Johnson with five shoot lets it Fly comes up short air bom three minutes remaining in this first half its been close throughout Dayton McCrae acrobatic Drew contact hard foul went right into malal potit both guys slow to get up was actually after the shot Brandon Johnson crashing the boards trips into poti and thats where the contact occurs potin who scored her career high 25 points in the win against Miami in blackburg in early January still down with the training staff looking at him good to see him get to his feet with the help of his head coach Mike Applause young did Coach beheim ever help you up no way he said he would have said get up son Lets Go we need yout now we got both of you guys working for us at ESPN yeah yeah Y and poti still going to get evaluated well keep you posted on his status hope to get you an update during Music halftime AJ ston mccraig got the start tonight in place of leading scorer Matthew Cleveland and he has delivered thus far 11 points in this first half yeah hes played really really well I like his aggressiveness hes getting to the hoop hes hit some shots from the outside hes keeping this team in this game he had zero points in the first meeting between these two and now 12 in this first half has Miami back within one fullcourt pressure from the Hurricanes re Steiner heaves it Johnson to Burnham Ben Burnham in attack mode that rims out wesler punches it to the first row little too much on that from Patrick wesler basketall Music Music Ugo chuko and now Schwarz hands off for State mccraig Miami looking for the lead on this possession trying to get it inside to Lin kid double team comes kicks out logo three its good Brandon Johnson drains it from Deep hes feeling it Johnson a perfect three for three in this first half and that one fires Miami back in front by two two minutes remaining in this first half Johnson spins his way free rolls off the rim no good wesler up and in to clean up the spill I like it hes showing that energy on the offensive glass finishing with the left Music Applause St McCrae comes up empty Burnham foul called neither team in the bonus at the end of this first half Music Music Music Jaden young got it Jaden young puts Virginia Tech back up by three and the hokes have already scored more points than they did the entire game on Tuesday night against BC yeah they knew they were going to come out and play a lot better than they played against BC ninth lead change in this game back and fourth we go here in Miami foul called on the entry Music pass Jaden young with that three hes got eight points in his first half so combination of Jaden young Patrick wesler with a combined 16 points of this first half some unlikely support cast stepping up yeah I mean look we knew we knew that somebody was going to have the quality looks that theyre getting from the threepoint line and also getting inside the paint and get some good easy layups but the hokeys have yet to separate it feels like every time they put a little gap between them and Miami the hurricanes have found an answer well look Miamis been playing well right I mean they theyre shooting the ball pretty well theyre getting good looks you know they got got to give them credit theyre theyre playing well offensively and theyre staying in the game in the team when you look at Miamis record at 6 and 20 and 2 and 13 this late in the season you might think theyve thrown in the towel but theyve actually played better in the last two three weeks of this season theyve won their last two games here at the watsco center yeah I I I think getting Matthew Cleveland back was a big help you know having him back you know if they had him from the beginning of the year wild Saturday in the ACC ton of upsets you got NC State knocking off Wake Forest Boston College beat Georgia Tech its remarkable in this league because those three teams are the bottom three teams will miss the ACC tournament at the end of this regular season I wouldnt want to play any of those teams fighting for their life no not at all right theres you know when you got a reason to play and youre fighting for something theres a dangerous teams logo three Austin Schwarz buries it uhoh gets it back almost hit it again both teams shooting better than 50 in this Lin kid get a touch in the post man we got to give it to him give it to him there you go he gets it 4 seconds to shoot crosscourt pass the Thea cant connect on the triple thats one thing about getting him the ball hes going to attract a double team and then youll have guys open on the backside just got to find him a little bit earlier so ly kid for Miami for Virginia Tech youve been wanting Toby L to get the ball back he scored the first seven points for the hokes hasnt scored since and misses that three yeah I I mean hes just wasnt aggressive after he scored the seven points I mean him going to the rim is is bread and butter in my eyes and he needs to utilize that more theres no reason why he shouldnt be at the free throw line um at least three four times a half the blow by Johnson the Finish had lell beat in Miami up by two yeah Brandon Johnson has had a game himself knocking down some deep threes and then a drive a nice drive to the rim pass Toby Lal for an easy two and he is a perfect four for four from the field leow had the seven points in the first four minutes has not scored since Hammond step back three no good low he can jump out of the gym grabs that off defensive rebound keeps possession with the hokes did you see how high he got off on that rebound my goodness the Wilds got a mismatch they floated to him 3 seconds to shoot rejected by ly kid good play by ly kid using his length St MC crafty tank for two hes been playing really well all night man hes been played really smart making quick fast decisions when he gets the ball not waiting and holding on hold on to the ball as soon as he catches hes either going or hes making a play passing the ball and this is how close this game has been tonight Miamis largest lead right now at four wesler he had a very good first half Miamis doing great on the defensive end right theyre really active with their hands and contested three goes from Jaden shoot Miami a Bright Start to this second half theyve dominated the opening 2 and 12 minutes good turnaround Johnson rolls off the rim no good everything but the Finish oo could have had a little highlight there if he finished that one Virginia Tech missed their first four shots of the first half theyve missed their first four shots of the second half the offense has been slow to get going its a little stagnant looks a little out of wits but a a tough a tough layup by uh by Tyler Johnson freshman lets go against some significant minutes hes going to be big for them next year Johnson the lob Lin kid the Finish Lin kid with a monster slam what a pass by Brandon Johnson a rim rocker gives Lin kid nine points against his former team low to wesler working against kid backs him down nice take off the window and in for two what a move I mean hes had some moves all night I mean he finds that left hand he gets to it hoks had 19 bench points in that first half wesler had eight of them hes near a season in high now with 10 on the nin and a block foul called wesler doesnt agree with it take another look at this a rack attack Lyn kid going against the team he played for for three years has Miami up by two but AJ ston McCrae has picked up the load yeah no he really has hes hitting shots from the outside um hes hitting shots to the inside had a nice pass you know to an open shooter hes shooting the ball very well driving to the hoop using his length finishing over the smaller Defender hes really had a game for himself hes double his season average usually seven points per game tonight already 14 hes at the line here to add to that tally yeah you know it its weird you know Matthew Cleveland was out for a while they struggled early on in the season right you look at a guy um like AJ you know and you say you know you should be this aggressive no matter whos on the court right its its youre only going to be complimentary to um Cleveland Lynn you know now you got a third guy thats super aggressive right you know youre looking at a record that isnt six and 20 its funny to say that because if you had a blindfold on and didnt see the score bug there that has Miami at 6 and 20 and just watch them you would not think this is a 6 and 20 basketball team no not at all and and you know theyve gone through the ringer this year you know with you know the coach leaving um guys being hurt um but when you watch them right they dont look like a 6 and 20 team the past two months theyve been playing really really well St McCrae got it again drill the three hes feeling it leads all scorers with 18 points tonight and Miami has opened up a Sixpoint lead their largest of the night the Miami team that we just mentioned playing better than their record theyre looking for their third straight win here at home Ben Burnham cuts the lead in half with a triple Big Shot Ben right there cutting the lead they needed every every one of those Music buckets Virginia Tech getting a big boost off their bench in this game Burnham wesler and jayen young they have combined for 24 bench points tonight more than half of the Hokey scoring yeah the bench is doing well tonight they just need to continue to grind it out stay close make it make it a you know a a close game when it comes down the stretch the hokes have been a good road team in AC play in search of their fifth conference Road win tonight trailing by three good pump fake Johnson couldnt finish it Burnham digs out the Applause Music rebound Burnham got it again to tie it at 48 backto back threes Ben Burnham Big Shot Ben there he is hes coming alive I told you every time Im here and I watch Ben burnam he comes up with big plays I dont know what it is I might be his good luck charm he is three for three from three Johnson cant answer Burnham pushing the tempo Rex sneer get it back heat check oh out if that one went in I would have I would have went crazy I would have went crazy if that one went in well you established yourself in the first half as the leader of the Ben bam fan club oh absolutely number one fan right here three straight misses from Brandon Johnson who continues to stay aggressive young contested three and its good Jaden young a bench explosion nine nothing run for Virginia Tech and the Hope easy to say theyre number one in the country but theyre my pick to win it all on the womens side yeah you know watching Hannah Hidalgo is is something special she can really do it all out there a shes such a fun watch Saturday night in Coral Gables this one has all the makings of a fun finish its been close and competitive throughout right now Virginia Tech on a 9 nothing run St mccraes had the hot hand misfires there Way Off the Mark just saying the LA the 90 run has been two threes by Ben baram and hes got three defensive rebounds in a row just saying now you have been the Ben Burnham guy all night and what a night to be a Ben Burnham guy that three rims out from Jaden Young its not just Burnham though the Hokey bench combined 30 points 30 points off the pine including 18 of their last 20 have come from the bench bench is coming up big I mean thats sometimes thats what you need right the bench needs to carry it to the Wi shot clock down to seven step back too much on it Applause Miami has gone scoreless for the last three minutes its allowed Virginia Tech to grab the lead here in the second half Jaden young top take finishes at The Rim strong move of two feet finishing at The Rim Jaden young has been has had a great 3 4minute stretch that looked like you that was a vintage MCW take down the lane he stole that for my bag didnt he stolen away Johnson and a foul called to transition feels like Virginia Tech had set the tone defensively and this led to an to the way hoks playing well without him though on an 11 nothing run young misfires out of the timeout good play Cole find the hot guy get him an open look now with potit unavailable right now now and Toby lwow very quiet in this second half its the bench that stepped up in a big way for the hokes 30 bench points and Y potin and L have probably been the two most consistent scorers this season for Virginia Tech so with them quiet The Supporting Cast has stepped up on the road absolutely Ben Burnham a big reason why he stays in attack mode and its been all its been the Ben Burnham show this second half feed my man the rock did you know this was coming listen I I tried to I I tried to tell you guys Ben Burnham is a Difference Maker on this Virginia Tech Team in different moments during the season he comes up really big and Ive seen it time and time again sevenpoint lead for Virginia Tech 13 nothing run and Miami has missed their last six Music shots and now youre requesting replays of Burnham the sky hook looking like a young Kareem out there come Music on you have no relation to Ben Burnham right I just want to no relation no relation I did go to high school with Bo buram though if you know who that is I do not should I hes pretty hey hes pretty big look give him a look 5p Point G Midway through the second half Virginia Tech in control Rex Steiner hands off for Tyler Johnson The Freshman beautiful Lefty laying for two I like his game as well real smooth can do a little bit of everything shoots the ball from the outside and can get to the rim thats a nice take using the left hand Johnson and Hammond have had to grow up quickly in ACC play and when you start two freshman in the back court during conference play its at this point in the season you cant even call him freshman anymore yeah yeah you know I mean theyre theyre well experienced I was been looking for that roll man its been there its been there Ive been looking for that pick and roll the roll guy has been there the guards just havent been able to give him the ball that time gave him a chance was successful on a foul call whats fascinating tonight about Virginia TCH and Toby laow is he comes out shot out of a can and scores the first seven points for the Hoke team and he has not scored since yeah you know its strange you know and in this season its kind of been a thing for him where he goes away a lot of the time and like I said he can have big moments wideopen three Jaden young makes Miami pay and its the largest lead of the night for Virginia Tech hes feeling it hes feeling it Miami only one made shot in the last 6 minutes its an 182 hoky run yeah and its been done on the on the defensive end forcing tough shots even that one thats a tough left hand floater Tech can live with that little double drag screen here oh good moveo Rex Steiner so crafty Rex Steiner that was smooth 34 points in the paint for Virginia Tech Mike young knows this is an important stretch right here these next three minutes a foul do you count it plus the ball or was it a foul on the floor count the bucket Virginia Tech bench which is right next to us screaming that that was on the floor but the officials say count it good move got a good step on Ben Burnham there got to the rim finished Paul Jo Bay giving Miami a boost here backto back buckets for him and a chance to make it a threepoint play here yeah Paul Paul um do hes been playing hes been playing pretty well hes attacks the rim hard hes playing with energy and effort its all you can ask for Miami giving pressure here young into the lane draws the foul J wasnt too happy about that one young has been terrific tonight really the entire bench has but 16 points for Jaden Music Applause Young on the season young just averaging six points per game in the first meeting he had zero points against the Hurricanes when they met in blackburg not tonight this is already a career high for Jaden young Music 18 his previous career best was 14 against Cal can his team hang on to this 10point lead 8 minutes left in the Reg ulation theyve done a nice job defensively shot down to just staying in front of the ball Miami in trouble Johnson I dont think he got it often time shot clock violation great done a great job of doing that so far so good here in South Beach 10point lead 740 left in regulation to the fifth conference Road win of the year for Virginia Tech the hokes have outscored Miami 226 since the Hurricanes had that 4842 lead its been an impressive stretch Jaden young big reason why a career night continues 21 points for Jaden young cant leave him hes hot the Miami came out in the zone lost Jaden young in the corner and he made him pay young already with seven points better than his previous career high tonight Im happy for him hes playing hard hes competing hes having fun out there most important is teams winning we need kin Linn here I think they need to find him these last seven minutes right he should he should touch the ball every other possession young cash app seven of 10 shooting for young five of eight from three the top three leading scorers for the hokes young westler and Burnham three guys off the bench that have set the tone tonight Co coach gave Ben Burnham one sip of water said buddy youre going back in no relation to Ben but uh Bo Burnham who you went to high school with Y Im getting lit up uh that I did not know who he is I did not know that some I should know okay got to recognize L kid he has been quiet in this second half knocks down that free throw playing his former team full court pressure after the free throw make good skip ahead pass young it is his night Jaden young 23 points for Virginia Tech hes just taking what the defense is giving him when hes open hes shooting it when hes not hes driving it to the paint finishing strong every single time hes gone to the paint hes finished strong right right next to the rim defending well its all been working for Virginia Tech in this second half outscoring the Hurricanes 3117 this game was tied at halftime but it has been all hokeys in this second half and what a response by Virginia Tech would you consider the poor off offensive performance they had Tuesday night they have come out and turned that around quickly already 69 points six minutes left to this one Joe Bay off balot and a foul called I dont love that one looked like a little bit of a bailout to me but good drive to the rim got the foul call give a chance to stop this bleeding but how about Virginia Tech on the defensive end I mean weve seen all the shots going on the offensive end but it really a started on this defense Limited the ball from getting into the paint theyre getting steals theyre not giving up offensive rebounds theyre doing everything they need to do on the defensive end to be successful on offense do you feel like as a player the when you get your defensive rhythm going it can lead to the offensive end oh 100 youre getting stops youre getting steals youre getting rebounds Outlets quick um you know you start getting in Rhythm the bench is going for you uh especially when youre away right you take the crowd out of it so it definitely helps you out on the offensive end Music I agree with you it feels like Virginia Techs defense particularly in this second half is the reason that theyve turned what was a close competitive game into a comfortable lead here with under six minutes left in it couple more minutes of good basketball Virginia Tech will have this game wrapped up but still a lot of time left Johnson down the lane ly kid got a piece of it good defensive stop by Lin kid kid desperate for something on the offensive end trying to squeeze it into kid and its stolen away its a timely turnover right there transition three its good thats tough man do you turn the ball over and you dont hustle back on the defensive end youre going to be sitting next to coach if thats the way you uh youre going to hoop big time answer AJ State McCrae boy Miami needed that one Miami needed that one and the ram in the glass hes one dribble to the threepoint line now hes feeling it corner pocket eight ball another three bang and then another Corner Pocket three I mean hes been hot from the outside hes really got it going you talk about a player who has been crushing it tonight brought to you by Crush Jaden young for Virginia Tech and AJ ston McCrae for Miami those two certainly the two top perform warmers deflected inbound it will stay Hokes basketball Miami going full core pressure here their backs against the wall we mentioned earlier they lose this theyre all but mathematically eliminated from ACC tournament contention yep see how Virginia Tech handles his pressure The Freshman finds Jaden Young kick to the corner Burnham it RS in Ben burnam thats his fourth made three of the night hes playing really well for this Virginia Tech Team good job by the Virginia Tech guards to break this press and find an open man in the corner count it plus the foul Paul Joe B hes been a bright spot for Miami in this second half he has theres a kick to Ben Burnham in the corner for three teardrop Music touchup someone from the crowds letting know coach young is doing a great job I love it yeah theres a couple Virginia t uh fans that have made the trip or could have relocated down here this is a home game for them see their home team uhoh good lck Toby lell on a wreck attack there it is thats what weve been looking for all night that pick and roll that lob that lob threat attack the rim you I mean he can put his he can put his chest over the rim the Ws first point since he scored the first seven points for Virginia Tech in the opening four minutes more than a half hour played scoreless for L but a a big time finish there ly kid still working on the inside for Miami its a good move spinning back to the left hand lint kid we need more of that my man pull up three cant connect I think thats been the problem for Miami Michael is theyve flashes everybody has for this Miami team but the consistency so you see it from Lin kid and just playing your strength right like some of the some of the shots that theyre taking can they can get better ones right they just got to play to their strength so something that they really havent been good at we see the big lob right there to Toby lall watch it again as hes looking at The Rim tearing it down Music e e tourament will be here before we know it Virginia Tech a 13point lead on the road in Miami this would be their fifth Road ACC win seventh Conference win overall tough remaining schedule though you still got to go against Louisville and Clemson not to mention North Carolina yeah I mean thats tough going against Louisville and Clemson are are real tough teams just got to battle just got to play get that get that North Carolina win uhoh we got a shoe off here Mike Youngs got the shoe he was about to throw it back to Toby lall instead they blow Play Down I would have like to seen him throw it see me too Id like to see him try to dunk without the shoe on well this win would go a long way in securing Virginia Tech spot in the ACC tournament for Miami itll all but eliminate them theyve got Cooper flag and Duke here on Tuesday if they lose that game thatll do it yeah thats a tough task right there I cant lie I cant lie thats thats a tall thats a Tall Tree to climb oh we got we need a uh you see Mike young there far side of your screen picks up that shoe he was ready he was ready for the assist we need a shot clock on that shoe tie another contested three goes bagging for Miami good defense by Virginia Tech in this second half the the hokes in full control here Less Than 3 minutes too for their fifth Road ACC win oo tough shot right there it almost went down good move desperation time for Miami theyve got a hurry here ston McCrae hes been the bright spot swatted out kept in play foul called on the entry pass to LY kid that was Virginia Techs final foul before the bonus so shooting one and one is Music kid well the good news if youre a Miami fan is you look at what Louisville did this season right you going from the bottom of the league to near the top of the league and in this new world of college basketball you get the right coach in there you give him support with nil and we know Miami can do that and you can bounce back right to the top of the ACC in a year doesnt take a 3 four year rebuild anymore it doesnt it doesnt all you need to do is get the right pieces to the puzzle they need to find a coach they need get some players in here I mean hey youre in Miami its not a not a tough place to recruit for so Im sure theyll get some some transfers they just need to find the right guys great cut re Steiner cant connect on the three and a year ago Louisville was in a very similar position to Miami is now and look at him oh Louisvilles theyre so fun to watch theyre a great team they come in with a great game plan each night Chucky hurn has been leading the charge in that on that team its great to see what pack chelse have done with that Squad and even Virginia Tech I mean theyre only a few years removed from winning the ACC tournament going dancing and a team that program that didnt get a ton of support this season for nil and you know Mike young is got full confidence that they will have the suitable support they need to build a roster thatll compete at the top of the ACC for next Seas and I think with the players theyve had this year particularly the young players like Ben Hammond and Tyler Johnson they have overachieved in League Play for sure and and I like them theyve got a lot of theyve got a lot of reps this year um which will really help them next year Ive said it a few times tonight but when you look at what theyve done on the road in League Play I think that speaks volumes I mean I dont know many teams that are going to have five conference Road wins its so difficult to do it is and it just shows a a bright spot for this team and how well coach Mike young is being able to coach their his guys and have them be prepared on the road Miami looking to hunt to three stolen away Jaden young thats a goal 10 count to two and a career night continues for Jaden young this is a special performance his previous career high headed into tonight 14 points tonight he has 27 hes nearly doubled it 27 points he must have had his wedy last night something some something was going somethings going on you had a good breakfast this morning had some family I dont maybe his girlfriend came to town or something hes performing 27 points for young this is the jayen young game hard foul ly kid he hate to see that going against his former team spent three years in blackburg with the hokes just came down right on his Music tailbone kind of got the I couldnt really see that one it looked like he got the chair pulled from underneath him but he was in the air a little bit just trying to walk it off right now before attempting his one and one oh he just okay his leg just legs just came from underneath him coming up next stick with us nothing but net right here on acc Network Taylor tanon bomb Luke Hancock Joel Barry Carlos Boozer theyll tell you everything you need to know a busy Saturday in the ACC as we get closer and closer to postseason play I think the story in this league right now MCW is the battle for the bottom three you want to be in that top 15 and we saw NC State and BC with their backs against the wall get a much needed win as they try and get themselves out of trouble and keep their season alive yep the battle of the bottom three whos going to whos going to make it everything at the top is pretty much settled I mean that four spots still up their grabs but its really whos going to get in at the at the bottom three and there none of them are easy outs young heat check ooh 30 yeah that would have been for 30 he was going for the 30 Applause clip deep three the other way goes begging and Virginia Tech can run out the clock seemed like Toby was still going up in the air as he got the rebound an impressive bounceback performance after a 58year season low 36 points on Tuesday Virginia Tech comes down to South Beach and Mike Young and the hokes leave with an 8168 win it was know it was a great win by by Mike young and his team it was a a full team effort um young came out hot he was doing his thing Ben Burnham had some good moments uh Toby had some good moments you know it was
