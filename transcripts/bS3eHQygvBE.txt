volume shooter averaging 20 points a game tip off goes the way of the hokes trying to snap a sixgame losing skid while the agies are on a 4 game losing streak trying to snap that here tonight against Virginia Tech and pull off the programs first ever Victory against the hokes malal potit starts it off well though and turns around with a hook shot for the hokes two nothing lead if youre a Virginia Tech fan youve got to like that if you can establish potit down low its going to open everything else up offensively for Mike Youngs group audas hands it off to Shell Ryan Forest leading this team nearly 20 points per game at 199 tried to throw it in Jed cudas turns around no good with the shot clock rolling down and Toby low pulls it down for the Hokey rebound while aent has a couple guys that can go off for 30 plus Virginia Tech has to have a more balanced attack passes picked away Hokies have been victimized by the turnover bug specifically in second half of the last few losses three on the way is good Landon Glasper did not play in the last game for the agies able to hit a three there he was a unanimous First Team all CAA preseason selection yeah averaging just 18 a game this year he is a dyamic score Jaden shoot with a pump fake thought about the three again give inside to potit backing in no good and stepped out of bounds it will stay with Virginia Tech Mike young looking on in his six season as the head coach of Virginia Tech former ACC coach of the year and Mack he has never faltered on his belief in this squad no he liked this team said they were very coachable loved being around them but their margin for error is pretty small and they havent been playing their best basketball yet but he really thinks theyve made good progress Rex Steiner steps inside and that ball got batted saved by Johnson shoot for three I really like his game and and hes got a little bit hes a hes known as a shooter but but he can put the ball on the floor hes a good passer and a very good Defender you see him guarding Glasper right here Jaden shoots coming off of three straight double digit games transfer from duke former highly talented recruit before transferring to blackburg heres a three oh good that was lamuth the Maryland transfer Tyler Johnson making another start for the hokes this is his sixth start of his career outstanding goodl looking freshman can rebound it can defend hes actually a signed guarding Ryan Forest Tyler Johnson knocks down the open three thats something he has not done but is certainly capable of doing now for Johnson that is just his second threepointer this season started out the year 1 for 10 from Beyond The Arc but hes one for one tonight another three wow look at Glasper yeah it doesnt matter it doesnt matter whether youre up on him or not he can just take a tough shot and make a tough shot now between Glasper and Ryan Forest those are two guys that arent scared to take those low percentage shots well I think they think theyre high percentage shots oh wow turn around couldnt get the help off the glass rebound lamuth Ryan Forest stepped out of bounds hoky ball Monte Ross in his second season as the head coach of the agies a former CAA Coach of the Year during his time at Delaware and he was there for a decade got the Blue Hens to the tournament in 2014 he is hes won where ever hes been hes hell do a good job here and he likes to play a tough nonconference schedule theyre going from here over to Liberty on Saturday and uh he he knows that his season in a one bit league is all about the tournament in March Rex Steiner and unable to hit the three but low cleans it up with a jam I know its a cliche but Human Highlight certainly applies to Toby lewow low leading this Virginia Tech Team in scoring at nearly 12 points a game back down to a one possession game Hokes not wasting any time OT got into a bit of trouble and to return it down low instead heres Johnson swatted out of bounds and it will go to Virginia attch after lamuth couldnt keep it yeah you you dont mind two guys going after the ball knocked it out of bounds but thats a good sign for Coach Monte Ross rebounding is going to be a big part of this game for the for AT because Virginia Tech is a little bigger a little stronger Pat wesler into the game for the first time for the hokes gets the ball in an entry lob and immediately scores what a nice play on the Baseline out of bounds Mike young certainly understands the importance of special teams here at Virginia Tech now wesler right at three points per game adding size at 7 feet we saw him hit a halfcourt shot and pregame and already has a layup to start it out well a turnover there for the agies hokes enjoying a 128 lead early on here in blackburg J Tech guard Jaden shot has really been making his Mark here in blackburg since he transferred in from duke but its been quite the journey for him to get here to be playing for the hokes he recently shared a memoir article which which he titled 599 days the significance of that time period well thats the number of days that injuries kept him sidelined from the game he loves most he said when he entered the transfer portal from duke it felt like he had a big question mark next to his name when schools were looking at him when he met with the staff here in blackburg he was down to 180 pounds had a cast on his leg and another in his arm but coach young and Company trusted he would do whatever it took to get healthy and hes done just that theres one thing Jaden said hes taken away from his n 599 days without basketball its to appreciate the little things because youre never guaranteed anything Bailey a great stuff Kendall for Virginia Tech to snap this Kid Jaden sh is the type of player that can lead them out of that and we saw that in moments and specifically in the first half against a ranked pit Panthers team yeah you know hes got the range everybody knows he can shoot it but again hes got more of a diverse offensive game a good passer understands coach Youngs offense and hes a really good fit sometimes you dont get that perfect fit hes a very good fit open cut and a foul its going to go on wesler as now Ryan Forest will go to the line a little back cut action right there hook hes off to a good start especially on the offensive boards four re four offensive rebounds resulting in seven points already for Virginia Tech and that was a big concern of Monte Ross as we as we talked today at shootaround first one good for Ryan Forest something to watch out for the Aggies because of injuries and just overall depth NCA an is not going to go deep into the bench no theyre going to play about eight players and they need to stay out of foul trouble because of that theyve got some people out with injury will Felton a starter and Bryson ogry whos whos played a significant uh uh part of this team early in the season you see AT out of the timeout jump into a two3 Zone they like to play manto man but theyll show that zone and if they dont like the matchups especially theyll play that two3 hokes need to get a shot off Jade young with a prayer did not hit the rim that is a shot clock violation for the hokes and Virginia Tech did not have an answer for the zone now recognized it too late didnt get into their offense and then had to take what ended up being a bad shot El Onis into the game and the paint for the agies see if he can make an impact here against Pat wesler lamuth drives in hes got it yeah the transfer from Maryland didnt play a lot up there really good decision maker and hes kind of the odd man out because of force and Glasper but lamouth can really score two Jen young in the wing off a screen young feeds Rex Steiner for three tipped out by Burnham swing it back to Rex Steiner second chance this time hes got it how many times you see that if you get a second chance the odds go up that youre going to get a really good shot another offensive board for the hokes Aggies trying to answer back with a quick three and instead its Virginia Techs ball Rex Steiner drive inside and an and one yeah coach Ross wont be happy with that youve got to stop the ball in trans position that was a big factor for Virginia Tech tonight because AT can really get out this time Rex ster says well play fast too very nice job of protecting the basketball and kontus with the foul first one for the red shirt freshman from Greece Rex Steiner really in the an enviable an unviable position here for Virginia Tech inheriting this point guard role didnt really think he would be the starting point guard necessarily coming into this season and inherits that its been a challenge for the sophomore yeah I think Brandon rexer always thinks hes going to start hes very very confident young man but you hes got skills hes really a hard worker can really shoot the basketball maybe more of a natural combo guard than a point guard but uh trying to do what coach young needs and and then of course hes been replaced by Ben Hammond as you talked during that uh break Hammond The Freshman from Northern Virginia CIS goes up off of the glass and now 1813 in favor of the hokes C hes going to get some of those just based on the penetration by penetration by Glasper and and Forest Jaden shoot from Beyond The Arc rebound lamuth comes the guard swinging into the Corner Shell steps inside and its an offensive foul on konis yeah little little illegal screen right there he picks up his second and we talked about foul trouble being a big problem for the agies see a little box out foul right there wrestling with potit kot is transferred from Lal after HIIT cudas uh another Greek player had a really nice freshman year last season comes Ben Hammond Burnham return to Burnham hell try his luck from three another offensive board for the hokes yeah t has to do a better job of keeping the hogies from getting that second shot because thats what youre going to get high percentage look either from the outside or you close out too quickly theyre going to kick it inside and potit has an advantage against whoevers guarding him tonight another shot up rims out for lamuth and a foul is called down low on Ben Hammond yeah trying to box out down low nice pass by Hammond and no look nobody fronted potit and the exclamation point after the foul trying to cut into this sevenpoint lead a three to do that and it will count it for Landon Glasper yeah you got to chase that the guy coming up through the middle off of the high ball screen handoff dribble handoff or ball screen either one another good pass down low Ben Hammond had a great feed to Elija potit but he gets hacked and now hell go to the line willll go to break 2016 hokey up by four with 1151 to go in the first half Network mens basketball double header old rival Syracuse and Georgetown Square off for the 100th time at 230 Eastern then Jamir Watkins in Florida State take on two lane in the second game of the auton nation Orange Bowl classic in Sunrise be pretty fun between the orange and the Hoyas 100th alltime meeting Hoya is trying to get the first win since 20122 the old Big East Rivals now did you ever get to coach against them you face off against Syracuse and Georgetown Id never coached against either one of them wow I am shocked I am too I am too as you when you ask that question okis dominating the paint 10 points already already 12 points on offensive rebounds seven of them so far for Virginia Tech yeah 11 overall boards for Virginia Tech make it 12 with that one from Jaden sh as opposed to just three for the agies Burnham pump fake another feed to shoot Loops it across to Young another bounce inside the feeds are there for Virginia Tech a good one from Burnham to Young and then young gets the assist with the dunk from Elijah potit really nice play theyve been posting potit up that time a little screen and roll now the theme for the Aggies trying to snap a four game losing skid of their own just lost a game against UNCC Greensboro now competing in the CAA familiar territory for Monte Ross coached in the ca for 10 years years me the last few years before returning to his head coach position or head coaching as an assistant with temple for three seasons another the rebound for the hokes M with that Miss right there finished the season really strong last year has struggled to start this season for Coach Ross and Burnham Burnham has played against these guys regularly in the CAA coming from the College of Charleston meanwhile Landon Glasper now we talked about Ryan Forest being a big factor in this game to potentially pull off the CAA versus ACC upset but Landon Glasper could be that electric spark for the agies to try to get a win here in Castle he can take over a game now offensively Rodney Brown Jr got open almost accidentally and he didnt waste his opportunity hes been practicing better and better and Coach young putting in a game in a critical time hes only played in four games before this this is his Fifth and he gets a three on his first shot of the ball game Hamond penetrates he has slipped a few times already and just turns the ball over really really quick wide open nobody closes out the transfer from out west bang a defensive mishap there for the agies lamuth looked like he was supposed to be on him there Ill call it down low on Virginia techs Ben Burnham or Ben Hammond excuse me yeah I think it was Hammond holding the cutter holding cam Shell havent heard much from cam shell veteran point guard he and glass were played together at Coffeeville Community College cam shell coming home from Winston Salem really solid point guard step back for Ryan forest and airball a wow was right under it take those contested shots Burnhams not as contested as that still surprised he hadnt had a big game he is just really capable and just hadnt settled into the offense but he hes getting more and more comfortable in my opinion Oki with a diversified attack here all players but two that have entered the game for Virginia Tech have scored its a goal tending called on the hokes so it will be awarded to ncent get this game back within single digits hi cudas gets one I mean you talked about Burnham he had such a great career at the College of Charleston averaged 12 points per game for the Cougars last year and was part of a team that beat Virginia Tech a few seasons ago down the Charleston classic one of the really good multiteam events here goes Burnham with the floater hes got backtoback buckets to fall for Virginia Tech Damen shell Aggies letting Virginia Tech jump out ahead here shell now in the paint and gets the bucket to fall yeah Rex sts got to stay between him and the basket tough matchup Aggies jump into two three zone that zone forc Virginia teeken to a shot clock violation Randon Rex Steiner from PR length hits the rim good job getting back in transition Ryan Forest that is off of the backboard nudus no good Burnham caral it good effort play there for the hokes forward rebound by the agies and itll bring us to a break lots of big shots being taken by both team yeah great range already with 11 points in just over 12 minutes and youve seen a variety of scoring ability 11 points three of five from Beyond the yard for the Junior from fville Arkansas from glasur we have Kendall Williams Kendall yeah guys a really cool story of how Landon glasur ended up as an Aggie his teammate and best friend cam shell signed with Coach Ross back in the spring of last year the Aggies lost a big recruit to another school late in the process and cam came into coach Ross Rosss office and said coach my best best friends better than that guy we just lost a few minutes later coach Ross called up cam Shells best friend Landon Glasper and the rest is history not only is Cam Shaw the leader of assist for this agie team but he assisted in coach Ross Rosss leading score Landon Gasper to get him to NCA andt Bailey thanks Kendall yeah I I gotta say Im lucky to have friends like cam shell that is really cool yeah that that was as as Kendall said a huge assist Burnham on the steel able to Corral it on the rebound Jaden young for three thats been the story of the night ma those Second Chance points are burying the agies yeah hu huge for Virginia Tech and that that was a concern of Coach Ross and his staff and a turnover forced by the hokes yeah Ben Burnham on the defensive end had the nice assist on offense after missing the contested layup one on two but then made a defensive play to get the ball back for Virginia Tech again 15 second chance points scored by the hokes as opposed to just three for North Carolina AT Jaden young feeding the hot hand cant get the bounce rebound lamuth Glasper wow takes a three as Rex Steiner win to the floor hokes dont get penalized for it though got the ball back again Rex St the lob up not sure that was planned and here come the agies with the left hand and hius will go to the line for two its really skilled got a great motor been struggling from the free throw line but uh hes my big PR a little bit of a different situation for him so many international players come over here to prep school or over here to Junior College but he came straight from international basketball to North Carolina ENT and took him a little while last year to get going but very skilled except for this part right here where he shoots less than 40 another two Greek players in CES and hi cudas but Eddy ctis last year had shot 50 from three so far this year hes only taken one and missed it but that can be a a reasonable struggle that a lot of players have from playing that International style of basketball then coming to America and playing college basketball here yeah what hes done is is really pretty amazing hes and hes a versatile big really a stretch forward kind of guy but having to play center with the injuries that the agies have well wow I think the rim was at his ch CH it really is incredible what he does ball goes to the high post back cut along the Baseline and a really nice feed unselfish basketball for the hokes meanwhile an an one answered by lamuth for the agies yeah yeah Im trying to tell you the you know the the guys that get all the headlines ball gets to the high post against the Zone The Zone coverage is all messed up at that point and a really nice Cut along the Baseline might have told a bit of a tall tail there Mack with saying the rim was at his chest but it just seems like that when leow gets up here at Castle that he is going over the backboard yeah he certainly he certainly has his head way up there little exaggeration to make a point thats not all Laughter bad agu with a little bit of a press back to the two three Zone out of the Hokey answer to the Zone here Tyler Johnson got the start got back into the ball game heres potit Here Comes Johnson crashing down gets blocked but the effort was there for the Freshman yeah and they got it right where they needed to poti with a little eightfooter rimmed out Johnson on the offensive glass gets it back for the hokes now hes jumped back in the man of man on the Baseline out of bounds Johnson was open for a second didnt want to take the three Jaden shoot will and nothing but net for the Duke transfer yeah again Mike young designed some stuff on Baseline out of bounds its amazing how what good shots they get and and they can get shot for the player they want when they want it brings us to another break Hokes up 13 Baseline out of bounds set situations and they did a nice job of executing for him Ryan Forest though hes taken a couple of downright pretty crazy shots that weve seen tonight for the Aggies guard and he ctis open on the midrange and airball it Ben Burnham right under it for Virginia Tech Rex Steiner why not it too short followed a shot hit cus on the Baseline able to get it back for NCA and lth Tech doing a good job of contesting those shots theyre making the Aggies take tough shots right now for the Aggies shooting at 435 while the hokes shooting at 45 but shooting a a lot more of them there theres potit hell get fouled and go to the line yeah we talked early in this game about the no r no one really matches up with potit for North Carolina ENT the one who had a chance was cottis and he came in and got two quick fouls so petite going to the charity Stripes so far this year at a 71 clip from the free throw line first foul on H cudas and its good for malal potit so Virginia Tech with a few more nonconference games before returning to ACC play Navy this weekend and up against St Joes at the palestra two for malal potit blro is such a great building and I you know whats interesting about St Joes among many things I still cant get over the mascot flapping its wings the entire time its amazing I mean his lats one of the beat great things in college sports no question Rodney Brown find some open space that was a great unselfish basketball for Rodney Brown Jr feeding it to malal potit for the dunk yeah C certainly could have taken a little floer there but found potit wow wide open Monte Ross the coach for entt was certainly at St Joes for a long time to short Hammonds under it for the hokes rebound another great feed Tyler Johnson skyrocketing to the hoop Oki sharing the basketball and the main thing theyre doing bayy is playing great defense timeout called by NC and hokey up thanks to the dunk from Tyler Johnson and malal potit bracket preview with Team breakdowns and comprehensive analysis the ACC has sent at least nine teams to a bowl game since 2016 Oki playing in the Dukes Mayo Bowl against Minnesota on January third meanwhile back here on the basketball court Hokes enjoying a bit of a run here no points in 2 and A2 minutes for the agies and Pat wesler hits another layup thats his second of the game good job adjusting through some contact down there we around the arc Glasper lost the ball Brown pokes It Forward Hammond a dribble and the Finish wow the seeg parted for Ben Hammond to lay it up uncontested Oki have it going in transition 4926 Virginia Tech enjoying now a 23point lead Jason Murphy into the game for the first time hasnt played a ton for the agies and now NCA an answers with another turnover and again you mentioned balent scoring for Virginia Tech potit the only hokey in double figures with 11 but now everyone who has came into the ball game for Virginia Tech has scored a big part of this 130 run turn to the top of the key for Hammond heres Burnham turns around lamuth slapped the ball away shell feeds Glasper a block from Ben Burnham wesler came in to crash jump ball and possession arrow keeps it with NCA and there a nice block right there in transition looked like Glasper was going to get an easy look watch The Hustle from behind Burnham clean block and then the jump ball so back with the agies now meanwhile Ryan Forest only has one point in this game so before the shot itll be a one and one one coming up for NCA and Burnham trying to cut off the penetration so Virginia Tech trying to snap a sixgame losing skid North Carolina AT on a four game losing Applause streak missed the front end of the one and one and wesler pulls down the rebound almost an 80 free throw shooter not much going right for the agies here late in the first half big part of the reason why Hokes out rebounding the agies 2410 Ben Burnham threes are dropping for the hokes mack thats their eighth three of the ball game yeah that thats something that Mike Youngs team has have always done well theyve struggled with that a little bit this season Ryan forest was open for the three instead takes it inside and hits the bunny shot for now 5228 a 24 Point deficit yeah forest with just his just three points in this half came in averaging 20 so that shot from forest stops the 160 run rodie Brown bounce the ball back to wesler but not before a hit the Baseline Brown followed up that shot but lost it out of bounds as you Saul Now this the agies team doesnt have had a lot of depth unfortunately with the injuries and just the the players that Monte Ross wants to bring into the ball game this is an athletic team we saw some moments against a team like ECU where they really hung tough with the Pirates now tonight it certainly has not been their night here in the first half these shots are just not going in yeah quick fast but they dont have a lot of size and Virginia Tech is pretty much stronger at most positions too we saw the big difference down low with with potit Burnham having a little success wesler with his size has been good Johnson has been good all the hes have really rebounded the basketball very well ores sinks the first free throw of the one and one and able to bounce both through like you mentioned dominating on the backboard shooting 40 from long range over 50 from the floor and taking care of the basketball so Jaden shot jogs in for Virginia Tech and wesler goes to the bench what the hokes can do to end the first half here its been a productive one for Virginia Virginia Tech balanced scoring effort crashing the boards for the rebounds shot clock down to 10 Hammond penetrates inside picks it up and he walked hes never really got settled on that looked like they expected Zone then called a manto man play never really got into it entt see if they can something to close this half but theyve dug themselves a big hole 22 down 17 seconds final possession of the first half down 22 see what Landon Glasser can do here for the aies in cudas puts it on the deck goes up and somehow gets that layup to fall hoki trying to Chuck one at the buzzer if it goes in it will not count it didnt go in anyway but still a good first half for Virginia ATT Tech ma 5232 the offense starting to click first half hokes did a really good job individually against him shoot had him some uh Johnson had him some Jaden young had him some uh the hokes did a really nice job against uh against their best scores Rex Steiner a point guard has started out here in the second half hoks trying to snap a sixgame losing skid up 20 at the half against the CAA North Carolina AT agies tipped around almost got it to stick back in from Johnson but a rebound from Glaser yeah you you talk about Glasper he had 11 points in the first 12 minutes none in the last eight of the first half shell draws a foul wow that is not going to count for the agies but hell get the style points from it yeah thats still a highlight yeah so i got to give it to him I had to look up at the scoreboard like did they count that no they did not but still lot cam Shells a really good player not not known as a big score but but just does a has a calming effect on this basketball team then Burnham gets called for the foul there laow now has three p personal fouls for Virginia Tech and a semi highlight there Mac for the hokes L is the leading scorer for Virginia Tech he really hasnt played much tonight no a lot a lot of people you know Burnham came in Off the Bench took his spot for a while and and was very productive but but again the balance scoring for Virginia Tech was a big key coming into this game and uh proved to be fruitful for Coach young in the first half still though 10 minutes for four points for L with four rebounds as well just has three personal fouls now Ryan Forest hits both free throws and now makes it a 5234 game as the hokes navigate through the press a will press anytime theres a dead ball try to mix things up defensively Tyler Johnson AGs in the two3 zone okis had trouble at times with that zone from the agies look at the shot clock now down to six now theyve matched up manto man Rex Steiner with a shot clock running down gives it to Johnson and gets it off the glass right before the buzzer sounds another assist another high percentage shot Forest front rim no good good job by Tyler Johnson on the defense right there lamuth cant hit the three Burnham comes in cant snag the rebound of Virginia Tech Corrals at Courtesy shoot Burnham rightwing three tipped around almost followed his shot but hi couis Will gallivant up the floor for the agies misses the layup had numbers right there got all the way to the rim lost his balance a little bit another tip ball hi kudus after the missed layup comes back with the defense there forces the turn over Glasper gets blocked and it stays on this side of the Court here with the ncent agies here it is defense comes across and a really nice pass to the Freshman through the inbound Johnson gets called with a foul forse going back to the free throw line horse can take those long jump shots but but he is a a true thre level kind of score gets to the rim has a midrange gets fouled a lot a correction actually that foul was called on malal potit to make that his second personal foul pooki already have three fouls here and the first minut 53 of the second half for has shot twice as many free throws as anybody else on this team its kind of like for Virginia Tech dominating the amount of free throws is malal potit and Toby low who we have not seen much tonight Johnson The Freshman gives to potit back of the iron Here Comes forest in the agies forest lost the ball got it back Kitty cudas fouled on his way to the 10 yeah Monty Rosss team will never will never quit they they always will play hard even when theyre not playing well they continue to give great effort he has sold this group he had sold this group on the fact that they need to just keep improving because its a one bid League nice Hustle by H cudas coming down to get the follow sophomore from East thats a little ninky Applause grease and this is the second of two the to he can down theyve theyve kind of been matching out of their Zone theyll go through with some Cutters makes for some interesting mismatches Jaden shoot out of a double team throws the ball away Forest now lost the ball but a foul called on Jaden shoot yeah and it has confused the hes offensively they show Zone but theyre really playing manto man with Cutters so Tech with five fouls in the second half and with that that FR Im say line change for the hokes good hockey reference Im going to a game on Saturday youre really weird Ron o dogs all right yeah that was pretty fun now dont ask me any strategy behind hockey Here Comes B Hammond for the hokes h cus with another nice move right there see the eight the Aggie show Zone dont go through with that cutter wesler lost the ball shell to Glasper for three Glasper again find and shell lamuth will try it still no good and Jaden young pulls down the board the hokes in the second half three turnovers for Virginia Tech hes have only hit one bucket so far getting out scored seven to2 here in the second half but the offensive board for Burnham goes inside and a charge bur got the offensive rebound but bad decision on the drive to the basket sloppy start for Virginia Tech in the second half thats our big lead at the half but t is like you said theyre theyre a scrappy bunch a competitive bunch and then that unfortunately has been a story for the hokes this year with solid first halfs you can think about games like Michigan and even as recently as the pit game on Saturday and then unfortunately for Virginia Tech a bit of a flat uh pattern here in the second half of recent from youth on the Tippi and on the backside all of a sudden down to a 13point lead Burnham from the free throw line down to wesler finds it with a left hand wler feels like a big bucket for the hokes to try to calm down this run oh my goodness he got a full Palm on that block Ben Burnham a foul called on Virginia Tech so a huge block for the hokes up by 15 what a block this was Mac in transition good hustle for the College of Charleston transfer Ben buram with a block capitalize on a slow start in the second half for Virginia Tech right now North Carolina aent outscoring Virginia Tech in the second half 94 Hokies have turned the ball over a few times and have now racked up seven fouls Mack to no fouls for the agies in the second half theyre going to be shooting free throws for a long time and as aggressive as they are offensively that could lead to lead to some points Ryan Forest missed the free throw the one andone opportunity there but he has scored four quick points after only having five in the whole first half Brown Junior second three of the game wow like you mentioned limited play in time it only played 11 minutes coming in but again have been practicing better hes a guy that played every game last season for cow now coming in hadnt played much for Virginia Tech starts in or doesnt start in this game but comes off of the bench and makes an impact Here Comes Hammond on his steel and finishes with the layup another big basket right there Hammond with a just a really good Defender shell finds lamuth lamuth hooks with a right hand doesnt get a piece of the rim rebound Brown theres Hammond goes inside finds Brown another three keep feeding the hot hand the reaction love to see a guy work hard and get the reward in the game knocks down the Baseline three 6441 Hokes lead back up to over 20 points Drive in scooping with the layup cant get it to fall energy right now tilting back to Virginia Tech for for one for eight now from the floor scored seven points from the free throw line though look at that steel Mack Ben Hammond has been promising here in this game look at that feed yeah jump really nice pass they had the numbers they were five on forward he found the open man wide open open into the corner Rodney Brown at lesler with the left hand able to sink the first free throw and Hammond you said earlier mck a true point guard he has had flashes to some really great moments in this game yeah be getting again another guy thats getting more and more playing time off the bench more and more comfortable takes those freshmen a while to understand the the speed and physicality of this division one basketball ball and the freshmans got four assists look at the lob inside to hi cudas magies are going to need more of that we a good passes from a point guard cam shell with beautiful assist to the Big Greek so that ends an 110 run for Virginia Tech Brown returning the favor with Hammond and the point guard knocks down the open three how about that return the favor Id say been inside for Forest under the backboard rebound Brown Hammond into the front Court up at the rim and the Freshman will take a trip to the line nice decision right there by hmond realized the defense was backing up he had an advantage and he went ahead went to the rim and now gets to go to the free throw line 10 out of 15 on the season he got a good looking free throw stroke now for Hammond that basket right there on the free throw ties a career high he had eight against Michigan he struggled from the field so far this year just shooting at 20 or 21 coming into this game now for Ben Hammond hes three for three in this game on field goals yeah a lot of that is just realizing when and where to shoot so there is the career high now its nine Hammonds got nine points as well as four assists for the hokes wow coming back in let see if he can get started a little bit for the hokes kind of a theme tonight L hasnt played much but the hokes have had such a balanced effort that really the two big breakout stars have been Brown and Hammond swing it into the corner Glasper layups cant fall right now for NCA and T yeah theyre kind of getting the ball where they want to right now but still cant make shots poies are at least contesting the shots Rodney Brown into double Figures its an amazing story didnt have that on my bingo card for tonight 11 points for the Cal transfer and an 182 run for Virginia Tech Glasper wow make it 185 run mat has range timeout 7246 hokey up big in the second half week at ESPN a time when we partner with the V Foundation to highlight the urgent need for cancer research this is gamechanging research that help save lives you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research here comes Glasper under hands the shell Hokes on an 185 run looking for the alleyoop hudis cant get it to go and a foul will bring us right back to another break so hi cudos going to the line 7246 still up big hey you played that perfectly that only played 11 minutes all year has played 14 and have they been productive for him here tonight with 11 points on four out of five shooting three out of four from long distance and M before this hes averaging half a point a game hes only played in 11 minutes all season like you said he was 0 for two from Beyond The Arc and hes hes already hit three threes in one game tonight and again this this is why you practice this is why you keep getting better this is why you put in the extra work with the coaches and its paying off for this young man and for Virginia Tech basketball and it is interesting with just how college basketball and really all of college sports has evolved now MC where youre learning about your team a little bit later into the season because all these new transfers that come in right after the the season before this the coaches are learning the players are still learning how to play with each other and what the coaches want out of them talked about pleasant surprises Ben Hammond has to be included in that conversation as well Hammond now with nine points and four assists Ls open wanted to follow his shot he didnt even need to Mac that went right through the 10 no but thats still thats thats a still still a good thing he he has really worked on his threepoint shooting but you always assume that shots going to miss just in case especially when you rebound like Toby low alonis back into the game for the first time since the first half Glasper draws a foul and it goes on Hammond thatll be his second we talked about the aies getting in the bonus early but this is the first time theyve been back to the free throw line in a while J Tech did a better job of not fouling during that that 15 minute to the 10minute Mark Tyler Johnson back into the game Brown and Hammond after a productive shift go to the bench for the hokes Johnsons had a good game too hes played well defensively seven points three rebounds but hes been very active on the defensive in either either drawing Glasper or Forest as his assignment and Glasper sinks both free throws Glasper still leading the way for North Carolina AT now with 16 points and cus the other player in double figures for the agies and a quiet night for Ryan Forest still on the floor hes one of nine from the field hes hit seven free throws though wesler out of a double team tried to navigate through it and the sophomore from Matthews North Carolina takes a trip to the line yeah KY ontis picks up a third foul hes really had limited playing time tonight because of foul trouble picked up two quick ones in the first half ACC PM with Mark Packer and Taylor tab bomb weekdays at 4 Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app lot to talk about in the ACC between football basketball and big news down in Chapel Hill Mack so with Bill bellich returning to coaching now I know he didnt take as big of a a Hiatus from coaching that you might have if you get a new job but does that mean that you are interested in coming back to coach again if uh if the compensation is Comm Laughter yeah I love doing these games yeah this just in Laughter folks yeah that was a big surprise it sure it sure uh is an indication that the the Tar Heels are serious about college football isnt it and particularly potentially building a pro style model and is that where college sports go in the future its already headed that way teams hiring General man managers paying players and no salary cap heres Pat wesler from the line heres lewow theres three players around Toby laow gets his own board and an A in one see what we talked about assume that shots going to miss especially if you rebound like Toby lwow so low going for the oldfashioned threepoint play transfer from London England just Elevate above everybody and go backup through the physicality and finishes off that aention oldfashioned threepoint play so the Hoke is enjoying a 28point lead now and thats the theme of the day you see that there 219 and second chance points the Hokey leading that battle low with 10 points and six rebounds now UDA spinning on lewow cant get the layup to go and a rebound clapped into the hands of Johnson KY cudas has 11 and six of his own Johnson gets pickpocketed and then a foul called on him on the effort to get the ball back yeah lamu did a nice job right there and hes going to go to the free throw line on the other end and nearly an 80 free throw shooter and the agies have have now jumped into the double bonuss headed for a double double nine points and nine Music rebounds hes kind of The Unsung guy with with guys like Glasper and Forest out there scoring 20 a game heres Sunday afternoons ACC womens basketball triple header Miami and pit starts us off at noon Eastern then number 14 North Carolina host number 25 Georgia Tech at Carmichael Arena and we finish up with loyal McQueen and Clemson taking on Wake Forest Georgia Techs off to a great start North Carolina off to a great start thats a big early season battle a lot of teams in the AC see MAAC enjoying success five teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference in womens basketball in the AP Top 25 hokes just took on a team and the top 25 as hi cudas dunks at home and the top 10 Duke Co law and down and Durham as the Blue Devils poised for something great this year its going to be a really interesting year for basketball on the womens side as well as the mens side here in the ACC Rex Steiner Ls got the rebound Second Chance three for Jaden shot another rebound this time Johnsons got it hes didnt call same team there shoot misses again wesler trying to track it down down and the ball goes to North Carolina AT I think they overruled it and gave it back to the H gotcha so the hokes will have another chance on this possession Hammond back in the ball game for the hokes 15 on the shot clock hoki slowing it down just a bit more here need a little more sense of urgency right here wesler dribbles pump fake up and he gets it to go with the foul Patrick wesler another bucket falling for the red shirt sophomore one into double figures clock running down lays up hiy cud is trying to put the body on him wer says wait room Pat wesler is locked in and wesler has been a part of this program now three years he does have an ability to make an impact on this team hes got a nice shooting touch certainly his size is always a factor we saw him warming up in pregame and was hit a Hal time or a half court shot with ease for the hokes havent seen him shoot a three yet here today or this season or this season I think in his career he has ability to do so so giving the ball back to the Aggies 8255 hokes up big with less than eight minutes to play Music at this losing skid and Ben Hammond we talked about the surprises thats been the theme of the second half Hammonds been another Pleasant one for the hokes yeah perfect from the field nine points four assist an outstanding Defender good decision maker and a career high so Hammond now with nine points hes got four assists a lot of those feeding Rodney Brown Jr couple players in double figures for Virginia Tech ma Rodney Brown Patrick wesler has a career high and look like we talk about him Ben Hammond immediately gets the steel and feeds Rodney Brown two of the real pleasant surprises for Mike Youngs Bunch this a this this evening look at that tip back in wesler got 13 13 points four rebounds and and in just 13 minutes hes been efficient for wesler five of six right now for 13 points a career high for Pat wesler cam shell went out with something happened to his hand tipped away here comes Hammond right on Q now hes in double figures 11 for Ben Hammond the MTH we talked about him having to to be the backup point guard due to all the injuries meanwhile the answer from Ryan Forest coming in with a right hand I think there was a little frustration in that dunk he has not had the night he expected to have with that dunk puts him into double figures Brown was wide open cant hit the left wing three and maai pulls away the rebound for its just two for 10 and again a lot of that has to do with really good individual defensive play by Virginia Tech backing in and the foul with the bucket for J Jonathan lamuth yeah the Maryland transfer hes out of Baltimore Mar defense was at a disadvantage and he played right through the contct able to get the bucket to fall lamuth now with 10 points make it 12 actually trying to make it 13 with his free throw and cant do it wesler got the defensive board M normally a good free throw shooter only two for five tonight ZIP down low for Johnson got the ball the high post Johnson takes the midrange no good oh Johnson knocked down is first three early in the game and look who made the play another steal hell get the ball into the front court now steps back for three what a sequence for the Freshman still perfect Ben Hammond is going off tonight five for five from the field and hes got two threes to go along with it contested jumper able to get down for Ryan Forest but the effort play there for Ben Hammond and a spark hokes might need to close out December we said two teams on losing streak we said one of them would leave here very happy pretty clearly its going to be Virginia Tech tonight Jaden shot misses the three as it goes in and out maai with another rebound lost the ball almost picked away again for it backing in on Brown spins air ball and here comes Applause Brown Jane shoot steps into a three Glasper transition three in and out and brown decides to slow it down this the Steph Curry effect now as a coach who who coached before Steph Curry Splash onto the scene you see a sequence like that with some open threes just miss back and forth how does that make you feel Laughter confused able to hit the midrange though with the shot clock falling down Rodney Brown continues his great night play with a lot of confidence this would really be a big boost for the Hokies to find another scoring threat four minutes away from snapping the losing skid as the ball pops out inches away from an an one but the hokes are up 30 Mack and Ben Hammond is feeling it for the hokes the steal the save and the reward for the defensive effort hokes and their fans enjoying a 9161 lead with 353 left to go in the game leading scores for Virginia Tech look at this Mac Ben Hammond Patrick wesler and Rodney Brown Jr all three of them in career highs tonight yeah raise your hand if you have Virginia Tech getting 51 points Off the Bench wow well my hand isnt raised so yeah we didnt have the camera on me but let everybody know nobody hand hands were raised Glasper leading the way for North Carolina entt hes got 22 lamuth now with 13 after that free throw as Monte Ross looks Applause on now Ryan Jones Jr enters the ball game for Virginia Tech interesting look for the hokes now with Rex Steiner and Hammond on the floor yeah I like that lineup Rex Steiner really comfortable playing off the ball looking for a shot a little bit more rather than running the team heres Jones taking the three even though that one didnt go in Mac The Hokey threepoint performance certainly propelled them tonight among other things hitting 13 threes and certainly a a category they have struggled in throughout the six game losing streak yeah first Miss of the season for Jones in limited playing time now so far for Jones this year hasnt played many games and weve seen that as a theme tonight Rodney Brown had played sparingly off of the bench for Virginia Tech Hammond trying to stay perfect and he does six for six from the field how about Ben Hammond 17 points for the Hokey guard coming off of the bench four assist five steals about you that sheet stuffer I had to be careful with that those mistakes cost money Mac thatll be ready Conor serin coming into the game for Virginia Tech Johnson goes out so emry hokei that has entered up to Ryan Jones and Connor cin has scored so see if the hokes can have that really coveted balance score sheet here Brown dribbled in lost the ball you know the fans are hoping for that century mark now H hes trying to get to 100 for the first time this season Im saying yes yes Forest turns around serving got Applause it Eastern Michigan transfer heres Hammond trying to stay perfect instead feeds Rex Steiner Rex Steiner from the free throw line cant get it to go Im retracting my prediction Forest pump fake dribbles inside foul called its a block on Ryan Jones Jr Forest having a little bit better luck here in the second half but just hasnt had his normal night averaging 199 coming into tonight going to the free throw line hes been hes two for 12 from the floor F bounces out oh basketball this weekend here in blackburg so the mens team taking on Navy at noon and then womens basketball squaring off against Radford at 400 pm so the New River rivalry the Sharkies Bowl going to be played all the Virginia Tech fans and potentially Radford fans tuning in get that one Mike Maguire team pick second in the Big South not off to a very good start Navy with Ed dellis former East Tennessee coach and former Penn State coach so Conor Venable goes to the line for three him and Peter Carr entered the game and hit the first free throw for the sophomore from Washington DC so this is a season high in points for Virginia Tech you see the bench imploring this shot to go in K do Kan have the hat trick Music here all encouragement though its a 9464 game none of those guys are seated for this it looks like for shooting Jane young theyll be an appropriate ribbing should he missed this shot though got the last one applauses there for the hokes and a smile for Conor Venable one minute to play one minute to play Ben Hammond still on the floor for the hokes trying for one last defensive stop here Rees handing it off to Murphy for the dunk so will Ben Hammond end the night on a perfect note he went six for six from the field see if he gets another shot up instead itll be Jones back iron freshman cant knock it down shot clock is still on Murphy out of the double team and a foul called Murphy the rossberg state transfer getting a little action here toward the end of the game yeah started his career at NJIT went to Frostburg State now in his second year with North Carolina t as the agies have been in the double bonus seemingly since the second half started ma yeah got into about seven minutes into the half didnt really take advantage of it Murphy sinks the second free throw shot clock off and Hammond dribbles away and that is going to do it so the sixgame losing streak now over as Virginia Tech answers with a convincing Victory 9567 the story for Virginia Tech most points since November 19th 2023 where they had
