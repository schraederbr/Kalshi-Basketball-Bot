in the losing music effort against Sienna Khalil knocked down three triples in that effort Game two of the season for both these clubs and the opening tap controlled by Moila and Georgia Tech The Yellow Jackets a 56 52 triumph on Monday in overtime against Maryland Eastern Shore in an early whistle in the opening possession as Mustaf hits the floor and weve got a foul coming here on Quincy Allen Yeah Georgia Tech Um you know with Dongo back on the floor itll be interesting to see WY how they adjust Thats a power duo right there with Moila and Dongo Great size and length and theyll be tough to score on on the defensive side of the ball as well on the interior Back to the top Jason Mustaf Cam Craft drains a three One of the reasons they brought him here was for his threepoint shooting Hit 97 threes against Miami of Ohio as now Bryants got the ball for their first possession Yeah he knocked them down in a 43 clip with Miami of Ohio last season Thats his specialty and coach starter recruited to that that he wanted to address the out outside shooting See the starting lineup for Bryant among those five names four countries represented and Daniel Aqui draws the foul there from Bongo Awi out of Gabone in Africa Keegan Harvey Australia as we said Tim Rodski out of Russia Bulldogs got great size and length average uh size in the starting five 67 Uh they theyre going to be a pretty solid defensive team with that size and length But again they are young Theyre going to take some time to gel and get tutored by coach Christian And Aqua has it knocked loose in a turnover Good hands by Jaden Mustaf with the help from Bongo But to your point John this is a Bryant team that you look at what they accomplished a year ago Theyre America East champs second NCA tournament for the second time in four seasons But of the players on last years team only one of them is here tonight Aaron Davis whos coming off the bench Moila nearly had a highlight reel dunk You see Georgia Tech starting lineup by Dongo plugged in as Chaz Kelly will now come off the bench for Georgia Tech Inbounding from the baseline Shot clock adjustment Seven to shoot Craft flashes open a second three around and out Had a good look at it Well executed on the baseline out of bounds play Just missed it One of the questions for coach Jaime Christian to Bryant was how are they going to handle the ball pressure A true freshman point guard tied to Balis floats it high off the window Just missed And now Cila with the rebound Kick out Reeves a corner three Thats short And now Bryant on the break Threeon one Rodovski two hand jam There you see the athleticism the speed He the agility at 610 He gets out and pushes the floor Had some nice bounce on that Another foul coming here on Tai Tales One more look here at Tim Rodski from Moscow Russia Yeah And although a freshman hes 21 years of age Uh so he does have some maturity Hes got a little meat on the bones been in the weight room Uh but hes uh tremendous athlete and hes a face up player at 6 10 6 10 and a half He faces the basket and attacks from the wing Mustaf gets it off to Ree Good hands and length from Rudowski An overhead pass and Mustaf trying to save it Taps it out of bounds You mentioned the length and size for this Bryant team I think both these teams hoping to turn the ball over less often than what we saw in their first games but these defenses are prone to disrupting passes Bryant had 20 turnovers in the loss to Sienna which led to 27 points Uh so thats certainly an area of concern that was addressed here in the last couple days in practice Quincy Allens three off the Mark Dongo goes down hard Head coach Damon Statenomire in his third season and after that win on Monday night John he was again it wasnt pretty but he made no bones about it He felt like this his team would not have won that game the last two years but theyve won it this year Yeah the the resiliency of just then to hang in there Uh down one with about 7 seconds to go and and they were able to you know get Payton Marshall to get fouled He knocked down the first missed the second went to overtime and they found a way to get it done And big to big passing there as Dongo feeds CILA pair of big men from Sagal Thats two times now weve seen you know the missed lob but its the high low action post to post and thats got to be uh addressed from Bryant on the defensive side No penetrating passes into that high post thats already hurt them twice Another threepoint try to Balis off the mark You know Brian their their goal is to take about 50 of their shots from threepoint distance as Craft has it knocked loose Rodskis everywhere at that length Yeah plays hard gets scrappy You know hes kind of surprising hes hes quick Hes got that fast twitch muscle fiber working Dongo facing up Reeves rattles out Keegan Harvey the board So far in the first three and a half minutes both teams taking better care of the basketball Just havent hit their shots That one wont fall for Rodski And Bryant starting one for seven Oh of four from three And a foul coming here Is that going to be on Tales It sure is Thats his second See Mavis and Williams checking in and Georgia Tech providing some relief to Mustaf and Reeves So a Kai Fleming in for Georgia Tech along with Jazz Kelly There you see head coach Damen Christian First year at Bryant but his fourth different division one head coaching job Hes only 43 years old And Craft a little out of control and it trickles out of bounds Bryant basketball Well step aside for the first time tonight Georgia Tech a 52 lead over the Bryant Bulldogs music Get out Georgia Tech and Bryant on a Friday night and Jamie on Christian in his 11th season as division one head coach Heres a look at his journey First year at Bryant coached at his alma mater Mount St Marys for seven seasons then Sienna for a year George Washington for a handful and then Hakanestro Trieste a professional team in Italy the far northeast reaches of the country and for Jamon Christian that was quite the experience for him This past summer hes coaching the Italian Professional League and then hes recruiting the roster at Brian I was talking to him pregame for a little bit I said How did you get that job How did you end up in Italy and he goes Believe it or not I had the GM on a on my podcast earlier that year We built a relationship and it ended up being parlayed into that gig Well they had their best year in 30 years under coach Christian this past summer And meanwhile his assistants along with coach Christian working feverishly trying to build a roster Quincy Allen one of their biggest additions to this group for and black Hes the preseason all America East player and right on Q and Alley to Quincy Allen He is a tremendous athlete Nice touch on the pass but that was well executed Good patience on the offensive side of the ball Craft catch and shoot wont fall Quincy Allen played at Chicago State last year He was a top 100 recruit coming out of high school Trying to see if they can unlock some of his potential and turn it into production And we got a foul on the rebound going to be on Reeves Thats our bigger part Thats going to be on Keegan Harvey excuse me right there Well above the rim Uh beautiful play on the screen on the back side of the defense Got it done And we know Bryant theyre a team that wants to shoot the three but John theyre having more success attacking into the lane Yeah I think uh attacking inside out The size the length of this team Uh thats got to be an area of focus for them on both sides of the ball is playing big Mai Fleming the freshman bullseye cheering Theres a look at your keys John Bryant needs to limit their turnovers Box out Yeah absolutely Uh I think turnovers in this one theyve got to find a way to take care of the ball They had 18 turnovers against Sienna leading to 23 points And so valuing the basketball is going to be crucial for Georgia Tech again inside out and then throw the ball in to Dongo Cila uh and and lets lets see what happens off of that Pton Marshall picks up the foul Quincy Allens got three free throws We were mentioning Chicago State last year finished the season really strong Prior to that he was at James Madison and before that he spent two years at Colorado and there you can see fifth year averaged about 10 and six last year preseason all conference selection but hes battled so many injuries over the course of his college career They feel like hes fully healthy and has a chance to have a big year in the America East Yeah he can be the leader on this team and hes only guy on the floor I believe with NCA tournament experience as well during his time at JMU Yeah its hard to believe its his fifth year John but only the 41st game he has played I mean hes averaging 10 games a year with all those injuries Davi Remagan leaves it short Point guard coming in from Germany for Georgia Tech We got a whistle away from the ball The foul coming here on Reagan Both teams getting to the bench with the substitutions early on in this one Coach Christian played uh 10 guys significant minutes in the loss at Sienna And uh we know coach startmire as well plays nine 10 guys So uh musical cheers right now six minutes into this one Well and thats the hope too with with the depth theyve assembled with this group And its one of the reasons coachar feels like they can be a little more aggressive defensively playing further up the floor because of that depth And another foul coming Its on Daniel Aqui And a foul before the inbound Got a foul off the basketball Foulson Okay I was going to say I think Jahe Naam was on the floor saying its going to be on Aaron Davis Yeah Davis uh you know got his arm in there and impeded the progress on the back door cut The stiff arm Flemmy trying to go baseline Nearly lost control of the basketball Thats one way to create for yourself Yeah Fleman you saw the athleticism there though Uh you know hes got great length good size athleticism and he changed the the ball to his left hand there Hes got to be a good player Just needs minutes needs to get seasoned but hes a guy that can score the basketball Spent last year at overtime elite just up the road here in Atlanta and missed most of his season with a knee injury had knee surgery in December rehabbing from that and this weeks the first time hes had a chance to get back to game action in nearly a year Yeah he was a three star prospect coming out Was ranked number 17 nationally among all shooting guards And prior to overtime elite he played locally at Osborne High School up in Marietta Georgia not far from Pavilion Part of that freshman class thats ranked in the top 20 for Georgia Tech And you know with Fleming in particular youre talking about a lot of bounce a lot of length some good shooting only going to get better the more confident he becomes in that knee He hits the second free throw Nine to6 lead for Georgia Tech Leo Williams at the point for Bryant Kelly trying to force him left Rodovski top of the key three A good read by Chaz Kelly Let that one go Yeah that was a nice close out by Reeves to get a hand up on Rodovski Hes got great length You got to look at him there 99 A real high release But Reeves with the close out Nice defensive play You walk away from that win on Monday night over Maryland Eastern Shore as Kelly pops a three air ball And obviously Georgia Tech felt like offensively they have much better than what theyve showed What do you think the key is for them unlocking their offense Well its a its a new group of guys but I think the the faster tempo they can play and usually thats manufactured with good defense So you know was that a sea by dongo block at the rim outlet and and the wings got to get out and run These guys are super athletic Mustaf is a 64 point guard who playing downhill thats his strength So I I think pace of play is important for this Yellow Jackets team to manufacture some easy offense Reeves another guy that can get out and run Plays above the rim able to disrupt that pass But early in the season sometimes it takes you know a few games some film sessions where the coaches can really get in and coach and teach and stress the importance of you know running lanes hard keeping your spacing I mean its a game of inches but uh the details matter Thats the home run pass intercepted Dongo looking to face up on Aquel Brian has been able to slow the tempo this game in a zone You know they matched up zone and Kesi Reeves count the basket Hell go to the line for one more It was a tough shooting night for Kesi last time out Nice job taking it here Yeah it a super finish and he he played to his strength there He knew he had the quickness advantage and put it on the on the deck and gets to the rim It was a high IQ play right there Did not settle for the shot He struggled the other night Youre right He was uh one of his first 10 I believe from beyond the ark And but he just stuck with it and he hit a huge threepointer late in that one Really allowed Tech to pull out of there with a win Yeah I think that goes in the books as a gamewinner Yeah And I think for him it just showed the confidence he has in his shot He a lot of reps in the off season and the belief of his coaching staff He kept shooting playing in his 100th career college game tonight Kuesi Reeves stretch the Yellow Jacket lead to six Tobales tries to get around Mustafo over to help Aqui from the top of the key No dongle with the board Hes pressured Itll be Georgia Tech basketball And with that miss the Bulldogs now 0 of eight from beyond the arc And that was a strength coming into this A key to the game for Georgia Tech was defending the threepoint stripe Theyve done that Uh but this a team that knocked down 10 triples in their opener at Sienna They shot 45 from three in that loss to Sienna They shot a lower percentage inside the arc Like you said they have not gotten off to a good start 0 of eight And theyve had six different players try a three Hadnt just been one guy Craft gets the ball screen penetrates Roll wont go The battle for the board Dong goes on top of Aqui and a jump ball thatll belong to Bryant Was a nice job by Graph just getting into the paint A little change of pace Eyes were on the target He missed missed the shot but hes got good size Hell be able to do that in pick and roll situations and hes going to get respect beyond the arc So the ability for him to get to the basket on on poor closeouts could be a strength of his game this year And he can throw that lob to Dong and Cila Coach Damat had a lot to say about how well Canra played defensively on Monday night a foul coming here on Reeves Reeves I think thats the value of just playing minutes at the collegiate level Uh you got an experienced guy and and he rode with his veterans late in that game against Maryland Eastern Shore And Pton Marshall another one who had significant minutes last year at Missouri Uh the veterans got the job done the other night Well I think its an important thing to point out too You know while Georgia Tech had some shooting struggles you did have five freshman making their collegiate debuts Theres going to be some nerves with that And coach Datamire felt like it was good They got the jitters out of the way And now they can move forward as the season begins to unfold Georgia Tech 126 lead as we hit a break map with confidence at regent of Georgia Tech Are you ready Well as is the case nowadays in college sports a lot of transition in the off season No different for Georgia Tech basketball coming in to this year Four starters gone threequarters of the minutes four returners including Bongo a big piece of course but 10 newcomers four transfers six freshmen And for Georgia Tech they feel like the identity of this team John music is going to be that front court You see Bon Fango also bringing in transfer Pton Kelly whos about to be at the free throw line be a part of Pton Marshall and then Moila as well Yeah And I think the two keys for this Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets team is who steps up as their leader Who is their vocal leader on the court especially you start going on the road in ACC play Uh whos going to mold into the vocal leader of this team and in the locker room And then point guard play I think thats going to be crucial Uh you know it might be point guard by committee Uh but the loss of Nate George who led the ACC in assists last season is one thing that its to watch I mean Georgia Tech fans are anxious to see whos going to step up And while the front courts the identity of course as the clock winds down here Harvey may have to let this go Hes got to go up and walked with it under two seconds on the shot clock Coach Christian contending that it was part of the shooting motion but it is a turnover But going back to the Yellow Jacket offense you feel like the front court can win you a game You just need the guards not to lose you the game Yeah and we keep going back to offense but defense is going to be where its at Uh holding Bryant right now to 15 from the field 0 of nine from beyond the arc This is a Georgia Tech team that can potentially get after most teams in the ACC defensively believe it or not and have the advantage on the backboard as well Alioop attempt there for Dongo Foul coming on Sims Heres a look at the front quartet if you will by Dongo All ACC Cila and Kiraek a couple of freshman Pton Marshall who might have been the MVP of the game you know and weve talked about his weight some He has lost a lot of weight but you know coach Datmire he was quick to point out look the guy brings a lot more than just his size Its his passing ability his free throw shooting as Don goes at the line looking for his first points of the season Left a little short And again Yellow Jackets left nine points at the free throw line on Monday night They were just 50 from stripe nine for 18 was an area Georgia Tech struggled last year And Dongo hits one of two This scoring drought for Bryant now over three minutes as you pointed out Two of 13 from the floor 0 for nine from three For their last five one for their last 10 Georgia Tech really getting after it with their length Modski trying to find some air Looks to break down Dongo Steps back That ball knocked out of bounds by Aaron Davis Thatll be Georgia Tech basketball Although missed on that shot You saw a little bit of a shake and bake I mean were talking about a guy with great length and size and his ability to put the ball on the deck Shifty good lateral quickness And again his length and high release Hes going to be a real solid player come American East play Cam crabs three wont go CEO the offensive rebound but has it ripped away And hes playing the point right now He can play just about every position according to coach Christian Williams hits it into Roofski Williams tries a three Wont go 0 for 11 now from distance for Bryant Jackets hit a couple threes looking for another Craft drills it Coach Christian not happy Hes going to call a timeout Bulldogs need to huddle Cannot find anything on the offensive side of the ball Bulldogs trail the Jackets by 10 on Bobby Kremits court at McCamish Pavilion one of the best threepoint shooters in division one basketball last year Cam Craft now a yellow jacket You see the numbers he put up as a Miami Ohio Redhawk And you know I asked Cam Craft Who taught you your shot He said Well my dad And I said Well he must have been quite the threepoint shooter He said Ah not exactly He was a big man for VMI and in Mark Crafts career Cams father all time in four years at VMI he went 0 for three from three Mother played basketball at D2 Conquered as well So hes got good DNA First time weve seen Eric Chatfield Jr on the floor for Georgia Tech tonight Out of the timeout Erics another guy is his uh mom played at Georgia State Renee Chatfield Wing three too strong Craft the board Thats going to be a big key for Damon Statimar How his guards rebound and Kasi Reeves nearly brings down the rim Fleman took that one on the chin Kesi take it easy on him No mercy from tied to Balis bringing it up the floor A couple of freshman guards battling here That got a little buzz buzz in the arena here No no pun intended Wy little buzz huh A little buzz action Lets wake up here Friday night ACC hoops Lets get another look at that dunk Here we go Chadfield gets off the ball early Take off Punish it All about getting out and running right John Little defensive foot fire there too I like it You know hes not celebrating Hes ready to play defense They really missed his leadership last year Kuesi Reeves played the first six games missed the rest of the season with a foot injury Ball in his hands again Tries a three Bang Kui Reeves feeling it right now Hes got eight points Yeah no hesitation in that shot as well This guy looks real confident lots of reps in the off season Just just watching him tonight he just looks more comfortable like he he is one of the guys now You know he played in a support role two seasons ago and right now just his mindset looks different Quincy Allen Bulldogs needed that 134 run for Georgia Tech Chadfield his three wont go Rebound secured by Quincy Allen Bryant has struggled mightily from the floor They are 0 of 12 from three Rudowski gives one a chance That wont go Dongo collapses looking for the rebound Second chance Sims goes up and finishes Sims did a really nice job using the basket to protect against Cila Three freshman on the floor now for Georgia Tech Dongo goes up Good straight up by Sims Reeves a three again Kesi Reeves with 11 And he is redot Its just the way Damon starter drew up that play Right Bike trips on himself fumbles the ball kick to the corner Give me three Hes playing possum there Weber Wilsons three wont go Jackets want to get out and run How hot is Kesi He check So Chadfield right there he has one assist in this game but hes a hes a solid point guard Great court vision Hes shifty and his strength right there is on the defensive side of the ball He can really get in and wreak havoc on the ball defense Yeah Mo Cer wreaking havoc on that shot You know Coach Dmer he described Chadfield as a guy give him a little bit of a burst a little bit of a energy pop is how he described it Good hands Rowski a race for the ball Rodovski reverse and the jam wont go Little slow getting up Five on four for Georgia Tech and timeout called by the Yellow Jackets Theres the man walking off the court right there He has stepped it up for the Jackets Reeves 11 points four of seven from the field Hes got two triples and finishing high above the rim Its buzzing music here in Atlanta Well be back Georgia Tech comfortable lead 6 minutes to go here in the first half in large part thanks to Kaci Reeves and John Fivear calling him the pacifier because he is so soothing for this Georgia Tech coaching staff They see him out there Damon Statamire described him as giving him comfort A guy whos been there since day one and right now hes giving Georgia Tech an offensive burst 11 points on just seven shots Yeah hes a guy that you know started his career at Florida with the Gator two seasons there and transferred in was a starter uh and then six games in last season gets injured and hes back for sure What I really like about him there another threepointer right there And Georgia Tech six threes here in the first half on 14 attempts I mean thats really the difference in the game right now John Georgia Tech is 6 for4 Bryant is 0 for 14 And that was Fleming second Hes got seven points Alioop A reverse over the head jam from Quincy Allen behind the back Back to Reeves Weve talked about his offense Thats good defensive help off the ball by Bryant Bryant trying to push Allen short corner No And Georgia Tech basketball Georgia Tech basketball Reeves a guy weve seen his offense but hes hes drawn the uh look at the alleyoop right there Thats some serious bounce But Rudowski hes held Rodowski one for six from the field 0 of four from three Rowski is averaging 15 coming into this one And thats the work of Reeves on the defensive side of the basketball Thats really something coach feels they got to hang their hat on this year is on the defensive end Marshall zips IT DOWN TO CILA TOO EASY Thats great courtfish If youre going to come with a double team on that youve got to come high hands That was a penetrating pass right into the paint Beautiful foul on Moila But take a look at this dunk Yeah Penetrating pass Two Bryant defenders near the ball Neither one with their hands up And that was the result SA the freshman Tied to Balis Loops it to Harvey Has all day out there It wont go and Bryant Theyve taken 25 shots 15 from threepoint land and 0 for 15 as Fleming draws another foul Thats Quincy Allens third foul right there John That could be a big loss for Bryant That hurts because uh youve seen his ability to be an offensive threat above the rim Hes got good size experience Coach Jamon Christian is going to have to make a decision here with 429 left You cant risk Allen picking up a fourth And with that Rossi will replace him Still a Kai Fleming at the line He was another top 100 recruit 53rd ranked freshman coming in by ESPN Thats the second Good active hands from Fleming Harvey penetrates hook and its swaddled away by Cila cheering Now Mustaf Marshall flashing open in the paint Instead its Fleming from the elbow Another battle for the board and Bryant controls it to Balis This Jack three wont go and a foul coming here against Aaron Davis Little fireworks here as we go to break Georgia Tech in control as we approach halftime in Atlanta event football team Saturday Join us as we seniors radio Basketball Monday to get your seats Hey hey hey Any coach would tell you you cant point to one number but in this case if you had to point to one this is the one John Oh thats the snapshot right there The Bulldogs over in the first half Yes you said it right Under four music minutes to go 0 for 16 from beyond the ark And again this is a team that came in that was the strength on Monday night at Sienna They knocked down 10 triples So Georgia Tech getting the defense done behind the ark And then Yellow Jackets have knocked down six of 14 The stat that I like there is Georgia Techs only given up three offensive rebounds music on 16 missed threes Usually long rebounds coming off Georgia Tech boxing out securing the ball and converting offense Fleming hits the first of two And that was another point of emphasis after that win over Maryland Eastern Shore for coach is he wanted to get the guards more involved in rebounding And at times he feels like they do way too much of watching the bigs do all the work As talented as the bigs are for Georgia Tech they need the guards to get on the glass as well Georgia Tech extending the defense full court Craft almost had the steal on that possession And this is something coach Datamire feels like he can do more with the depth tied to Balis freshman guard from Wester Mass Good hands by Fleming And now Craft racing down the floor Kelly a three It goes there He is the transfer from Boston College He gets in the scoring column Largest lead of the night for Georgia Tech And finally a three drops for Bryant Missing their first 16 Its Ashley Sims freshman who gets the roll Under three minutes to play here in the first half Kelly calling for a ball screen Marshall Nice bounce pass feed to Fleming who worms around SPINS IT HIGH OFF THE GLASS AND it drops Wow Spin coming down That was the athleticism on display right there That was 12 points to lead all scorers in this game Yeah forget the mustard That had relish and had it all and it still works Rodski dials up a three Maybe its contagious Thats two for two now in the last two Unfortunately he missed the first 16 but little change of fortune Bryant knocks down two triples Down 17 though Crab tries a triple Battle for the ball Cila lunging towards the Bulldog bench Hit the floor hard there Good hustle Kelly gave the thumbs up over to the Georgia Tech bench from the deep corner So I think he is okay Kai Fleming headed to the bench One more Look at this Its pretty serious English The works baby The works laughter on the way down Watch this Hes hanging Hes gliding Score it Bryant trying to finish this first half stronger than they started Ball is loose Williams recovers taking the air out of the ball here Got the mismatch on Marshalls calling for the switch DIDNT GET IT BUT CILAS THERE TO CLEAN IT UP Racing back Mustaf just inside the free throw line He got was a very good decision by Reeves Didnt have anything Backed it up Gets Mustaf with a poor close out Couple hard dribbles left and bang the size advantage Husttoff drops the midrange floater Awe thinks about it Instead hell slash and Payton Marshall contending he went straight up Official Jamal Spearman disagrees You talked about the uh you know Coach Stomire after the game said he felt like the defense uh really got the offense going the other night and here you see it They they were heating up the ball heavy ball pressure Cila comes blocks it off the glass and then heres the result You know an eightfooter but that started with Cilas block Really started at half court with the heavy ball pressure Pton Marshall with the hard hedge on the ball screen Georgia Tech getting it done defensively Take a look at the defensive efficiency for Georgia Tech last couple of years made a considerable improvement moving up nearly half the way in Ken Pom And thats points per 100 possessions So again just a shade over a point a possession but thats a number that can tell you a whole lot about how efficient you are based on how often teams are shooting and how many possessions you get in a game so on and so forth Yeah I think the intent uh on recruiting size and athleticism Coach DMA and staff have done a great job bringing in some length athletes good rim protection and really guys who just play hard Down low to Aqu Keegan Harvey bullying in and a miscommunication He sends it right to Randy Waters at the radio at the radio broadcast position Jamie Christian uh little kick to the uh scores table right there Dont break the foot now Hes heated He does not like those turnovers Harvey unfortunately threw it to the official out of his peripheral vision Thought he had a teammate over there Yeah six turnovers for Bryant Three for Harvey You got to look at Andy Demetra and Randy Waters Isaiah Stewart over there Georgia Tech Radio Yellow Jackets can hold for the final shot of what has clearly been their best half of the young season Mustaf with five Fading away Two Rodski heaves it from half court Its short And that the end of the first half The Yellow Jackets put up 39 points shooting better than 40 from three and put the clamps on the Bryant Bulldog offense Yellow Jackets a much crisper performance than what we saw on Monday night as we hit halftime in Midtown Atlanta No better place than a Friday night Glad to have you with us ACC hoops as we get this season off and rolling on ACC Network Thats what he felt about the shooting performance and he kind of gave a smirk and hes going to strap up here and get back after Too funny Too funny And so will we Second half out of the break His Ree picks up right where he left off Hes got 13 Like the call right out of the uh half uh dead ball situation Go to your best scorer in the first half And Reeves if youre Brian I mean what what are you hoping to see here in the second half aside from making more shots you know sustained effort I think a young team uh right there thats a perfect example Second chance opportunity a hustle play The shots are not falling What can you do to affect the game Thats a perfect example by Rudowski number 99 Hell go to the line Uh but its a second chance points right there Effort Go after it He hunted that rebound down Thats what you got to look for Feels like Rodovski leaves the free throw shorty Its been quite the impression here in these 20 minutes just watching him play He seems to be relentless and hes got a lot of tools in his bag Lust a little out of control Goes to Dongo for a THREE AND HES GOT IT HIS FIRST BUCKET OF THE night is from the corner Georgia Tech great spacing on that one Mustaf gets into the paint and finds the shooter Dongo in the corner for his first triple first field goal of the game For what its worth John he did shoot close to 40 from three last year Just didnt take a lot of them Halfway down and out And Cila Dongo wide open Cila didnt see him in time And now the alleyoop going up and nearly drained it I think he was looking for a pass there A little too much mustard on that one there laughter Been in the wait room Coach Duttermire is a little bit better with the ball in his hands I think at point Hes shaking his head Oh my After further discussion it will laughter be Hes in disbelief over there Hes What was that cheering Ooh Georgia Tech nearly with the steel At first it looked like it was going to be Georgia Tech ball but after further discussion it wound up belonging to Bryant And well you see a 20point margin here in the second half You look at Bryant and I know they struggled from three Theyre two for 20 tonight But if those shots begin to drop like theyre capable of they can get back in this game Credit Georgia Techs defense in the first half but Bryant did miss five or six of those threes you know without a hand in their face You know ones that they knocked down on Monday night against Sienna Back door pass Allen feeds the corner and Harveys three wont fall Its perfect example John A perfect example Great offensive execution Back door cut Switched the side with the side of the court with the basketball Wide open three no hand up and a miss I mean if youre a coach youre just its so frustrating because it was really good execution Its just one of those nights for the Bulldogs right now 18 minutes to play though Anything can happen We saw kind of what happened when they finally found one or got one to go Ashley Sims that unlocked a little bit of offense momentarily for Bryant is by Tongo just carving right through the paint And thats why hes preseason second team allac selection Uh you saw the three on two possessions ago and then he goes off the bounce And now the press for Georgia Tech Heres Kui with the reverse and timeout Bryant Georgia Tech mashing on the pedal here to begin this second half cheering as they have got themselves out to the largest lead of the night And John the LJ playing some Chris basketball Yeah Bryant had five turnovers in the first half music already two in the second Georgia Tech everyone getting in on the action and by Dongo and Reeves stepping up in Atlanta We have big I dont like the way by Dongo two years ago exploded onto the scene in the ACC 12 and8 part of the all rookie team Last year he turned it up a notch 139 and earning third team allconerence honors This year a preseason allac selection and John hes got a chance to be one of the most dynamic players in the league this year And we saw it just in the last two and a half minutes Drains a three from the corner and then drives himself with his left down the lane for another two So averages 139 last season but actually averaged a double double in ACC play 1410 Yeah he was one of just two players in the ACC to average a double double in league play The other being Eddie Lumpin Junior at Syracuse Those are John Babel type numbers Kesi Ree splash Oh what a night for Kesi Hes got 18 Hes cooking right now For a young man who had to sit on the bench for a long time last season played the first six games and missed the rest of the season and had a tough night on Monday He has erupted here tonight Another empty possession for Bryant Cam Craft he triggers a threepointer and he drills it Its one of those nights right now Bryant has no answers right now Georgia Tech up 30 Yellow Jackets have hit 10 threes Bryant two for 21 Rdowski trying to help that number and he does Hes a good looking player Four of nine from the field two of six from beyond the arc Hes got 10 points Hes the only bulldog in double figure scoring And Mustaf taps it up Dongo third time And after just one point in the first half Dongos now got seven here in the first four minutes And you know John Kennedy after that win on Monday night there was a little bit of nervous energy perhaps outside the program with Georgia Tech about how things looked and Damon Statamire and company felt pretty confident that you know it was one of those nights and they have come back and played a much higher level of basketball tonight Yeah the intensity is there their sustained effort over time When they go to the bench with the subs theyre not dipping Its been a good effort for the Jackets and they have already matched Monday nights point total We still got 15 plus minutes to go At brothers we are committed to the highest standards in our jewelry Our philosophy is simple When we buy price well we stand firmly in our pledge to never compromise on quality accuracy or affordability of our products Solomon is a proud partner of Georgia Tech presented by United Consulting official partner of the Red Heat Heat I dont remember Little Big 12 ACC showdown in North Carolina after trailing at halftime Look at that number at the bottom 75 shooting in the second half without a single turnover Looking to snap that fivegame win streak that the JayHawks have over the heels In fact the ACC theyve taken only one loss so far as a conference That was Boston College on Monday night in overtime against FAU And Kai Fleming had a big first half Hes now getting his first run of the second half How about first time the JayHawks have ever played in Chapel Hill Can you believe that Well I think Kansas likes Fog Allen Theyre pretty comfortable there That I that that does surprise me Carolina projected third in ACC preseason rankings behind Duke at one Louisville at two And a nice nice win if they can hold on and pull that one out against the JayHawks This will be an interesting year for the league huh I mean obviously getting only four bids last year in the NCAA tournament and Duke being the only team to win a tournament game or should advance past the round of 64 Just feels like a a big year for the ACC to just reestablish you know their presence nationally Yeah something to prove You know its you got NC State Virginia SMU Clemson uh Miami Syracuse These these teams are all in the middle of the pack Uh and all have something to prove this year Fleming midrange short sila the board And new coaches as well You got Ryan ODM at Virginia Jay Lucas at Miami Will at NC State Luke locks at Border State as well Nice take that time from Khalil Williams Red shirted all of last year out of Hardgrave Military Academy Thats the same prep school that Miles Kelly went to Former Yellow Jacket Sila baseline brings it down Goes up Good defense there from Keegan Harvey Davis A three in the corner Wont go Williams been quiet tonight He had 12 points uh on Monday against Sienna but put him in an ISO situation on Fleming There you see the left hand finish high off the glass Hes been quiet but hes another guard that coach Christian is high on Um hes going to call his number and he delivered on that possession Yeah hes one of the few pieces intact from last years team I know obviously he red shirted but he was in the program for Bryants big season where they set a division one school record 23 wins near the end of the shot clock for Khalil Williams Fleming trying to shut him down Its got to be Weber Tough shot and a battle for the loose ball and an offensive rebound for Bryant Davis picks it up and lets it go Shooting lows continue for Bryant Three of 27 from beyond the ark tonight 27 of their 44 field goal attempts when you called it are threepoint attempts So when youre not knocking those down thats not a good recipe Three for 27 But Coach Christian I dont think he has a problem with either This is their style of play Hes recruited shooters They practice this Theyre just having one of those nights And a foul there on Aai Fleming on a threepoint try from Davis Well we were talking about between the break too John I mean this is a Bryant team that you feel like can really have a big year in the America East Theyre picked to finish sixth Thats hard to believe you know and I think you know they certainly passed the eye test This is a team that does not look like an American East team I mean it looks like an ACC opponent here with their size their length the skill at every position Uh theyve done a nice job assembling a roster that I think can do some damage Um you know they got to knock down threepoint shooting I think defensively theyre going to continue to get tougher and more sound Uh but here you go Wy take a look at that Last season yeah look what they accomplished I mean the program record in wins Phil Martelli Jr was the American East Conference coach of the year second insulate tournament birth in four years And then you move to this season new head coach Jamon Christian You lose your top seven scorers including all five starters Phil Martelli Jr takes the job at BCU Only two letter winners returned So again one of them not here tonight Jakai Robinson Want to congratulate Jakai His daughter was born today A big day for Jakai Robinson and his family Congratulations And good hands Aai Fleming again Georgia Tech applying that pressure And its Bryant basketball Got a little hustle by Fleming Had a turnover Gets on the floor Get to the next play Young fella good looking prospect I like the demeanor Coach Stomire the patience Uh you know hes got his young guys out there Theyre going to go through some bumps early in the season but hes high on this team He Its a different look different feel different mindset he said coming into this season and I like the pieces hes assembled Well John youve been around basketball your whole life Im curious You Ive hear a lot of times players will say the best thing a coach can do is be authentic Just be who you are Dont try and be something youre nine It feels like Damon Statamire unsurprisingly has no problem doing that Most CEO makes that look easy I think the value of just having relationships and communicating thats such a important part of coaching outside of the Xs and Os Uh you know how do you you know have an influx of confidence out there as a player Well you get confidence through your coaching staff and that all has to do with communication Were going to have a break in the action Its been all jackets in this one Jackets lead by 30 in Atlanta on premise for tonight Bryant continuing his shooting woes in the second half music Hey students make sure you stand here on the video Tonights game by the end of the season will have an awesome chance to win prizes So make sure you check in Get on that plane Kind of fun to see James Forest in there huh He was great Early 90s In fact his son will be here on Monday night playing for Southeastern Louisiana But as of tonight I mean what a terrific improvement John when it comes to the assist and turnover ratio And look to be fair on Monday night most of those turnovers came from the bigs more than the point guards Yeah CILA had six turnovers in that game But for Georgia Tech tonight 17 assists Theyre moving the basketball and thats on 22 made field goals Uh theyre finding each other What that shows me is a sign of an unselfish team Mustaf assist Marshall three CILA three assists Uh so a balanced attack from the Jackets tonight And David Remagan is back in for Georgia Tech Another guard freshman from Germany Five to shoot Webers three No And Cila pounces on the rebound But for Georgia Tech again one of the big questions entering this season who is going to replace Nate George at the point guard position You see Chaz Kelly and Remagan in the back court right now for the Yellow Jackets Marshall surveying and Marshall goes up There it is But you can see the numbers right there at Nate Six and a half assists per game that was best in the ACC top 15 nationally He has transferred to Syracuse And Georgia Tech still has not had the services yet this year of Lamar Washington who is a big point guard brought in from the transfer portal out of Pacific He was a West Coast Conference you know all conference player So hes going to have his opportunity too But uh you know the balance the balanced attack tonight Must stop with five assists Marshall and Sila combining at the post position for six assists Uh its a different look different style Nate George out Some of the parts make up for that And a turnover See Lamar Washington there on the bench A whistle down low and the foul coming here on Ashley Sims Nice little triangle action Kelly Marshall isolating Dongo down low They formed the triangle Went high low Wing the high post Threw it in with Dongo Dunk it in Entry pass to Marshall Puts it on the deck and he walked with it Big fella took an extra step on that possession Marshall made the key free throw on Monday night against Maryland East sure sent that game into overtime Chaz Kelly creates a turnover and he cashes it in Transfer from Boston College now in his cheering fourth year in college basketball His first points as a Yellow Jacket coming here tonight Now got five Georgia Tech has forced 11 Bryant turnovers in this game Theyve scored 11 13 points now off those turnovers air ball there Dong with the rebound Here come the Jackets and Reeves stepped on the line or begging pardon Knocked out of bounds maybe I think it I guess Rodski must have got a piece of it Knocked it out of Rodski may have been stepping out of bounds when he touched the ball He went to reach in His foot was out of bounds So therefore side out tied to Ballis Freshman guard wear number one in black He was a late ad for Bryant Quincy Allen threes off the mark and now fed ahead Kesi Reeves cant quite handle the pass Wisely pulls out then back in and blocked from behind Good hands from Remagan and it winds up in the pause of Payton Marshall Floats it ahead Feed dongo Perfectly executed on the run out Yeah the defense to offense conversion tonight by Georgia Tech Theyre really giving Bryant problems getting up the floor Active hands in the paint They turn it over Two passes layup And you have the feeling thats going to be a key ingredient for Georgia Techs offense is building off their defenses Tobalis drills a three Now four for 31 as a team from three 31 threepoint attempts Only 17 twopoint tries But again thats part of the plan for Bryant Kesi Reeves halfway down and out Good hands by Kelly One of the suicides right now between these two teams Dongo ready to hammer away on Allen Goes up and cant get his own miss Theyve gotten quality looks just John havent been able to hit them as Kuesi Reeves rips away that board Bulldogs four for 33 from beyond the arc Just one of those nights theyre getting good looks They hit these shots on Monday They are not falling tonight Theres a lid on it for coach Christian Jackets cruising to his second win up by 33 Three is plenty saucy Sauced up for sure And uh you know more impressive you know the offense starts on the defensive side of the ball and Georgia Techs perimeter is locked down Holden Bryant Bulldogs to 25 from the field in this one And I think thats a direct reflection of the success youre seeing offensively is theyre getting after it defensively Theyre not thinking Theyre just playing Theyre having fun And the ball is finding the open man You think back to your freshman year and even your debut Got a jump ball here on the floor Ive got to imagine the nerves from game one to game two subside considerably right If youre a freshman out there Absolutely I was a you know suburb kid from Boston Massachusetts We played Wford in the opener My first ever game I had one field goal a slam dunk I didnt have many dunks in my career but first collegiate basket was a dunk We came back and played the the Bulldogs UG trailing the whole game We came back and won that one on this court right here the old Alexander Memorial Coliseum And I Yeah I remember that But you had no time to be nervous against the dogs That was the rival You had to win that game Yes Jack and George will meet one week from tonight over in Athens Statement Coliseum 900 tip Five freshman on the floor right now for Georgia Tech including Cole Kira who were seeing for the first time tonight And reaching in foul coming Its going to be on Kalo Williams What youre saying is that dunk against Wford though theres somewhere theres a few former Terriers who wake up in a cold sweat thinking of John B laughter I dont know about that Oila trying to create some new nightmares And that ball is whacked away by Wilson What athleticism for Quincy Allen a bigger pardon Allen Allens got some serious bounce Saw a few lobs the dunks in the first half Uh hes hes solid player Hes going to be good in this league and hes fiveyear guy Hes got the experience Take a look again at this block here Let me see Allen getting up Hes listed at 68 but look at the athleticism I mean I hard to imagine a better athlete in the America East than Quincy Allen Yeah that was off the vert No step against you know 69 610 COA with a lot of bounce throwing a jump hook and he gets swatted Six and a half to play Another brick from the threepoint line Remogen takes the contact Its going to be on Rosski On that possession we saw Cila the freshman and why everyones so high on him on the flats Hes got 11 boards eight points in this one Hes one basket away from that double double He had a double double in his season opener the other night That was just beautiful passing Davi Remagan with the assist the hockey assist I should say Did I just speak that double double into life right there Great timing Thanks Cila Amy maybe look good right there Cila 10 points 11 boards Hes going to be a force for the Jackets this year Second straight double double And Cole Kirwak with the assist there laughter Those 15 rebounds for Moila on Monday night A program record for a freshman in his first game You held that record John Is that right Yes Yes Yes Thats accurate 100 accurate Or was it Derek Favors One of those two Put my prop bet on Favors Also what he does so well is sees the floor Hes got three assists in this one And then his ability to change the pace of the game He can grab a rebound off the rim and leave the break and get four guys out running with him Thats a game changer right there when you have a guy that can snag it off the rim and start the break A foul there inside the final five seconds of the shot clock Thatll put Allen at the line But going back to Cila John you coach Dimear was pretty frank You know he told CE after the game on Monday night that he didnt think he played that well He could have played a lot better it feels like tonight with the way hes taken care of the ball as you mentioned the three assists another double double a little more of a a sharper performance for Moan thats probably the case for all of Georgia Tech you saw his effort there you know deep in the deep corner early in the uh late in the first half diving on the floor little things like that really stand out of you know what kind of competitor are you how are you going to answer the bell when your coach challenges you thats a great Foul here on Keegan Harvey Keegan Harvey out of Australia Moved here in 2019 and he just now got his first car Spent some time at College of Charleston GW Fleming continues to add to his impressive night 14 points second among all scorers behind only Kuwaiti Reeves Has a knack for scoring and finishing Uh the size the athleticism the length and uh the touch Yep cheering Its got to feel good for a guy who battled that knee injury and surgery missed nearly 10 months and Ethan Borg freshman on the floor cheering And Wandowski air mails it And now the debut coming here for Brandon Stores Jr Freshman out of St Raymonds up in the Bronx Scored 2000 plus points in his time in New York City Set a school record there Has a knack for filling it up Sila out to Remagan Remogen cant get it to fall And Remagan picks it off though Good read The extra pass And thats going to be Bryant basketball I gotta get this note in here Davi Ree did you see who his great uncle is Oh yeah Of course Ple not many can say that Yes Ple is his great uncle Pretty cool Athlete of the century Not many can say that Yeah Chadfield probing Keep waiting to drop a goal on one remake against jumpers Just got to get got to get one to drop Did he go by Ple or Uncle Ple I mean laughter thats a good question Is it just ple I think hes called a monk Thats all Well step aside Georgia Tech cruising to a 2 and 0 start here and a stronger performance here on a Friday night in McCish Yellow tickets are available tickets for tonight Georgia Tech getting ready to salt away a win here at home and they will be back in action Monday night Thats a 900 tip on ACC Network And then the first road game of the season up 316 in Athens A 900 tip there as well So get your coffee ready this week And then Georgia Southern West Georgia Then on down to Niceville Florida for Depal And our referees want to take a look at a foul real quick Make sure they got it right Just when you thought it couldnt get worse for Bryant in the second half uh the shooting wos five of 23 in the second half Thats 21 from the field Two of 18 from beyond the arc So 18 of their 23 attempts for threepointers and then just three of six now four of seven from the free throw line Uh it just hasnt been their night shooting the basketball Home opener for Bryant against Dartmouth on Wednesday They will hang the American East Championship banner that night inside the Chase Athletic Center up in Smithfield Rhode Island And then back on the road three straight Valpo Virginia Tech and Yukon Yukon started tonight up 282 on UMass L So uh the number four team in the country The Huskies look like theyre back and mean business Yep Remog flowner There it drops Get a goal there for Ples great nephew In all seriousness though Davi Reeogen playing professionally over in Europe Nice to see him get his first points as a Yellow Jacket Now to the shot clock Allens got to chuck it up It wont go Kiraak the rebound You know for coach Christians perspective John I mean how much of tonight do you look up and chalk at chalk it up to didnt have our shooters firing versus things you can improve upon each Uh the second half the wheels fell off a little bit on their focus Turnovers Uh they they only had five turnovers in the first half and they started kicking it around They now have 16 turnovers in the game So I think thats one coachable thing on film is hey even when the shots arent falling weve got to maintain our focus and our defensive intensity cheering Freshman continue to go to work for Georgia Tech All five on the floor We got some subs coming here for Bryant Daniel Aqui along with Caleb Williams and Aaron Davis and on the Georgia Tech side John as far as things coach Stamar can work on this weekend leading into Mondays game as Khalil Williams shot blocked Its his own miss A lot of positives here tonight Yeah I think watching the film the value for a young team is just seeing yourself on film and you know effort you know second chance points you know running the floor spacing just the little the little details of the game and and even in a win theres theres a lot of teachable moments And for guys that are you know freshman thats where you learn and can kind of take the jump in your game And for seniors uh you know you got to be a leader You got to talk You got to carry your team along And that thats one area I want to see whos the vocal leader on this team Who can be your your your spirited captain Your kind of coach on the floor Thats what they need Take a look one more time at this effort from Khalil Williams down low after getting a shot blocked by Cole Kiraak This is Lonard Weber out of Munich Germany at the free throw line Misses his first A fouryear guy at University of Toronto Played 8 minutes on Monday night against Sienna But another guy thats a little bit older on this team on a young roster 68 220 four years of collegiate experience Hes a guy that can certainly spell some minutes for coach Christian this year Stores leaves it short and Borgade cheering is fouled A Kai Fleming reaching up towards the glass Theyre going to count the basket on goending So and one opportunity coming here for Ethan Borg Fleming get up on that one And you know I think that for Georgia Tech uh the success uh in their first two wins lies on the defensive side of the ball Field goal percentage defense rebounding effort Uh in a night where Bryant shoots four of 38 from beyond the arc Thats a lot of long rebounds and Georgia Tech only only gave up surrendered seven offensive rebounds tonight So that shows me that youre locked in when youre boxing out on all five positions and you mentioned guards rebounding was a point of emphasis Uh that stat is glaring to me applause in a positive way for the Jackets Chafffield Jr looks like hes going to take the shot clock violation and Georgia Tech will be 5 seconds away from a 2 and 0 start And John this win didnt quite induce the same type of heart attack moments we saw on Monday night Yellow Jackets were in control early and maintained it throughout as Georgia Tech improves to two and 0 Final score 7445 And John when you walk away from this one what whatll stick with you I think it you know celebrate your success celebrate your win but know that its a long journey ahead and you dont want
