But theyre playing it safe with Lau for his long term Unfortunately theyre down a big player for what will be a tough test tonight Clarence Armstrongs going to throw it up Ben Allen Luben beats Malagel Pot for the tip Ted Valentine AJ Desire other officials And its Elliot Cado and the Tarheelss with the ball first 12 and six in the ACC with two to go this one And then Saturday at home to Duke and a great start Kadau feeds Luben who had a season high 19 on Saturday Starting five for the Hookies without l Its Burnham and Poti four in the five Ben Hammond and Jaden Young coming off spectacular games against Syracuse and the freshman Tyler Johnson Its a team with 10 freshman and sophomores Theyve gotten better as the seasons gone along Heres Young who scored 20 plus two of the last three leads it long And here is Kado with the ball Starting five for Carolina RJ Davis now third all time in scoring in the ACC with Kado the terrific freshman Powell Luben and Jaylen Withers maybe their best player in this win streak CDU cant convert the offhanded layup I think Withers gives them something that theyve really needed all season which is space at the four position Particularly if youre running some pick and pop action with Elliot Cado who who really is only going to turn the corner and create Hes not looking to shoot Virginia Tech nearly turns it over They struggle mightily in that category Worst turnover team in the ACC but they get a good look for Hammond from three and the freshman from Fairfax gets Tech on the board Its good to establish that early that you can recognize where the doubles going to come from and find the open man and good by Hammond to be ready to shoot Theyve been a really good threepoint shooting team in conference play Powell set up by GDO Its two assists for Kado and a three for the freshman Drake Cowell I just love him I I really do I I think there are some guys that give you such a great energy that you you its it becomes almost infectious right Negative is contagious Good is infectious Drake Powell has an infectious energy on this game 38 threepoint shooter What could be his only college year Davis with a pullup pop and Carolina hits back to back from deep The toughest things for Virginia Tech is you gave up an opening play scripted play I I would almost just run a weird zone if teams are going to script out plays right Bruce Pearl scripts out the first play and they often get it Step back Jaden Young He has been unstoppable of late 27 against Miami three games ago 26 in the overtime win against Syracuse on Saturday Music The dole after the penetration feeds Withers Hes been redhot and thats too long and tipped into the hands of the freshman Tyler Johnson Withers is shooting a high percentage from three and typically he takes really good shots Thats a tough shot to make as he kind of backing out to the threepoint line with no balance Virginia Tech coming off a 101 95 overtime win And Young was hot in that game and he is hot to start this one Five points on the last two possessions Its good to see the energy from the bench too Smiles on the court smiles on the bench Everybodys happy for one another Given how challenging this season is its its nice to see that positivity Luben rolls it out to Powell Davis with a switch on the big man Potit will pass out of it Get it back from Kado RJ with a step back Deep one Its good RJ Davis in rhythm early with a couple of deep ones I think the game itself has a good rhythm Both teams scoring actually gives the game a rhythm If you dont believe me find the rhythm in a game thats zero to zero after five minutes Teams are seven for 11 so far No turnovers yet That jumper by Johnson too short Rebounded by Powell Carolina loves to get down the floor quickly and they get it to Luben for a good look inside He cant convert Ted Valentines the best It looked like a foul you know against Withers and Tim Valentine just explained it was both of them and thats a great call or no call Hes also explaining it to some fans who yelled at him in the front row Just some great crowd work Ted Valentine off the miss by Young Davis driving down low for Luben Its a weward pass in the games first turnover Just the sixth turnover in the last six games for RJ Davis Played a lot of point guard in this win streak Burnham driving out for Hammond Rookie shot at 61 the season high on Saturday Young with a deep three Thats too short Music more of a driver than a shooter Withers will drive it and hes been more of a shooter of late This is a game that could use a little reset right now We havent had a whistle in a while You dont like good flow Is that is that a problem for you The last few possessions were at the best flow The bottom those are the current standings in tech They could be an 89 game They could be 13 seed Who knows Theres still so much to figure out but they will be there 15 teams make it Three are left out Inside the first touch a basket for the sevenfooter Patrick Wesler North Carolina kid And the first bench points for a hookie team that has had huge scoring contributions off the bench of late I really want to see if Dean Jackson can earn significant minutes in this game I had them against Miami and he did not play a lot A lot of that was because he didnt defend He can do that I mean thats for sure He Hes an electric scorer but youve got to be able to earn your time on the floor I think something Hubert Davies been working on him with Good look Rattled out Jackson Seth Trimble Jaylen Washington are in the game for the Heels Just working with him on Thats okay You still ended on the preposition Jaden shoots out there with the ball coming off a careerhigh 20 Young for three Two deep and rebound to Wesler who fell down after getting entangled with Washington Theres nothing more annoying as a player uh than sorry Hubert Davis Im talking about annoying while were looking at you We love you Just just know that Uh theres nothing more annoying than a backup big coming in who just plays super hard Like its so frustrating You get established in the game you play your position then the backup big comes in and just outworks you They can pop Burnham from Young and Virginia Techs back on top Their third three of the night Well they drag that ball screen action all the way down towards the baseline So it just gets that defense to sag into a help position and Burnhams right there on the pop Tarhill spread it out Davis gets the switch loses a dribble Back into the corner for Trimble Multiple threes in two straight And his first shot tonight is good from D Its a game changer when they make threes They get space on the floor that makes everything easier They have so many drivers so many cutters but they need space to be able to get those things open You got RJ on the floor You get Jackson Drake Pal can shoot it Missed by Rex Steiner into the hands or missed by shoot into the hands of Davis And RJ is fouled first of the game against Virginia Tech So last five games 46 only Colorado State has been better from three in that stretch In the first 25 games this was one of the worst threepoint shooting teams in Carolina history I think part of it is I always said its a different rhythm when you dont have a big you dont get inside out threes So youve got to create the rhythm yourself get comfortable with it find confidence in what you do and start to just let it fly I think it took a while but this group has figured out and I got to give Hubert Davis a lot of credit Its not an easy job to be the head coach North Carolina when given the expectations at that place But I know he wouldnt trade those expectations for the world You just have to figure it out I think this group has done it The back out there for Davis Trimble thinking about another three Will drive shoot instead Miss a high arcer Help Little gamesmanship down there The Cowboy cant believe it Music In the bacon strip Out of bounds off of Virginia Tech I think it was next to Cowboy Jackson dribbles it off his foot and Carolina turns it over Theres Mike Young in his sixth year taking Virginia Tech to the postseason four straight years every year except for the co season And though the records not good this year and this does not look like the postseason team hes done a wonderful job of developing this team especially because of everything they lost coming into the year And then they lost would have been their likely starting point guard his Seir Miller dismissed from the team reports of the ongoing investigation into the gambling issue at Temple last year where Millard transferred from so Virginia Techs lost a lot Had to basically start from scratch and theyve been very competitive in the ACC Washington leaves a jumper well short Mike Young the longer he has these guys the better theyre going to be Hes such a great coach and a wonderful human being Rex Steiner taken away by Trimble at the rim And Trimble fed by Kado and he finishes strong over the 7 foot Wesler That thats uh thats just a fullcourt clip that you break down and you say defend the rim get out and run and he just hung in the air took contact finished Kind of what you expected from Trimble all season At 63 playing well above his height He is their leading rebounder 1613 The Tarheel lead Heres Young A lot of shots for him early Johnson terrific offensive rebounder Is fouled on the way up Huber Davis frusting four threes in that game Theyve hit 53s in the last five Simple question Probably not a simple answer Whats different Do you want that Do you want that answer now or do you want to get me to get back to I look its something as simple as rhythm in the game When youre a smaller team you create rhythm off the bounce by moving the basketball Youve got to limit turnovers Thats number one Theyve been able to do that a little bit better That was a great play by Elliot Kado but at times turnovers are an issue You also have to push up the floor and try to avoid resets You have playmakers The more you play against a set defense the harder its going to be to make a higher percentage of shots I really think a lot of it is just being basically free enough to play fast Theyve done a much better job of doing that And in doing so you create a rhythm that you can build on That was a tough question Kevin Like sometimes I get them and Im like I got an answer for that Thats like there are layers to that that answer right there You want simpler questions Well look I think some of it respect you for lunch today Dont remember There you go See this was a simple question I I think another part of it is RJ Davis having the ball at the top of the key more often It creates better space on the floor Better space means easier driving lanes better passing lanes With the ball right now hes assisted on five of their first seven but he turns it over here But but watch the watch the defense when Gdau has the ball at the top of the key It flattens out and you lose all the space in the offensive attack Hey tonight Super Tuesday mens basketball double header on ESPN Auburn just keeps racking up huge wins They get a chance for another College Station against number 22 Texas AM Arizona State Arizona after that Both games streaming on the ESPN app as well Something feisty always happens in Arizona State Doesnt matter how good the teams are The Wildcats are much better than the Sunundevils this year meeting as Big 12 rivals this season Burton with the basket The lead down to two Gdau sets up Withers His three out of the hands of Luben into the hands of the former Duke Blue Devil Jaden Shu Thats the play GDO has to continue to make Just simple attack hit the open man Thats a high percentage look off a hard petite screen Shoot sets up Burnham His jumper contested by Withers and it found its way to Johnson A beautiful accident for a Virginia Tech tie and maybe a lead at the line You heard me say it a lot is bad misses are easiest for the offense to get This is an airball You know great contest by Withers getting back into it Bam just kind of shoots an air ball and its the offensive player whos kind of sneaking in from behind that sees the basketball coming up way short Heard you say too how good Carolina is unbroken plays Virginia Tech has had a couple of successful broken plays tonight Seven second chance points They get the basket there and a 1919 tie more than halfway through the first Davis and Kadau with Trimble Withers and Luben Washington picked up his second foul going to the last break Trimble feeds Luben He is fouled with a basket and a chance for three for him Yeah hes really gotten better Kevin He Hes Hes a guy earlier this season you saw potential but there was going to be an adjustment and hes starting to figure out how to play with these guys At times its not get to the open position Sometimes get with a smaller lineup you got to learn how to get out of the way Sometimes out of the way with playmakers on the floor puts you in position to make a play or at least get your big away from the basket when you have drivers coming at you Its a weird skill to teach a guy Hey let me teach you how to get out of the way but its important He was nine for 10 from the field in that win Saturday And Burnham Im not sure he needed to do that He saved it right to Trimble to way too strong on a three And Bham saves it this time as hes falling out of bounds Applause Music Hammond back on the floor to run the point for Virginia Tech and Wesler throws it away looking for shoot Davis gets it from Withers hard to the rim No And it ends up over the top of the backboard as Wesler got back well in transition I think its been a fun game up and down for both teams to start Little bit of lull after the first five six minutes but this is what weve talked about Virginia Tech and these guys competing Like I think theres hope within this program First off you got a great coach Second off theyre theyve grown their NIL which I want to smack myself for celebrating that but thats just the world were in Y and it does matter Well the key is its not just about having the money Its about getting the right people the right guys Its got to fit the type of basketball you want to play but theyve also got to be people that can be taught the way Mike Young teaches Can miss a foul here His first Who are the right kind of people for Mike Young I think you got to have a sense of a basketball field You cant just be raw in the field department Youve got to have decent instincts that you can be taught how to play the game better You dont have to be the supreme athlete You dont have to be a fivestar guy You just have to have the willingness to learn how to make the game easier for you and everybody else which means learn how to rely on others Sometimes the best talent they dont know how to rely on others Bird strong drive to tie the game Thats a kid who has a great feel for the game Partly developed at Charleston under Pat Kelsey And heres Johnson who is fouled by Kado picking up two quick ones early where games are separated into four quadrants And quad one those are the toughest games 175 If you play a team in the top 75 in the net on the road top 30 at home top 50 neutral sight its considered a quad one win Theres some history No atlarge team has ever had a record that bad in quad one Again this is year seven of the system and made the field So lets just simplify it If historys any guide UNCC has to win another quad one game Could be Duke on Saturday could be SMU maybe in the ACC tournament if it holds but they probably have to win one I think theyre playing well enough to do that The the challenge is if if its going to be Duke thats a great challenge Down the floor for Jackson is layup ties The question to you is between Auburn and Duke right now is there one team you could even give an edge to And I just dont know I think theyre both really high level basketball teams I I would say Auburn played their best basketball earlier than Duke but Duke has since figured out how to kind of maximize Cooper flag and everything else around them Knocked away from Young Heres Davis And a nice little handoff to Powell for a Tarheel lead J Techs got to be careful not to let this get away from them Theyve done a great job of being in this game but turnovers and easy layups and transition opportunities are one thing they it cannot allow Music Hand off by Wesler for Young And I dont know who he was looking at on that pass He may not have either Hammond just bear hugs Trimble for a foul on the floor NBA Wednesday double header tomorrow night Three of the best teams in the league Starting with the Cavs the Eastern Conference leading Cleveland Cavaliers against Tyler Hero in the Heat at 7 Eastern with that Cavaliers backcourt led by Donovan Mitchell has been awesome And then Shay Gilis Alexander John Morant Thunder and the Grizzlies the best in the West after that NBA Countdown starts it all at 630 Eastern Nice to see Michael Jordan in the house tonight By the way to your earlier question I think Duke is playing better than anybody in the country but does it matter as much that Auburns playing much tougher schedule than Duke We could say yes but who really knows Because it doesnt matter once you get to the NCA tournament You can make the argument that Auburns better prepared So what You still have to beat your opponent You think that does matter significantly Look I played in the Big 10 when it felt like everybody was really good And we made the argument that if we didnt win its because we got beat up all year If we won it was because we got prepared But the reality is you just got find a way to win either way I think both those teams are set to beat anybody Still no guarantee Think we said that about Zia Williamson and RJ Barrett and that whole crew but they lost two Heres Potit Left it short a team that almost lost to Virginia Tech I believe before Michigan State took him down in the Elite 8 Davis on the drive his first points in over 11 minutes after the early couple of threes Oh you talk about that Duke dude They almost lost to UCF Yes I think Virginia Tech was the game after that though And then Michigan State got him inside Young great cut Good find from Burnham They opened up the whole right side of the floor and Trimble tried to take the pass away with no help behind him Applause Youngs got seven Davis off balance takes the bump from Rexiner and the best free throw shooter in Carolina history will shoot two Just a better team when when RJs got the ball out top I mean you just see the amount of attention that comes his way and denies the ball screen rolls takes his man away and then youre just wide open on that side of the floor Youre not going to have a lot of help You just have to stay between your man and the basket right Simple fundamentals I I would say its less about simple fundamentals as absolutes and its more about situational fundamentals You have to know that if you are wide open on your side of the floor you have to stay between your man and the basket You dont have your luxury of taking that pass away So situational fundamentals RJ Davis 88 tonight is his 169th career game Obviously he gets the fifth year of the co year He ties his former teammate Armando Bay for the most games played in ACC history The thing is hes hes been here right Like there are some guys that like theyve been at four different schools five different schools six years in college Its hard to keep up But look at the impact you can have by staying one place impact not just at a school but on a community and this Chapel Hill community is going to remember RJ Davis for a long time on the floor Thats taken away by Davis right in front of his bench Treble on the drive knifing through and he draws a foul I was wondering what the heck was going on The hokey bird is directly behind us right now leg I just I felt contact No freedom of movement over here Press row I felt contact I cylinder violation by the Hokeie Bird Just over here trying to pivot Hey were trying to work over here He doesnt talk Kevin Hes a creepy master I know but he can hear Look at his big floppy ears Carolina ties it largest lead Actually Im not sure he has ears Its a turkey right I asked him that He just gave me a fearsome point and walked away Confirm or deny Two free throws for Trimble and this is the largest lead for North Carolina A lot of it was set up by turnovers turnovers and runouts Its the last thing you want to do is allow Carolina to make it a fullcourt game Mike Young teams I think we know they can score but its not just about tempo and pace They pace you on the offensive end but they can do it in the half court Its their ability to operate that makes them so good Nice take down and score by Potique over Ty Claude whos getting some rare first half minutes Washington in foul trouble Potique can play tight end 69 260 out of Rice University Trimble from Jackson A rainbow is short Grabbed by Hammond the freshman point guard Music What a couple of weeks its been for Hammond this freshman whos had to take on Chucky Heert and JJ Starling Marcus Burton and now RJ Davis And hes played really well Pot back from shoot Hard drive and Potits fouled again Elijah Poti getting up close and personal with a photographer as Virginia Tech tries They have it If you just take away some turnovers and some easy baskets for Carolina that theyre probably beating in this game I think theyve played really well You know they havent won a ton of games but when you watch them like in preparation for this team you watch a team that you like and there are some good teams that that you struggle to like and that sounds mean but what I mean is do I like how they play Are they connected Do they have good body language Do they care for one another Like do they try to seek out opportunities for their teammates Like thats what you look for and this is a group that does that Good screen by Lub and he frees Davis his third three Four and more teams got to look at the flare screen Its just a tough one to cover and if you can dribble that thing over with a guy going underneath it sets up a ball screen coming right back to the middle Theres so many options with the flare screen particularly having that whole side of the floor and the baseline and block wide open A deep three by shoot off a screen by Potit Carolinas had some nice plays to start the game out of some timeouts Hubert Daviss Tar Hills looking for a season high six straight win Davis the defense Thats the true freshman Hammond who now switches on to Jackson Big height advantage results in a step back three Thats the problem with really good shooters When they put it on the floor theyre theyre creating rhythm with the dribble it becomes a high percentage Do get back on there with Hammond It sets up a ball screen right back into the middle of the lane where the big is not in position to hedge hard I just think flare screens are are something more teams should look at as an option Davis three for four from three Hes got a game high 13 Carolina is 7 for4 Continue their ridiculous shooting Tough one by shoot Grab by Powell and the Heels are off and running again rolled inside the loop and its stripped Good play by Hammond Had a season high three steals Saturday Hammond turns it right back over though down the floor to Jackson and his miss is cleaned up by Luben Lubens been really good for them I thought earlier this season and there are times when I still agree with this I like Washington at the five because of his defensive presence at the rim Just a deterrent but Lubmans been really good on the offensive end It kind of complements the whole threat offensively Boy this lineup is just a death squad right now for Carolina Davis off the turnover bangs it home Hes got 15 and its a 10 nothing Carolina surge I just think a big part of this fivegame stretch is RJ Davis having the ball in his hands more often And I think Elliot Cados got significant value but not at the top of the key That flattens the defense This is all good stuff Look at the big fella just running down cleaning it up Jay Davis hes just so crafty That midrange game its there The defenses know protect the rim protect the paint run guys off the threepoint line the midrange is there Again RJ Davis with the ball in his hands Its a different Carolina team He understands the different options coming off of ball screens Hes patient He gets guys on his back He can shoot the ball He can take it to the rim Hes made good decisions Foul was the second on Jackson Pamman misses a one and one And then Johnson lost the rebound Its Kade Tyson on the floor for the first time Trimble sensing a lane finishes gets fouled and continues this runaway Tarheel train Hes one of those guys It Its Hes got that other gear right Good hesitation Heres a good hesitation and go He got Potit to get up on his toes for a half second if that fraction of a second Youve got to stay down in a stance You got to show hands high stay in a stance getting wide He barely stood up and got beat 12 straight North Carolina points Foul was against Johnson his first and Seth Trimble makes it 13 in a row This is a a challenge here for Hammond You know you got to initiate You got to get them into some sort of offense Get a good possession for Carolina picking up fullcourt pressure which I love I think they should do more often Berm driving it in on Tyson whos called for a foul reaching in there So one and one coming for Ben Burnham Tysons got to get low at this level defensively You again get wide get low show hands high When you have length like that youve got to learn how to be physical and gap Use your length I dont think Berms pulling up for a fadeaway three or fadeaway jumper going to the right Music Kate Tyson has found himself back in the rotation a little bit Hes played in the last four Hes scored in the last four Really good against Florida State in the win last Monday Remember he was expected to be their big threepoint shooter And it hasnt happened coming from Belmont but they have not given up on him yet Well there was a stretch where it seemed like they had timeout taken by UNC him to actually showcase his athleticism and his explosiveness He needs space on the floor He needs he needs gaps to attack when hes got that Theyre a really good team and Kate Tyson may have been out of the lineup a little bit Ill tell you one thing that Virginia Techs not going to do Theyre not going to leave him wide open Scouting report still says hes lethal from outside Doesnt matter what youve done recently Decoy Decoys have value Lingering in the corner right now A step up to the wing with six to shoot Up for Trimble Had a huge first half and that three is deep but grabbed by Lubet Dying seconds of the first half Trimble with the punctuation mark on a 151 surge into the locker room What a really impressive run for last time he was on the floor it was 2121 You got to make sure you can keep the attack up keep pace on the game and maintain the rhythm you created in a great first half performance 258 after his second foul Burnham gets a clean look Clanks at three Hot has it taken away by Elliot Kado and Kado charges down the floor and he inserts himself into the proceedings very quickly Well the thing that that hurts Elliot Kadau is a reset on the defensive end They can force a reset meaning they stop the initial surge and now you have to operate It actually favors the defense Its something Elliot Cadau they they want to just flow one action to the other pot sets young another miss three Luben with a rebound Van Allen Luben with a nice first half Six more points now Six rebounds for Kim Powell Withers yet to score and Lubens got the offensive rebound and then throws it right over here You were hoping hoping for a higher bounce It could have been epic slide into our snoop I would have let you get counter in front of us I would have let you get it and that would have been hilarious if you fumbled it Lets see what happened to Potique Yeah he came down gingerly That Thats why Luben was able to get the offensive rebound It was five on four there for the first 10 seconds of the possession And he missed a game two games ago with a bone bruise in his knee Still pretty limited in practice Off the steel Tyler Johnson the freshman rebounded by Luben Virginia Tech hasnt hit a field goal in six plus minutes at this point This is the problem It stops and its just going to get easy to defend and to Drake Powell Hes rejected but a foul is called You saw RJ Davis push it up The initial surge three different guys came at the basketball The ball gets swung over to Elliot Gdau and it stopped That thats where youve got to have this thing flowing Its got to continue to build on the rhythm Dont stop the music Otherwise you become easy to defend Rihanna 101 Dont stop the music Such a dork Youve heard of Rihanna right I do know Rihanna Because before the game we discovered you didnt know the name of Taylor Swifts record setting tour the last two years Who cares Like its basketball season man Im not worried about what shes doing right now Im not either Im worried about what you did in the last two years Pretty much pretty much the last two years three children and they and theyre not like they cant sustain life on their own yet Like Ive got real problems Kevin Okay You live in a dream world where you go to concerts and know what her tour is named Yes Me and every other person on the planet besides you Were all in dream world and youre just living a oneman nightmare Hammet inside the arc and another rebound for Luben Freshman Powell once again has delivered great energy Gets it back from Kado Slashes and couldnt finish Rimmed it out around the sevenfooter Wesley Hamtts been really held in check after a careerhigh 21 against Syracuse Saturday Burnham slithering around a lub Second time hes done that tell you the sit downs there when you get it inside the paint whether you you know get a layup or not you just sit down good things happen Luben and Withers if Im covering Kado and theres a ball screen or any action that brings two up around the basketball look for the slip or look for the split pops that out of the air 17 to shoot for the Hookies checking in for your hook Hes never seen Burnham here kind of sit down right You sit down Good patience good footwork Get underneath on the other end You got good stuff happen I mean this is just a good strong attack Good footwork Finish on the opposite side Thats good stuff Theres the slip dump down Withers Good basketball First basket for Withers Shoot Tough night for him What do you think he said when he missed Can I repeat it Well Ronnie is ping you so Im not sure Just the way you said his name I know I realized it as soon as I said it Its either the best or the worst basketball game Yeah Its like the former kicker Ryan Longwell miss a 48y old field goal and your last name is Longwell or Chris Buitt Thats even a worse name for a kicker Applause Knocked out of bounds It will stay with the Hokes I dont know kickers names either So just to make Taylor Swift feel better Well we found your only two blind spots Hate that I got the reference inside to Young Hes fouled on the way up See Virginia Tech has the ability to operate and get good shots And a lot of its going to come on these back door cuts Theyre really telegraphing passes around the perimeter And if the defense is going to take that pass away up around the perimeter just continue to back cut Even if you dont get the ball it softens the defense as it create defense and creates a chase The hardest thing for for guys to get in basketball that the play you make may not be for you but itll take a defender away Itll give the other guy the opportunity to do something Foul was on Luben whos first going to see potine back on the floor I always say that about football Football is is so much about your responsibilities right Where you train a linebacker to take this gap knowing that its not to make the play Its to occupy that gap and allow someone else who has the responsibility of another gap to actually make the play So theres trust involved Its really about your responsibility basketball theres so much rhythm and flow The fluidity of the game makes it hard to focus on your responsibilities and we think of it more as playm which a lot of what weve seen from Carolina in this fivegame win streak That rhythm that flow that connectivity that took a lot of time to get there It took Hubert Davis time to to find the lineups that worked Now by the way I know Carolina fans are going to say Well why didnt they figure this out a week or two into the season these these lineups these guys were here Whats whats your response to that Well its a combination of Hubert learning this team and this team learning how to play together Its a different look You dont have that inside presence So you really cant go inside out Youve got to space differently You also have to figure out how to move Kadau on the floor When he keeps getting the ball up top the defense sags and its going to get harder to get good shots Davis out of the double Luben spinning and scoring and and with Lubens another one who whos been a little bit more deliberate recently You look over the last five game stretch he hasnt had to do as much because of the good guard play and and the scoring that theyve had but when hes deliberate and quick about making a move thats when hes at his best Two shy of his first double double of the year Hammonds wild pass gets knocked out of bounds North Carolina led by 17 Georgia Tech on Thursday According to our ESPN brackettology Virginia Tech is currently the first team out of the projected womens field ACC is loaded this year Womens hoops NC State getting the one seat over Notre Dame So a huge game Virginia Tech against Georgia Tech Thatll be Thursday morning from Greensboro and then well have the mens tournament next week from Charlotte Trimble will be cutting Washington Its North Carolina by 21 Kevin Brown John Crispen with you Tar Hills win They would win their sixth straight Theyre the third team out of Joe Lonards projected mens field And its a big night on the bubble A ton of bubble teams are playing mostly after this game So Carolina trying to get into the projected field before a date with Duke on Saturday Thats a soft bubble too So not a lot of great teams there Carolinas playing better as of late but you just look at the overall the overall resume its its just a challenge and and I think they played some of the the toughest games early when they hadnt yet known who they are Theres the first four out the next four out Theres a nice basket by Potit who draws a foul I also think you know Im just sitting here and Im I cant believe its already March And I think part of that is youve seen a lot of these teams grow and its February March when theyre finally figuring out who they are and playing their best basketball And that may be one of the new realities in the way the game is today when you have one and two your teams if youre lucky Its going to take a while to figure out who they are and how to play and let alone how to win at this level I know weve showed this uh statistic that nobodys had a record of 1 in and 10 or worse against quad one teams and made it as an atlarge bid I Im just curious about this year It is a it is a softer bubble I know people say that every year but it really is a softer bubble this year And Carolina only has one loss in the bottom three quadrants which is a onepoint home loss to Stanford Rex Steiner for three Thats a rounded out They played a very challenging nonconference They are playing really well down the stretch I wonder if they get more grace for the lack of bad losses and for the way theyre playing down the stretch if they finish the season strong Do you have a problem as Washington hits Uh do you have a problem if they get in And in a way part of why they got in is because its Carolina and they did play t such a tough schedule See I dont really mind that on the surface I think there are other teams out there but if the bubbles soft I dont mind taking the team that tested themselves early and put themselves in a tough spot so long as theyre playing well as of late I think who you are as of late matters more than anything else I agree And that criteria is not listed criteria for the selection committing anymore It used to be Jackson buries another three So you have Washington with his fourth of the year Jackson follows and Carolina extends its largest lead Mike Young is out of answers type players The Crispen three Good segue Hopefully no bad blood between those three You know what I mean Now I did get that reference Stop it 25 is the lead for UNC A game high Young cant convert and Jackson had it knocked away by Johnson And then Davis does great to help strip the ball away from Burnham I like this lineup on the floor for Carolina See what they can put together on both ends here Put together a turnover here Maybe hell like it next time Young into Trimble and Trimble with another rejection or excellent to be called a travel So no block shot Just a turnover and its the 11th against Virginia Tech Travel just goes up It was kind of like the wall up He just goes up straight I mean elevates Oh yeah Just a deterrent He didnt even touch it He just deterred it What do you like about him off the bench Energy explosiveness Oh Jackson My goodness The last six games Ian Jackson has been volcanic from three The key is just balancing out his overall game get him to defend use his length really buy into being a defensive player because the more you defend the more minutes you get on the floor The more minutes he gets on the floor the tougher this team is Its almost his responsibility to defend so he can maximize his minutes on the floor cuz Carolinas better when hes out there Great spacer He is 16 for 25 from three over the last six Withers cans another 11 for 20 from three North Carolina the hottest threepoint shooting team in the country over the last three weeks is at it again They were 46 in the last five from three Theyre 55 tonight Look theyve gotten some help in the sense that you know Miami not a great defensive team particularly defending the three Syracuse going to give up a lot of points been able to create rhythm Trimbo is fouled I mean its threes and layups right now for Carolina It is an analytical darlings basketball And these are just such high quality shots all over the court Thats kind of like a chicken and egg conversation Like what what comes first Well ultimately you knock down threes you ele you lift the defense the defense has to cover more of the half court You elev you lift the defense you have room to attack off the bounce particularly in transition If you got to defend threes in transition thats why I say I love a transition three because it makes a defense defend for a full 30 Its not that fake offense for the first 10 seconds You have to take the initial surge away which means you have to close out to the threepoint line When you do that in transition easy to get to the basket off the bounce What a cool shot This is a really cool arena It is cool 64 season pass the Coliseum Part of the reason that it would be great to see Virginia Tech build a winning program again which theyre not far from who can do it is this place can get so loud when it gets packed Knocked away Trimble back from Kado Look out below Ian Jackson had a freeze frame Hands raised to the ceiling fans here at the castle before Trimble was even fully on the way up Its a 15 to nothing Carolina run and Young ends it Music Has the ability at times to get lost defensively and on that play if he just stays with Young trails him over and then gets back Hes fine Sometimes he has a tendency to get lost I think its because of his athleticism he can make up ground pretty quickly because of his athleticism Oh lord Jackson only his second miss in six threepoint attempts I like the aggression from Carolina on offense though Be an offensive team Especially up big at the half Yeah Fire away man I mean this is a game that looks like its going to do wonders frankly to their net rating All those efficiency numbers which do matter part of the selection committees criteria I just think they look good I know thats not part of the criteria but it sure should be No they do look good And look the next game is Duke on Saturday They better be really really good in that one But theyre obviously playing exponentially better than they did the first time going into the Duke game Gdau wraps it through to Withers and a shot is rejected And then Withers just heaves it up and loses it A 17point lead at the half Carolinas plus 48 If youre not dont even sweat it because on the scouting report they want to run you off the line continue to seek out shot opportunities cuz its going to get everybody else open 40 from three for Ian Jackson Freshman from the Bronx number seven in the ESPN 100 Came into college with a lot of hype He certainly lived up to it most of the year Jaden shoot with a three for Tech out of timeout Little pump fake relocate side step open three Good stuff That more than doubles Virginia Techs bench points by the way Carolinas bench outscoring Techbench 325 Tortured Hookies department most of the night here in Blackburg And Powell adds to it The 12th North Carolina three Drake Prows just scratching the surface to how good he can be Really develop his footwork a little bit better and shot preparation to get those shots off quicker Huge ceiling in his game Johnson missed it and its cleaned up by Wesler So backto back bench buckets Remember Virginia Tech without Toby Luell tonight their leading score and rebounder They expect him back for the regular season finale Saturday at Clemson Hes out with a lower leg injury Its tough to overcome when you rely on your bench so much It just it mixes up your rotations And some of the players who scored those points off the bench the last three theyre starting today as well Jackson fouled on the way up That would be part of mixing up your number Yeah Out of necessity By the way we havent seen Rodney Brown Jr tonight a cow transfer who is back from a toe injury He was available on Saturday Hes available today were told but he certainly doesnt look available right there Where are the ones Youd be surprised what a bad toe will do to you Applause Play a whole year with a broken toe I stunk Like its one of those things where youre like I can run but I cant walk And its just annoying more so than anything else Do Do you feel it on your release Does it hurt you on your shot The toe Yeah you you do It it messes with the whole rhythm of the shot because as you step into it you dont want to drive your right foot If its your right foot you dont want to drive it too hard to hit the end of your shoe The the worst thing about a lot of injuries is the things that make you think about them right Cuz the whole idea of basketball and the fluidity of the game is you dont want to think Wesler inside to quote the Taylor Swift of his time Dont think twice Its all right number 22 His second personal foul Now Im totally lost Oh that was Bob Dylan To the line for your Hookies number five Patrick Wesler Did that win any awards by the way Uh a complete unknown went 0 for eight at the Oscars but it got eight nominations so I hope it was happy to be there Wesler I bet they were happy to go lose Usually not winning means losing Yeah tight best actor race Adrien Brody beat Timothy Shalamé for The Brutalist Adrien Brodys second Academy Award for best actor Im so glad you said his name I now know how to pronounce it What Its Adrien Brody Tend to be shallow You got to pronounce it like Adam Sandler did Shalom I didnt actually watch Jackson Powell Another please sir man Almighty 13 for 24 Carolinas tied a season high for threes 58 plus percent from the field 4 from three And the positioning theyre in on on the defensive end for rebounding Look out Luben up top from Kado First Carolina double double for Vin Allen Luben I think Carolinas been impressive I mean yes its frustrating if youre Virginia Tech and theyre down Oh boy Why not Wesler his first threepoint attempt of the year I would have loved it if he pulled out the archer or something when youre down 36 Why not let it fly Carols playing really well Theyve really utilized skip passes well which helps get create space on the floor Jackson skips it to Powell Withers Kado and that ball will be rebounded by Applause Burnham Man oh man this Carolina team is a joy to watch when they get going How do you stop this defense The answer is Elliot Kado has 10 assists as well It has been a thorough beat down for North Carolina on the road And this is the game before the Duke game which sometimes can be a little bit wonky Carolina and Duke players will tell you you try not to look ahead to that big game Duke certainly didnt last night They bludgeoned Wake Forest and Carolina certainly hasnt today Largest deficit for the Hokes this season I just think its a different Carolina team right now It doesnt mean that theyre going to beat Duke I think theyll compete better against Duke James Brown the freshman on the floor for the first time travels Let me ask you this If Carolina plays Duke close if they play him tight how much of a data point should that be in their tournament It should be a big data point Are you playing well Like who you are as of late matters more today than it ever has because most teams dont know who they are until two months into the season And then you want to try to find a rhythm and get better and thats what theyve done Conor Servin Hey Connor Servin in his 16th game of the year just scored his first points Graduate student from Prairie City Illinois So we got Wesler who takes his first three and hits it And Servin with his first points I like Wesler He just really gets after it Hes battled Hes had his hands full but just appreciate this This Virginia Tech team young group they played hard they fought and then theyve been dealing with this Jacksons fifth three of the game Just knew it was going in Like as soon as he caught and released him like if Youngs not there on the catch to run him off the line its its going in You mentioned Isaiah Evans who we saw last week at Miami If you have a hand thats even remotely down against Isaiah Evans youve lost Its starting to feel that way when youre guarding Jackson And and its a good thing And the thing is you got to remember now I learned this too late in my career but when teams scout you they typically watch your makes If you make some tough shots youre going to get hard closeouts the next game You can prepare for that knowing what the scout is And you have to work on whether that team has the tendency to actually play to the scout or not Tyson shot fake gets it back from Kado Kade Tyson inside determined to shoot and couldnt convert it Rebound to Burdom You get what Im saying though We watch film on other teams and you see guys like Isaiah Evans he and Jackson make these tough shots Inside to Servin Now all he does is score Make these tough shots You know the defense the next game out is going to close hard Now Carolinas got to look at this and go All right man Ds going to be running us off the threepoint line Youve got to be ready to be drivers and then become willing passers Just harder Dukes length defensively They close up passing lane so quickly Jackson come on In and out And great job by Tyson soaring in there for the rebound He gets it back and he sticks a three Tyson I tell you if Kade Tyson found that earlier on this year could be a different Carolina team just as a floor spacer I know hes had to develop defensively at this level which does take time but man almighty they they have weapons Cado with a dozen assists Hes one shy of a careerhigh Young misses Every time Elliot Kadau passes somebody the ball theyre open beyond the threepoint line And Carolinas now hit a season high 15 And Brown is denied by Burner A good recovery by Burner Yeah couple of blocks for him tonight Hammond Ben Hammond Little quick release layup That was special Have an official timeout too He had 15 in the first half RJ Davis has not scored in the second He hasnt played the last 10 minutes And it doesnt matter Everybody scoring for North Carolina Double figures uh five players double figure assists Kadau with 12 of them The third team out of Joe Lonards projected field This could be a big day to make a move There are a lot of bubble teams in action with tough games as put home by Triple Everything was done really well defensively there Hammond actually stripped him but Triple does a really good job of getting 5050 balls Quick hands aggressive after the ball Carolina 15 threes First time in two years February 11th 2023 They hit one more three It would be the most in the Hubert Davis era Deep shot clock Its Young from the logo Texas one of those bubble teams tied near the end of the first half at Mississippi State That is an important game for North Carolina Texas has fallen out of Joel Lonards projected field Jackson offensive foul Wipe it off Oh what was the last time you saw a charge Want to play at the rim It helped that Severn was there for a solid 5 seconds But we have not seen a lot of those Am I right or wrong You are right And I love that I bet youre right Uh by the way elsewhere in the bubble Georgia won by nine at South Carolina Bulldogs are in Joels projected field They had a big win at Texas on Saturday Baylor down two near the end of the first half against TCU Baylor quietly has slipped down to the bubble Not a lot of great wins for Scott Drews Bears this year Hey theres Rodney Brown Jr his first game since February the 1st and he immediately sticks a three I have a thought Kevin We were talking about you know Auburn and some of the top teams in the SEC playing against such a a tough conference Does it prepare them I actually think it better prepares the teams that just get in from the SEC because theyve seen the best and sweat very little Yeah does that make sense Logically Georgia Arkansas on that boat Tyson slashes into the defense scores it and Yubert Davis will take a substitution timeout here Get some walkons in the game Just think about that I mean I go back to 2001 my sophomore year and a Penn State team made a little sweet 16 run And I guess people outside of the program thought we were crazy but we had beaten Illinois early in the season They were a top five team We had beaten Michigan State they were a top 10 team at time Beat Kentucky when they were a top 10 team So we felt as if we could play with anyone and I think it gave us confidence once we got in I do think theres a benefit for the teams that just barely get in when they faced better competition all year Whereas for Auburn you could easily say man theyre probably worn out Maybe they get bored Dante Mayo Rexiner grabbed it out of bounds North Carolina has Dante Mayo Jr freshman walkon in the game Russell Hawkins sophomore from Charlotte John Hol freshman from Hickory Tech going deeper into its bench as well Peter Carr freshman from Westchester Pennsylvania is in there Connor Venibal sophomore as well So walkonss getting some run Carolina trying to get to 90 again inside to Ty Claw There you go Theyve been averaging 91 a game in the last five and theyve hit that mark again One minute one minute remaining Six straight 80 plus point games in ACC play for North Applause Carolina They just look the part again The question is going to be how much the quad one record hurts them But if they can steal a win against Duke a couple in the ACC tournament theyre probably going to be March Madness bound They look the part right now Can they seal the deal in the next two weeks and get there Brown sets up Carr and he airballs a three I think a lot of that comes down to what happens around that bubble Hard hard to expect Carolina to beat Duke think Duke is that good right now Its games fluid Next year it could be completely different A lot of bubble watching tonight for North Carolina and they can watch in peace This was another flatout dominant display Northtown
