and leads the league in steals he has been fantastic at managing all aspects of the game for Pat Kelsey and hes back as you saw just that one game missed with the groin injury told us today it was weird sitting on the sidelines watching for only the second time in his fouryear collegiate career Louisville on the road in the black begins with it and James Scott mask and all is out there as well after a facial injury that he suffered on Saturday as well in a win over Miami and the scoring begins with Chucky heer Chucky looks pretty good right there Id say late clock he is fantastic he can break off the offense at anytime see the starters for NC State Brandon Huntley Hatfield one of the Louisville transfers for Kevin Keats in the pack hes back after missing the last three with a shoulder injury there he is with the post entry he matches up with Scott got the double and then Marcus Hill walks with it its a great job by Javon Hadley bring the double take NC State deep into the shot clock Pat Kelce will bring two to the ball but they rotate so well out of that On The Backs side defense has really improved for Louisville one of the reasons they sit at 18 six overall as you check out the full starting five an entirely new team of course this year for Pat Kelce Hadley is one of four in double figures Edwards was awesome didnt come off the floor on Saturday gave it up back up top to the Wisconsin transfer Chucky heer late shot clock again weave the pass underneath for Scott that does not count as a dunk even though he has 52 of them which is what he had last year James Scott I dont think that counts as a dunk have to Rattle the rim for it to be dunk we need two hands on the rim for safety heres Huntley Hatfield who lost it on the way up Dantes Styles tried to rescue it and Edwards pushes gave it up and and the pass tooo hot to handle for Hadley heurn ran it down big break for NC State early because that was a fouronone opportunity for Louisville Hadley couldnt knock it down from long range and then Scott tried to keep it alive and hes already adjusting at that mask after he lost both his front teeth and then had a tooth driven so far up into his upper gums that they had to extract pieces of it so thats what hes wearing today what a competitor right that mask I dont even know how he can breathe out of that but he looks fine and hes hes a tough competitor Marcus Hill couldnt knock down the Deep one Styles got the offensive rebound and then Jaden Taylor swirled it out but another offensive rebound for the pack Huntley Hatfield no on the face up and Scott clears it Huntley Hatfield has not played in the last three games bothered by a shoulder injury did not make the trip West against Callen Stanford Music back out high for Edwards to knock it down and its a seven zip start for Louisville on the road when Terrence Edwards is Catch and shoot with his feet under his shoulders he is a much better threepoint shooter than his numbers show only 30 this season but as you said it can look a lot better for the reigning Sun Bel Player of the Year at James Madison NC States doing a good job getting the ball below the free throw line now they got to make a play out of that double team Hillin create hes their leading score and it rolled off but another fresh 20 another offensive rebound Taylor sticks it and the first points finally for an offensively challenged NC State team well NC States got to play through the double team theyve got to get a piece of the paint and they are doing a really Goods got them overall number 29 right now and their adjusted offensive efficiency is in the top 25 you getting a look at the clock situation here it looks like it maybe just took too long because the game clock stopped and its now set at 1648 with 28 seconds on the shot clock so wipe away what 20 seconds there and couple minutes of our lives and back to action so 73 the early margin for Louisville coming off that win against Miami at home at the KFC Young Center Saturday 8878 for a team that was picked ninth in the ACC heern playing off two feet heres Edwards cut off there by Hill Edwards with the size Advantage scores attos Baseline out of bounds sideline out of bounds you have to win that number against Louisville theyre really good at that why are they so good at it because they practice it hard they know exactly execution wise what theyre going to get and theyre an excellent screening and cutting team that stuff doesnt always show up on the stat sheet but thats what theyre good at and thats why theyre so efficient Taylor driving kick and then they moved it for Styles the Georgetown transfer and another offensive rebound from hudley Hatfield but a turnover to jabad Hadley who lays it in turnovers for touchdowns something Kevin Keats always talks about but it plagues the wolf pack here and it is all Louisville in the first four minutes well Terrence Edwards picking up where he left off coming off a season High 27 in the win at home over Miami it was a combination of threes and dimes and hard drop when they thats a terrible pass right there from Tates Styles who does get the block on rain Smith youre coming off the timeout and that is a horrible play right there by NC State that is their fourth turn turn over thats the atos Im talking about so Cuts both ways and Kevin kes all kinds of frustrated hes going back to the bench immediately for Marcus Hill Michael comes out scratching my head too over here like you know the one thing about Kevin keatss team is they have played hard all season now they have lost 10 games in the league seven of which have been by one or two possessions its been close you see on an eight game lose streak their longest in 17 years tie up here and a held ball will give it to the pack see thats the kind of effort that you have to have right here if youre going to pull the upset in your home court Louisvilles favorite in this one thats just the first turnover for the Cardinals well Trey Parker is into the game five in white Uber confident freshman Guard from fville North Carolina last four games hes averaging a dozen points per game and he is never shot lets it fly right away and Parker is trying to pick up where he left off on the California road trip scrum for the loose ball and another held ball will give this one to Louisville to your point and he is a good player and he does like to shoot it but Trey Parker when youre coming off the bench and you barely have a sweat going the first thing you do is fire a three his game is getting in the paint driving downhill and then setting up his threepoint shot and he did a really good job of doing that particularly late in the Stanford game its a team that has really struggled to score like we said that Kevin Keat has said they dont have a superstar and he will rotate through a lot of bodies looking for answers but I like the way hes trying to get lower than Chucky right here in a defensive stance thats the kind of effort you got to Applause bring abubacar trayor banging with Ben Middlebrooks spinning on the Block and walked with it and its a second Louisville turnover see Ben Middlebrooks can stand you up in the post and most times you dont need to bring a double to the Ben Middlebrooks matchup plus hes got some size in this matchup right here against treor its a really good defensive Music job 610 senior Middlebrook second year after transferring in from Clemson got to stay out of foul trouble Parker off the bounce tough step back swirls out those are the first couple of shots from Parker who ran it down found Hill and a goal on Noah Waterman much better possession for NC State and it results in two points see the effort from Parker to get it back for Marcus Hill the Bowling Green transfer first six minutes Sixpoint Louisville lead on the road Hadley with the size advantage on Parker going to work with the floater on the Baseline Javon Hadley has every move in his bag he can shoot it he can post it and hes really good with that float game very mature Colorado transfer hes been as consistent as Chucky heer all season nearly a turnover and it is from Marcus Hill heern gave it up Smith the sniper buries it you cannot make a mistake and lose him in transition the turnover with the team speed is going to be really challenging for NC State to stick with got to take care of the basketball NC State a team that does not turn it over very much they average fewer than 10 turnovers per game you how theyve got five already theyre first in the ACC and only turning it over nine times on the average Taylor got shut off there and now Styles working on Hadley too strong tror clears it see how quickly Taylor got on rain Smith you cant lose sight of him shot fake and in the midrange a runner for Smith his ninth twopoint Basket in ACC play in his 63rd in his career cuz he doesnt take two thats in four years for rain Smith the azi Parker from long range first points for Trey Parker coming off a season High 19 at Stanford Hadley running the floor couldnt finish through the contact from Styles you can see Parkers motor he could be a real spark and helping NC State with some of their offensive issues but theres another turnover a sixth and then adley gets the Music Applause goal uncharacteristically turning the ball over and its allowed Louisville to get numbers going the other way or an advantage just like that so 28 is the margin for Louisville you see has outscored NC State just with its points off turnovers alone middle Brooks on that short roll found Taylor couldnt knock it down in the rebound to the Freshman Kai Roots NC State worked on that in their shoot around today and you have to make good decisions in that short role and Ben midd Brooks made a good decision heurn spun it out Waterman whos always got that high motor ran it down playing through a broken thumb that has four pins in it 93 in the black Noah Waterman the sixthe senior late shot clock this is heern backs it out Edwards Hoy and he Music hits timeout Kevin Keats again wins in 20 days last year and it all started for NC State against Louisville in the first round of the ACC tournament in Washington DC a year ago then mdle Brooks misses it in tight Louisvilles got the big lead in this one up by 15 the first 9 Music minutes heurn turned the corner got it out high for Edwards constant motion every cut gets a piece of the paint so well drilled heurn came to get it the skip for Waterman on the Baseline Drive and an offensive foul NC State matched Louisvilles energy on every action of the basketball that time they get the stop and look whos here speaking of that run last year DJ horn we were talking with Kevin Keats today and he was telling us about the day before that first round game against Louisville last year he said they were tight and it was because they knew they were going to be playing without DJ horn in that first round game they got the win after trailing that lowly Louisville team at halftime middle Brooks on the Block Miss could use a little dj horn scoring right now Im sure they wish they had him another year was Music explosive Edwards left that short and then run down by Taylor out ahead of the pack and a foul on heurn they get bailed out there by a whistle on James Scott deep one falls for the 30 senior Bri pass inate kid who hadnt scored in the last five games and then a foul committed on Jaden Taylor with Edwards coming up court its the first on Taylor well stop and start flow to this one the first chunk of the first half yeah we hadnt had any fouls until the last 30 seconds we got three Hadley has oconnell on him got the quick hook after his turnover earlier but back in for Kevin Keats Edwards working on the Freshman herd Edwards on the up fake took the contact and got the roll Terrence Edwards plays the game hard and he plays the game low watch right here how low he gets his shoulders and his hips he gets heard in the air and and finishes through that contact whats playing low allow you to do because you mentioned it twice now both sides of the ball what Im looking at hips and shoulders and so when your shoulders are lower than the person that youre guarding youve got leverage and you got to move your feet then when youre on the offensive side youre trying to get your hips and shoulders past the defender Taylor lost it heern had ripped it away and its another held ball and it will stay at this end of the floor with the wolf pack and then some barking back and forth with Javon Hadley in the middle of it for Applause Louisville Tony Henderson goes to check the monitor just quickly but it will stay with NC State down by 14 here in the first half oconnell Huntley Hatfield pass Styles and Hill to five on the floor for Kevin Keats heres Hill off Target from deep and another offensive rebound the fifth overall for Brandon Huntley Hatfield OK Connell in the midrange no Huntley Hatfield runs down a six okell swirls out a triple Hadley rning the floor again backs it out for heurn the trailer buries it when you push and you take the ball to the Baseline it makes the defense seek the level of the ball it opens up the top of the floor and heurn just steps into it tipped out of bounds by Edwards it will stay with NC State one of Louisvilles most consistent and best offensive habits is how hard they run the floor its an advanced pass by Chucky the court to Hadley and then the defense gets to the level of the ball and Chucky just steps to the top of the floor and knocks it down again if youre just joining us Chucky heern back after missing Saturdays game with a pulled groin and we get a foul here that goes against Louisville heern was telling us today that shoot around its the third straight year hes pulled his groin so hes used to it said this one was not as bad as last years and last year he didnt even miss time good pass out of the double but oconnell missed it short and NC State is four of 19 from the floor but good hustle back the other way for Michael oconnell and the crowd stirs here because Trey Parker just got off the NC State bench so you get a sense of what Wolfpack Nation thinks of the Freshman well I think hes emerging and it takes freshman sometimes a little longer and Trey Parker is getting extended minutes he played 28 minutes in Stanford thats the most that hes played and he delivered in his minutes and he was in the game at the end so you can see that Kevin Keats is starting to trust the Freshman a little bit more you got to earn that in practice see what hes done his last four games had a big game at Duke that left John Shire afterwards and holy smokes with some of the shots Trey Parker headit pass hits a long two for Bon pass who has supplied some scoring Off the Bench Hadley good shot fake off the roll from heern theyre going to take a look at this they might they might look at Applause this its just a nice pick and roll Hadley with a good pump fake and theyre not going to look at it so theyre its the first on Trey Parker and itll send Javon Hadley to the line native of St Paul Minnesota averaging 12 and seven this year for Louisville Joe lardy right now has Louisville as an eight seed 29th in the net 14 and one outside of quad one today is a quad 2 game for Pat Kelce and after tonight its two quad twos left and then four quad 3es remaining for the cards got to handle your business got to take care of business and you got an opportunity here on the road theyve been convincing so far these first 13 minutes from the Lenovo Center pass sticks another guy hadnt scored in the last five games and Brion pass has eight this one is deflected out of bounds by Trey Parker when we left shoot around today the last thing Kevin Keats said to his team is energy everyone involved everyone engaged from coaches to managers to everyone on the bench to keep their focus and to bring their level high bring a high level to the 40 minutes good drop off and trayor lays it in and Kevin Keat said my energy level his he said was going to be off the charts he said you better match it today or dont even get on the bus over to the arena Kevin kes energy is always high he is a hard worker hes an excellent teacher in the gym not everybody gets to see what hes doing in practice guys got to make plays sometimes its not always about Applause scheme Smith in transition finds Edwards and he walked with it thats the fifth turn turnover on Louisville one of two active coaches in the league right now that have been to the final four the other Hubert Davis its amazing the turnover weve had in the ACC the last half dozen years you knew there would be a transition and were in it right now record of 9 and 14 overall for Kevin Keats in the pack as we told you two and 10 in League action heres Huntley hatf last two years at Louisville last year was honorable mention all ACC pass was the last eight for the pack shot clock winding down and now Parker Crossing up Smith on the drive couldnt get it to go rain Smith a lot of times teams try to pick on him and hes good enough tror couldnt haul in the pass from heurn thats part of what we were talking about the defense has really improved and and Pat Kelce showed his team all the numbers about it and said where they had to get to this year Well if youve been in their practice you know what level it is here there is everyone is involved everyones engaged styles with a step and he scores off the glass and those are the first points for the senior Dantes Styles who averages 10 I mean you have to be North and South in your quarter court against a team that plays as aggressively as Louisville does you cant cant just go side to side and stay on top of the floor trouble on the post entry from treor for Hadley and then Parker scooped it up Huntley Hatfield follows it up with two more and NC state has cut into the deficit down to a dozen Huntley Hatfield has six offensive rebounds but thats the first time he scored on one he has been Relentless his first points at all for the senior from Clarksville Tennessee Music heurn around the corner nearly coughed it up Smith got it back comes up short and Hunley Hatfield snatches another rebound Taylor backs it up probing and now got it back from Parker Taylor driving on Smith but traveling the call and a seventh NC State turnover I theyre doing a really good job now of taking care of the ball in this segment of the game getting into the paint now you got to make a play on balance once you get there dant Styles had a great drive down the lane line two possessions ago then you get an offensive rebound from Huntley Hatfield youre starting to stack a couple plays together Middlebrook spells Huntley Hatfield whos up to nine rebounds overall here in the first 15 plus minutes considering he hasnt played in the last three games thats excellent that shoulder issue you mentioned hes missed five of the last eight overall a shoulder problem that has gone on for the better part of a month traveling on heurn and hes got a couple of turnovers and Louisvilles got seven of its own Applause now really good job by NC State defensively right here you can see theyre digging in a little bit you got to dig your heels in at some Music point Signs of Life late in this first half from the wolf pack at Music Home Parker navigating scooped it high off the window though cleared by Scott heern went down slow to join the Applause mix off the crossover working on Styles and spinning back out for Edwards with a game high 10 and see St just play tough right here good cut beautiful pass you got to go punch for punch with Louisville cuz they are never going to back Applause down so a dozen now for Edwards off that sweet feed from James Scott heurn poked it away and heres Scott thats a dunk 53 on the season and the First with the Bane mask from James Scott we say that because the first basket he kind of laid it in there we were not going to give him a dunk on that one one of the nations leaders in dunks this year heres Taylor heurn switched on to him now Brion pass drives on Smith and got fouled on the drive it on both ends and this is an excellent cutting and screening team things that dont show up on the stat sheet and they play with great Pace not just in the fast fast break up and down in the vertical but their Pace in the quarter court is outstanding offensively as well and that can be challenging against teams to guard all their personnel cuz they got five weapons on the floor Smith lost the handle Brion pass slams it down hes four for four hes got 12 Off the Bench for NC State off the pogo stick the sixfoot Brion pass and ing more life into the Wolfpack good shot F from Edwards working on oconnell and a foul is Music called good d by the Wolfpack it allows them to get this easy one right here Brion pass throwing it down minutes had been down the last five games we told you didnt even play on Saturday in Palo Alto a guy who said before the season I could have transferred but I didnt complain just stayed the course here in Raleigh Scott got the offensive rebound shot clock doesnt reset and heres Edwards around the screen Edwards floater to strong loose ball Hadley back out Waterman cant stick it Scott goes soaring but okell ripped it down pass whats another left it short but the follow Paul mcneel cuts it to Applause 10 rain Smith hasnt had a touch in a while lets see if they can get something for him right here instead Edwards throw it away not on the same page with the cutting Waterman Waterman is supposed to stay in the corner on that to keep the floor spread Brion pass in transition and Paul mcneel Jr thats an offensive rebound again NC State is winning the battle on the glass on the offensive end they have been fantastic on the o o boards 10 offensive rebounds for the wol pack who are down by as many as 17 here in the first half Middlebrooks gets fouled by Scott and they they can trim this to single digits considering it was 23 to8 and Kevin Keats had to burn a couple of timeouts and the one thing you can say right here theyve turned the ball over but their offensive rebounding has sort of nullified that but the energy and effort that he asked his team to play with they have brought it tonight especially some of the bench sources for Kevin Keats and NC State hey one of the best womens basketball games on the schedule is tomorrow night Madison Booker and number three Texas coming off that win Sunday against South Carolina square off with Georgia Amore and number eight Kentucky 7 Eastern ESPN two in the out there are two allamericans playing in that game on my top 10 list Madison Booker for Texas Georgia Amore the point guard for Kenny Brooks at Kentucky 19 points a game and leads the SEC an assist thats going to be a good one it really is leading into a huge weekend of womens Hoops as well NC stayed on a 70 run Scott couldnt stop it Styles clears it in the final minute of the first half you got a two for one opportunity right here if you can score quickly Connell got shut off nearly a turnover cant get by Chucky you cannot get by him he picked it and lays it in thats the first team all ACC point guard making a play on the defensive end to sap the energy from NC State headed toward halftime one of the best on ball Defenders right here number four 24 in Black shadowing oconnell heern went digging on middle Brooks oconnell cant stroke the three heern with 6 seconds to work with and he gets fouled NC State with a couple fouls to give country many Chucky dolls to drum up support rain Smith hits the three in the after timeout Wizardry again from Pat Kelce and his staff and just like hey can I still lift tomorrow morning he is that type of guy and a reason why like you said Pat Kelce just loves him as Michael oconnell commits the foul on rain Smith every cut is sharp on a straight line every screening angle is dictated and calculated to get a switch every dribble of the ball is Music pounded Louisville led by as many as 17 in the first half split the ball screen beautifully I mean so quick to make that read in real time that happens really very quickly you got to rep that a lot and then Scott goes charging in to step in front of a casual bounce pass Chucky he had five assists couple of steals in the first half as well I mean Brandon Huntley Hatfield jumps out like theyre going to bring two to the ball and he reads that so Music well styles with the post entry for Huntley Hatfield Huntley Hatfield was pointing to the wing for the entry okado gets his first to drop had been 0 for four from the floor in the first half including 0 for three from long Applause range Kevin Keats will tell you Michael okells a steadying force on the floor but hes got to have more activity he needs more productivity look at rain Smith the ball does not stay in his hands long before he lets it Fly he has made 94 threepointers this season and second most in the country we get a foul away from the ball that goes against NC State and dant Styles I had Louisville earlier in the year and I asked them to look this up for me in the Florida State game he made six triples and the average amount of time that the ball stayed in his hands on the six made triples was like 16 seconds oh come on average unreal he just gets rid of it so quickly and purely you saw approaching 100 chasing down the taquan dean record from 20 years ago for one season heern left it short and then a foul on the rebounding action goes against James Scott and thats his Applause third watch Chucky heer right here gets all the way to the Applause rim wow yeah he was even impressed by himself was right into your living room that would make me reference an old NC State player here sometimes I shoot with my left sometimes I shoot with my right Im amphibious Im amazing long range triple n there for Brion pass who had those dozen in the first half and abubacar trayor ran down the loose ball Smith wanted a deep one spun it out but it will stay at this end of the floor last Touch by Jaden Taylor range in the gym a lot of confidence Pat Kelce runs a lot of great stuff for him but his teammates understand when to get rain Smith the ball and that is when hes open I want to come back in my next life as rain Smith and just shoot for a living threw up 16 triples on Saturday not a foul on Brandon Hunley Hatfield somehow DED him drop off was tough to handle for trayor loose ball picked up by Brion pass oconnell scanning and well back it out for Music pass Taylor back it out we get a foul away from the ball its on abubacar trayor his second jockeying with Huntley Hatfield thats sorry Mike thats a tough matchup on the inside Huntley Hatfield is working for position he set the tone in the first half n rebounds in N9 minutes he got a double that came his way good pass out of the post pass no dice from D extra pass to a wide open threepoint shooter and NC States got to make those to get back in this game overall 32 from the floor for the wolf pack and then Styles commits another foul his second and that look sort of says it all for the way this has gone for Kevin Keats here tonight hes going to get Marcus Hill he leading score at 13 a game up off his bench and the true freshman microwave Trey Applause Parker they come in for pass and Taylor respectively essentially got three small guards on the floor now for NC State Hadley shut off by Huntley Hatfield still working in the post banging with Huntley Hatfield who defended it well in transition Hill swings it to the corner Styles couldnt can it offensive rebound Hill airball the follow Applause away shots just not falling for NC State theyve had some good looks Applause Hadley with the size Advantage this time going to work on Hill slipped it for Trey Ori thats that small guard lineup that Im talking about where there are advantages that Louisville understands and recognizes Chucky saw that right away and got it to Hadley good back door cut by Parker who laid it in from Hunley Applause Hatfield with a small lineup from Louisville heres 65 tayori such a versatile piece for Pat Kelce directing with rain Smith in the Applause corner Hadley calling for it and gets it matched up with Trey Parker Hadley going to work took some contact treyo the offensive rebound plus a foul thats the hustle in the effort of Applause TR not many times do you seen Louisville stand on the end but this time they let Hadley go to work and trayor slips in underneath to finish the offensive putback equity in that game is going to be high ji broom anytime you get a chance to watch him play hes worth put your feet up if you can keep your feet up cuz youre probably going to put your feet down and jump up based on something that he does it is going to be something Auburn got the win yesterday at Mark bton has done a great job there Alabama with a win convincingly at Texas at the Moody Center here at the Lenovo Center 5 minutes gone by second half and Louisville up by 19 Michael oconnell moves it back for Ben Middlebrooks powering his way on Noah Waterman and a foul call good play off the timeout by Kevin Keats Middlebrooks getting the advantage posting up inside and Louisvilles bringing the double on the bounce so you got to be ready to make a play out of that most times you want to skip it to the other side of the floor but Michael oconnell recognized Middlebrook still had an advantage middle Brooks an important piece for NC State second year after transferring in from Clemson Kevin Keat said on Saturday we got to get more from him hes got to play better you look at all ACC players with at least 400 minutes played nobodys committing more fouls than Middlebrooks thats been his Bugaboo this year yeah in the last five games coming into tonight he only had 13 points and 15 rebounds combined and he had more fouls than that very capable piece for him had some big moments on the run last year in his first year with the pack hes matched up with Hadley who Louisvilles been running the offense through these last few possessions State doesnt usually like to switch one through five but they have in this possession and that allows you a mismatch on the glass 10 points eight rebounds for Javon Hadley the fifth year senior and the biggest lead today for Louisville is 20 middle Brooks this time working on the Freshman double came again good pass underneath from Hill but tough to handle for Styles yeah Hill missed Parker wide open on the weak Sid thats what Im saying like you want to play through the double you know they bringing it so you throw it on the Block and if you can quickly score you do if you can counter away from the double you do but if not you reverse it most teams want you to bring two to the ball you got to welcome it so you can make a play out of it Parker no dice on a deep one good block out from heper and heres Kai Roots R Smith on the drive gets a roll hes got two two twopoint buckets tonight after he had what you said eight all season coming in now he got nine in the ACC nine twopoint buckets in League Play coming off 26 points Saturday against Miamis up to 13 here step back for Taylor blocked by Roots Middlebrooks ran it down and we get a whistle away from the ball that goes against NC State Applause I think they said Middlebrook stepped out of bounds to give it back to Louisville Taylor checks out for the Wolf Pack Louisville is outs scored NC State 146 here since halftime and in these first 6 and 12 minutes trying to make it 13 wins the last 14 games heurn through for Chucky heer its not a bad idea you trying to capture the interest I mean his play alone should be good enough I know they were upset about him not being on the Koozie award list he is one of the top 10 point guards in the country he will be a first team all ACC guard I dont have any question about that in my mind hes getting my vote mcneel scores the tough midrange shot hey I heard Sean and Coach Greenberg talking about it at halftime that they were saying top 20 wooden players and that Chucky heern deserves mention there not just top 10 point guards with the Bob Koozie he skipped it for Hadley who cans the three he sees all nine players he sees the other four on his team and he reads the five on the defensive side not everyone can do that Parker tough step back for the wolf pack hes a natural scorer Trey Parker and he has an instinct to score thats what hes looking to do and NC State needs it Scott moved it ruths hoisted it couldnt Applause hit Marcus Hill found the trailer and mcneel had it tap back out by Middlebrooks on the Baseline through the contact Hill couldnt finish mcneel freed it back up Parker hits another Trey Parker can cook hes got 10 hes got his own cheering section right behind us as brother Demetrius is behind us he introduced himself to us at halftime schedule they have remaining this is what they have left two quad two opportunities Music remaining I dont know if any of those can move up into a quad one but I think Stanford and to could move into quad twos if they get some Ws here down the the last couple of weeks of the season towards the end b a clack here for Terrence Edwards and he drills it 15 for Terrence Edwards at the expiration of the shot clock so connected is Louisville they know exactly what they want and who can deliver it and their defense is swarming look at their transition the other way volleyballs around off the backboard Hadley trying to rip it down and he gets tied up with mcneel and the officials do a good job stepping in nothing there between Hadley and McNeil and then some of the players trying to step in in support on the loose ball Music look at this shot two or three and did he get it off in time you talk about time and score I mean this is just so well done gathers himself behind the threepoint line knows where his feet are Beats the clock Pat Kelce has said Terence Edwards is playing his best basketball right now and that in particular his defensive Improvement is big reason why the team defense has gotten a lot better the last two months for the Cardinals and were talking about team defense with Pat Kelce today and he has showed his team a stat the last two months effective field goal percentage defense basically your field goal percentage but weighted based on twos and threes simple way to think of it exactly he said they were in the 38th percentile 7 weeks ago he told his team at that point weve got to get to the 60th percentile theyre basically there right now and theyve done it in the course of seven weeks well when you consider not having Chucky H for a game not having Noah Waterman for four games basically James Scott played Seven Minutes in the Miami game so youre not doing it with a full roster either they I dont even know if theyve had a full practice ice with everyone healthy remember K prior had such a great start and got hurt in the Oklahoma game in the Bahamas hes put it together he has managed the roster really well they had a lot of buying really since the New Year in particular defensively Tates Styles varries a three for the wol pack I think the key for Pat Kelce is they play hard and theyre unselfish if you you have those two qualities you can run anything you can scheme any way you want cuz you have buy in for everyone as you just said Mike with a totally new roster of course from last years Louisville team heurn turn the corner underneath with a reverse from Chucky heord and he high fives the NC State fans as hes going by uh I dont think they wanted to high five him he is having some fun out there weve seen a couple of the reactions from Chucky heern just in this second half alone Trey Parker wanted a foul and instead Louisville runs Hadley backs it out for Edwards he sticks it he loads it up if rain is 16 Terrence Edwards Jrs probably about 3 seconds but look at the space he has because they run the floor hard thats 18 so far for Terence Edwards Jr building off that 27point game against Miami its like time in the pocket Patrick Mahomes would have craved for on Sunday Hill answers with a three of his own Marcus Hills second bucket so backto back triples for NC State heer probing and he draws a foul and Chucky heern has got this thing on a string right now mean watch this right here Baseline he tosses it up I think he was trying to hit the backb and then theres a couple of fives along the way unwillingly oh maybe theres a few going hey watch my space he thought they were high fives welcome back Chucky heern hes second in the AC and assist he leads the league and steals hes got better than a two to one 51 of the shots he takes are outside the threepoint line which means he has great balance he already broke the single season assist record with 16 against SMU and hes a heck of a guy hes a mature kid who understands what his role is and how to get everybody in the right spots Kevin Keats said to us today at NC State shoot around he thinks Chucky heer might be the best trans for pickup anywhere hes been that important you said hes a first team all ACC guard in your mind Styles short from three trayor the rebound and he has led this Louisville group well balanced again four and double figures here tonight trayor turns it over mcneel moved it and Hill walks with it and that is a 10th turnover for the wolf pack but only the first here in the second half thatll get Bryce herd up off the bench Louisville with nine three pointers which is right about on their average theyre just under 10 a game second in the ACC and threepoint makes behind Duke and they Jack a lot of them as well theyve taken 737 coming into the game Mike that is the most in the league the next closest is Duke at 620 thats 117 different difference thats how Pat Kelce has run things the last number of years they will let it fly from long range inside of eight to go Brion pass still scoreless in the second half after a dozen in the first half and then Middlebrooks continues to work hard and will shoot a pair meanwhile Chucky heern is having some fun here in Applause Music D coach thank you guys very much back here in Raleigh where its been all Louisville theyve led the entire game and ever since the early minutes the closest it ever got was nine NC State trimmed it to 3627 and this Louisville Revival keeps on humming well NC State had it to 10 with middle Brooks on the free throw line right at the end of the half and and then Louisville goes down and hits a three Ry Smith they lose him so middle Brooks here again on the first they coming up at nine over on acc Network Cooper flag and number three duke they host Andre sto yakovich PAs kid and Cal at Cameron indor so flip over to ACC Network sto yakovich and flag thats a pretty good match up on the floor Id say be fun to watch and Cooper flag is just so special playing again just an elite level in every way this year as a freshman seven plus to go here in Raleigh in good hands from Jaden Taylor okono saved it for Taylor he hounding him and Chucky he commits the foul his second really nice job by Jaden Taylor to get in the passing L right there with his hands coaches are always talking about move your feet have high hands got a good deflection in the passing Lane how do you see the ACC shaking out the rest of the way you got Duke you got Clemson and you got Louisville trying to keep Pace with Clemson 708 from now well if the most important thing right now that you start looking at or one of the things you look at is double Buy in the ACC tournament there you want to be able to stay in that top four seed so that you can get that double bu so you dont have to play until Thursday to do what NC State did last year to win five games nine elimination games all the way to the final four what a remarkable run I mean one for the ages for sure wi in the ACCC tournament the way they won was hard to do and Pat Kels got himself a team that right now in the standings you see it 11 and two with a win over Clemson a loss to Duke their other loss was on the road at Georgia Tech he was talking about how playing at Georgia Tech today with Damon St Meers team switching one through five helped prepare them for the way Miami switched one through five because they played small and learning from that Georgia Tech put up 50 in that second half against Louisville thats really the only blemish recently those was two Saturdays ago Louisville bounc back at BC then the game Saturday that you saw against Miami at the Yum Center and business as usual again for the cards here on the road in Raleigh Smith Catch and Release now Music Applause M Connell initiates and now Music Taylor a lot of talk down here on this end of the floor for Louisville you can hear Terrence Edward calling Gap one pass away deny ball wide open Smith 16 a couple of times and he missed back to Music back doesnt happen often from rain Smith P Kelce said the other day whatever shade of green it is its neon for rain Smith Hunley Hatfield spun it out from the Applause Block heern just bouncing around out there with confidence he just so good in the drags you know that first screen and transition up the floor the lob Little Too Tall that time for James Scott which you havent been able to say much this year we talked to Chucky Hein about the lob pass today as as well because thats what he usually throws to James Scott and he said at Wisconsin he threw a lot of pocket passes his bigs were different here hes throwing a lot of lobs he had to learn how to do that with James Scott they had to spend a lot of time together to get it worked out and as you pointed out Scott unable to really talk as well today with the mask on he led the outlet for Hadley who finishes and hes got 17 Kevin Keats preparing to dip a little bit deeper into his bench Ismael dof about to come in we havent seen Dennis Parker in this one pass misfires Hadley rips down another rebound Louisville only knows one speed and a slam in transition from Applause ruths the other is the wear down Factor right I mean Louisville play so hard for 40 minutes theyre conditioned to run every possession here they go again with numbers freshman Roots moved it for Smith drills Music it all right guys thanks very much you love a player that impacts winning and doesnt have to be about scoring Cooper flag can impact the game in so many different ways and L has a number of guys like that on the floor tonight Paul mcneel hits a three for NC State who is staring down what would be a ninth consecutive loss they havent won a game since January 8th this would match the wol Packs longest losing streak in a single season since the ACC was formed back in the mid50s up top the alley for James Scott from Edwards what a great screen by rain Smith shallow cut through the lane back screen the weak Applause side it is pretty to watch this offense move and the cuts they make the screens they set its beautiful when its played like they do they play so hard me watch rain Smith hes going to set the back screen right here everyone is lifted except for Hadley its just a great delivery and thats what James Scott does were just talking about that lob pass you surprised how much hes been able to give them tonight and the effort that hes played with the mask Pat Kelce told us 2 of college players today would be playing in this game with that mask on based on what he went through on Saturday in the Miami game seven minutes in and I mean he fell and a Miami guy fell right on top of his head and smashed his face into the floor I was right there on a good angle to see it its not a pretty sight I Im amazed that James is playing in this game came off the court with blood on his lower lip in particular again lost his two front teeth but playing here tonight hes from an hour Southwest of here in fville another Triple Falls from the outside and its 19 on five threes for rain Smith five triples for rain Smith rain go ahead and shoot till your arm falls off four players with at least 15 for Louisville shooting a season High 64 from the floor they have been utterly dominant here tonight everyone gets it off the glass roval and can quickly get them up the court into their transition game Scott slipped it moved it and then Roots a little too ambitious against Hill transition mcneel pulled up on the Applause Baseline thats
