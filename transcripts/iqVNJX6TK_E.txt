who can facilitate scores in the paint 50 behind the arc and he nailed the gamewinner against miami in the last game that eight foot shot off glass a shot he worked on the entire offseason nothing lucky about it according to coach brad brownell for the clemson tigers just about set ready to go about 1800 fans in attendance tonight theyre calling that a sellout in these crazy times were living in great atmosphere and manny bates set to go against jonathan bear so one of our early questions already answered manny bates hyper extending the knee the last time out for state he was cleared to play and hes in the starting five opening tap control by the tigers stressing the allwhite home beauties we have two outstanding defensive teams who do it in different ways bald movement player movement sharp on offense is going to be important alamere dawes from downtown clemsons on the board first three nothing dawes he trusts that jump shot so much hes worked on it all in the off season hes become one of the goto guys for clemson starting five for the pack one note cam hayes gets his first career start braxton beverly suffered an injury during warmups he is not available tonight that news breaking just moments ago that hurts the wolf pack on the offensive end one of their better outside shooters it shrinks the floor in some ways kevin daniels back on the board hes 32 i mean this is a really old rivalry going back decades its great to see him playing its just one time this year so be it but we think this is going to be a competitive contest tonight see the starting five for the tigers coach jonathan beer inside has to help amir sims on the glass and defensively by blocking shots sims needs to stay in the game cannot get in foul trouble Applause hellums from the corner that shot is pure nc state grabs its first lead 53 kevin keats likes to press most of the game and pick up full sometimes they go into a zone but theyre back to their aggressive switching one through four mantoman ball movement crisp sims top of the key off the mark the rebound to daniel clemson and virginia tech tied to topranked teams from the acc at 19th in the latest ap poll nc state receiving votes helems baseline off the mark alex hemingway the rebound making his second career start tonight thats a guy who can really light it up 12 in the white hemingway great outside shooter that surprised you to see virginia tech and clemson in front of duke louisville north carolina this early on in terms of talent yes but theyre playing better than those teams and duke hasnt played many games they havent played for about three weeks daws lines up for three this time off the mark state controls ill tell you what clemson is the class of the acc defensively and bear called for the bump thatll be his first teams first 56 points per game thats one of the best seasons for head coach brad brunell in his 11 years here kevin keats fourth season in raleigh hes done a great job and weve gotten to know him quite well over the years paul your relationship with kevin keats goes way back to when he was at heartbreak military academy back in the day but always fun to chat with and get into some of his stories he told us later on both of these coaches have done an outstanding job at the mid major level and now they have teams in the acc that could be the favorite to win the conference this year now thats a bold statement dolls inside were tied at five after the air ball by cam hayes this is the best roster that brad brownell and kevin keats Applause i think the acc is wide open this year and an offensive foul down low jericho pelham picks up his first heres brad brownell joked with him earlier today well clemsons a basketball school after what happened last week against ohio state for dabo sweeneys tigers he said wait a second not not so much we had our callin show last night young woman from charlotte calls in launches into a lengthy conversation turns out she called in thinking it was the football callin show he said we still got some work with him reminds me of when i coached at ohio state everything was ohio state football basketball was the queen footballs the king but brad barnell has this program in a great position this year hes done a really solid job over his tenure and kevin keats hes put the energy and the life back at nc state and i do mean that each of these teams have a chance to win the acc this season well talk more about it baseline three silky smooth omax olivier maxims prosper connects thats not his game but when that happens watch out hes one of 11 from bonus land this year thats just his second triple hes a driver athlete transition player good defender young player theyre really high on him tigers regain the advantage elbow jumper cam hayes first bucket as a starter boy that was such a tough shot it was contested the help was behind it i mean that was a really difficult shot for a talented freshman cam hayes hemingway open Music and a foul inside against clemson just underway lead is one and a good one brewing and little john coliseum vote 24 keeping it real with fernando tatis jr believe it or not but and were talking defense tonight because these are two of the best teams defensively in the acc get in the stance stance and vision roy philpot like it its there in that little on camera i dont know but you really need to work on your stance but it was too open for me that sounds like my jv coach back in the day you can tell you were sitting on the bench a lot devin daniels top of the key squares one up and its all net back back in front daniels just plays with so much offensive confidence hes 37 percent behind the line he knows when hes open and hes ready to shoot theres his steal manny bates comes away with it one of the top shot blockers in america daniels in transition and a late whistle shooting foul called his clyde trap no theyll call it against state Applause but you see the defensive awareness by nc state and the ability to convert from defense to offense the only average 16 seconds per possession theyre one of the fastest teams in the ncaa in terms of pace i like what you said too about kevin keats breathing life back in the program because their points per game theres a nasty rejection shaquille moore jumped up hes a nasty player watch him look at that love it three to shoot him and way left open and the rebound to moore shaquille moore has been a big time catalyst for the wolf pack played great against north carolina and boston college kevin pete said to us earlier he doesnt know that he shouldnt be doing what hes doing tigers start this one out eight of their 10 field goal attempts from downtown trap off the mark rebound playing by sims and thats one thing nc state can do they can rush you they can speed you up and once you play out a rhythm they have you and clemson is a very rhythm type of offensive team the passing the cutting the screening and nc state can take that rhythm away gravernell trying to change the rhythm hes got a line shift coming in hes got five sub substitutions ready to check into this one bit unusual do you ever do that as a coach only when i was mad id sub up the starters and put in five other guys because i was a little bit hot and heavy maybe hes mad because theyre taking too many threes Applause the reversal came from the top amir sims had a halfway open shot decided to reverse it to his teammate it was wide open that is unselfish basketball by emir sims Applause here comes that line shift we were talking about trap baseline nice looking ups for numeral zero watch amir sims he gets it thought about it a little lefty pass sims to trap he just blew by the defense he is an explosive athletic 64 combo guard senior at east over south carolina lower richland high school hes battled some injuries now a lot of injuries hes come back really strong Applause back back to work nc state 61 on the young season 20 in the acc one of those wins against north carolina and an offensive foul sebron i believe took the defender trying to get to the rebel clemson does a great job of staying between the ball and the basket they sit they slide they move their feet theyre not a big gamble team they dont look for steels they fall to steals but theyre always in the right position put great pressure on the ball and an offensive foul on the other end chase hunter just checked in and the guilty party that time what is it like facing nc states fullcourt pressure because obviously thats going to dictate a lot of what happened tonight right yeah you have to be so aware of potential traps your passing and catching has to be exact you have to move a second and third time to get open you cant catch the ball in the dead corners at half court or on the baseline because then theyll use that line as a third defender ellums off the pump fake the midrange pack lead it by two he was so good against north carolina jericho helens only scored one point but they had to keep him in the game because of his defense pj hall top of the key too strong Music paul the talented freshman first game of the new year for nc state daniels hit the deck thatll be the second on chase hunter nc state a twopoint lead in their acc road opener heres little john coliseum bull 24 keeping it real with damian lillard it pays to have range like boat 24 30 kfc yum center then boston college and number 21 duke in the nightcap that will be in prime time at 8 30 all headed your way tomorrow and we look forward to that all the action right here on acc network also the espn app as you see kevin keats paul being cardi roy philpot back inside little john coliseum you got keys for me tonight coach nc state specialty points those are points before the defense gets set they average about 22 points per game from their turnovers also rebounding they get 11 second chance points per game the more they can score before the defense is set better chance theyll have to win for clemson limit the turnovers 12 or less want to eliminate the live ball turnovers control the tempo of the game they want it in the 60s theyre going to attack with vision and also transition they need to get back and make this a half court game the more its five on five the better chance clemson has to win good shot by nick honor who just checked in will stop a 92 run for nc state back to a onepossession contest honor is a player that plays a lot bigger than his frame would indicate hes got those wide shoulders but obviously not tall in stature hes got eyes for the rim thats what he has when he catches that ball hes thinking about putting it up he is always ready to shoot the ball nick on you better honor this guy from the outside because if not now you got to take away the shot but still anticipate the drive a little hesitation by nick honor gets the defender out of his stance nice blowby foul went against john newman whos back after missing clemsons last game at miami this past weekend manny bates will get one more free throw we mentioned him as a shot blocker his presence even if he doesnt actually impact the shot impacts opposing offenses because hes got a 72 wingspan on the 611 frame he just does a lot of dirty work for state as a freshman he was led the nation in block rate 16 of the time when he was on the floor he would get a blocked shot its a pretty high percentage thats huge yeah and what that does is it changes your offensive attack it makes the offensive players think two and three times it leads to turnovers nice high low bare inside missed the chipping back up and in and a chance for three well thats one way to do it you missed the first shot you get the offensive rebound coach you pad the stats a little bit you got a chance for an extra point this was beautiful offensive execution high low pj hall with a beautiful dump down bear with the miss but the quick second jump the effort to stay with it it seems like thats clemsons style right the grit the toughness they miss it they dont hang their head they go after it free the hard way jonathan bear the transfer from unc asheville overtime once again at 15 clemsons going to pick you up full court its going to be mantoman not many traps at all just trying to be on and up the line hayes the freshman from downtown cam hayes seven points in his first career start already smooth under control talented plays with a high iq daws tries to respond he cannot rebound to daniels here come the wolfpack good job by clemson getting back i talked about defensive transition on the miss they sprinted back with the bounce you can see nc state gets pretty explosive at times theyve got shooters theyve got penetrators we mentioned the shot blocking this is a team that can score 80 plus as weve seen for most of this season already and thats why the tempo of this game is so important because if it gets into the mid 70s or higher it favors the wolf pack bj hall the midrange from 15 the goodlooking espn top 100 freshman i just love this kid i love his game i love his work ethic tell everybody what you told brad brownell today because i like the way you framed it about his four years here yeah hes a foreign dunk four and done i mean hes an old school guy whos going to get better at an old school rate he still has to understand the speed of the game the physicality of the game and the basketball iq but he is a terrific piece to build upon i think hes going to be all acc as a senior and he would almost be like the prototypical clemson player for brad brunell why trap spins home at three tied at 20 and a quick fivenothing outburst for the tigers thats a great freshman this year in the acc scottie barnes getting four and a half assists per game florida state Applause kevin keats will call a timeout and talk things over so pack had some trouble inbounding the basketball well step aside as well here in clemson Music Music and juicy burgers um i think that guy is crying Music 840 to play back in clemson south carolina nc state put some tigers tied at 20 clemson and virginia tech the highest rank teams in the acc the latest ap poll hey by the way the net rankings came out for the first time as well this weekend thats something that matters a little bit and paul you made a point to me earlier today these two programs typically exceed their preseason expectations probably going to do it this season too right well no question i mean nc state at number eight theyre going to finish somewhere in the top five i i think they have the experience the depth the talent uh to challenge for the acc title clemson has the best defense in the acc right now and could have the best defense all season long will their offense come around enough for them to challenge at the top but certainly not going to be in the bottom half of the acc i think their shooting has improved the last couple of seasons underground right now the case has as well but as well as they defend right he comes down to making shots at times you just gotta you gotta hit him it certainly does theyre 34 from three they need to score from their defense they do a good job of that they need to continue that all season long baits on the jump hook was off the mark and go back to the tigers like the blow in this one so far its kind of been a back and forth affair as we expected its been well played well executed low foul game when you talk about clemson you know dawes and sims are going to score the ball whos going to be that third score to step up for the tigers i think thats going to be huge all season long Applause Music pack gets it back its probably going to be nick honor more shaquille more from downtown 23 to 20 his first points that young man is just fearless as soon as he scores hes up on the ball he had a big shot against boston college back on december 30th a steal thomas allen came out of there with it daniels launches and connects nc state with its largest lead at six how about thomas allen Music brad barnell not happy his team didnt get the loose ball the wolf pack trying to get some separation on the road defense first theres the dive the push daniels knocks it down thomas allen gets on the floor pushes it to devin daniels who finds the line buries it it seems like daniels has been at nc state for about six or seven years doesnt it i think you called one of his games at utah yes you did i remember that i believe so its a long time ago but daniels has gotten better it seems like each and every year thats why kevin keats loves his team experience these guys have been around in the system skip pass honor left open thats his spot it is all net id like to see him in a game of horse i mean nick honor just lights it up from the outside as soon as he catches the ball hes thinking shot thats a sign of a player whos worked on his game 5 10 205 fearless at the rim in times this year you go back to clemsons win against florida state and a couple of big plays and and one late poked away by bear 11 to shoot smooth stroke for number four nick honor just understands where the line is right away calls for it a little baseline drive pass opposite hes not going to hesitate i love that blow by when the defense closes out out of control allen hit the deck no whistle baseline foul call it will go against nc state thats hellums and thatll be his Applause second now helens went for it he was just fighting for it he was saying i got pushed i believe they just ruled him out of bounds just tried to collect the basketball but i think what he was saying is clemson pushed me out no doubt no doubt Applause threepoint advantage for the pack on the road sims left open same spot as honor different results and saved by shaquille moore nicely done he just makes all the hustle plays more count it shaquille moore continues the hot hand roy in high school shaquille moore did not shoot the ball he was a driver transition layup guy and kevin keats quick to give the staff a lot of credit to work on the jump shot of shaquille moore honor on the other end nick connor started to heat up hes got eight points off of brad brownells bench you could feel a little offensive blow coming in this one coach the defense is what theyre known for tonight right now offense is the name of the game Applause each coach really emphasized the ability to cut move screen to get open shots put trigger for more and air ball this time here comes nick connor sims has been held in check so far scoreless three field goal attempts bear is short daniels another rebound third of the first half for number 24 in all black devin daniels goes to work talked about specialty points for the wolf pack one of the keys to the game they get 11 second chance points helms i like the way he slowed down saw all the space went to work that was under control right there you love that as a coach right upperclassman this team is full of them and when you have upperclassmen they play hard they play fast but they play under control trap picked up the personal helms now with eight points move back back to a six point advantage its so hard to score against clemson theyre number one in the acc and scoring defense so you have to get points in other ways that was a big offensive rebound that led to that bucket sims tried to spot crap had an easy layup it was poked out of there when you think about specialty points like second chance points off for turnovers cant defend them theyre not on the scouting report theyre broken plays four and a half to play in a well played first half sims looking bouncy shot clock under 10 dawes launches fourth rebound for devin daniels stoppage here and our veteran acc officiating crew led by jeffrey anderson were going to take a look at that last sequence sunday afternoon womens college basketball returns on acc network with a triple header up first number two louisville clemson tigers followed by virginia tech georgia tech and then boston college and wake forest noon two and four eastern right here on acc network also on the espn app back here little john coliseum clemson south carolina paul b carty and roy philpott on hand nc state leads by six with possession that last stoppage in play because there was in fact a shot clock malfunction coach and the shot clock did not start so its immediate timeout by rule thats under four minutes and 30 seconds allen the floater nicely done nc state largest lead call it eight thomas allen an important transfer for nc state hes been out of basketball a while hes been injured when he left nebraska hes a tremendous outside shooter omax baseline in and out headed three moments ago its tapped back in by nc state we dont see that every day thats two points thunderbird does not want well dj thunderberg back after missing three games in december his return last week against boston college nothing short of sensational hellums patient again off the mark and the rebound flame by sims good movement by the wolf pack a lot of offense in the middle third of the court here comes clyde trap bigerow Applause you like that little get to the rim let it go a little little jelly fan they call it in the grassroots game thats right yeah i like that as well under three to play crowd on its feet allen will try to silence him he cannot trap the board here comes clemson off the crossover a little shake a little bit off blast count it and a chance for three for numeral zero flying trap awfully impressive tonight i think clemson is a different offensive team when they attack you off the bounce look at that open court trap with a little ball fake right to the rim defender low deep thats going to be a block and hes moving clemson does a lot of screening and cutting theyre so good on their execution i think when they blend in that dribble drive game theyre so difficult to play against trap well short on the free throw second foul on pelhams a sixnothing run for clemson allen will shoot two to try to change all of that well both teams have kind of gone through these fivenothing sixnothing outbursts so far tonight theyre getting some points off from makes misses scoring from their defense and the halfcourt execution has been very good you can tell these teams these coaches were working on their offense because they know the opponents defense is so strong thomas allen 45 at the line before that miss Music foul win against prosper for the tigers oh two at the strike nc state six for ten from three big numbers early in this game tigers five of 15 from downtown two and a half to go in the first poked out of there thunderbird comes away with it ahead to allen and a double dribble turns it over a costly mistake for the pack they got out in transition where they wanted to be Applause now theyll pick up full court nice poke from behind just got a little too got ahead of himself put his head down you got to dribble that ball with your head up i think when you put your coaching cap on you did it and are on camera my defensive positioning was not good dribble with your head up there foul call it against nc state Applause kevin keats has his team programmed to go attack play downhill youre going to have some of those turnovers first foul on thomas allen the transfer from nebraska kevin keats we asked him earlier today what have you learned about yourself what have you learned about the program the last year during the pandemic and he said you know a lot of these collegiate athletes the student athletes theyve had this last year stolen from them cant go out cant see their friends cant do much of anything and theyre required to basically stay isolated otherwise they cant play offensive foul called against johnny newman and he said its been tough its been tough on all of us but hes learned a lot about himself and his program along the way looks like devin daniels was in good position was he still moving slides his feet i dont know about that one second foul on newman i would agree with that assessment thats a blocker play on coach keats also telling us patience something hes had to learn a lot about he talked about flexibility being adaptable to change traveling violation cam hayes turns it over i dont forget coming up at halftime kelsey riggs seth greenberg gets you caught up on everything going on around the acc hes got some teams coming out of brakes theyve been paused conference play really starts to heat up this coming week joe linardi by the way has nine teams from the acc in his current bracketology update case hunter was fouled hes going to shoot a fan joe linardi is going to be the most wanted man in america to march he already is but more so this year well you know i mentioned earlier the net rankings are out and im curious how the committee goes about its business this year because road wins are a little different this year without fans compared to previous years and the net rankings take into account all of those metrics its can be uh quite complicated but joe linardi trying to sort parse his way through all of that i agree i think were all going to be on pins and needles okay how do you rank this team versus that team when road wins are easier and home wins are a little bit different as well i guess no question about it youve got those quad one quad two those are the categories but i love it when you start talking quadrants yeah but what about the formula and i think joe linardi said it best to me this morning i think the formula needs to be tweaked but keep the categories and i think hes on point with that so in a sense a quad one win for a team its a little different this year than in previous years the committee looks at that to try to see teams and figure out which teams belong in the dance thunderbird stepped out of bounds scoreless first half for dj tigers get it back with a buck 13 to go to your point right its never been easier to win on the road i mean just look around here right now if you have 15 18 000 different body on you thats intimidating all right so for the net rankings their formula that they use if youre playing a team ranked one through 30 at home in the net rankings that counts as a quad one win one through 75 on the road also again those are so critical come selection sunday omacs working hard off the mark and the rebound claimed by bates the question is will the committee tweak that formula because things are different in 2021 back with a chance for three in the first points on the board for dj thunderbird when we mention all this to the coaches this morning they just their biggest concern is having 22 negative copen tests yeah thats right too and getting their team ready for the game nc state look at that throw ahead beautiful pass thunderbird we talked about him in the open the ability to run the mobility to move hes got great hands much improved senior dont forget coming up tomorrow morning the time is now for another episode of packer and durham mark packer west durham pull up a chair and enjoy some atlantic coast conference conversation the guys always do a great job 710 am right here on hcc network set your alarm 6 45 cant miss packer and durham im still waiting for my first invitation one of my good friends kelly bramletts on the show all the time does a great job cant wait cant wait to join the fellas at some point im right behind you okay wait for that call let me check myself were right here were right here see if mark packer makes the call ill talk a little acc hoops shot clock and game clock virtually identical Applause pack leaded by five gilmore taking his time wants it sweet dish inside of thunderbird and the pack will close the first half in strong passion 3932 our score thunderbird closes with a bang as he pours in five points in the last two minutes and clemson will face its largest halftime deficit of the season paul b carty nc state outstanding on the offensive end 56 from the floor a little sweet dish by shaquille moore thunderbird hard tigers trail theyve also trailed in their last two victories at the break you get too close its gonna drive you to the rim has a nice sweet pullup game hes got 10 for the wolf pack only player in double figures in this game if youre brad braddell what kind of adjustments do you try to make here in our final 20 minutes well first of all offensively amir sims has not scored so you got to get him some more shots you got to get him going he is your best offensive player a second defensively youve got to be there a little bit tighter on the shots a lot of those threes or half of those threes i think were uncontested and thats not a sign of a brad brannell team defensively speaking of uncontested threes devin daniels on cue off the mark rebound bayer three on two for the tigers daws attacking up and under and saved brilliantly by cam hayes i like the attack by clemson but that plays into the pace of nc state you have to attack with vision your guards have to make good decisions look at our first half stats 56 from the floor 60 from deep tigers get it back on an offensive foul baits over the back Music yeah nc state they get 11 steals per game thats fifth in the nation already with four they score so well off their defense eight to three points off the turnovers i thought maybe that one would be a little greater in favor of the wolfpack given the lead but just a seven point game we saw both teams go on five nothing and six nothing runs and felt like throughout the first half and a foul is bear attacks thats helens it is itll be his third second team kevin keats have to decide whether he wants to keep jericho helms on the floor here looks like he will this is a deep team that like noahs ark they have two of everything they really do daws comes up short rule remember braxton beverly not playing tonight injured during pregame warmups hes got 80 career starts almost 200 career threes state still leads clemson by seven on the road and hes a forty percent threepoint shooter i thought when we got the news that that would really hurt state from the outside not the case daniels beats bates allen off the pump bait bear another rebound still scoreless in our second half Applause top threepoint specialist in the game another guy like devin daniels it seems like hes been in raleigh forever right he has and hes had some injuries you know hes hurt tonight had some back injuries last season but he is part of the heart and soul for the wolf pack even devin daniels hemingway came top of that screener behind it rather its almost like he didnt get a good look at the rim as he shot it two strong baits goes to work first points in the second half nc state with his largest lead at nine and thats the part of his game thats really improved manny bates the ability to get position and score with either hand in the low post clemson went without a point the final 247 almost duplicate that to start the second and jonathan bear off glass yeah jonathan vera put it between his legs at 6 10 that was a nifty move lead is seven a long ways to go in this one clemson at eight and one two and one in the acc and over the back was bare itll be his second manny bates has really improved but its back to the basket sims with the body baits with the extension on the jump hook and how about beer globetrotter splits his legs up and under off the glass looked like you and jb yeah thats right that was a third on bear by the way so hell have a seat cam hayes two strong rebound by dogs clemson will push tempo ahead to trap hes got nine points make it wow how did that not go down looked like the ball on the roulette table kept going round and round oh nice high low bates had position dawes called for the foul im not sure how this last shot from downtown did go through one two three Music oh you see the emphasis by nc state the second half going to manny bates theyre trying to get him off inside they feel like they have an advantage mayor sims has to be careful not to get foul trouble even though he hasnt scored in this game its hard for clemson to win games without sims playing well now thats a big story sims scoreless after 25 on the road at miami including the gamewinner with 19 seconds left that tied his career high heres daniels against trapping now sims and he was fouled and amir sims pick up the infraction thatll put devin daniels at the line a lot of what nc state is doing is in the middle third of the court reason why its hard to get help side when youre in the middle if you go on one side of the court clemson does a great job of keeping you on one side daniels can go either way off the dribble very good with his pick and roll game the ability to come off and shoot it or to penetrate just like he did in that last possession really been aggressive in this game daniels really saves his best work on the biggest stage we saw that against north carolina in the win against the heels poured in 20 plus leader for this team nick connor launching and connecting big shot for the tigers 4237 honor now the first player for clemson and devil figures off the bench hes got 11 tonight thunderbird gets it back lost to handle bates couple of pointblank misses and somehow saved by shaquille moore but its right to honor up and under count it honor with 13 one possession game now you love the hustle by nc state but nick moore im sorry nick honor with the hustle play what a beautiful finish i was thinking of nick moore at smu thunderberg daniels foul free throws coming up for devin daniels but nick honor getting it done coach well sometimes turnovers can result in momentum swings nick honor drilling it from deep its bow time its eating time at the ring hes a big time spark for this program yeah they bring him off the bench which provides a sixman type of roll in his last five games nick honor over 50 from three states got to do a better job of finding him getting a little closer taking away his face paul we should mention this too is daniels gets one more free throw hes got 12 points tonight the lead all scores actually honor has one more than him but at halftime here at littlejohn they broadcast the heisman trophy ceremony and they cut to it as soon as the announcement was made so you had kyle trass clemsons trevor lawrence devonta smith and mack jones from alabama all on the jumbotron here they made the heisman trophy announcement this years winner not trevor lawrence is devante smith at alabama and that was created by a chorus of boos here in clemson south carolina a lot of people here that werent happy i think some people actually left the building i think youre right about that for the people that were here we could hear the booze were not in the right spot tonight roy so far daniels got the bounce but you were calling it right before the heisman who kept saying his name smith devonte smith devonte smith i think most people thought he was the favorite going in his numbers were just astronomical honor spins that one in that time it stayed down after clyde trap missed a similar shot from almost the same exact spot moments ago one possession game about how quick the release is by nick honor again if youre nc state you got to be there on the catch lets see what happens when nick honor catches this basketball you got to honor the threepoint shot shaquille more late im almost thinking we got to ban that because i i guarantee you like every announcing crews coming in saying honor the three right i mean thats yeah that was deep and so what happens is with the great shooter when you think youre close enough you have to get closer coaching 101 you got to make them put the ball on the floor make him a passer make him a dribbler but you cant let him be a shooter Applause goner one point away from his season high he squares those shoulders it feels like its going in at least as of late for the fordham transfer daniels attacking nearly lost it hellums launches at the buzzer thats going to be a shot block violation state turns it over that was the best possession defensively for clemson tough on the ball great on the help they were there on the catch watch them pressure the ball get over the screen pj hall good help pressuring the ball they move baits up the line denying everywhere they rallied to the ball on the drive that was excellent pj hall checks back in inside jonathan Applause baer Music last clemson lead was eight to seven nc state has been in semi control in this one daniels the floater newman the rebound honor left open feeling it first miss of the night for nick honor and a foul pj hall pushed helems thats how you beat a very good defensive team the ball movement went from the right side of the floor to the left side of the floor theyre looking for their teammate nick honor you always want to find the hot hand and keep feeding them i love the way clemson is looking for him right now honor set out last season after transferring in he did play however in the world games over in italy clemson claimed a gold medal ncaa wouldnt let him play last year sat on the bench waited for his time Applause bates baseline j the midrange available nice job by shaquille moore he dragged two defenders with him off the ball screen bates has really improved that short jump shot i talked to assistant coach james johnson he said if you see bates make a jumper dont be surprised hes in there before film he stays after practice hes working on his jump shot from the midrange page back after hyperextending that knee against boston college ball inside contested layup is good 4744 his first points of the night again penetration is the way you beat nc state because you want to force the shot blocker to step up so you can drop it down that time manny bates he was in no mans land check that hall actually with four approaching 12 to play Applause seven on the shot clock cam hayes thinking about it moore bear the rebound and he was hammered hit the deck hard and a foul called against state Applause pj hall talented freshman dorman high school over in robux south carolina getting it done the reverse dont forget coming up tomorrow a mens college basketball triple header here in the acc right here on acc network pittsburgh syracuse will tip things off at 4 30 19th ranked virginia tech at louisville at 6 30 bc and duke 8 30 tomorrow night right here on acc network also on the espn app we are back at little john coliseum high above playing floor paul being cardi roy pillpock great to have you with us tonight one possession game i said earlier today i thought this was the best game all night in terms of college hoops rank team two rivals its been closely contested coach i think weve got a fantastic finish i think this ones coming right down to the end and if nc state can pull it off they have a chance to be ranked there are others receiving votes right now i dont think clemson is going to leave the top 25 theyve had some great wins the tigers purdue mississippi state alabama theyve won a lot of power five games more thunderbird tj thunderberg with seven nc state back in front by three how pretty was that give up by shaquille moore kevin keats was recruiting josh hall who committed nc state at moravian prep and he fell in love with shaquille moore he thinks hes going to have one of the top back courts in the country quick trigger for pj hall daniels the rebound 4946 thunderbird against hall senior on the freshman he held his ground got the defensive board Applause dj hall on the floor in place of amir sims whos yet to score tonight jump ball to stay on this end what does that say for clemson that sims hasnt scored and its still a one possession game if you take a look at the last two buckets that shows you how great clemsons defense is nick arnold with a little dime to pj hall i thought he was going to flush it good looking freshman how about shaquille moore defunderburk a lot of big time plays in this game i think the offense has just been absolutely beautiful against two teams that are known for their defense a lot of cutting screening open shots sims just checked in well short on the three tapped out stay with nc state hes got to continue to shoot those shots that play was run for him he got open on the screen hes got to look at it hes got to look at hes got to shoot it brad brunell told us that he would consider some opportunities to play sims and hall on the port at the same time it has not really happened a lot tonight paul just checked out for amir sims can he do anything else to kind of get out of this little mini slump that were seeing so far tonight attack the rim crash the glass i mean what do you do as a coach i i like him away from the basket in the game he can draw the big away brad told us today i want to see sims get a little more selfish in a good way to take some more shots sims called for the foul here Music scoreless tonight just picked up his third personal coach but hes a senior so he understands to keep playing the game not thinking about his box score hes a terrific facilitator good rebounder hes going to stay with it continue to take the looks that he needs to take but not force it thats the key theyre right there in this game without him scoring the ball dj thunderbird eight points all of those coming now nine since a minute to play in the first half the top returning big men in the acc this season nc state the all black unis as well on the road they actually have glowinthedark numbers its kind of cool when clemson went through its pregame introductions newman off last sims trying to put it back and thats going to count his first points of the night on the goalkeeper Applause his first two points come a little unconventional nice drive look like daniels yank the rim for interference Applause sounds of college basketball returning Applause even if a packed house is not Applause daniels calls the rebound omax off glass one point game omac six seven plus athletics shaquille moore feisty tough guard but hes a six footer on that one that thats a mismatch on that drive the band the limited crowd off their feet pack turns it over cam hayes gives it back to clemson the tigers looking for their first lead since it was eight to seven they just continue to make clutch defensive stops omax too smooth dribbles right to the basket kilmore just cant do anything with it then on the other side they set their defense and when they do theyre one of the top five teams in the country defensively looks like cam hayes just got frustrated with the onball pressure under eight and a half to go sims gets it back goes to work daniels the rebound bates with outstanding defense bothered that one great matchup two of the best seniors in the acc daniels blown her and its all net how many times has he done that tonight hes got 16 hes been super aggressive off the drive Applause once he gets into the acc logo its forcing clemson to help if they dont help Applause devin daniels has been strong all game long for the wolf pack a little shot fake hard drive little float game wolf pack up three Music bull 24 keeping it real number four for nc state and all black tonight done a nice job but the foul problems creeping up quickly he also did a great job in that north carolina game only scored one point but they couldnt take him out of the game because his ability to defend the three and four spot thunderbirds stepped out of bounds officials didnt see it that layup will count lead is five for nc state thats an enormous Applause play sims and he was fouled crowd here loves that last noncall and im not sure that he established himself back in bounds before he touched the basketball right thats what theyre looking at in a sequence like that i dont believe he had full possession during that period of time okay one more look he doesnt touch the ball he goes out of bounds but doesnt establish possession so in your mind thats a valid play it is yeah okay it didnt look it at the time in real time but i think afterwards i would tend to agree because when he was out of bounds the ball was inbounds dawes off the mark sims a rebound and a fresh 20 devin daniels slow to get up and that does not look good Applause Music you see him kind of trapping the right side of his head for a moment kevin keats wants to find out more theyre going to look at that last sequence to see what happened with devin daniels its a lot happening here in our last 30 seconds or so look like daniels he hit he hits the ground hit his head not sure if sims pushed him to the ground or not heres a better look oh yeah that that right up that left arm for sims he definitely pushed him to the ground jeffrey anderson james breeding having a look and now a conversation clemson staff thats not a flagrant foul so after all of that clemson gets it back no change on the original ruling daniels remains on the floor and no foul call nothing to review right sims was playing like a safety under seven to play lead is five nc state has led since it was eight to seven sims was bumped and thats gonna be an offensive foul thats number four amir sims two points four fouls Applause i think they were trying to get him involved in the offense almost a little clear out thunderberg held his ground he moved his feet he stayed in front of sims that was good defense so sims have a seat on the bench pj hall checks back in still a fivepoint game and now if youre nc state you may want to go to thunderberg inside against the freshman Applause high ball screen for daniels hellums back on the floor with his four personals the dump off under burke was fouled nick honor got him that time dj thunderbird to the strike pretty good free throw shooter this season 83 percent of the year before tonight and three of three this evening as well thunderbird not a low post block player where he likes to establish position but he gets a lot of dump offs from the penetration of daniels and moore hes got great hands to catch it quick finisher so coming up next sunday afternoon womens basketball returns here on acc network second ranked louisville hosts clemson at noon thatll tip things off before virginia tech georgia tech at two eastern bc and wake at four right here on acc network also on the espn app a sixnothing run for nc state pack lead it by seven once again their same advantage at halftime hard screen by hall gets it back honors trying to sky for the rebound against shaquille moore and moore comes away with it two tough dudes should kill more nick honor id love to see these two play oneonone they will here for a moment it looks like its getting a little chippy its getting a little physical pelhams left open from the wing big possession now for clemson the spin nick honor all over the place comes up with an empty possession however yeah when youre small and you go deep you may want to think about spraying it out unless you have a clear path tigers have made their runs nc state has responded each and every occasion pack in the midst of a six nothing in nc state a seven point lead on the road 5 38 remaining wolfpack looking for a quad one victory thats exactly what this would be tonight clemson number 15 and the debut of the net rankings just came out this week trying to build that resume nick honor has other intentions hes led the tigers in scoring tonight with 16 and for just tuning in amir sims just one bucket and four fouls if youre nc state youre feeling really good right now we got to close this game out youve done a great job of taking care of the basketball youve shot the ball at a high clip on the road and you talk about those quad one wins but its a lot easier to win theres only a few people in the stands bear tries to poke it away he does cant come up with a steal nine on the shot clock more to daniels daniels a rare miss didnt hit the rim thatll be a shot clock violation tigers get it back with paul being party on roy philpott weve got just over five minutes to go critical early acc clash between two rivals that have met nearly 160 times in their histories last touch by danish when these two teams play and it gets a little chippy at the end and they fight over a lot of recruits between north and south carolina they both know this game means a lot when youre looking at the standings at the end of the year dont be surprised if a game like this determines who comes in first second third maybe fourth place i mean who are you picking roy in the acc oh man who do you have as a favorite oh thats tough him and way left open and its all net first points making his second start alex hemingway latest trim to four this guy is a pure shooter hemingway i dont know who im picking to answer your question something tells me some school along tobacco roads gonna have something to say about it by the time we get to midmarch whether its nc state or duke with carolina thunderbird was pushed and the foul is going to be called against the tigers alex hemingway going to try to shoot clemson back in it alex hemingway comes from the baseline little zipper cut up the middle defender got hung up when he catches hes thinking one thing let it go 50 from three in his last five games its a second foul on hall amir sims checks back in with his four personals thunderbird at the stripe 13 points tonight perfect at the line theres two guys for clemson cant leave open on the outside nick honor and david webb and alex hemingway cant leave those guys open youve got to be there on the catch you can help off the other guys you can be late on the other guys you cant be late on those two 59 53 four and a half to play state just jumps right on you thats the main field goals Music why traps been scoreless in the second half good look for bear too much zest on that pass thatll be a turnover yeah you needed a catchers mitt to that one right idea wrong speed on that pass Applause Music Applause and daniels called for the offensive foul no that was helens Applause and he just fouled out they got him for that left arm he threw it out after the bump kevin keith saying hes bringing the ball up i mean there wasnt a lot there was there he put himself in a position for the official to make a call if he keeps his arm down its play on but once you start pushing off and pushing out the officials see it they have to make a call big call in this game as clemson gets it back trailing by six yeah look at his right arm i mean its incidental contact but he throws that arm out push out discipline to keep it in yeah the pace has really changed in this game and it favors clemson down the stretch amir sims the bounce pass the bear who dumps it in 59 55 under four to play its turning into a half court heavyweight fight everything is grinding now not a lot of easy buckets Applause execution down the stretch will be huge and hemingway called for the foul against cam hayes Music so the pack in the bonus camp hayes shooting free throws when we come back good look inside for jonathan bear clemson back in it a lot of time left one advantage for nc state jericho hellums just fouled out cam hayes at the stripe shooting free throws after that last foul by the tigers win against alex hemingway hes paul being cardi im roy philpot fantastic to have you on board tonight good crowd on hand here as well almost 2 000 theyve been loud at times giving us a little atmosphere and weve enjoyed that some booze when the heisman trophy was announced but other than that theyve been very very spirited pays two for two at the line this year and when you know it oh gosh couldnt you wait that was my mistake couldnt you wait hes just a freshman french time has arrived in tiger town lead is five for nc state theyve held that advantage basically since it was eight to seven clemson early tonight clemsons defense in the last four minutes has posted a shutout against state four minutes in tennessee states last field goal honors had the hot hand for the tigers good look inside him and way quick turnaround puts it in he snuck that one in there what a pass by nick honor the ability to come off that screen and find the cutter hes nearly lost it sims steals it three ball could tie it up under three to play in little john Applause trapp the sims on the way what is it with that rim cant buy one tonight good look hes got to keep his head on the defensive end of the floor cant let the offense affect the defense roy phil potter you know your defensive stance thats right need some work 10 on the shot clock heres devin daniels clemson helps each other so well daniels attacking off the mark trapped the rebound sims again and a blocking foul call this time tigers will have the one and one well i didnt know which way that one was gonna go if that was called against sims he fouls out that was one of those really quick collisions more kind of sideways still you agree with the call youre youre thinking charge he wasnt squared up yeah you have to be squared up to take it yeah he was a little bit sideways how about you kill more fearless a freshman doesnt care one more for sims Applause well coming up later tonight in play ej manuels gonna be on board right here on acc network get the latest going on around the conference kelsey riggs as well discuss all the hot topics going on in the acc crowd on its feet the lead is one and a timeout call last field goal for nc state by dj thunderbird with 7 39 to go starting to lock in i think if youre the wolf pack you got to look at daniels a thunderbird down the stretch here youre talking about scoring in the half court set more movement more cutting more screening keep the ball in the middle third of the floor the offense was flowing in the first half second half clemson tightened it up defensively we thought it would be a good one i said earlier today i thought this was the best game on the college basketball schedule today its coming close to living up to that billing and a lot at stake nc state undefeated in the conference early on clemson at two and one tigers the highest ranked team in the acc along with virginia tech theyre tied at 19th and youve said it several times you think either one of these teams have a chance a legitimate opportunity to win the conference absolutely and i havent seen the entire acc but ive seen most of it had miami ive seen georgia tech i know louisville down a couple of bodies duke hasnt played in three weeks carolina doesnt shoot it well behind the arc theyre not scoring in transition they have miami tonight i think these are two of the better teams along with florida state and i think virginia will come back i think their defense will be back to where it was for tony bennett not so much that gonzaga game and their offense will grow more off the mark thunderbird on the offensive glass and he was fouled by bear thatll be the fourth on jonathan bear and dj thunderbird cleaning the glass with the box out 15 points six rebounds watch thunderbird get right inside a beer a little leverage gets low goes up strong thats what you want to do on the weak side block get in there wedge yourself in get that inside position great job by thunderbird what a luxury to have nobodys healthy missed those three games last month perfect at the line tonight theyve needed every single one of them nine for nine at the strike for dj state wants to defend without following if they do clemson goes 11 trapped the sims the fake trap little euro step barrel the offensive rebound only five to shoot they dont know it approaching a minute to play state with the lead and possession now clemsons going to rely on their strength right now this is how they won the game against miami yes sims made the gamewinning shot but they made three consecutive stops down the end they need one right now boyle may have gotten away with the travel no whistle under 10 on the shot clock less than a minute to go in the game thunderbird sims a rebound Applause otter ties it up 19 on the board for the transfer from florida 38 seconds to go and a timeout on the floor for the senior emir sims love his versatility that time the ability to facilitate nick honor he finds that line in the conversion game this came from the rebound the grabandgo by amir sims Applause state stops the ball they dont recognize the shooter the tigers bench loving it right now nick honor yeah thats me with the three what a game this has turned out to be 38 seconds remaining so nc state plenty of time what are you trying to dial up here if youre kevin keats i think you have to go thunderbird daniels maybe in a twoman game middle of the floor set that high ball screen in the middle shooters stay space try to get thunderbrook on the roll but you just cant go into a pick and roll against clemson you cant get first side offense youre gonna have to get some movement some motion into that ball screen so tough to win on the road to the acc clemson comes in 19th in the country trying to hold serve and here we go theres that middle ball screen Applause plenty of time for devin daniels sams picks off the pass shot clock is off and brad bernell going to call a timeout how about this turn of events clemson hasnt led it since it was eight to seven and now has a chance to win it in walkoff fashion perhaps we talked about the pace of the game changing its been clemsons pace in the last four or five minutes its been more of a half court game its been more of a defensive game and clemson scoring in the half court hemingway pure from deep and how about sims doesnt score facilitates in this game they find the cutter under the basket what a pass by nick morin perhaps the biggest player of the night since to honor a nick honor not just making threes but how about the pass he made to the cutter under the basket defends well that fordham transfer paid off big time in this game he is our spotlight player presented by geico five of six from bonus land and without him this game isnt close nick honor has been nothing short of sensational so 12 plus seconds to work with you got to think honor is going to have a major role in this endofgame sequence and they could use them as a screener and dont forget about amir sims he hit the gamewinning shot against miami but hes one of eight tonight it doesnt matter that thats history thats next play you get the ball to where mere sims you get them in the middle of the floor let them operate you have to trust your seniors only loss for nc state this year at st louis in a popup game billikens awfully talented this year and so much at stake here with 127 seconds remaining crowd on its feet honor gets against the freshman shaquille moore five seconds to go honor attacking and the setback rejected by moore over time and little john shaquille moore made so many big plays down the stretch at boston college in that win this time he does it defensively shaquille moore was locked in on nick moore im sorry nick honor stays down doesnt go for the fake Music well go for overtime right now you survived the run by clemson your defense got due to overtime that little guy right there shaquille moore i mean a nick honor theyve been sensational tonight morris 61 180 plays a lot bigger nick honor of course 510 205 moore got the best of that battle and it came at a critical time and shaquille moore absolutely fearless early in his career in raleigh giant control the opening cap of ot yeah jonathan vere and mayor sims four fouls each keep an eye on that keep in mind nc state also without braxton beverly injured during pregame warmups if you can envision that moore feeling it off the mark honor the Applause rebound lets get more of this matchup trap the elbow j silky smooth and clemson has its first lead in what feels like years the trap just slowed down off that ball screen and found the open pocket of space and knocked it down first advantage since 87 nc state without a field goal in the last eight minutes devin daniels will try to change that here states got to get back to more movement before the play bates inside hes got the four personals also has seven points tied at 64 i think state playing through fun to burke and bates inside can pay dividends in overtime hemingway the runner how about that for a guy whos a pure shooter great handle Applause three and a half to play in overtime a pair of oneloss teams at it tonight Applause thunderbird d3 count it the big man can shoot it from deep hes worked on that shot in the off season dj thunderberg in his first game back had 21 points in 29 minutes against bc thats three games packed with pause for about a week sims is short shot hasnt been there all night daniels the rebound stayed by a point and with possession legs look flat that time on a mayor sims halfway through our first overtime Applause session daniel sailed that pass out of bounds trying to spot thomas allen you know the pressure that clemson puts on the ball and they force you into turnovers not by pressing not by trapping but by being in the right spot at the right time you have to be so good and so clean with your passing and catching Music otter off the screen inside to sims working against bates puts it in with a jump puck bates didnt even go after that one of the best shot blockers in the nation i know hes got four fouls but you got to get your hand up tigers back in front another pass out of bounds unusual to see devin daniels with backtoback turnovers Applause clemson that time just put all guys in the paint wasnt sure where to throw it out of bounds they ran that action last time and then we got a jumper sims feeling it with the other hand another jump up backtoback baskets for amir sims after an ice cold start trust your senior hes feeling it right now and moore will shoot two nearly had a chance to tie us up again clemsons been so efficient coming up in the clutch amir sims just bodying in hes got that soft touch good extension good time to fill it in overtime going right hand going left hand you know when youre a senior you keep your head in the game you understand theres a next play young players sometimes can lose their confidence when they dont score early in the game not this young man that foul win against jonathan bear thats his fifth Applause first clemson player to foul out thatll give kevin keates a moment to talk things over with his club pj hall will check in and shaquille moore at the strike not been a great prepro shooter this season and his first attempts in this game clutch 43 i had him at four for 11 im sorry 36 youre right looked good though didnt it first one did second one not so much the rebound to him and way clemson by two approaching a minute to play Applause brad burnell tells nick honor to slow things down for a minute hell call out the play youre gonna play through amir sims whether its in the post or as a facilitator theyre gonna look at sims thunderbird trying to d up number 25 in white as best as he can hes doing a great job otter penetrating clothing and a chance for three for nick otter how about the handle by honor splits the defense thats a lefthanded floater in the paint recognizes he cant get to the rim against nc state stops on a dime with the left hand impressive clemson trying to seize control in overtime after trailing for most of the night the lead is for their largest in this game and a chance to increase it with honor at the strike coach and they did it with their defense when you look at the last five or six minutes of the game they held nc state scoreless for about four minutes they were able to score the ball armor got hot from the outside game goes in overtime amir sims now its a major threat feeling confident i think clemson has found their scoring opportunities in this game and maybe all season long with amir sims nick honor and dawes lets check out the best stuff that happened tonight brought to you by our friends of papa johns amir sims getting it done after a cold start he has been clutch in ot well he starts in the paint thats where hes most comfortable just goes right over manny bates with that jump hook using the body to get deep he can go with either hand hes tough to guard inside hes a great passer jump shot hasnt been there tonight but he understands where hes best is in the paint at the rim eight and seven go along with four assists for amir sims senior out of virginia after he tied his career high with 25 at miami last game its been a work in progress tonight but hes been just enough in this extra session all right kevin keats talking to his club theyre looking at trying to foul here to get back in it connor makes the free throw trailing by five whats the strategy well i think for state you know they score best off their defense youre looking at a two possession game right now lets see what happens at the line first tigers are 81 you mentioned it earlier wins against mississippi state alabama maryland fsu purdue resume awfully impressive the net rankings indicate clemson at number 15 translate roughly into about a four seed according to joe leonard espn racketologists its going to be a two possession game make or miss states got to score quickly youre going to have to think about the foul game or a quick trap then foul if its two possessions and the clock is at about a shot clock 67 for honor and hes off the mark now five of seven tonight thats a big miss here comes the freshman shaquille moore now to the senior and daniels was fouled by trap not a good play for numeral zero thats not the play that brad bruno was thinking about defensively that was an inadvertent bump turned into a foul tell you what you got to be clean and crisp with your passing trap a little aggressive about 35 feet from the basket daniels a 68 free throw shooter its the bounce on the first three of five tonight next one could make it a one possession game so paul you got 41 seconds left in essence you could try to play defense for the duration of the shot clock here right you absolutely can you got to trust your defense i think youre going to see a trap by nc state youre going to get it back with 10 they may blitz a ball screen right here 7270 no need to foul shot clock winding down now at 10 seconds doss trying to get it to haul the freshman goes to work against bates one of the top shot blockers in the country paul gets the bounce what an effort lead is four shaquille moore and kevin keats called a timeout as dawes hit the deck itll stay with nc state but how about pj hall working against manny bates well the freshman had it with only a few seconds he knew the shot clock the game clock winding down bates bited him got that home court bounce that was a long jump hook with the sweet bounce pj hall number 60 in the espn 100 fourstar signing and a bigtime get for brad brunell his coaching staff and theyre going to bring him along slowly averages about five points three boards per game you see the eight points tonight no two bigger than what we just saw and i want to say he grew up a little bit on that possession but it certainly doesnt hurt his development well thats a shot that gives a freshman a lot of confidence moving forward in acc play the ability to post up and score at crunch time make you want the ball more as game goes on his teammates will be more confident throwing the ball to him gonna double check to make sure that the right time is still left on the clock is pj hall got himself into the paint with two feet and and bates was putting the body on him bates with four fouls didnt want to commit one but i thought he would have went for that block a little more aggressively so watch the clock as keats calls a timeout at the top of the screen and i think theyre gonna add a couple of seconds back on you see it there maybe about eight and a half somewhere in that ballpark coach yes griff doesnt recognize till about seven seconds now this has been a lot of fun we still have some business to take care of well see what nc state tries to draw up out of the timeout theyre going to keep it at seven seconds little surprise there and thats where the officials saw and it state you gotta score quickly you gotta go we have no timeouts you gotta score stale score again shaquille moore will be the trigger man and bravernells gonna call a timeout so we get a chance to see what kevin keats is gonna at least initially try to do and that lineup he had bates and thunderbird right on the right side by the inbounds this could be a simple lob to the rim to try to get a quick twohour get the it was foul on that possession from bates and thunderbird im thinking keats is going to try to go upstairs kevin keats and brad brannell both head coaches at unc wilmington back in the day not necessarily close friends off the court but theyve talked on occasion including when kevin keats took over at uncw and now theyll get a chance to go against each other here tactically its been a fantastic conference of bear near the heart of the acc you see manny bates zero on the right block thunderbird right behind him on the right hash that may be a quick screen to the rim daniels gets it hes got to hurry threepointer on the way short trap the rebound and thats gonna do it a jump ball with 16 remaining theyre going to call a foul against thomas allen in the process and this will be an enormous win for the clemson tigers when it looked like for most of the night nc state is going to sneak out a little john with a win they ran the play for daniels hes been the hot hand all night pretty clean catch and shoot trap with that defense of the board holding on for dear life trap will get one more stayed out of timeouts tigers on the verge of improving to nine and one and three and one in the conference Applause 7470 the final score number 19 survives but it took overtime to get us there they went down most of this game but they were never out of it their defense won the game for clemson one of the elite defensive teams in the country they proved that tonight nick gotter 21 points to lead the tigers and a big time performance as amir sims comes up clutch in the extra session as well wolf pack ball to six and two first conference loss in their first game of 2021 for paul b and cardi im roy bilpot saying good night from clemson south carolina lets send you back to the studio and heres kelsey riggs coming up on in play it was a tough weekend for the acc in college football we try to make sense of it all a
