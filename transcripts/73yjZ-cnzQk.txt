Center we welcome you to a late night of college basketball here on the ACC Network by Dongo able to Corral the opening tip for Georgia Tech and so the yellow jackets in their gray uniforms have the basketball first off the bounce Nathan George hes got to look for his own we know he can set everybody else up second in the league and assist per game but averaging 10 points per and hes got the yellow jackets off to a quick start as you see the starting five for the Fighting Irish matako has been a key xfactor type of guy Tay Davis continues to Blossom for Notre Dame which turns it over here is McCollum over to Lance Terry Drive the Baseline mullum the Oklahoma transfer spent a couple of years to begin his college career at Sienna finds and Dongo left it short and Doug we talked to Coach STM at shootaround in at practice yesterday andago is a guy who whos capable of doing more offensively but just to have an impact on the floor just needs to be active and and use that athleticism and body movement to really help this Georgia Tech Team Marcus Burton misfires on his first attempt Notre Dame won Saturday at Virginia first time theyve ever won in Charlottesville and Burton led the way hitting four first half threepointers Terry George and McCullum about as good a threesome of the back court is youre going to find in the ACC yeah these these Georgia Tech guards they can get to the rim they can shoot the basketball and something that coach drewberry was really talking to his team and shoot around was being in the gaps making sure they see that Irish in front of them whenever they drive to the basket Lance Terry a 39 threepoint shooter makes the score 5 nothing Tech Applause on the screen and roll gets it to Kev who finds Davis open in the corner and if you Georgia Tech that is a win defensively right you are okay with Davis taking that corner three well you saw in that possession right there right away off the pick and roll with Burton they blitzed it and J did a good job of get to the center and be an outlet and really thats a thats a shot that Georgia Tech is going to give give Notre Dame but you see right here McCullum doing a good job getting downhill and yeah sorry just moving on the screen right there I found it interesting michah Shrewsberry sharing with us this afternoon the differences between his offensive philosophy in the first half as opposed to the second half looking to share the basketball move the basketball get guys moving get everybody involved in the first half more so mataco one of the captains Brad transfer from Princeton backing McCollum into the paint and McCollum got him on the arm taking advantage of being 6410 the ears a trip to the line Doug to your point about about Coach Shrewsberry hes almost a a baiting and see what theyre going to do in the first half and then setting up for the second half and you see right here loo just using his size against McCullum right there and we weve seen him do that in previous games just getting into that area and using his height Advantage his strength advantage and just trying to get an opportunity at The Rim Loos been quite a revelation out of the transfer portal for Coach Shrewsberry nearly 4 to1 assist turnover ratio thats best in the ACC fifth in the country and hes on a pace to pass Martin englesby for the alltime Notre Dame single season record and he would blow that record out of the water if he maintains his current pace of 39 assists for every turnover and he just gives the Irish another capable ball handler besides Burton besides Shrewsberry a guy who can go in there and and make a decision and make a play for somebody else Nathan George looking for his offense has a couple of early buckets 71 tag and a foul called against the 63 sophomore point guard from Toronto and with all the injuries that Georgia Tech has faced this year Nathan George is is more than capable offensively scoring the basketball we know hes a playmaker hes looking to pass first but coach ster wants him to be aggressive and look to score the basketball and Georgia te needs them to be we havent even mentioned Braden Shrewsbury the coachs son number 11 in white a lethal weapon from the outside theres the three ball knocked down by Kevin J and J is not a guy whos going to shoot the threepointer often but hes 6 for 12 now on the season so hes 50 hes more than capable of hitting and if he has the opportunity where hes wide open like that coach Shrewsberry is not going to tell him not to shoot Terry left that one short and on the rebound weve got a foul thatll go against George attack right here bird he just creates all that attention on defense which allows J to be wide open on the wing and like we said hes not going to shoot it often but when he gets opportunities hes shooting 50 and Eric that fouls on Suare his second so in making his fourth consecutive start for Georgia techa team that has only eight available scholarship players tonight one of them already in some foul trouble Tay Davis fortunate to keep possession here goes Burton get it back into the hands of Davis tend to shoot shrewbury thought about it now puts it up long rebound Tracked Down by Duncan Powell hes coming off of his careerhigh performance in the win over Virginia Tech last Wednesday 23 points and then this yellow jackets team has enjoyed some time off Dango with an airball Doug Duncan Powell is a guy who start coming off the bench it doesnt really matter hes coming in hes bringing high energy hes bringing grit hes bringing tenacity and offensively he can really shoot the basketball Davis misses again from long range hes been most effective and greatly effective this year when hes putting it on the deck and getting downhill well hes hes super aggressive getting to the basket hes one of the leaders in the ACC and getting to the free throw line over 120 attempts his form doesnt look bad but Georgia Tech if if hes open theyre going to back off theyre going to let him shoot that shot George misfires on the midrange Irish down three with the basketball Burton dribbled it off his heel George comes up with it and here comes tech oh good Hustle by Shrewsberry to keep Powell from throwing it down so he picks up his first personal and weve got our first time out Atlanta when he put 21 on the Fighting Irish in a Georgia Tech Victory 8675 Yellow Jacket shot 60 1 in the first half led by 19 at the intermission and then wound up hanging on for the victory but the big difference between these two games a month later Notre Dame didnt have Marcus Burton for that first meeting its a big difference right there I mean obviously just having Marcus Burton on the floor your defense has to adjust and in how they play and just with his driving ability his shooting ability you know a totally different Notre Dame basketball team so defensively what are you seeing from Tech here against the Notre Dame offense I think early theyre doing a really good job of just when Marcus Burton does get downhill theyre putting bodies right there and theyre making other guys make plays you see Davis theyre leaving him open to shoot it you saw J he had the open opportunity and he knocked it down but theyre doing a good job crowding great cut right here by alako and finding ji whos just right at the rim and and thats what hes doing is a big body be physical and just go up strong opportunity for two foul on Bay and Dango remember the 2024 AC all rookie team as kevi at the free throw line we talked about what a good threepoint shooter he has been this year in limited opportunities hes been good all the way around six and a half points six rebounds a game and for Notre Dame as a rim running type of big he has provided what coach shrewbury needs from that position Doug Ill tell you what theres only one basketball and theres five players on the court you need guys who are going to play their roles and be okay with that be okay with not seeing the ball not scoring all the time and gu is a guy who hes going to be physical hes going to play defense hes going to rebound and hes going to be a presence at The Rim George set up and Dango draws the foul and will shoot a couple of free throws Eric Im fascinated by the chess match between coaches and again getting behind the scenes a little bit with coach shrewbury today as he and stmy try to figure out what the other ones doing and then make adjustments as we go well both have a high level of respect for each other obviously both had NBA stance uh you know coaching and you I like what Shrewsberry was telling us the first half you kind of you know throw stuff out there and see how they play it and then you know whether later in the first half or early in the second thats when you kind of adjust and see what you want to do even more so and really try to attack it and again both these guys were assistant coaches under Brad Stevens with the Boston Celtics as a matter of fact Brad Stevens son Brady is a walkon at Notre Dame and you know when the Celtics cut down the Nets this year after game five coach Shrewsbury was there he was part of the celebration he has a ring he has a championship ring and of course Damon STM is a great NBA player NBA Allstar had a long career and has had a really good coaching career both as an assistant in the NBA and as a head coach in college at Pacific the foul is going to go against Nikita constantini with an illegal screen n hes other guy who just he comes in and plays his role just you know moving a little bit too much just have to stand still and get a wider base on that scen Ryan Matumbo has also come into the game for Georgia Tech 72 senior from Atlanta of course the son of the great dmbe Matumbo defensively Shrewsberry was talking about it all practice they want to be in the gaps they want to be long and they want Georgia teex guard to see them there on the drives off the Matumbo miss here is Marcus Burton constantini back out to Shrewsberry good ball movement also Julian roer the second is checked in number one for Notre Dame Marcus Burton still looking for his first points of the night 6 and A2 minutes in shrewbury as well his first two come on a runner marus Burton creates so much attention and Georgia Tech is doing a great job of being active and when he does get into that paint area he has bodies all around but thats when you got opportunities for your Shooters Shrewsberry even on the kick now its a long scramble and you see him be able to get on the drive and do his floater Matumbo misses the first time but Taps it in on second attempt thats what Matumbo is going to do hes hes a sevenfooter hes a big body hes not going to be a a big time threat offensively but if youre seven foot and you get that close to the rim please make it whatever offense you get out of Ryan m is a positive for the yellow jackets Shrewsbury to the corner sir mohamd out there and Burtons now on the scoreboard so Burton averages about 20 a game Shrewsbury 15 a game and on consecutive possessions they get on the board its only a matter of time before Burton gets his opportunities defensively there are going to be breakdowns from Georgia Tech but you just love to see the ball mve it in the body movement from the Irish something that coach Shrewsberry really was stressing to his team step back three by Duncan Powell Off the Mark 1310 Georgia Tech Fighting Irish with a chance to tie with a three ball Roper gives it back to Shrewsbury sets a good screen on Terry constantini going to work right around Matumbo and he lays it in a little showtime for the big man from Ukraine and he learned that on the playgrounds of Ukraine right there denro Jin he is a ke native count the basket at a chance for three Javen McCullum with a burst line among the last four in but on the wrong side of the bubble hes also got SMU in the first four RS and then Wake Forest before tonight in the next four round so at the moment the ACC with five not as many as folks around this league would like and what theyre accustomed to and certainly not what the SEC has going on Doug Im Im really impressed with how Louisville has been playing wow I mean he with the two main guys who got hurt for the season and Coach cat Pat Kelce excuse me you cant give him enough credit to how hes got his guys playing and just high energy active defensively offensively the guards are penetrating creating opportunities for themselves Louisville has been outstanding Burton makes his second three of the night off the feed from his fellow local recruit Jr kzne and Doug something that Burtons been doing a really good job Georgia Techs been doing a really good job of putting bodies in front of him but he hasnt really forced anything right hes taken the opportunities that come to him and you see on both threepoint shots great opportunities and he knocks them down George lobs inside for nango the sophomore from Sagal surveys the paint and kicks it back outside McCullum from 16 ft nothing but net for the 62 senior from Fort Meers Florida thats good defense right there by Burton but just a tough shot by call him right there and hes a tough shot maker hes a guy we talk about he could score on all three levels well since becoming conference rivals in the ACC Georgia Tech has never won in this building Damon STM their head coach with a smile today told us thats going to change tonight theyre off to a decent start about Midway through the first half a competitive first N9 and 12 minutes shot clock expires as roer tried to make the extra pass and the tech Defense Forces the turnover Burtons done a great job of not forcing anything but just taking the opportunities that come to him you see him knocking down to top of the key threepoint shot and this is a great guard battle right here McCullum right here just going right at Burtons chest and hitting a tough shot hes a hes a tough shot maker dog thats what he does well he was all Big 12 Conference honorable mentioned last year for Oklahoma when he averaged 13 per game with the Sooners and he told us earlier today Eric about he brought experience and he thought that was was a big deal for the group at Georgia Tech that he was able to add along with the scoring and other things this year and I think experience is is really key especially all the adversities that Georgia Tech is facing you know going through all these injuries hes the guy that can really keep his team locked in and with his experience you know just talking to his team you know keeping their head above water and making sure everybodys locked in Tay Davis still scoreless Music first foul on Matt Alo by the way uh constantini a while back picked up his second foul as we were going to breaks so each team has one player with two fouls about Midway through this first half and now B Dango 69 240 lbs originally committed to ruter out of putham Science Academy in Connecticut but followed Carl Hobs when he left rut to take the same position as associate head coach under Damon stmy and George Tech certainly is glad to have him although from what STM has told us he doesnt feel like the numbers he has put up have been as impactful this year his numbers are still solid but he hasnt taken that freshman to sophomore jump well he he was talking about Dango is a guy who whos never really been the man on his team so I I think that pressure got to him early in the season but what can he do to be really effective for Georgia Tech what you saw in that previous possession just run the floor hard use your athleticism rim run get opportunities for lobs at the basket and then if you get fouled knock down your free throws but hes not really a guy right now where you throw the ball down to him offensively and tell him to go get a bucket hes a guy that needs to run the floor and get those type of opportunities at The Rim hes averaging about 11 points eight rebounds a game again the shot clock down for Notre Dame shury hes got that in his game this year where last year as a freshman he was pretty much all around the perimeter much improved putting the ball on the deck but what right there what created it was just the body movement and the ball movement getting guys and scramble mode defensively creates an angle you see Shrewsberry doing a good job driving opportunity at The Rim butum now with seven absorbs the contact and finishes Georgia Tech up by five hes not a big physical guy either right we talked about he was 150 at sien and hes obviously gained some weight since then but still not a big guy but just tough mindset getting into guys bodies creating the contact and be able to finish through the contact yeah that might have been 150 soaking wet when he showed up at Sienna the first time coming out of Florida of a l though it was evident though when hes healthy he is a terrific player although of course he Sho shoots an air ball while were talking nice things about him but he has been a terrific addition he is another one of the Tech players who has missed time due to injury this year because of a concussion but hes been on quite a r roll shb off the Davis screen he can be lethal from there as first made three of the ball game Doug I dont care if you got a hand in his face you have to be able to take that away and make him put it on the ground you have to lock and trail on his hip push him off that threepoint line even if youre there as an example hes going to still be able to knock it down yeah both a volume threepoint shooter who is fourth most accurate in the ACC third midrange pullup from Nathan George tonight this is what Nathan George needs to be able to do for Georgia Tech we know you can get in the in the pain and create for others but youre 65 you can shoot the basketball you can create plays get in there and be aggressive offensively and look for yours Davis coughs it up nobody gets back and Terry with the Music jam this what we talked about at the top of the broadcast Georgia Tech has to be able to create offense from their defense get opportunities in transition not always having to play against the set defense in half court Tech with its largest lead of the night McCollum with a burst into the lane finds the open man Terry in the corner Works around a loo puts it up Applause no Notre Dame needs to get this guy going Tay Davis gives it to Alo kesn catch and shoot three well kesn is a guy whos been playing livit in minutes but hes 670 can shoot the basketball everybody really on this Notre Dame basketball team can shoot the ball you know obviously Tay D Tay Davis isnt a great perimeter shooter but hes capable but all these other guys on Notre Dame can shoot the basketball at a high level and that guy right there dgap pal he can shoot the ball as well says dont forget about me hes a 35 on the year his first made field goal and its back to a sixpoint ball game Doug hes an example of when guys get hurt you get more of an opportunity and then your game improves just from playing more and get more opportunities on the floor heres Davis on pal kick it out of loo quickly to kesn he is shot ready at all times that one rims out though I tell you what if I only play limited minutes Im going to be shot ready too whenever that ball touches my hand its going up come on man even if you were playing 40 minutes going to be shot ready 100 as well you should have been under 6 minutes to go little pick and roll action Bango wanted a foul missed the shot here comes the Fighting Irish 2923 Tech Davis continues to not get to the basket defensively Tech has done a nice job kesn hunting his own shot the young man out of St Joseph High School here in South Bend with five quick points Off the Bench averaging only four per ball game well you knew Georgia Tech was going to focus on two guys Burton and Tay Davis now these other guys have opportunity to step up and make shots and thats what you see happening right now for Notre Dame b gets cut off going right keeps the dribble down the lane with the left hand and denied by joh oh J right there moving his feet right Applause there under 10 to shoot Shrewsbury thought about it picks up the dribble puts it up rebound cleared by Dango and that possession right there favors Georgia Tech the Notre Dame offense was more stagnant more isolated and that goes to Georgia Tech here but how about Duncan Powell just continues to take advantage of his opportunities on the floor shooting the ball at a high high level hes got eight points to extend the lead to seven the largest of the night now Davis runs into that brick wall of a chest from pow kicks it back out to kesn Applause J dribbling his way toward the paint going to have to put it up goes over the left shoulder just barely Nick the front iron and again Georgia Tech will take those POs those last two possessions for Notre Dame Georgia Tech will take that all day Powell going to be called for the offensive foul each claims both as his homes and hes been playing very very well tonight on his third Collegiate stop spent a couple of years at the uh HBCU North Carolina t then last year out to the West Coast to play for Sacramento state did well enough there gotten a chance to play in the ACC Vier Georgia teack Marcus Burton has spent plenty of time on the bench in the first half no fouls hes back into the game five to shoot roer turns down the shot now takes it constantini playing with two fouls on the offensive glass Music Burton kicks this time Ropers ready and he buries it and these are the opportunities that theyre going to get Doug and Julian roer you have to take that shot when its open because you see when Marcus Burtons getting downhill that jorgia Tech just has bodies in the lane so the drive and kick is going to be open often for Notre Dame you have to be able to shoot those when you get them Tech has led from the start bad pass poked Away by Burton picked up by shrewbury Sir mohamd back into the game number four in white for Notre Dame freshman and Son of Nazi muhamd out of bounds and thatll take us to our under four media time the better four or five teams in the league I think that is a team that can get things going back in the right direction well theyre back for with with Legette and low two guys who are really explosive at getting to the rim hitting perimeter shot and creating plays for their teammates when you have good guard play youre going to give yourself a chance to win some games bucket by Braden Shrewsbury coming out of the timeout hes now got nine points back to a twopoint Applause game column cut off finds the open man in the paint who throws it down on the beautiful feed back into the game playing with two fouls Ibrahim Suare has his first two points it was a great job right there my ballum right there just to continue to probe continue to probe and then see the little opening great balance pass to Suare right there Mis Rotation by Notre Dame dunk by Suare that is what Julian roer is going to bring to this Irish team saves the ball off the leg of his opponent Dougs a Detroit guyan Im surprised it took this long to get that in what do you expect hes a Midwest guy hes tough hes hard NOS what he has to be able to do is be ready when those opportunities come to him on Perimeter if youre open you have to be able to shoot the ball well when Burton was sidelined in November and December with that knee injury he got a chance to start six games theres Burton back to full health delivering once again hes got eight points for the Fighting Irish back to a twopoint game Im just really impressed because Georgia Techs done a great job guarding Burt but hes being patient hes not forcing anything you see him right there playing off at 2 feet and Dango doesnt come out he is set midrange floater Nate George hes now got nine points very efficient shooting the basketball tonight Doug if a Coach tells me I need you to be more aggressive offensively thats all you got to say you dont tell me anymore Nathan Jorge iss starting to understand that he needs to be a threat offensively scoring the basketball well you see the footwork of Nikita constantini one more time hes got four points Off the Bench for the Fighting Irish thats a strong man right there grown man strength just playing off of the contact finishing strong at the r 610 260 dungo looks down at the threepoint line then missfires from the corner Notre Dame is okay with him shooting that corner three every single time Notre Dame has trailed the entire half but with a three could head to the locker room tied and now timeout call Coach shrewbury and well take it with him and return to purcel Pavilion in 30 seconds Music Music Applause Music Applause Thursday at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will break down a full night of ACC Hoops plus theyll look ahead to a fantastic weekend schedule catch it all on acc Network and the ESPN with Eric dorf Im Doug Sherman theres Muffet mcgr hes got a statue out front a banner hanging inside and she will be part of our ACC network coverage as we were just showing you there Notre Dame womens basketball is a hot ticket around here and the mens basketball program just trying to keep up Michel Shrewsbury in year number two has his team looking for a 500 record with a win tonight loo glances over to coach shrewbury now with 6 seconds 5 Seconds Alo uses the screen contested three nothing but net and the Fighting Irish have come all the way back first tie of the ball game more opportunities not only for himself but for his teammates getting more open looks and now for Micah Shrewsberry told us earlier today that second half hes looking more for two and three man actions and maybe that is the key to unlock Tay Davis who had no points no rebounds no assists no fouls in that first half Georgia Tech did a good job of putting Tay Davis out on the perimeter and just forcing him to shoot jump jump shots I want to see Notre Dame get him in that elbow area where he could play off the hand off or just really turn that corner and be aggressive to the rim something that he really excels at first block shot of the night for either side belongs to Nathan George the point guard for the yellow jackets who has the ball draws the contact Alo deflected the pass the rambl wck keeps possession this is Jen McCollum the former Oklahoma Sooner honorable mention all Big 12 a year ago open man in the corner gives up the shot back to mcallum little twoman game theres indongo getting active at his first two points and thats what Im talking about D you see him right there he passes it back to McCullum but then he Sprints into the screen already giving himself the advantage and then you see him slipping it right there getting that drop pass and then just being aggressive to the rim first made field goal for nango he was four for four from the line of the first half Applause Georgia Tech has never trailed it was a threepointer right before the halftime buzzer that tied it up for Tech another block shot for Nathan George I think Nathan George is an underrated Defender at 65 and you know having that lengthy body athleticism you know hes capable of getting Steals and getting deflections on that end well I think Damon stmy had the same idea get by and involved and when you got a guy like Nathan George whos handling the ball he can get downhill and make plays he loves to throw lobs at the rim and dgo just be by the rim and be aggressive use your athletic ability and finish another defensive play made by Nathan George Dongo gives it up to McCollum back to George to McCollum in the corner Davis steps out defensively bad pass Burton pokes it away Tracked Down by Powell in the back court no change of possession so the shot clock continues to wind down Dongo sets the ball screen George going to work goes to the left hand and lays it in timeout Notre Dame six quick points to begin the second half as Georgia Tech tries to tonight but George 17th in the country and second in the ACC but hes not just a guy who sets up his teammates hes got to look for his own well coach sire he was talking about it in practice in a shoot around they need Nathan George to be more aggressive looking for his own opportunities scoring the basketball and when he does that its just going to make his job a little bit easier as far as playmaking for his teammates a second turnover here in the second half committed by Notre Dame mullum finds Suare brings it back out to indongo and he Applause traveled AJ Desai Eric Lewis and Doug sha are three officials tonight that was Eric Lewis who with a smile explained you cant change your pivot foot well thats thats basketball dog yeah sir Mohamad Off the Bench for Notre Dame this is Matt Alo and back out to Burton the sophomore Sensation from nearby mishaa Indiana five to shoot Burton good shot fake better defense once again by Tech third time he has had one of his shots blocked to begin the second half and thats what indongo brings on the defensive side of the basketball use your athleticism use your movement and be aggressive in your movement dont just be slow to the ball see right here Burton doing a good job of just getting to the rim but indago coming from the weak side and using that athleticism in lank and getting the block shot Applause Lance Terry averaging over 15 per game hes got five kicks it out for Powell muscles it up to the rim gets it back but I think he was out of bounds indeed he was and so its Notre Dame basketball and Doug real quick just back to indang he hes a guy who his movement has to be aggressive but it has to be controlled I I always talk about as a basketball player you have to be aggressive but you have to be able to control it but for him especially when hes active when hes moving he just brings that energy on both ends of the floor and He makes himself more useful well this is Notre Dames sixth possession of the second half and they have yet to get a shot to the rim three shots blocked two turnovers and the foul is called with 1602 remaining in regulation first foul on Lance Terry and so will be fighting Irish basketball underneath Doug I think one thing that help the Georgia Tech guys they know that theyre not going to come out of the basketball game they dont really have that many guys to to come Sub in so they have to play hard they have to be active and defensively they they have really been bringing a lot of energy and doing a good job of just having bodies in front of those guys and when they do get by theyre there at The Rim to contest energy effort enthusiasm the three EAS good effort that time by indongo to get the rebound to Suare tech only used two reserves two of their three available scholarship reserves in that first half and again Georgia Tech play without Jaden Musto missing his third straight game with a foot injury Shrewsbury misses on the three and a foul on the rebound kaasi Reeves still out LC this a zero assist its a zero still just his inactivity on both ends of the floor hes hes not being his aggressive self and at some point Doug if Im Tay Davis Im going to get the ball and you dont want to force it but you want to be able to be aggressive at the rim and create opportunities for yourself some way go to the rim get foul get opportunities at the free throw line see the ball go through the basket but you have to be aggressive Tay Davis in order for this Notre Dame team to be as good as they can be well he just got his first rebound of the ball game and it helps to set up Marcus Burton Fighting Irish with their first two points of the second half and Doug if Im Davis Im trying to get it closer to the rim Im getting it Im playing off the elbow a guy comes off for the hand off I can turn the corner if he reacts off that I have the little midrange opportunity right there you just have to find Opportunities to get to a spot on the floor where you could be effective foul on the penetration Burtons just so crafty with the ball you see him right there just the step back behind behind the leg dribble and Terry really had good defense right there hes just a tough shot maker hes crafty as they come with the ball and hes able to make tough shots that was the second foul on Julian roer suar goes Applause out Davis defensively now on the switch has McCollum second Defender comes Powell penetrates had it poked away and here comes Burton with numbers Daviss running mate throw it to the rim Little Too Tall and Tay could not bring it down that was one of those opportun right there where it would have got Tay Davis going a little bit getting the alley dunk on a fast break and Dango misses the layup I was going to say I loved how he made himself available for that pass and then missed the easy part yeah Miss Opportunity by Georgia Tech right at The Rim its a bunny right there in Applause Dango heres Burton the whistle Applause Music cops and I think just for Notre Dame right now again theyre becoming more stagnant he talked about coacho but you need ball movement you need body movement thats when Notre Dame really excels not when they get the movement theyre able to create more opportunities for their Shooters its harder to play basketball when you dont have movement youre more in isolated style of play and you dont really get as much opportunity foul number two on and dango kzns come back in for Notre Dame replacing Matt Alo Davis out to Applause Burton Burton off of two feet and Banks it home D that is a tough finish right there at the rim he hes only 59 honestly and then McCollum McCollum did a good job of coming over and and helping on that but Burton just making tough shots and prior to that you see how Duncan pal is playing Tay Davis hes just sagging off all the way and again thats where just having that midrange jumper would be that much more effective for Tay Davis Dongo having a big second half showing off the nice touch six points of his 10 have come since the break Music kesn puts it up Davis the offensive Applause rebound and rather than kicking it out he goes to work thats what you have to do get an offensive rebound see what you have you got into a spot where you can be effective and then just be aggressive at The Rim be your explosive self well he makes 67 of his shots at The Rim hes third overall field goal percentage in the league at over 50 that was his first bucket here tonight Fighting Irish down by two they have never LED in this ball game Burton creates space finds an opening and lays it in 14 points for the sophomore out of nearby pen high school and were tied at 45 the contact and he shows it game in and game out well the last time anybody from Notre Dame averaged better than 20 points and five assists for a season that was Rivers back in his senior year of 8788 he went on to be a first round draft pick of the LA Clippers and spent three years playing in the league and Burton did investigate after his terrific freshman year his possibility of going to the NBA decided to come back for a sophomore year perhaps down the road hell have an opportunity to play in the NBA as well Julian rooper creating some space in the lane and he lays it in Julian roer just another guy who like Po comes in and brings high energy hes gritty hes one of the best defenders on the team you see him right here guarding George but hes a guy who hes going to do whatever coach Shrewsberry ask him to do I dont think George has hit the rim on any of his midrange pullups tonight 16 points to lead the way for tack we talked about him just being more assertive offensively established himself as an offensive threat and hes more than capable of doing that you see it tonight Music now rer will take a seat for Notre Dame Alo has returned out there with kevi Marcus Burton Braden Shrewsberry and Jr kesn here is kesn back to Burton Burton Works around Terry lost it and the foul comes against number zero in Gray Doug what I really like most about Marcus Bergen and you know his maturation as a point guard is hes in control he hes not forcing it his decision making has gotten better he knows how to draw fouls you see right there Georgia Tech just switching on that and he took his time jab stpp got into the lane drew the foul hes just gotten so much better in his decision making turned down the three now the tough two McCullum will send Burton into the line Second foul on McCullum after Terry had just picked up his second Burton has been cooking this month Eric only Cooper flag at Duke is averaging more points per game in the ACC and its so hard to keep a guy like Burton in front of you it its almost like he forces you to follow them dog he he puts you in angles and situations where youre uncomfortable and you try to get in front and and stop and you end up you know following him well Eric be sure to catch ACC pm with Mark Packer weekdays at four Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Burton in 85 foul shooter swished the first rattled in the second notan back to within a point the game was tied at the intermission at 37 after a buzzer beating triple by mat alako otherwise the yellow jackets have led throughout George works his way into the lane keeps AO on his hip and its going to be a foul on matako his second for the former Bradley High School star from hilard Ohio who has been a big addition out of the transfer portal for Coach shrewbury hes kind of the voice of the team hes a natural leader apparently born to speak colum goes around Burton finds the open man Powell back to McCollum Powell had his pocket picked by Burton and here comes Shrewsbury for Notre D couple of bodies getting tangled off the ball McCollum and Davis thats a tough match up physically for Javen McCollum he picks up his third foul at 62175 against Tay Davis who is 69 215 and I just I just like guys competing at a high level you know bodies are in going to get thrown to the ground youre going to get bumped youre going to get knocked down basketball is a contact sport dog if youre competing at a high level those things are going to happen Defender goes down Burton picked up by Terry good shot fake and he draws another foul its just unbelievable just just a little pump fake or a little jab step and and he just needs you to give him a little bit of room and then he finds that crease in that angle to try to get by and and like I said before he just forces you to foul him third foul on Terry so he and McCollum both with three again the yellow jackets playing with only eight scholarship players again tonight theyve used only seven Burton has another shot block still with the basketball able to get it back out shrewbury Techs done a nice job to keep Shrewsbury from heating up tonight well hes a guy guy that Notre Dame obviously needs to get going but when youre such a good shooter and you know theyre going to play that so much up on you like that it just opens up an opportunity just to get into the midrange and hes more than capable to get into that area hit the floater or a little pullup jump shot Suare the r Shir freshman from Guinea makes it 5249 George attack T Davis loses the dribble off his shin and here comes McCollum with a full head of Steen no oh on the layup Suare hustling for it and brings it back out to George Powell for three got it Duncan Powell I mean he just continually shows up for this Georgia Tech Team on the boards being aggressive hitting jump shots and he really bow Tech out right there they did a good job of creating opportunity at the rim and didnt get it but dunan Powell knocking down an open three Powell now three of five from Beyond The Arc tonight hes got 11 points blocking foul Applause call dunan pow has just been playing out of his mind and no hesitation right there rise up and knock it down Duncan pow hes energy hes effort hes grit and he can shoot the heck out of the ball yeah 6 for nine over the last two games from three and you see McCollum now is going to take a seat with those four personal fouls Terry will stay out there with three fouls and if youre Damon STM got a lot of time on the clock to try and thread that needle and and Javon hes hes a quick guy himself it just shows you how quick Marcus Burton is I mean they have multiple guys trying to guard him but if youre not there on the catch if youre a little bit late a pump fake or just a little bit of jab hes just going to get an opportunity to get by Applause you off of a his historic freshman season Marcus Burton joined Troy Murphy and Chris Thomas as conference rookies of the Year remember Notre Dame for many many years was independent then a league rival of yours Eric in the Big East and now in the ACC well dou got cooked here yeah your freshman season freshman Season 22 got the win my guy G Mack had 25 he was the senior leader and and always a tough place to play here in another Dame foul comes before the shot so no basket for Lance Terry I had to get one in DG okay its okay proud Syracuse alumnus to my right personal foul on Marcus Burton that time just his first and you mentioned GMAC course Jerry mamera one of the heroes on the 2003 national championship game Powell effective outside effective inside I just love guys who compete at a high level make Miss whatever it is theyre theyre continuing to play hard Duncan Powell is one of those guys again the last seven games he been averaging 14 per night hes got 13 in counting this night Burton draws a crowd as usual back to Shrewsberry Here Comes AO thats a shot thats a shot right there instead plenty of time on the clock Burton up and in despite a defender in front of him and a Defender they closing from behind I tell you what hes a tough shot maker he gets to the spot wherever he needs to get with that dribble hes getting there and usually when he gets there hes getting a great opportunity and a great look another one right there and Eric this is now his fifth straight 20point game Ben hansboro the last Fighting Irish player to do Applause Music that look they need to get stops just thinking the same thing doesnt matter what happens at the defensive end for Notre Dame if they cant stop the yellow jackets at that that end Powell scored the last seven points for George attack Doug eventually they theyre just going to crowd and make Mar Marcus Burton pass the ball and make other guys have to hit Applause shots roer takes the contact there to clean it up the big fella Constantin will have a chance for three just by rer being aggressive yeah it was a tough shot but by him being aggressive how do they get a loo how do they get Davis going well they got to get more movement I mean Burton is doing everything the ball is in his hands right now but eventually theyre just going to put three guys in front of him and then that opens up drive and kick opportunities but guys cant be hesitant on the catch they have to take what is open whether its a pull up open three whatever it is they have to be aggressive when they get their chances pal is fouled by shrewbury and foul trouble is an issue for Tech four for McCullum hes out Dongo has three Terrys got three meanwhile for Notre Dame youve got a trio of players Al loo Roper and constantini with two AP piece that was on Shrewsbury now he has two Eric and Doug I was just going to say I think two for Notre Dame just being offensively getting Shrewsberry in a straight Sprint off the ball or off a handoff whatever it is you cant be stagnant offensively you got to get some movement so you create advantages jas the second Defender and the reach in foul comes Alo tells his teammate just wall up dont reach in but its too late well thats it I mean it was just a silly foul youre he had nothing right there Duncan P now he gets an opportunity at the free throw line just keep your hands up and make him lofted up over you well coming into the game Georgia Tech was dead last in the ACC as a team at 6 7 tonight at least so far Eric no problem and that is with a tremendous foul shooter in JB and McCollum who last year with Oklahoma made 39 in a row hard to believe that a team that has him is only 67 thats their first Miss of the night one out of two for Duncan Powell Georgia Tech has just been doing a good job of of being aggressive theyre not settling theyre getting to the basket theyre creating opportunities for themselves and when they miss the shot their aggressiveness is giving them opportunities at the free throw line ver has another shot blocked Suare this time and here is Terry whos had a quiet night shooting the basketball but hes done a really nice job at the other end tailing Shrewsbury defensely and thats a tough job cuz Shrewsberry hes going to move the whole game so it just shows you what type of job Terry is doing defensively and then hes not forcing anything offensively hell find his opportunities under 10 of the timer George glances up at the clock and now he says Im going to go working on a lock up two to shoot fade away from the Applause Music Baseline and Doug right there you dont really want a lot of those possessions but Georgia Tech has the Personnel to be able to have success in those type of possessions Nathan George great job off the iso and there you see Shrewsberry getting going and Notre Dame needs him to hit shots only rain Smith of Louisville makes more threes per game than shrewbury those are his first points of the second half cuts it back down to four George turns the corner Suare Way Off the Mark Dongo no and in that case right there it was a good drop right there by George but Suarez you just got to rip it and be aggressive to the rim Applause Davis never even looked at the ring Defender was 6 feet off it I was thinking the same thing if hes giving you that space Im attacking that space here he is from the corner and theyll live with that absolutely georia te will live with that all day Applause Music six to shoot get it back into the hands your point guard George mango offensive rebound Applause Suare and we have reached side of Atlant all season long but they have led throughout so far here tonight Eric and how about Nathan George and just his overall floor game zero turnovers eight for n from the field five rebounds five assists three Steals and two block shots yeah you know the uh coach although he wouldnt want us to mention it on the air or to him tonight personally the coach that lost that game for Notre Dame back in 1990 not surprisingly hes in the building Digger Phelps who makes his home here in the South Bend area and attends most Fighting Irish games Burton picks up the dribble kicks it back out to Alo 15 to shoot Shrewsbury uses the screen good job by George to fight through it Davis from That Elbow working on Powell denied by Suare shot clock down to one and its Georgia Tech basketball thats what Suarez in there for hes athletic hes can block shots off the weak side and Davis got stagnant right there good job by P standing him up and Suare was just there to defend the shot Suare with it not a threat on the offensive end 20 ft from the bucket gives it off to McCollum whos back in playing with the four fouls George who has been Ultra efficient tonight dumps it off Suare no alako aggressively grabs the rebound Notre Dame with the basketball down by four Doug George has five assists he should have eight those last three possessions those those Georgia Tech fors they have to be aggressive at The Rim aako gives it up shrewbury Burton wide open off of terrific ball movement its a onepoint ball game and that was almost like a drill that Notre Dame had in practice get it in there off the double team good Terry George and McCollum the back court for Tech Dongo and P The Bigs inside for the visiting Yellow Jackets looking for their first road win of the year theyve led by as many is seven howwell couldnt get it back to four and now the Irish with a chance to take their first lead a great look though right there for POW now po defensively fights through the screen Burton for three and the Irish lead Doug this kid right here he lives for these moments right now these pressure situations he was built for these situation and to make those type of shots and the 90 run has a chance to continue for Notre Applause Dame same play Applause George lob inside gathered by indongo and the fouls on the floor shrewbury giving up size there commits the personal his Music third and so we will have a one and one upcoming and now in the final minute or so well see if those free throw issues that have been problem for Tech all year long rear their ugly head with indongo a 60 foul shooter looking at a one and one into the student section A missed opportunity for Tech howwell thought that he knocked it off of Davis being calmed down by his head coach Damon STM you love the energy in the passion I I love it the proper call made Georgia Tech with a minute six left in regulation to get the inbound from mum and he didnt get it in 5c violation reverses the overturned video review give it back to Notre Dame what a big missed opportunity right there for Georgia Tech just not getting the ball in bounds what a break for the fighting Irish and so back into the hands of Marcus Burton just make a play if youre Tech you just got to play solid defense here for the next 11 seconds of the shot clock Alo to the corner J gives it back to Alo gives it back to ji and he makes the bucket in one no Panic as the shot clock wound down and they Applause deliver right here good job by Alo turning the corner and honestly I thought ja was going to shoot that corner three just making the first one that he had in the in the first half but good job I continue to play AO and we talked about his playmaking ability and thats a friendly fire Tay Davis took it in the face got a sacrifice right there Alo doing a good job of continuing to keeping the Play Alive then J just being at the right spot right in front of the rim they they teach that when you driving right there just get in front of the rim right there as a big guy and youll have an opportunity and now he has a chance for an N1 J 77 on the year little strong helps to keep the door open for Georgia with a basketball down by four McCollum goes back door cant get it to him so George pulls the trigger rebound Fighting Irish jas got it off to Davis and the foul now given by Terry with 182 on the clock bad possession right there for Georgia Tech not not the shot they wanted at all no ball movement stagnant and just a tough Shot full fouls now on Music Terry its an 11 nothing run for Notre Dame during which the Irish took the lead for the first time tonight lets go lets go this is going to be a tough pill to swallow for Damon stms Club Doug you got to give them credit because you cant say they didnt compete they competed all night they were right there they were really honestly supposed to win this game I mean right there they had a huge mistake not getting the ball in bounds down six Terry goes right to the rim its back to a fourpoint game shrewbury is foul well Saturday its a mens basketball triple header right here on acc Network Florida State and Boston College start us off in two Eastern followed by Virginia Tech and Virginia and then well cap the night in Dallas Stanford at SMU that was the fifth foul on a Dango so he is the first yellow jacket to be disqualified this is the fourth straight game Damon STM has not gone any deeper than two on his bench again only eight available scholarship players so any foul trouble is a really bad thing and they have managed it so far to finally lose their first player due to fouls and now Shrewsbury an 83 foul shooter makes the front end Applause George pushes it to the front Court attacks AO gets another layup only 52 to go into shrewbury and he is fouled some more time ran off the clock and they may have to put some more back on Music W while we have the final seconds here in South Bend good one going on in Pittsburgh over on ESPN the Panthers lead the uh tarel 6463 under 4 minutes remaining in a huge ACC matchup inside the Peterson Event Center Im a big fan of jayen low just just his we talked about Nathan George and you know the game hes had you know despite Jord te GNA lose this game but jayen low the pace that he plays with left hand get into the lane great footwork even when the shots not there his footwork is so good that he continues to keep the play alive and hes another guard that can get in there
