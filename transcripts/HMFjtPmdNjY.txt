shortly heres a drive and a feed back to omir and he will score against Robbie Baron so NORAD omir the Junior from Nicaragua makes it two nothing Miami and heres the Hoke lineup Dan reflecting Coutures absence Robbie Baron draws the start add does MJ Collins with Tyler niichel who came off the bench and was terrific on Wednesday night against Clemson and hes got the kind of size that they need against this Miami team defensively Baron a triple and that that is great news for Virginia Tech because Baron has not shot the ball well all year although hes come on a little bit better the last couple games you see the Miami Lineup Bley Joseph and wga poppler both on the floor starting tonight means the Freshman from Switzerland Kon George will enter the ball game off Jim Lenas bench that was a long three by buler well it sure was heres padulla skipped to the right side for Collins MJ Collins working against Nigel pack interesting to watch the screen and move game here Dan really from both these schools padulla from the logo boy its first Miss hes had in about a month Shawn padulla has averaged 29 Points in the last two ball games for these hokes hes nine of his last now 17 from three with the Miss there three ball at the other end and pack dials that one home and neither one of these teams Wes is afraid to launch in Miami one of the best shooting teams in the country heres kid with Miami holding it early twoo lead padulla is going to sail that out of bounds Miami will be the benefici beneficiary of the Virginia Tech turnover and the course 74y old Jim Lena now in his 13th season the everpresent whistle at the bench 266 wins in corl Gable has to be the best whistle in college basketball oh easily you bet you and when it hits now everybody on his team knows it everybody everywhere knows it thats that is true too Matthew Cleveland in Miamis possession Bley Joseph and here is wga poppin nine to shoot for pack behind the back and a three ball away and Bounds into the hands of nichel thats the kind of Threes you want Miami to take those contested threes before theyre able to get the ball in the lane ncka three Tyler nickel had 24 the other night including five threes in the win against Clemson Wes he was a great great scorer in high school not a lot of opportunity at North Carolina last year but he can put it in the basket omir draws the foul trying to set the screen and Mike young of course his team now benefits from a Miami turnover and theres the head coach of the hokes Applause we welcome you to Castle Coliseum in blackburg game three of our ACC Network triple header great to be with Dan Bonner West Durham Courtside here tonight for the first of two meetings in the next three weeks between Virginia Tech and Miami and both teams are already dialing long distance here early heres padulla a twopointer thats good first basket of the night for padulla its a 5 nothing run to give the hokes a threepoint lead and clearly padulla has the decided hes going to continue the aggressiveness that hes displayed over the last two games popper trying to rub off the NORAD Mir screen heres benley Joseph and he threw it away to Baron hokes Migel potit has come on the floor wearing 34 a moment ago on the dead ball heres a turnover by padulla and a baron foul is going to be ticketed by Jeffrey Clark who works with Greg Evans and Ron groover tonight thatll be the first on the North Western grad transfer originally from Richmond Robbie Baron sha padulla is a guy who does not mind Taking Chances and thats the second time hes tried one of those hook passes and he has not been successful he threw the other one up in the seats about five rows up in the seats heres pack sliding through a screen and deflected pass headed toward Joseph by Padula will keep it with the canes and 24 to shoot Miamis here theyve lost two straight for the first time this year d they lost by nine at home to Louisville the other night in Coral Gables Virginia teac has won five their last seven theyre 80 at home two and0 in the ACC in this building and they beat Clemson in here by 15 on Wednesday night shooting 54 from the floor omir missed a chippy and omir wont miss many of those but Virginia Tech all show shot better than 50 from the threepoint line wow is that good I mean he is shooting with so much confidence right now omir on the drive poti bothered it enough to create the Miss hokes have made their last three from behind the line padulla fouled on the drive by Joseph thats going to get us to a timeout well Shawn padulla had averaged 29 in his last two five lead here and great to be with Dan boner West we welcome you to our coverage now the hokes are playing tonight without Hunter Couture he was injured in the first half the other night in the win against Clemson Dan kind of a freak hustle play accident involving the Sharpshooter it really was a a very freak play he goes down on the floor in God Creek goes and and hes not even trying to get him hes just diving for the ball his foot goes and hits Couture in the side of the head and as Mike young is prone to say hunter Couture is tough as a pine knock and when he hobbles off the floor and cant come back you know hes hurt well Couture is dayto day coach young hopes to have him back in the lineup soon but hes not here tonight and uh was briefly a part of their practice he sat on the bench he did not participate in the shoot around at all today but boy the hokeys are missing 13 a 12 points a game so Shawn Padulas hot start heres music for The Hokey ears and nickel misses the three off the inbound set and here is Miami who is gone through about a 2 and 12 minute drought theyve taken some tough shots we said theyre a very good shooting team but only shooting 28 of the moment because of their shot selection popper hands to pack poti tried to help with the double team heres Nigel pack on the drive high arching shot wont go tapped around and patite comes up with it wait thats a really nice job rebounding the ball despite the dribble penetration look at MJ Collins a line drive through and heres popper Miami Will Not Waste much time will they Dan the half cour Miami is a team that beats you with their offense Joseph a back R Applause Music Miss and MJ Collins is going to take over some of the ball handling duers with Hunter Couture not playing maai long to meijel potit nice turn with the left hand left it on the rim ripped out of there by Cleveland theres Matthew Cleveland from Atlanta transfer from Florida state whos been a really nice fill in the Miami Lineup given the talent of Jordan Miller that was on that roster a year ago at Coral Gates its hard to replace Jordan Miller but theyve got a long way toward doing it with Matthew Cleveland oh what a nice play Collins reaching in on pack and if you can knock it away from pack youre knocking away from one of the best in the ACC dont forget next Saturday three more games for you well start in gaes Clemson in Miami what a ball game they played a year ago at Little John Coliseum and Virginia at Georgia Tech and then Dan and Ill be at Cameron for pit and Duke for the second time in 12 days right here on acc Network and of course streaming live on the ESPN app and pit is hoping the second time goes a little bit better than the first time oh boy Kyle filipowski and the Blue Devils unbelievable the other night Nigel pack got the basket hes got five of Miamis first seven padulla trying to get by benley Joseph heres Tyler Nicola fallway on the Freshman George and the rebound pulled away Miami up and running Cleveland to the young man from Switzerland and now into the corner for the three ball from Joseph and thatll be a foul from behind on AJ Casey the 69 sophomore from Whitney Young in Chicago draws his first hes only averaging about eight minutes a game in ACC play is Casey that was a tough break for Casey because Miami did a great job getting the ball up the court in transition theyll take that shot from Joseph every time the Hurricanes just cold here early but maai long did a nice job with the blockout Padulas return to the lineup hell kick it across for Nicholls three Wesson Im telling you thats going to be such a weapon for the hokes if nichel can continue to shoot the ball as effectively as he did against Clemson and has done so far here in the first seven minutes of this well he came on the floor the other night against Brad brownells team cutting it Loose now heres a skip pass for Joseph hell try to sneak Baseline against padulla with the right hand and the rebound pulled away by kid on the Miss cant play defense any better than padulla just did look at this they try and sneak Collins back door he almost turned it over kick out nickel how about another back rim Miss now and that got deflected away and last Touch by Tyler nichel but this young man from East Rockingham High School in the shannond DOA Valley Dan hes got the vibe well he does we said he scored more than 2900 points in high school and its just a matter maybe of him getting settled in but boy thats a nice looking stroke and hes got some size about him too Wes that helps him on the defensive end he is the alltime leading scorer in the Virginia High School league thats the public schools uh open division of course here in the Commonwealth of Virginia you break the rec you have that record you beat some people some really good players almost 8 minutes into this first half double number for Virginia Tech three ball from Casey Off the Mark hes now 0 for 11 twopointer from pack no good padulla and nickol have combin for 11 of Virginia Techs first 14 here and Shawn padulla tries to gear down on this possession look out Rex Steiner saves it right here in front of us and Miami has to wonder if the balls ever going to go in the basket heres kid well out canes are one of their last 10 not the case for the guys in white three to shoot kid on the roll got to get rid of it heres a kick out Rex Steiner shot clock violation thats a win for larenas team and its going to get us to a break Mike Youngs team up 147 in blackburg of shooting the ball from the perimeter and they lived up to it so far well they certainly lived up to it against Clemson and so far tonight theyre four of eight from out there but keep in mind Wes before the Clemson game the hokes were only shooting 34 from Beyond The Arc and thats the worst of the Mike young team has shot the ball since 2013 but as we said they they did a great job shooting 54 against Clemson the other night and theyre 4 for eight so far today but their defense has been really good Miami shooting overall 21 you see Brandon Rex Steiner he guards The Freshman from Switzerland kaon George who wears number seven for Miami heres Matthew Cleveland with seven to shoot on the drive jumper got bothered by long and finally padulla pulls it away well really nice defense by long and its not too often you see a guard ripped the ball out of the hands of n Chad omir look at kid the turn and Score first field goal for 610 senior transfer ly kid well omir went to cover padulla and kid went straight to the basket but that was a tremendous little spin move there to create a wide openen shot lead is nine George trying to free himself from RE Steiners pesty defense George launches spins out the rebound for padulla the Hurricanes now one for seven from Beyond The Arc theres not a lot of side to side ball movement West and Miami isnt driving the ball into the lane as well as they normally do feels like its one pass maybe two and a shot right nichel will have no problem teeing it up and Cleveland on the backside well they made him move Wes and that thats always a good sign it doesnt always frustrate the threepoint shooter but sometimes its very effective Miami going to take a timeout here timeout registered by Cleveland and Virginia Tech is Dan noted theyre really in front of Miami shots here early triple header of womens basketball will start at noon at Chestnut Hill pit and Boston College and then Jeff walls in Louisville welcome Wake Forest presented by food line at 200 and well wrap it up with Virginia Carolina at Carmichael 400 triple header of Lady Hoops on acc Network and always available on the ESPN half tell you what Dan you take the 13 of 24 the other night from three for Virginia Tech and the start theyre on today where theyre four of nine thats pretty gudy shooting theres George trying to end Miamis drought the canes are now one of their last 13 and oh for their last seven and whatever the opposite of Gotti is thats what you have right here that ball bounced off re Steiners head Y and I think Rex Stein is trying to litigate that it was touched by Miami Robbie Baron also trying to help Council Ron Grover well the referees they get a lot of help from a lot of different people a lot of unsolicited help yes unsolicited help help they do not need yeah or want they got plenty of Technology at the table ABS okay gotcha nine and a half to go ninepoint lead Cleveland dials up a three first points for Matthew clevel Cleveland the third best score in ACC play at 19 a game he made that three West but once again Miami has a possession where they do not get into the Music lane snaps a long drought for the canes here is Baron on the perimeter against Cleveland Robbie Baron on the drive skipping the corner Rex Steiner went in the air put it on the ground and traveling well Wes and weve been talking about the tough start for Miami but even though theyve shot the ball very poorly theyre only behind by six points youll see padulla return for Rex Steiner and Mike Youngs lineup and were 11 minutes into this first half and its just a sixpoint game and Virginia Tech has four threes in their six made field goal right but they made four their first five West and theyve cooled off Cleveland again off the back of the iron heres Collins padulla spinning through against George and got it slapped out of there now heres Miami quick transition and Cleveland the dump wow Kanes made that look easy with the Matthew Cleveland finish padulla is going to drive the ball to the basket like that somebodys got to get back on defense great job by Miami to take advantage and score in transition nichel with 15 to shoot working against wga popper heres Baron hes trying to drive on George and Kishon George 68 freshman from Switzerland draws his first its the fourth on Miami but heres a pretty good transition off the George Block its off the block but what a great job omir did to get the ball out quickly and then they just get down the court you dont score as many points as Miami does and they come in average in 84 points a game without being able to get out in trans transition so Virginia Tech will go to the bench and the Freshman Jaden young checks into the lineup for Mike young he wears 13 for the hokes averaging about four minutes of ball game in conference play padulla airballs a triple and were going to get a hell ball that will stay with Virginia Tech and we go to the under eight well the hot shooting is cooled off larenas team to within four as we take a break at the castle backdrop here in blackburg Dan uh I see these threepoint field goal shooting stats for both schools um the question I guess is Virginia Tech has attempted 10 threes in their 15 attempts overall Miami 10 of their 20 attempts are threes can you shoot it too much game well I I think you can Wes and Miami you see they shoot 49 overall in the season only 25 so far and Virginia Tech made four of their first five theyve missed their last five threepoint attempts and when you got a guy like Lyn kid on the inside you got to get it in there to him so inbounds will be spot throw in Robbie Baron collects the entry from padulla and here is padulla Kean George tagging him defensively tough shot padulla got it back and scores right there in front well padulla was looking for a foul and took a very tough shot very for to get that one back Sixpoint lead for Virginia Tech 7 A2 to go in the opening frame more a busy day of ACC basketball heres the Freshman George working against Jaden young and he stepped out of bounds in front of Mike young right there at the hoki B so kesan George whos from mon in vales in Switzerland 20 years of age started uh the previous four games prior to coming off the bench the other night with Poppers return to Jim Lenas lineup he played pretty well in Poppers absence thought he did too he shows you a lot of promise what gifts hes got for a young man his size here is a two ball or thats three for Collins and baron the offensive rebound Jaden young firing away and its benley Joseph who steps in front of that Sixpoint lead oh popper clutch from the logo hell drive to the basket leave it for rir and West that sort of is a staple of the Miami offense driving the ball into the lane that time they handed it off to Amir we havent seen a lot of that from the Hurricanes I think part of the credit for that goes to the Hokey defense 15 to shoot baring a catch and shoot three Miss badly 7 to2 run by Miami Cleveland wow eye level at the iron he punches home his third field goal thats created by the transition and by Joseph driving the ball to the basket forcing the help to come they lose Matthew Cleveland padulla heres young looking at kid couldnt get it to him 10 to shoot for the hokes padulla will offer and it got knocked around heres George and Miami in transition Kickback popper threepointer spins out rebound for Collins boy popper has taking a couple of long threes he was standing in the kilan clinic logo when he cut it Laughter Loose some floors thats worth four heres a turnover by Virginia Tech Cleveland and Miami with numbers George back for Joseph missed everything omir tried to make the save stepped out of bounds Matthew Cleveland though and finishing this transition chance well watch here as Joseph drives into the lane Baron has to come and help nobody picks up Matthew Cleveland this is just a great look at it but thats what happens you drive the ball into the lane you create a situation where the defense has to react and if it doesnt pick up guys on the backside youre in trouble young man from Pace Academy in Atlanta was eyeball in the iron when he set it down theres Robbie Baron knocking down a three second triple of the first half for the Northwestern transfer Baron and theyve been waiting for him to get hot from Three West coming up on five to play in the opening half hes made two tonight but coming in only a 28 threepoint shooter there is popper a two thats rebounded by kid but its a tough two Wes early in the shot clock without trying to penetrate into the lane kick into the corner Collins will launch backside rebound now Collins coming in is only a 23 threepoint shooter look at Cleveland boy I tell you what nobody gets lonely at defense do they no nobody has to play defense very long my Heavens its almost like the offenses first guy down the court shoots for both teams right kid heres nichel Padula peaves and hits now padulla was standing there waiting for the ball it was a very nice patch he caught it ready to shoot and Let It Go he is a deadly threepoint shooter under those circumstances Virginia Tech only has two twopoint field goals in this first half everything else behind the stripe omir with the left hand second chippy hes missed in this first half thats good defense by Baron eightpoint lead and padulla came to almost a jump stop omir ran up his back and thatll get us to uh a break second foul on Norad omir Robby Baron picking up some of the threepoint slack for Virginia Tech and then sha padulla adds theres oir with those two fouls but Virginia Tech has attempted 24 field goals 17 of which have been three right and only three twopoint goals in this first half its interesting Jim Lena was talking specifically today about their twoo percentage compared to their three in our visit with him this morning nichel back on the floor with padulla heres the Freshman young and it will bounce up over the top of the glass and out of play so Jaden young who played for the great Freddy Johnson Johnson at uh greensbor Day School of course the alltime winner in coaching wins in the state of North Carolina well young has not played that many minutes but hes percent wise hes a pretty good threepoint shooter comes in at 43 has missed both of his attempts today look at popper air ball one the Cleveland rebounds and hes going to draw a foul from maai long and get one more wow ruga popper hes got a big smile on his face there because that was another long shot from the Killian Court logo Y and he airball and I think if it hits the rim I think it hits the rim thats almost like a pass if it hits the rim the hokes are in pretty good position for rebounding Collins comes back on the floor for Mike young first free throw of the ball game with 312 to go as Matthew Clevelands threepoint finish now Wes I think thats an indication that neither team is working very hard to get the ball inside right either by the pass or the dribble Matthew Cleveland working on Career Point 1000 needs just one more theres a little soft layup by on padulla hes got a dozen here Dan first half on his fifth field goal Wes he is just Fearless taking the ball in there sometimes thats good sometimes thats bad but lately thats been very good for the hok without Hunter Couture tonight they may need all these right you leave a 13 and 1 12 point average off the floor tonight theres a drive and scored by Nigel pack hes got seven now pack I mean hes noted for his threepoint shooting but he can get the ball to the goal and a backcourt foul of be ticketed to benley Joseph its interesting because Miami is even though its a fivepoint game Miamis kind of survived two droughts here in this first half well Miami definitely is surviving so far here in the first half if you didnt look at the scoreboard you would think Virginia Tech was up by many more points inside in the drive and another basket padulla you know they really ought to consider guarding him Music Laughter l Music 2821 ahead of two to play thats Casey back on the floor for a second time in this first half Joseph threw it away turned over to Padulas got nickol ahead here in transition hell go all the way to the basket and roll it in of course he will 16 in the first half for the young man from Edmund Oklahoma Applause ninepoint lead for the hokes and a bump and a foul on Tyler Nicholl itll be the first on niichel Fourth by my count on Virginia Tech well padulla they play him for the three Wes hes been making that three and he just puts the ball down and goes and this is in transition nobody stops him and he takes it all the way to the basket and this is a repeat except he comes down the middle of the lane is that what happens when you hit a couple threes and they know youre yes absolutely but he has certainly he should have by now lost the element of surprise he gets the ball and he shoots it West there is popper the Junior from Philadelphia those are his first points Dan He averages 16 and a half a game for Miami I thought that was another tough shot but hes a guy who can make tough shots you just dont want to take too many of them and thats all hes taken so far today the number one threepoint shooter in the ACC coming in at 51 how about Padula front rim missed pack will run it down under a minute to play in Miami in transition with Cleveland to the basket and the layup boy Jim Lena Matthew Clevelands got a dozen and he is saving Miami in this first half theres no question Miami has really shot the ball very poorly and yet theyre within Music four poti with 15 to shoot now to Pulu with 10 working against kesan George Nicola Triple George the rebound thatll be a Virginia Tech foul I think itll be on Long nope theyre going to get potit Migel poti senior from Reedsville North Carolina fifth on Virginia tag West Miami can hold it for the last shot if they want to and if they get a three theyll go in trailing by one point in the first half which is amazing considering the fact that theyre shooting under 30 yep so the canes will line up the final possession re Steiners come on the floor for the hokes along with young padul is gone to the bench heres pack with under 10 working on re Stein heres Cleveland with six and and we get a foul there sure did its on Rex Steiner and I think re to go actually was in the game to commit that foul they had a foul to give thats only the sixth foul on the hokes little gamesmanship you think yeah I think so you know Im not a fan of giving that foul in the first half but its one of your bench guys then Im a little little more comfortable with it well step aside final possession of this opening half coming up next from blackburg CC gymnastics session three follows our coverage tonight Cal and Michigan State and NC State and BYU will be involved theyll be competing in four skills bars beam Vault and floor tonight and follows our basketball from blackburg with Dan boner West Durham 54 left to go possession will belong to Miami who Trails by four and you said this a moment ago a three here and its a onepoint game going to the locker room on what has been a less than optimal first half of shooting for Miami kesan George to put it in play does so here is a three out of the corner by popper recovered by pack and he laid it in and a foul too yes yes indeed the foul is going to be on padulla it is his first that seven on Mii on Virginia Tech with 22 to go how about this Dan well this is not a very tough shot and again its an airball if thats not an airball Virginia Tech gets the rebound but this is amazing you dont usually associate Miami with keep their defense keeping them in the game but I think thats exactly whats happened here tonight 10 for Pack 12 in the first half for Cleveland and jakai Robinson has comeing the ball game so is AJ Casey and also Christian Watson on the floor for the final 22 two here is padulla 34 Court three is off Mark and its going to be a onepoint lead for the hokes going to the locker room well it was as big as nine Shawn padulla has got 16 to lead all scores we got a onepoint game as we join Kelsey Rigs and the national able to climb back in it you see there an 80 run to finish the half Miami made five of their last seven shots sea padulla you see seven of 13 from the floor his mates tonight five of 17 in fact padulla and nickel have 22 of the hes 30 Matthew Cleveland Nigel pack have 22 of Miamis 29 and Virginia Tech a team that is a very good three free throw shooting team gets 22 of their points from Beyond The Arc has not been to the line tonight here is pack and the canes who I dont think did they have a brief lead at the front and and thats it right two nothing on the omir basket yeah they LED for a minute yep here is Cleveland a fall away and Miami in front to start the second half thats 14 tonight on the six field goal for Atlantas Matthew Cleveland their first lead since the opening 2 minutes Dan and theres the ball in the lane area with the jump shot lob inside ly kid got one shot make it two on the night and he made that one they have to get him involved he averages almost 15 points a game and to only take one shot but hes not going to shoot the ball if all theyre doing is shooting threes yeah Hokes back in front a year ago Miami won both meetings theyve won five of the last eight in the series three ball pack rings the bell 13 now for Nigel pack who had 25 against Clemson and 15 in the loss at Wake Forest now west Miami shot the ball poorly in the first half but they are a team that shoots the ball very well you dont expect them to have another poor shooting half padulla double clutched it Baron a three from the wing back rim Miss look at padulla scrap for the second chance omir has two fouls on him they really need to try to find kid heres Lyn kit for the dunk Bonner says the Hokies Applause follow I dont think thats why they did it but it was a good idea and it ties the game at 34 omir oh he is hard to handle but his short game tonight not been as productive no again hes got to be a little careful with those fouls that he doesnt pick up a charge ly kids got all four Virginia text points and looking for more padulla kesan George runs at him hes starting the second half padulla really likes that hook pass and hes thrown three of them away Tonight George a three The Freshman from Switzerlands 27th three of the year is his first point tonight largest lead for Miami now at three if you turn the ball over Wes you let Miami get out in transition and they really like the three in transition heres kid now Nicholl front rim Miss he hurried that one Wes in the first half his first couple he had his feet nice and set and look at omir runs what strength to catch the ball get both of his feet planted and then even though he got hit from the back hes still able to put it in foul is going to be on Nord shadir or the basket for nadir the foul is going to be on LY kid its going to be his second and the First on Virginia Tech this is a great pass and omir is down the court hes looking all the way Nigel pack sees him thats like a quarterback throwing it just over the fingertips of some linebacker perfect pass and perfect finish ninth best free throw shooter in the ACC barely got it to the rim oms 82 Dan wow and he was what three for seven the other night against Louisville right he was hitting 73 in his first four conference games at the free throw line padulla now trying to get away from a double team of George and omir with to shoot and he threw it away and kesan George told you in the first half this young 68 freshman from Switzerland it Jim Lena says it is just about adjusting to the speed and the athleticism hes going to see at this level he can guard one through four and play one through four Dan well he did a nice job jumping out on padulla and padulla coming off that screen theyre almost double teaming him forcing him to give up the ball popper with 15 to shoot Bley Joseph is the guy who starts the second half on Lenas bench and George starts instead heres seven to shoot and popler on the drive in traffic got it leftand move for Philadelphias wga popper and were starting to see the dangerous Miami offense that has been slumbering for the last two halves of basketball suddenly come to light yep padulla trying to get to the basket stripped out of bounds it will stay with Virginia Tech and padulla thought he was going to get a whistle there did not poppler just takes the ball and drives right by niichel nichel is I mean hes big enough that he can bother the jump shot but I think popper has a quickness advantage and used it very effectively kid will come out of the game Migel potit has checked in here for Coach Young nichel right around the top on the drive potit the rebound and the layup big 265lb Migel potit first bucket but he was in the right place because he set himself up in there after the drive the drive drew the defense popper again trying to take nickel off the bounce and hell get the foul before the shot and that is going to get us to a timeout were in blackburg on a Saturday night would change their plan of attack lot of it driving the ball right well you get the ball into the lane and then there are they are a deadly threepoint shooting team and they also they get down in transition so were seeing the Miami offense here tonight this is just a great pass ahead had an opportunity for an oldfashioned threepoint play there but look at this thats 83 for those of you who are counting shooting in the second half and two for two I think everybody can get that percentage on the drive popler had it blocked by potit defensive stop by the hokes turns the floor for Padulas quick drive and scoop 18 for Shawn padulla whos been on a burner as of late too and thats the third time at least weve seen him in this game just take the ball and go you have to make him stop midcourt weave finishes with pack in control popler trying to find an alley see nobody in the post for Miami they spread you out so they can drive it seven to shoot they skip it for Clevelands triple too strong niichel kept it alive heres Collins thats a great job by nickel on a battle against I think that was Matthew Cleveland that he knocked the ball away from five minutes gone second half inside pass catching score Robbie Barons got eight tonight first twopoint goal for Baron back in the the lineup again tonight he started the first nine games of the year started Wednesday night in the win against Clemson drew the start here tonight pack clutched on a three Nel pack and Collins the foul first on MJ Collins second on the hokes and the hokes are a team that can score very effectively in transition too heres the block shot nobody is getting in front of padulla and he just goes all the way that wasnt an easy shot he was off balance with his left hand but boy is he playing well yep J Jaden young steps in for MJ Collins well remember Hunter Couture is unavailable tonight so young is going to see a lot more time Quick Pass little pocket pass in Cleveland fouled by Baron pretty handy little delivery of the basketball by Nigel P here quick reminder to you next Saturday another triple header of ACC basketball await you on accn Clemson gets us started in Coral Gables against the canes Virginia Georgia Tech and Atlanta at 600 and then Dan and I be at Cameron for Pittsburgh and number 11 Duke boy the Blue Devils got 30 and 13 from Kyle filipowski today to beat Damon stms team Matthew Cleveland hits both free throws there hes now got 16 in the ball game Miami was really good movement of players and the ball that time you get in the lane good things happen lead for the canes at three padulla now for Baron George follows him and heres nichel and popper going to be whistled for a foul that is the second on Wugga popper and the First on Miami I inadvertently awarded popler or Joseph a foul that belonged to popper in the first half so thats the second on popper benley Joseph still yet to see action here in the second half has one omir was the only Miami player with two at halftime heres poti Miami really ramping up the defensive pressure padulla all the way the basket on George and that was against a 6 7 in player lot of defensive pressure pressure George is coming down the court holding his jaw yep so he got the worst of that all the way around third straight game of 20 or more for sha padulla had 32 against Clemson 26 at Florida State hes got 20 here tonight with 13 and a half to play and the hes to within one and George on the drive and offensive foul on kesan George second on the Swiss freshman second on Miami but here on this particular replay George is trying to guard padulla and padulla just drives into him and I think pedullas head hit him in the chin and now this padulla takes it down the other way just stands there and takes the charge thats a really nice job George unable to drive by him Kean George comes out and Bley Joseph in for the first time George a young freshman showing some frustration there I think he one of the foul on padulla at the other end and then he was whistled for one at the Miami end of the floor so theres a couple bad possessions he gets smacked in the mouth and then gets picks up a foul that ball got knocked out of bounds itll stay with Virginia Tech but benley Joseph has the reputation of being Miamis Best on the ball Defender Tyler nichel of three air ball Cleveland the rebound nichel just looks at a little bit of a rush to me Wes yeah its been kind of feast or famine hasnt it for the sophomore pack working on Jaden young tough assignment for Poppers three got it wga popler now has eight five in the second half came in at 51 from behind the threepoint line Wes and that that is an incredible number 51 and what that means is you force the defense to play off of him he gets any chance at all and theres the turnover and omir traveled with it I think NORAD was thinking about uh going behind the back and just couldnt get the puppies collected but this is a nice job again pack is getting into the middle of that defense forcing everybody just to take one step toward the ball and then that allows popper to be open and so poer hes not only shooting pretty well hes doing some pretty good talking tonight too to the referees yep kids back on the floor to replace potit what a terrific crowd here by the way at the Castle tonight too on a Saturday students not back for class until Tuesday and a full house looking on inside kid who got off to a hot start and add to it here in this second half six of his eight points here in half two for lin kid and he played right through a double team I mean they they tried to get him to give up the ball and he didnt really have any place to go so he went to the basket twopoint lead here for Miami and the basketball omir turning on kid and traveled with it Jeffrey Clark the turnover on Miami with the whistle well kid not able to get excuse me omir not able to get the ball to the basket but kid does a nice job splitting the double team and West he dribbles away from the basket and away from the double team creates a space to give himself that little hook shot its Baron heres Collins he briefly took a look in heres Nichol baring the catch missed it kid the dunk follow 10 for ly kid my goodness just one shot in the first half and hes lit the fuse here in the second 20 minutes and the hokes have tied it up popper thought about it pack with t to shoot will gun and the rebound pulled away by Padula they forced they forced him out just far enough Wes pretty good defensive pressure by the hok this building would love a three from Mike Youngs team he walked sure did Collins shuffled his feet theres a turnover on Virginia Tech we get a timeout at the castle were tied at 46 Lyn kid has been the second half scoring star for Virginia Tech eight of their six round for 1hour review of the day in the ACC highlights and Analysis its nothing but net on acc Network and streaming live on the esnf seven games today NC State a road winner uh Florida State a road winner Dan uh home wins today for North Carolina Wake Forest Clemson and Duke who beat Georgia Tech by five in the ball game that preceded our coverage here tonight from blackbury well its going to be a really really good slate of games in the ACC yep all year long Joseph with 15 to shoot were 9 Minutes old high arching Runner no good omir follows the Miss eight for nor Chad omir from Bluefields and Nicaragua Wes weve seen it for both teams you get the ball into the lane and good things happen that time the drive force kid to come omir was all alone for the rebound miam me back in front of basket Nickel in inside for kid whos got eight to lead the hokes what a move and score by Lyn kid Virginia Tech has scored 18 points in this half West and theyve all been inside kid who had 14 in the overtime loss at wake it averaged Just Four Points five rebounds prior Music two here is pack in a 48 all game omir the three front rim Miss maai Long on the floor for the first time in the second half the rebound well hes not a terrible threepoint shooter hes made eight this year but youd rather have him out there than down inside padulla a double team theyre just attacking him every time he goes off the screen heres padulla crossing over Joseph three ball back rim Bley Joseph in Miami chance at a transition a little give back for pack that was a great tip Away by Collins pack was lining up to shoot a transition three well theres the three on Q doesnt matter transition or out of a set 16 for Nigel pack Virginia Tech missed their last seven threepoint attempts and now they Trail by three theyve scored all of their points in the lane in this half heres the give for kid bounce pass padulla three for the tie Shan padulla Now 23 in the ball game and when you throw the ball into kid and you move to an open area he does a really good job finding you 51 all under nine to go pack fall away two rebound long heres padulla with help and Im always fascinated when Mike Youngs team has an advantage at midcourt and then gears down Dan they saw a lot of black shirts getting into position nice job by Miami to get back Collins 18footer fouled on the play foul will be on pack itll be his first third on Miami well the three has been a much bigger weapon for Miami in this half and Nigel pack is just a deadly threepoint shooter the hokes they have not shot the three well in the in the second half thats their first one but again nice pass by Lyn Kidd couple of free throws for MJ Collins scoreless Tonight is the sophomore from Clover South Carolina and just his second Miss of the Year Dan in 18 tries 16 of 18 now as Collins at the line thats their first free throw is it it is these are their first free throws of the night remember that Miami took their first free throw throw with about 3 minutes to go in the first half this game has uh been replete of Charity tosses if you will well its hard to get foued when youre out beond the threepoint line not impossible but hard right so here is Collins at the line after the rare Miss and hell get the back in for his first point Wes and it doesnt hurt to repeat that Hunter Couture not available thats it for Virginia Tech tonight yeah Couture out of the lineup after being injured in the first half the other night and wins these Victory against Clemson kesan George back on the floor remember he picked up the foul come back out there for Coach Laren Egger theres omir with the left hand and thats against poti whos a big guy but omir just out muscled him inside and omir is so good with either hand on the inside that is 245 battling 265 you ought to think thered be some sort of belt involved in that but theres not under eight to go heres padulla and a foul called so we will step aside foul called on pack came in here on a burner Dan and he has not stopped tonight no he certainly has not hes made 10 field goals West in 17 attempts hes knocked down three of eight from three just as impressive like the West he has eight rebounds in the game so hes got 23 points he has eight rebounds he has four assists this is only three so far in the second half well but you talked about him being on a hot streak 26 last Saturday 32 Wednesday night 23 tonight you mentioned his threepoint shooting tonight three for eight by the way Dan that makes him 12 of 24 in the last uh two and a half games is that any good 50 fairly good okay fairly good I think you could you know you can classify that as being pretty good couple of free throws the foul was on on kesan George as we went to the timeout thats a third on the Freshman from Switzerland Virginia Tech is a team that scores more than 20 of their points from the line and this is only the second player to take a trip to the line so padulla now has n and the half 25 in the ball game won its amazing thats his first trip to the line because according to the statute hes been fouled six times heres George beating nickel on the Drive Cleveland OH nice chase by padulla defensively and then the Strip by Sha padulla forced the Miami turnover Baron lost it on the way up and its tapped out and here is Cleveland he is fouled by Baron and willll get a couple of free throws third on Robbie Baron will be the third fourth on Virginia Tech here in this second half how about defensive plays at both ends here tremendous defense by padulla they not only get in the way of Cleveland but to strip the ball and then as pulla takes the ball down the court he just loses the ball and look at pack he might have been out of bounds Wes Cleveland pushes it up and in Matthew Cleveland is 76 at the line and four for four tonight pack look like he was out of bounds and then jumped up in the air and tipped that ball before he came back down so if thats the case thats a break for Miami kans in front of Point as the Jour Junior from Atlanta hit both free Music throws and a ball got inside and last touched Tyler nichel thought it was off of Miami Ron gr says it was off of Virginia Tech Mike young was right there dont forget a triple header of womens basketball tomorrow starts at noon pit at BC wraps up with Virginia car Carolina right here on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN app boy padulla just saved a basket right there tipped the ball when they had a wide open back door com Cleveland on the drive and gets around poti for the bucket 8 and A2 20 in the game from Matthew Cleveland and hes really done a great job not only driving the ball to the basket but with pullup jumpers averaging 19 in conference play Third best in the ACC and now hes matched up against padulla defensively missed the three chases down his own Miss tries again and hits my Heavens no you dont think you got to block that guy out but you do because he is chasing after the ball I dont know if Tony Bennetts at home tonight in Charlottesville or not but he might want to get three when he checks in on the bus Wednesday in Charlottesville there is the drive and foul by Bley Joseph on his hell get to the free throw line here for two the foul is on Baron that is his fourth as Matthew Cleveland scores a moment ago now Cleveland just does a great ball drive into the basket but Cleveland does not go after the rebound and he does not block padulla out and padulla makes him pay for Cleveland who at 23 against Clemson 22 the other night against Louisville my goodness free throw by benley Joseph from Arlington Mass his first points of the night this is a guy who been three times double figures in his last five Dan right I think they called that last fou on potit no on Baron Baron okay thats his Applause fourth freee throw by Joseph good well Wes unlike in the first half we got guys making shots yep now of course pullas make shots in both halves long is on the floor and theres a steal by omir and he will dunk it down with two hands nine for NORAD omir in the second half and Miamis pushed it to a fourpoint advantage kanes have tighten the screws defensively against Virginia Tech out in the midcourt area padulla turns it over trying to get it to kid heres omir with a whirling dervish he changed hands on the dribble and everything else and then the Hokey got a hand in but how about this a moment ago well this is just a very weak pass by maai long and you cant make a weak pass when nor Chad omir is in the neighborhood and then Sean padulla with another one of those hook passes threw it away yep he hasnt had a lot of success with that pass tonight Cleveland tried to go to air kid playing over the top knocks it away you see the points off turnovers a moment ago boy Miami has really impacted the game that way and Miami is not noted for its defensive prowess not that they cant guard but everybody talks about their offense omir lost it out of there comes nichel leaves it for kid and the dunk four 1 for Lyn kid 12 in the second half hoki to within two thats a great job by niichel to get stop a lot of times you see a guy get a charge in that situation but a great job by Kid to give him an option by running the court theyre going to call the foul on padulla and nichel hes going to the basket and he doesnt have any options except ly kid runs down the middle of the Court three guys were on nickel and he was able able to find kid behind the defense so one and Music one on the Music foul yes we never got to the one in one from either team in the first half son tell me we barely got to the free throw line in the first half free throw by Joseph on the front end good all three of Bley Josephs points have come at the stripe Jim Lena with Bill Courtney Cody Kimbell DJ Irving over on that Applause bench both of them good for Joseph Miami is winless in their two Road games overtime loss at Wake Forest and the loss at Kentucky Dan and here they are on the road for the third time this year Well West theyve only won one game this year when they scored fewer than 79 points yep Mike young was cognizant of that today too wasnt he yep theres an entry pass kid draws the omir foul five on Miami by the way third on Norad omir and Virginia Tech has made a real commitment to getting the ball inside in this half and omir you know hes going to be aggressive in there and if hes if hes aggressive he might pick up that foul if hes not aggressive then kid has an Music opportunity kid trying to hand to nickel look at the double team popper and omir and heres padulla with Cleveland out front from the logo rims off and a shot clock was running down West but Miamis jumping out on those screens and its just been very difficult for Virginia Tech to handle here in the second half and basically you go off a screen you get double team heres pack now trying to size up Collins back for Cleveland he traveled Jeffrey Clark the whistle on Matthew Cleveland and its a fourpoint game with 412 to play now well just the way this game is going you get the feeling that this is a very important offensive possession for Virginia Tech yep padulla out front long La for kid and the catch and score what a second half for Lynn kid W padulla created that whole thing by backing away from that double team making another one of those dog on hook passes and a great look inside by by uh maai long 16 in the ball game 14 second half points for lin kid twopoint game popper lines up a three in hits wga propler seven and the half 10 in the ball game now Miami back to a fivepoint Edge well you just cannot give him that much room out on the perimeter might have struggled early but he has brought the threepoint shot into Focus here in the second Music half out front Collins a line drive three just his seventh of the Year Dan well he is his hes only like a 23 shooter out there but thats a huge shot well big buckets for the hes ly kid has been terrific in the second half this a really nice pass after padulla escaped that double team theyve been really good on the inside and popper hes pretty good from the outside we got ourselves a game going right down to the wire well Dan weve gotten our moneys worth so far hadnt we with 307 left to go what a terrific ball game Miami and Virginia Tech you see the ties and the lead changes Miamis got four guys on double figures and as they delivered last year both things are really shooting it theyre shooting it very well Wes in fact the difference might be that Miami has made eight of nine free throws here in the second half and Virginia Tech has only made two of two in fact eight of nine is the way the two teams are combined here in the current stretch of the ball game from the floor Miami four for four the hokes four for five omir and the canes with a twopoint lead and now pack on the drive out of the corner popper and the rebound for padulla hes got help with Collins hell take it down too strong on the layup and a foul called so we will take a break the foul I believe is on George itll get us to a timeout free throws for the hook Virginia Tech coming in off of 15point one over Clemson with road trips to Charlottesville and righ next week Miami hard home lost to Louisville on Wednesday night Dan here in blackburg with Florida State next Wednesday night Coral Gables to be followed by a trip to Syracuse next Saturday West they just arent any easy trips and no easy games even when youre playing at home yep so here is Collins at the line hes one for two four points for MJ Collins seven rebounds but just one of two line shooting three double figures in his last six and the first one good so five in the half for the softmore as you mentioned West before he missed that first one he was 16 to 17 on the year yep so hes not a guy you mind having it the long 13 starts a year ago in the ACC for Collins whos got six all in the half eight tie of the ball game at 66 George with nickel Applause defending now heres pack tend to shoot skip for George hell launch from the logo and back it in wow what a big shot for the Freshman kesan George and Virginia Tech that wasnt bad defense nickel was right there young man from Switzerland has given Miami the lead ahead of two minutes to go heres Nicholls thought about kid now back for padulla pads looking for a screen got it from Collins standing in the logo now on the drive scoop right hand Applause good 12 field goal padulla now has got 30 Applause Music my gosh first of all Kean George doesnt know any better right well hes on the end of the logo right there and thats a bank shot over a 67 player but here padulla he just he gets to the basket he doesnt try to go all the way there he gets that little scoop shot to avoid omir and this for Virginia Tech with the possession errow you see both teams no problems with timeouts shooting free throws on any foul yep so if youre Miami here you kind of thrown the whole catalog out there here in the second half right without any question the interesting thing to me Wes is here in this part of the second half the games on the line and its kesan George in the game yeah not benley Joseph thats correct I think George its his size its his athleticism you know Joseph is a great defender but theyre looking for the combination of offense and defense so 90 seconds and change to go in blackburg Cleveland George popper now packed Collins draws the assignment seven to shoot Packs got it again pack shooting it sure is hell take it foul line Runner right hand good Nigel pack 18 now in the ball game and Miami pushes the lead to three with 65 seconds left Dan W its really tough to defend a team down the stretch like this in Miami who has so many scoring options Collins a two thats too strong omir had a shot shot at it last touched Baron and kid were there battling omir but what a take by Nigel pack well pack just sends everybody away and then drives down the middle of the lane and hes noted as a threepoint shooter West but he can shoot the pullup he can shoot the he can shoot the floater and padulla and he gets knocked down and hes slow getting up and limping now the officials are over West looking to see who touched that ball last in the last two minutes of the game theyre allowed to go and look and see who caused the ball to go out of bounds right so the the ruling on the court was that its Miamis ball remember they had omir kid and baron all there and Jim Lonas huddled his group because if they if it stay status quo itll be Miami ball here so theres a lot of hands up there theres omir looks like Baron Baron is the last hand to touch that a lot of people touch it but Baron I think on the Falla through there I think thats its going to stay Miamis ball yep Music yep so if youre Mike young here its a threepoint game youve got basically 22 seconds of differential 23 seconds of differential you can play this out well you have to what you youre not going to foul obviously Miami is a very good free throw shooting team so thats one reason why you wouldnt but youve got to play tough defense without fouling and then youre going to give yourself a chance but obviously you got to get a stop here you see Baron going to defend the inbounds pass of George cuz its a spot throw in and omir right back to George Baron plays with four Collins got a hand in but knocked it away wait that was a dangerous pass to George because he barely got in bounds not questioning Jim Lena in any stretch but wouldnt you want pack handling it rather than George on that toss back trying to get it to pack right got a lot of confidence in George and yeah Packs the guy you want to handle the ball and popper how about this who feed omir and get one more because hes fouled nor Chad omir its a 7 to2 run by Miami the foul will be on Lyn kid its his third and the eighth on the hokes and Virginia Tech trying to pressure in the back court and Miami thats the way Miami plays West they attack and omir what a great step to the basket you know you mentioned 245 lbs hes very powerful on the inside they made Virginia Tech pay for the pressure missed his only free throw of the night and Ron groover is going to go to the monitor here Im not 100 sure what were reviewing Mike young ly kid fouled omir above the shoulders I think and they wanted they they want to check for contact here at the head and neck area Dan well I am not sure Wes I I got the idea that Mike young was asking for this review although thats something they could review right there he certainly he certainly clocked him and remember the definition of a flagrant foul West is contact that is excessive and or unnecessary and he swung his arm and you it doesnt make any difference whether youre playing the ball or not right if your contact is excessive and or unnecessary then that could be a flagrant foul so the foul on Lyn kid is his third so obviously obviously Mike young did not not asked for this review I was mistaken about that but so they made a call and the the issue here is if theyve already called a common foul right so the issue here is do they keep it a common foul or do they to do they or do they add to it yeah was that contact enough to rise to the level of flagrant and Wes the way he swung his arm and hit omir across the face you could certainly understand if the referees decided that was a flagrant foul but that would be a big call theyre going to keep it as common foul a common foul yep so kid has his third so omir is going to get a chance to go to the line to try and make it a sixpoint game with 445 left and if youre looking at it from Virginia Techs perspective it can be no matter what happens here its still a twopossession contest here in the final minute its still a two possession contacts but theres only 44 seconds left and if youre Miami youre more if particularly if he makes this youre more concerned about defending the three yep oh but he missed it short again yep sure did left it on the front rim now Virginia Tech you just need to get one quickly heres padulla trying to measure a kid screen hell take it in had it knocked away it will stay with Virginia Tech Miami has handled the top of thee Circle screen game a lot better in the second half yes they sure have and theyre going to look at this again is this about The Possession Im assuming yes it is who touched the ball last and in the last two minutes of a game particularly close game this goes on all the time so who touched it last and that it looked to me like that was popper that popped it out of the hands of padulla right there and I I dont think padulla touched it again after poer hit it in Music fact all right now again you have to have indisputable evidence to overturn the call on the court and the call on the court is that its Virginia Techs ball yeah so both squads huddled at their respective benches here now if youre Virginia Tech what you might want to try to do here in this situation wow no miam last Touch by Shawn padulla okay so so its Miami ball the foul there was no foul called the contact occurred when padulla lost control of the ball on the drive and the referees seem very convinced of it so padulla must have touched that ball so now Virginia Tech does have to foul dont they yeah I think they do inbounds heres pack now popper ahead for Matthew Cleveland and theres Lyn Kidd reaching in to commit his fourth foul but its a pick your poison kind of thing you know now omir had shot the free throws very poorly tonight right but I mean who do you foul I mean Cleveland like is the worst guy out there and hes 76 and here is Cleveland who misses the front end of a twoshot foul because now thats the 10th foul first Miss of the night for Matthew Cleveland well now you got to rebound the ball if he misses if youre Virginia T and he made it so now the math becomes two threes yes and so now I think if you were Miami all youre defending is the threepoint line yep and here is padulla working against Cleveland hell launch from the logo again and hit how about that well how do you defend that 33 for Padula Applause now you know they had a guy play here one year named Eric green Who lit the building in the league up look at this standing in in the Sean Clinic Music wow how is it that all the guys that show up from Oklahoma to play in the ACC can rip it by the way can really shoot the ball so sha padulla working on a career high now with 33 in the ball game at 32 the other night against Clemson right yes hes from hes from Edmond by the way and if youve been around the ACC long enough you remember the little guy that rolled in to play for Bobby krims at Georgia Tas who was from Metropolitan Enid Oklahoma named Mark Bry he was a part of those part of that 1985 ACC Championship team that Georgia Tech had with Bobby KMS in Atlanta when they beat North Carolina to win the title at the Omni the old Omni I should say and now heres this guy whos put together quite a week in the ACCC Shawn padul hes put together quite a three games Dan well hes had his career high three games in a a row yeah and its not like his career high with six points8 points and 10 points right you know hes 26 32 and now 33 side note to this now Virginia Techs called a timeout Miami you see has two left possession still belongs to the hokes Miami is in the double bonus theyre shooting two shots on every common foul so if youre Virginia Tech Dan with 21 a half to go youre trying to extend the game right youre trying to extend the game and I dont know that Jim Lena is going to give him an opportunity to do it heres padulla scoring in the last three game but if Im the hokes Im going to give nor Chad omir another chance at the free throw though y now I cant believe theyll have omir anywhere near the ball right well its interesting theyve got omir George Cleveland popper and Nigel pack and kesan George again is going to put the ball in bounds and theres omir up there to receive it and Robbie Baron on the floor for the hokes hes playing with four fouls yeah you got to be careful but I might try to grab omir before that ball goes in bounds omir going to set the screen theyre going to throw the ball deep omir lost it on the end line tried to make the save went out of bounds wow so they tried to throw the post route to NORAD omir wow now the break for Miami there is that omir was able to touch the ball because if he doesnt touch the ball then the balls out on that end by just a little too far and he cannot run it down if he doesnt touch that we go back down underneath the other basket so heres Baron to put it into padulla if youre the hokes you got the ball in the guys hands you want man if youre Miami hes the one guy you do not let shoot the ball heres Collins thought about it hell fire the three back rim Miss Pack the rebound Baron tries to reach over the top I think were going to get a foul called Baron was trying to lock up the hell ball and its going to be on Robbie Baron and that will be his fifth Robie they double team padulla to force him to give up the ball and Collins I think if Collins takes that shot immediately its a rhythm shot hes not a good threepoint shooter but once he puts it down on the deck and has to dribble and then step back thats not a threepointer a threepoint shot hes going to make very often so Packs going to shoot two free throws after Baron fouls out of the ball game and with 46 left the hokes need two misses out of Nigel pack and they got the first one now if youre Mike young are you calling a timeout here Dan well you got to get the ball first they have one left pack hit that its a fourpoint game time out Miami well thats I mean thats enough now Miamis just got to get out of the way yep so 7571 you know coming into today only six of the first 31 ACC games played in conference had been five points or less or overtime Dan we had a fivepoint game preceding our coverage here tonight in Durham where Duke beat Georgia Tech 8479 and were looking at a fourpoint difference here with 46 left to go but I think you hit it right a moment ago you better get used to these kind of back and forth tilts because it feels like this league is is competitive and maybe as deep from a competitive standpoint its been a long time yes I would agree with that 100 Wes and this is a situation remember the Hoke going without Hunter Music Couture and we said you know Miami they shot the ball so poorly in the first half you just expected them to come out hot in the second half and they really really did but I thought their defense was a very important key for the Hurricanes tonight as well yep Padula inbounds heres long right back to Shawn padulla hell line one up try to lean into omir itll Bound Away and Miami gets a critical Road wi Dan what a win for Jim a win they needed desperately sure did Miami goes to three and two in the league 12 and four overall Virginia Tech now 10 six 2 and3 in the ACC thanks to our producer Aaron Owens for Dan Bonner West Durham the final Miami 75 Virginia Tech 71 now to West Valley City Utah and
