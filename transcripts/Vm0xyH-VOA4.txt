number one field goal shooter and by the way fourth and rebounding as we get underway burt smith on the whistle tonight with bill covington jr and aj desai and of course lazzewski and theres juwan durham handling against the luma on the first possession for the irish and notre dame a quick twonothing lead on the soft jumper by the grad student from tampa Applause aluma off the beaten bounce pass and were tied at two as much as they fall in love with the three both these schools yeah absolutely and both teams are likeminded in that regard west and both teams very good with the basketball and dont foul very much so marlboro maryland one of mike brays i95 guys theyre a handful of them on this notre dame roster as well soft drive in the bucket and thats tyrese radfords first points i know you mentioned i know you mentioned it earlier west but you talked about coach young wanting this game to trend towards the 60s as opposed to the 80s an early observation is its headed that way and defensive acumen and also ability to rebound thatll come into question theres a long rebound collected by the hokies but a giveaway and hub gets the n1 new jersey player of the year bergen catholic getting on the deck for the first time and he spells le chesky with dane goodwin and jalen cohn is the energy off the bench for mike young again draws the hokies close he really is vinnie johnson he is that microwave you bring him off that bench just ask louisville coach chris mack six of 12 from three people are probably accustomed to hearing him in the starting lineup removed from it struggled offensively in the last few games this is an old coach break tactic to try and fire up a very quiet respectful kid know how good he is expect him to come out here motivated leski a long two six quick ones for nate liszeski by the way skill set the efficiency hes the goto guy for the others missing the three the tap follow rolls in for radford radford knocks down a two hes got six now hub long three this is works trey wurtz the transfer from santa clara their last nine prior to the missed by cormac ryan a moment ago there heres cone rising and firing another triple for jaylen cohn good spacing though iso ball from zona versa luma great defense couture knocks down the three that was gassan who couldnt finish the freshman from holland and there is a long three shot like that going for him can be monumental for his confidence its darius maddox handling it out front heres cone along the baseline hit a little soft jumper off the baseline for two he is fun to watch fun to watch and one for juwan durham at the post they kind of sell scouting look at the minutes and give guys a chance to maybe get some more of those minutes too and its a smart move by a coach as bd goes in and finishes just a wheel route to the rim with no resistance thats the rebound locked up at 26 under six to go and why we talk about practice hows it practice all american west dont worry about my stats in my career jayla cole are you kidding me goodwin working on couture about the tour defensively here giving up nothing and dane goodwin off the window notre dame on a 91 run and looking for more and ryan strokes the three and the follow by nicola jojo shot clock at eight and kelly will run down the rebound and go right back to the left for the punch hello twopoint game now and the irish with the ball in the lead skip for goodwins triple nice answer by notre dame in the block durham skips goodwin nice bounce pass ryan heres juwan durham to catch and score aluma cone from the corner yes sir make sure you are everywhere he is at all times for the remainder of the game cone is the biggest threat for the hope and ryan answers and kevin illuma has not had as many touches maybe as we anticipated hokies with the ball trailing seven they gave up 42 to penn state in a loss a nice box out by a lean irish arent really sending offensive rebounders when that thing goes up its most typically a oneanddone situation Applause Music from the irish with an advantage and the lob for leski got broken up other end nuts will finish with a dump mutts is not that dangerous to the shot blocker play into contact cone off the bench misses rebound inside the stick back for radford and hit 11 of his last 18 threes in the last two games couture at the front and thats a two for couture still riding a 102 start to the second half were five minutes in Applause and the follow in front by much as eager to get them to the freethrow line if you know what i mean hub fall away over cone is good prince hub tough shot hes got five on his second field goal ten defender and cone for him to get into the paint with two feet and shoot over top couture has really done a number on hub swatted out by durham itll stay with the hokies nobody likes the pregame box of popcorn better than mike young all feels great the world again wes ryan hub shoots for the lead and has it Applause on the bounce this is mutts working against le chesky into traffic nice pass inside gassan the basket talk about a connected group in the irish in that first half ten assists theyve only tallied one on two field goals here in the second half aluma with the right hand Applause mutts Applause Music nice play with the right hand oh cant finish mutts leads the break couture and the top follow is good looks like a valuable one strength coaches those are the kind of bodies they love getting into the workout room in the off season theres a luma at the rim scoring alumnus got his second double double of the year both of them have been an acc club heres couture from the logo yes sir he certainly didnt like it and irish fans arent gonna like this one from the logo you just cant win when your perimeter is not playing at the highest of levels in the threepoint line its not that weapon that it quite typically is for the irish 623 they were within that one theyre gonna have a chance of getting that one you gotta put this in the rear view move Applause forward
