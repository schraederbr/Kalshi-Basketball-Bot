four against the Razer backs of Arkansas Bert Smith Jeb Hartness and Mark snur with Victor lockin and Lyn kid to get a started here at the watsco center and the opening day of play in the Atlantic Coast Conference underway here Miami three and five theyve lost five straight including their last two at home Clemson 8 and one has won five straight State McCrae on the drive and sheins first rebound of course at the defensive end one the things Im sure we could possibly say a lot of here is Ian shefin with the rebound you get a look at Clemson starting five Chase Hunter with is the leading score for the Tigers johy Wiggins working against State McCrae the Up and Under got bothered and recovered by the East Carolina transfer Brandon Johnson johy Wiggins is normally going to have the height Advantage at that small forward position Brad brell trying to get him opportunities on the glass unable to get it done on the last possession but another turnover Cory Austin Schwarz the giveaway on the on the travel and it brings us to the Miami Lineup uh Schwarz a freshman McCrae a transfer Johnson a transfer kid a transfer pack is the only veteran who understands Laras intricate systems at both ends of the Nigel pack is the only hold over from the final qu team two seasons ago and Coach L will be the first to tell you they cant win without him and of course Nigel pack not 100 trying to play through injury and help his team get back into the winning column good ball movement by the Tigers but it leads to a turnover on the shefin travel and there is Jim Lona at the Miami bench of course 14th season here 41st as a head coach he and Brad Brownell both with 273 wins at their respective schools both of these are two of the better coaches that we have in the league and of course have been so for a very long time one we need to get coach L into the Hall of Fame however this team is going to have to help him Schwartz a deep three kid the offensive chance for the kanes Johnson passed on the three Schwarz a launch again and shefflin another rebound and you cant give a good shooter like that multiple opportunities especially open opportunities like Schwarz was able to get Im sure Brad Brownell does not like the fact that Miami was able to get multiple possessions inside shefflin the catch up strong couldnt finish kid another rebound for Miami and now pack wants Miami out in transition and Coach l wants a foul that he felt that JayZ was a little aggressive with Nigel Pat into traffic thrown up on the window and another travel is called Clemson makes a substitution Brad Brownell has gone to his bench promptly and Jake hi breeder has checked in well one of the reasons is because you talking about a much smaller lineup for the hurricane so difficult for chy Wiggins to guard smaller guards and stay in front of them especially if hes not going to be able to take advantage of his opportunities on the other end H Breer averaging about 11 minutes of ball game for Brownell locking for Hunter double team was there Chase almost lost it out of bounds recovers to shefin T to Applause shoot theres Hunter fallway on Schwarz spins out blocking a second chance for the tiger Miami trying to keep Clemson in front of him here hi breed to the three backside Miss and a nice box out of she yeah great job by Johnson there keeping in shefin off the glass Johnson a very good rebounder in his own right averaging eight a game for the kanes hes sixth best in the ACC through the early portion of the Season look at the attention that Nigel Pat gets coming off screen to roll action opening up opportunities for Len kid now this is normally two points when he gets in his hand shooting 70 from the field kick out for pack deep three itll Bound Away into the corner Zachary will run it down both teams kind of trying to lock Folks up on the perimeter especially well thats a great sign for the Miami Hurricanes because thats been a struggle for them all year long that was a beautiful pass from I shefin to JayZ unable to get it to go down but part of the reason why you see shefin actually leads the Tigers in assist Schwarz to the basket blocked and fouled by Victor Lockett now if there were a challenge boy as Lockett gives the signal to Brad Brownell to actually challenge it you cant do that in college basketball however if there were a challenge they may win this one you see a lot of basketball up top but when you swipe down does he make contact with Schwarz on the swipe down afterward schs wanted to dunk that one lockin got up there got a piece of the basketball freshman from the Cannon School in Concord North Carolina is perfect at the line this year make him 11 for 11 with the make there Miami the best free throw shooting team in the ACC to start the season at better than 81 Miami doing everything right on the offensive end that that is not an issue for the canes leading to ACC as you mentioned in free throw percentage also field goal percentage shooting 50 from the field so offensively has not been an issue for the canes the offensive rebound by Johnson unable to get it to go actually had two cracks at it on that one shefflin got another rebound first Miss of the year for Schwarz at the line miam me a one nothing lead heres Zachary all the way through skips for shefflin three ball out front good Ian shefflin now thats the area where Clemson can be even more dangerous Ian shefin on the season only five of 26 from Beyond a threepoint R so he is struggled to shoot the basketball but now you see him getting going knocking down the three ball that opens up so much more for the tiger kid working against Lockton now Schwarz on the drive kick back Matthew Cleveland who checked in misses from deep and last Touch by Miami and that will get us to a timeout first break in the action season last year for Brad Brownell and off to a great start once again this year can can I just tell you that when I saw the last tiger with 20 or more rebounds in a game was Harold Jameson in 1999 and hes the only other tiger went with 20 rebounds the game and when you consider horse Grant right you think about all the great bigs tree Rollins as we see take Hy breeder yeah Hy breeder knocking down the three out of the corner but when you can think about all the bigs Dale Davis oh come on man tigers have hit two threes and a fivepoint lead here early at Coral Gables out front deep three from Miami rattled out for pack in sheon with another rebound we lets lets just make it the broken record thing today tell you what I and a lot of things go into being a good rebounder and its interesting to listen to coaches both his and opposing talk about it heres shefflin out of the corner should have shot that one and the close from Johnson quickly nice pass catching hot breeder left it on the front rim they go to the deck and Miami out of there with a great hustle play you can tell High Breeders a little allergic to the paint though short arm that one not used to getting those shots in the painted area does most of his damage from Beyond The Arc Betha coming up with the Loose Change did a great job there but Miami turns it over Brad Brown L Chase Hunter operates the point here got a few Atlanta guys in the mix today you saw talking about by Ian shefin then Chase Hunter as well as Matthew Cleveland on the Kane side so some guys with familiarity with each other Hunter a hard drive two strong Lyn kid the rebound and Christian Reeves who came in a moment ago for locking hit the deck in transition and Miss Len kid who had a wide open we talked about Christian Reeds falling in transition Len kid had an opening Miami missed him which could have been their first field goal of the game the D transfers really getting a chance to play though Cory as a return to health as as much as anything else his two years in Durham were just you know racked with injury theyve absolutely were missed you has seasoned in surgery last year only played in three games and you know talking about a young man of course from my alma Mo oakill Academy you know so no Christian Reeves very well and again off to a fresh start still in the ACC but under Brad Brown hes done a tremendous job with developing bigs throughout his career foul on jumper tapped away rebound pulled down by Reed and again when youre and youre playing alongside a guy like Stein one thing you better do is rebound you cant play for Brad Brown if youre not going to do so look at the ferocity at both ends of the floor and a hell ball will stay with the Tigers here man everything is contested you can tell this is the start of conference say its conference play WD you look at all these guys getting on the floor after the basketball Johnson Bea of course Dylan Hunter underneath the pack right there as though he just ran for a first down sure Baseline Tigers will have it with Zachary Dylan Hunter has come on the floor with sheflin hiy breeder Reeves and Zachary Cleveland Lynn kid Brandon Johnson Nigel pack and Jaylen Blackman has checked in he wears number five for Miami and I mentioned Blackman now transfer from ston who last year First Team all Atlantic son for the Hatters of Donnie Jones averaged 2 points a game and attempted an NCAA record number of three SC well he I tell you what hes locked in lus just like his brother James Blackman who played in Indiana as Ian shefin gets an opportunity to knock down his second threepoint field goal of the game and does so WD came in shooting 19 y from Beyond the threepoint Arc and already two of two here to start this off on the road the Tigers lost their first true Road game of the season at boy State a much better start for them here in Coral Gable Music well Cory Clemson nine Miami 1 Jim lonas principal Focus coming into this was his defense Clemson is three of their first 10 Miamis yet to hit a shot from the floor in nine tries theyve competed have they defended well they have defended very well Miami has but when you consider the fact that Im sure Miamis concern was defense because they shoot 50 from the field one thing that coach L knows is going to be consistent is their offense but the fact that they have gone almost seven minutes of game action without a field goal Im sure is shocking to him Blackman to Matthew Cleveland back out front now Wiggins is returned Blackman a launched front rim Miss cha Wiggins got great job by johy Wiggins going back in after the rebounding and thats one of the areas where Brad ronell wants to see Wiggins grow is to continue to be more of a force on the defensive end using his link Dylan Hunter into traffic back for Wiggins three Chanty Wiggins knocks down a triple thats four for Clemson to start the ball game all their field goals and thats why Brad brell wants him to be better defensively because he can absolutely do that over 40 from Beyond the threepoint Arc as well as Chase Hunter this Clemson team comes in shooting close to 39 from three and thats where theyve done their damage early Cleveland at the foul line area knocks down the first points for Miami and thats going back to the old school when you consider Matthew Cleveland going oneonone with Ian shein those two guys played a together for our guy J AKA James Forest on team Forest back in the day so theyre very familiar with each other heres Wiggins on the drive all the way through and Johnson the rebound Miami wants to run here numbers are even Blackman Blackman missed a great opportunity to throw it up for Matthew Cleveland who had the finger pointed into the air showed off his hops multiple times in the Arkansas game you got to give Cleveland an opportunity to finish that sheflin a twopointer and Ian shefin actually asked for a sub as Brad Brownell has three new tigers at the scores table ready to check in tack will bring it into the front Court here Clemson has stayed man throughout this first half yeah its going youre going to see mostly manto man when youre talking about a brad ronell coach team Y and a physical team you already see a couple of canes complaining about how physical Clemson has been on the defensive end of the floor five to shoot heres Cleveland eying one from Deep Over the Top of shefflin Matthew Cleveland now all five of Miamis points still an eightpoint Clemson lead Zachary will pull the trigger and hit and thats a steadying force but when you consider Clemson Tigers bringing in Jaden Zachary out of Boston College his ability to be able to not turn the basketball is a huge opponent for the Clemson Tigers Im sure Brad happy to have him at the point on the drive pack kick out another one for Cleveland left it on the rim kid fights for the rebound pack out of the far corner and saved by shefflin tell you what Ian shefflin is trying to get a break cant get out until theres the next dead ball but he is absolutely put in work here in the first plus minutes of this one now shefin back for Dylan Hunter tend to shoot heres shefflin in traffic with the right hand again bounced out the rebound pulled down by pack a foul on christien Reeves will be his second so just ahead of 10 minutes to go third team fou picking up Nigel pack 94 ft embodying him and so as you see now they want to be able to bring the pressure 94 ft but more importantly not allow Miamis guards to be able to roam free pa freshman Divine uku from Houston and Dell Jones from outside land over Maryland and eventually inside Brandon Johnson gets the basket Brandon Johnson only five points and four rebounds against Arkansas a guy thats their leading rebounder and a double figure score theyre going to need his production on both ends of the floor to be successful Matthew Cleveland on the floor with four new faces heres Chanty Wiggins he double clutch now for hunters three itll Bound Away away remember now Reeves is on the tiger bench hes got two fouls with 9 and 12 minutes to go so Victor locken has returned and locking provides a different Dynamic more of an offensive player yep however you also got Ian shein who finally got a break after putting in Big Time work in the first 10 minutes of this game Wiggins for the Freshman Jones here is Chase Hunter playing or Dylan Hunter playing with Chase Baseline oh the scoop but how about the fade screen more importantly reading the screen and then I mean again I guess the brother should have some type of connection right there however deylan with the beautiful find to get it to chase in the corner yep and then Chase does the rest first basket for Chase Hunter whos averaging almost 16 a game there goes the drive Ogo chuku his first points freshman from Sugarland Texas did not play against Arkansas and now Miami starting to find a little bit bit of a rhythm on the offensive end of the floor after struggling as locking gets the offensive foul second on locking too Cory so both the tiger PS but the face off the screen and then Chase Hunter attacking Baseline the Beautiful Finish the reverse you know I was going to give Chase a lot of credit but Im going to have a conversation with him after this because he was ducking a point guard I thought it was a big guy down there ready to block that shot thats a point guard trying to block over top of that chase not more of a its more of feedback than it is conversation yeah yeah always conversations its always conversation heres Blackman on the drive into traffic shefin back on the floor now with locking in the two fouls five to shoot Cleveland winding against Chase Hunter and scores Matthew Cleveland is booing what Miami wants to do he has got seven of the canes 12 here and this is what Matthew Cleveland did in the first half against Arkansas had 11 points in the first half after only scoring two points in each of the previous two games so I told Matthew pregame glad to see you back hes the guy that weve been missing in the ACC tend to shoot jonty Wiggins Hunter thought about it now shefflin had it stripped out went to the deck to get it and Hell ball is going to go to Miami but how about the Miami bench look at them up cheering on their teammates but going and getting on the floor after a loose ball not reaching down to get it they found their way back within two Music possessions that he was so entertaining his his energy and enthusiasm was absolutely fantastic its vwe at ESPN its vwe at ESPN its where we partner with the V Foundation to highlight the urgent need for cancer research its a gamechanging research thats saving lives you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research basket by Blackman cuts it to four so Miami in a bit of a surge here of a six nothing run the last 20 seconds or so inside the catch knocked away off the offer by Miles Foster and now here are the canes with Blackman who got the basket a moment ago and he found some Rhythm front rim back rim and in that will be a yes miles forgive me Jaylen Blackman answers your question as that was very close to a back door ends up being a turnover anyway on the Run Jo Bay the love and D WD you remember a few plays ago when we talked about Blackman needed to give Matthew Cleveland an opportunity to go up top Matthew Cleveland showing he is more than capable of taking advantage of a lob pass if he does so in transition and just like that weve got a tie basketball game Matthew Cleveland its all about the you and turning defense into offense throwing it up top Matthew Cleveland putting it down now we have ourselves a ball game game here at wat go Center in Coral game Music Cory its really a a game of runs if you will Clemson and Miami both had really tough starts Miami didnt get their first field goal to the 1226 Mark since then 8 to 12 Tigers havent been bad Miamis just been better it feels like Miamis been better but it all started once Matthew Cleveland checked into the game he got the first field goal first two field goals of the game for the canes and hes continued to be productive in his time on the floor coming off the bench for the third straight game heres hi breeder who gave him a lift off the bench earlier in the half Zachary playing with Chase Hunter Ian sheflin and here is Chase 10 to shoot Hy breed with eight to shoot trying to work against Blackman bounce past inside shefin fell off the rim hit the in line stays with the ti ERS and 20 to shoot and shefin with struggling to score oversiz ly kid wins the matchup as far as defending however the N shefin is always going to be able to win the matchup when it comes to his effort going right after and regains possessions for the Applause tiger Zachary against chob five to shoot for Chase Hunter into traffic the scoop too strong Cleveland the rebound Miami can take the lead and the lead for ly kid tough position to put Lin kid in trying to run the floor get to the Box on that one Matthew Cleveland for the last two games has been very aggressive in transition shocked to see him give that one up so early Chanty Wiggins is in Miles Foster sits down for the Tigers so Cleveland Joe Bay uku kid and Blackman out there for Jim lenen but when you watch Miami you can see its been a completely different level of defensive intensity as we see JayZ with the nice forgive me was J the pass was from shefin but Chase Hunter with the beautiful cut to get back door on that one taking advantage of the aggressiveness on the perimeter by Miamis Defenders Jo B the little soft Fall Applause Away Jo B has some moments a year AG go but you see him now starting to step into his R coming off the bench but very aggressive and attacking the basket on that one y had 10 against Oklahoma State earlier this year in the Charleston classic heres Zachary High breeder now threw it beyond the reach of Wiggins he got locked up at the Block so Clemson turns it over in a 20 all game here thats the second time H breeder struggled trying to get the basketball inside actually had to come out and have a conversation with Brad brell previously when the basketball was tipped away that time it ends up being a turnover of course feeding the post is a lost art this miamis hit their last six shots on the floor still locked up at 20 Blackman fall away at the front for three and scramble inside Chase Hunter going to run it down and Clemson right back at him high breeder catch and shoot too strong tapped away were going to get a whistle and a foul I believe I think theyre going to get Ian shefin on that one be his first fifth on Music Clemson and heres Nigel pack now to replace Divine Ogo chuku quick reminders to you top 10 college basketball tonight on ESPN 2 were going to go to The Great Outdoors of the Pacific North Northwest Seattle tonight Cory egga o and Kentucky against number seven Gonzaga with Ryan NIMH har third game in a sixyear series between these two clubs comes your way tonight late and thats going to be a second of backto back tough road contest with Kentucky you consider having to go play against Clemson at Little John where they knocked off the number four team in the country and then having to go to Gonzaga can the block after gave Miami the lead Wiggins now against Jo Bay Hunter thought about the three High breeder covered quickly by Cleveland and now Hunters got to try and work it with the shot clock winding now sheflin a three oh my goodness thats been the answer for Ian shefin throughout this game we talked about came in shooting only 19 five of 26 from Beyond the threepoint Arc and in this game alone three of three so close to matching uhoh heres the steel and Hunter the soft it was a d it was a d sof D its still duck but I mean more more mellow style flip it through dont touch the rim you know dont mess up your your manicure 2522 Clemson back in front the shefflin three the hunter stealing layup dunk lay dunk 18 to shoot heres Joe Bay took an extra step might have gotten away with it sheflin had it foul on Paul Joe Bay will be his first Miamis first foul of the game with 238 to go here this afternoon heres Chase Hunter hell play with high breeders sheflin Zachary and Wiggins on the floor for Clemson Nigel pack has come back so is Austin Schwarz the young freshman out front Zachary a corner three hiy breeder a second chance Hunter the shot fake hell te one up left it on the front rim still a good opportunity right there give H breeder a lot of credit for getting in there crashing the offensive glass coming up with a second chance opportunity of course always the best time to shoot a three is off of offensive rebound so free possession WB yep Brandon Johnson with theres Schwarz with 10 to shoot Lyn kid toart remember of shefflin digging Downs already got one foul heres a kick for Cleveland and shot clock violation Bert Smith right there on top of it and the canes trailing three turn it over there quick reminder to you we got mens college basketball coming up number 25 Yukon and Texas in Austin tomorrow afternoon 500 Eastern on ESPN that is a showdown between two fantastic freshman Liam mcney from Yukon Tre Johnson from Texas Trey averaging over 20 points per game both guys from the Dallas area and actually played a with each other as well from the time they were eight offensive foul on pack first on Nigel pack second on Miami Johnson was a big factor the other night coring the win for the Longhorns and Raleigh he absolutely was and shooting 45 from three spent a lot of time with both these guys at the Nike Academy of course good friends growing up however they go at it I can only wait to see them compete against each other later this afternoon 2522 Clemson went five and five on the ACC Road last year but lost their last two conference Road games inside Wiggins to catch boy look at the reaches and Hell ball going to be called by Jeb harness Clemson will get possession with 109 to go and Zachary will put it in play on the Baseline another look you see Nigel pack get in there get a hand on the Bas ball Brad Brownell having a conversation with Jeff Hartness about he didnt have a hand on the ball but I like the officiating by Jeb har because there was another alternative and it wasnt going to go in favor of Brad Rell so this way at least this way it does Hunter Schwarz follows him so he had a double team four to shoot heres Wiggins three for Zachary two one at the horn Hunter puts it up it hit the rim and they roll to the deck here and theyre still on the deck and hot breeder collects it and another offensive rebound for the Tigers can they turn it into Point as Sports Falls over a West spot Hunter spins out of three the second time Hunters got a great look off of an offensive rebound just unable to get it to go down and a young man whos shooting over 40 from three missed two wide open looks final half minute Johnson a twopointer once again Miami needs more production from Brandon Johnson hes shown that he can be a scorer and we know theyre going to get it from him rebounding they need for him to step it up kanes have hit eight of their last 10 to go to the locker room Clemsons missed their last five its a onepoint tiger lead with seven seconds to go hunter going to work against Schwarz spot up left it on the rim rebound pulled away and its a onepoint game Cory I dont know why were surprised consider that he leads the Tigers in assist at the point forward position Ian shefin having a very versatile and productive year original starters for both teams get us cranked up here for the second half and Lyn Kidd to work second field goal for kid Miami back in front on their first shot attempt remember the canes had a pretty strong finish offensively to the first half thats kind of where their bread has been buttered so far in the first eight games theyve played Wiggins knocks down the jumper I like that move by johy Wiggins driving the basketball but see now heres the conversation that happened look at the foul Jaden Zachary picking up a foul 94 ft away that work was put in by coach L Jim Laras conversation with the officials forced them to back the pressure off of Nigel pack trying to bring the basketball floor against Zach yeah that was an early timeout discussion heres kid going to work locking there defensively pack out front ston McCrae a Samford transfer rolls in a three ninth of the year or eighth of the year for State mccraes first point you could hear Brad Brownell yelling to Chanty Wiggins that ston c is a shooter but yet still able to get that shot off against a much taller Defender and Wiggins heres Hunter shot fake on Schwarz locking a rare three try and a rebound foul on Brandon Johnson first on Johnson will Ian sheff get an offensive rebound for that possession being that the foul was called does he still get the offensive rebound because he has 39 on the season thus far which is by far the most in the ACC but you consider his rebounding pract his prowess no offensive rebound just to this game theres a drive and boy Hunter Had It Go halfway down and rattled back out Applause packed front Court twopoint lead for Miami or kid a lot more assertive at the offensive end here he absolutely is and trying to get his hands on the basketball good things normally happen for the canes when he gets his hands on the basketball we talked about shoot 70 from the field great footwork and to be able to get to that left hand of course very familiar because he started his career with the Clemson T sure did seven games at Clemson theres the Drive Victor locken his first points of the ball game nice drive by lockin there to be able to go soft off the glass and more importantly not pick up an offensive foul our visit with Jim Lara yesterday was interesting we were talking about playing personalities of both teams his and certainly Brad brownells heres ston McCrae another three Johnson gives Miami a second chance pack obliges and it wont go shefflin the rebound fell down over lockin kid went down but sheflin knew to pass that off to JayZ before he fell to make sure that he didnt get a travel look at lockin spinning in the lane with a right hand and it goes and B Smith had a great look on that because locking put a hand up but B Smith immediately saying he did not touch it otherwise that would have been an offensive interference tied at 31 a little bit more of the offensive catalog than I knew locking had a moment ago tell you what it took us 10 minutes to get any type of offense like this in the first half the second half both these teams have warmed up and now they got the offense going ston McCrae with five all in the half Miami back to a twopoint lead lob inside locken couldnt hang on to it Clemson turns it over and Ian sheins done a lot of things Cory but just his work ethic on display but look at how smart he is he understands hes going to fall and once he goes down thats going to be a travel so he hands it off to JayZ and then lockin going with with a nice touch does not touch the basketball and softly rolls into the rim you know Miami started this game cold as ice from the floor they missed their first 10 shots before Cleveland hit that twopointer since they missed their first 10 the canes are 15 of their last 23 and the canes Now with an opportunity to add on to their lead as Zs unable to get it to go in the painted area on the drive Hunter had it kicked away it will stay with the Tigers so he start looking Paul jobay has come in the game pack stays in Schwarz stays in and Clemson going to size down a bit here taking locking off the floor and bringing in Dylan Hunter over more of a three guard lineup pushing chy Wiggins to the four spot shefin back for Zachary a standing three and the rebound pulled away inside Joe Bay had a hand on it the rookie Schwarz to work you get a kid like Austin Schwarz who grew up kind of in Tobacco Road territory right coming to Miami he plays in his first ACC game youre always curious about where the nerves will be right absolutely something hes probably dreamed of Im sure for a very very long time and schz unable to get that to go hunter the rebound both these teams have done a a pretty good job of defensive rebounding throughout this game especially for Miami when you consider that how great Clemson is on the offensive glass shefin working against Johnson into the lane with the right hand fell off the iron tough day shooting for Ian shefflin yeah sheins success has all been from Beyond the threepoint Arc he struggl on a reach in the back court here so half in South yeah think about this too could be the second of three matchups between Georgia and Texas yes but now when I tell you and this is nothing against SMU sure I got a root for the Clemson Tigers tonight and the reason being is because if Clemson beats SMU SMU is ahead of Miami right which means that we could have the ACC could have two correct teams in the college football playoff thats correct Alabama sits ahead of Miami 11 and 12 which means that if SMU beats Clemson there will be only one ACC team SMU in the championship theres the rebound stick back wouldnt go down that was uh I isah Johnson aru and a foul is called on Chanty Wiggins at the offensive end the defensive end for Clemson first on the junior Wiggins at 611 so of course youd have much more to do with ACC football than I do is that assumption correct if SMU beat you cant assume anything with college football playoff however with Miami sitting at 12 and Alabama at 11 and neither one of those teams playing today you cant move when youre not playing thats what the chairman said the other night is correct which means that theres no way that Miami gets ahead of Alabama that that is apparently the case so the only way to get two teams in is for Clemson to beat SMU and SMU is jumps ahead of Alabama correct one would think okay all right but again I would hate to assume anything at this point well you know what they say about when you assume thats exactly what Im tell Will I say the rest of that phrase however folks can go to their own ANS yeah Brad ronell not thinking about Clemson football tonight hes only concerned about Clemson basketball having conversation with Bert Smith and the Tigers now trailing by two as Chase Hunter lines up one wow unable to get to go 0 for five from Beyond The Arc for Chase Hunter comes in shooting over 40 on the season hasnt been able to get it going from Beyond The Arc today hes hes three of 14 from the floor he and sheflin in terms of field goal shooting are in a struggle a little bit today heres a kick out out for pack thats a long three itll Rim off Wiggins had a shot shefflin got another rebound twopoint lead from Miami we played almost 6 minutes of this second half Wiggins the catch and the dig in foul on Joe Bay 67 sophomore from France will draw his second thats the second on Miami great find there johy Wiggins trying to take advantage of his size against o Jo smacking down on the right arm there which would have forced a turnover had not the whistle been Music blown sheins got 11 points on four of eight shooting heres Zachary of three thats a front rim Miss and shein the first offensive rebound for shef now a double double for him 11 to 10 Hunter on the quick drive in basket Chase Hunter nows got eight in the ball game on his fourth field goal but thats the way this game has gone its been a grind so both whichever team is going to do the job defensively is JayZ gets a hand on Nigel Packs basketball unable to come away with the steal but this is going to be a defensive battle whoever can get the job done defensively will walk away with their first Conference win Johnson with seven to shoot against shefin Burrows down with the left shoulder spins and now shoots and it got tapped around theyll fight for it underneath and look at shefflin go to the deck a hell ball will get us to a break in the action Miamis just one of their last nine 0 for their last six and it might be a first and 10 down there I tell you what or third down in short maybe regardless as to what Miami has done on the offense a belt doesnt it it is some star power in that game we talking about Paige Beckers of course averaging over 20 shooting 61 from the field and by the way the first college player to ever have their own signature shoe thats right yeah pae got her own shoe man CH hunter in traffic tried to dump it to lock and got knocked away from behind nice defensive play at the post by Kid that pass also got deflected itll stay with Miami so Jalil be is one of my guys WD and every time that he makes a play makes a mistake or whatever may be hes looking immediately to the bench that means hes not playing with confidence right now if it would help Miami so much if he can find a way to gain some confidence to where he can become the play player that is necessary for him to be for this Miami team to be successful thats what he does theres Bea right there that gives him confidence right there thats his game being able to score the basketball and right now hes got to find a way to instill confidence in his coaches to keep him on the floor long Dave Miami the lead heres locken musling down on kid and overshot it boy post play is no joke today defensively it has been hard at the office twopoint lead for Miami kiding locking off the ball Cleveland trying to find that groovey had in the first half and that ball got kicked out Jalil Bea a McDonalds allamerican coming off the screen and then getting to his footwork you see his ability to rise up and score over the top the struggle for Bea to this point has been what hes done defensively hes got to be able to lock in I had a conversation with him on Tuesday letting him know Hey listen youve got to do the job defensively for Coach L to trust you enough to put you on the floor heres Dylan Hunter setting for three hell hit the side of the rim Joe Bay the rebound lockin tried to knock it away and last Touch by and immediate timeout not sure they announced who would get the ball will double of the season and the 17th of his career Cory he had 11 of them last year seven came in conference play and a great job defensively by JayZ there Jaden Zachary getting a hand on the basketball and just like that and we talked about Ian sheon with his double doubles hes going to need to add more points to that double double cuz Clemson has struggled on the offensive end especially here in this second half not able to get much going on this end of the floor yeah tigers have struggled to shoot it for sure four of 12 and gone two minutes and change without a point lockin on the hard drive with the right hand boy look at that rattled right out how many in and outs have really both teams have but especially the Titans theyve had a few but the canes have done a much better job of keeping their man in front which is something thats important for Coach L Cody Kimble Bill Courtney as theyve talked about how they have to be able to play I called Cody Kimble out earlier I said okay I know you guys do coordinators oh thats a nice how about uku on the hard drive right yes I talked to him about I know you guys do coordinators whos the defensive coordinator Cody just looked at me and said that would be me so I asked what do you got to do defensively yeah he broke it down but they have to keep guys in front they did not do it on that possession as Chase hunter gets probably the easiest basket hes going to get this season boy a pretty quiet 10 for Hunter right Cory yeah well he struggled to shoot the basketball we talked about his numbers and again no threes for him throughout this game so give Miami credit for doing the job defensively against Clemsons leading score Cleveland had it blocked locken pulled it away and another hell ball is going to be called this one will be awarded to the Tigers a nice drive by Cleveland but lockin is there to meet him at The Rim but ly kid gets hands on the basketball forces the tie possession even though Clemson gets this one it points the arrow back to Miami for the next one Hunter out front against oach chuku Zachary twopoint lead from Miami locken thought about the three and lost it on the dribble nine to shoot its going to stay with Clemson boy Miamis bench a lot of that Cleveland but oach chukus got Music four now heres Dylan Hunter with eight to shoot against patha Chase Hunter Baseline with two on the clock draws the foul Jeb Hartness off the Baseline on Lyn kid love the recognition by Chase Hunter knows that hes shooting struggling from Beyond a threepoint Arc so with the clock winding down puts his head down attacking the interior of Miami and finding a way to get to the free throw line the possibility to tie this game at 37 seventh best free throw shooter in the league is Chase Hunter Cory as a point guard which Chase Hunter is hes got to know when hey look I can distribute and direct and do all of that but there are times when it just needs to be me leading this team taking the initiative is now that time it is that time for him and is the point guard right now Chase Hunter has the ability to be able to break plays I would call it more of a combo yeah because Brad Brownell needs his scoring absolutely and he has the opportunity to be able to break plays especially when hes getting into the teeth of Defense because not only can he create from himself he create from his teammates as well those are the first free throws of the game for Clemson by the way wow yeah well one things for certain that we coach El could talk about the physicality but it hasnt been as though its been an inconsistent whistle so the referees have been allowing these teams to play on both ends of the floor McCrae inside gets his third field goal hes got seven all in the second half and the long three theres Chase hunter from downtown but you talk about the ability to be able to break plays off and again I was fortunate to have that ability when I was playing so that coaches would say okay when you recognize its times for you to go score you have to go get a bucket but now what he did was he was successful his first threepoint field goal make of the game nine minutes to go in the ball game kid working against lockin back with a right hand and oh ston McCrae the follow in a foul called and the foul will be on Victor lockin itll be his third and state McCrae getting into the interior using his size against Chase Hunter to be able to figure it out but Chase Hunter being letting it be known anything you can do I can do better and does it for one more of the three his first three of the game ties the game at 39 Two Shots here for AJ ston McCrae and the free throw good hes now eight for nine on the year has eight points all in the second half played a year ago at Samford in Birmingham 12 points five rebounds but heres the thing he shot 41 from three and he had 20 or more three times for the Bulldogs who were terrific in the Southern Conference and really trying to find his footing with Miami right now and again youve got 10 newcomers on this Kane Squad so everyone trying to really Define what their role is and who they need to be for this team to be successful Wiggins out of the corner long with the three Zachary the rebound back to chase Hunter twopoint lead for Miami 8 and a half to go Zachary on the attack turn and Fall Away how about Jaden Zacharys second field goal and when you talk about this Clemson Tiger team they played with two point guards because JayZs also a point guard and great with his assisted turnover ratio the best on Clemsons teams are one of the best in the ACC right now very shorthanded with The Rock and that pass Johnson trying to get it to kid tough angle to be able to feed the post on that one you want to play high low but with both guys on the same side of the the nail it makes it a difficult catch for Len kid of course he and Johnson still talking about that here on even on the defensive end so tied at 41 heres Hunter working against ston McCrae shefin will fire for three and the rebound Wiggins had it tried to make the save Zachary had it deflected and it will go back to Clemson with 20 to shoot and 74 five to go opening day in the Atlantic Coast Conference for conference play the level Ian sheflin has brought his to Coral Gables coming up with double figure rebounds already and then continuing to get on the floor after the loose basketball but it hasnt just been about shein its been about everyone on both these teams competing knowing that each has a chance to go one and0 in the league as of course Tim shein looks on Big Time basketball fan WD first conversation ever had with him he cornered me in the bathroom at Georgia Tech was telling me all about the ACC everythings going on great man love talking with them talking basketball enjoyed our visit before the game today Tim sheflin heres Ian outside locking three oh my well did you mean locked in because he absolutely was on that possession and more importantly sprinting over to get to the wing getting away from the defender Ian she on absolutely where to go with the basketball part of the reason why he averages 37 assists a game kid a couple of spins at the post and scores with the right hand hes pretty much automatic yep again how you shoot 70 yeah the only way to get him from scoring is to be able to send a double team but you dont want to do that and open up all the threes on the outside Hunter leaves it for lock and how about one more Cory lock is locked in WD backto back three balls as hes given Clemson a fourpoint lead Victor Lock with two deep threes his fifth and sixth of the yearo Johnson they are battling in the post heres kid Im telling you its the office today heres pack tended score and a reach in on Zachary will be his second five on the Tigers Cory the Big Fellas are going at it WD ly kid with the nice spin spinning back to the middle the right hand jump hook going over that left shoulder and on the other end lockin is locked in his second three on his many possessions six straight points for Victor Lock and the inbounds pass paa gets it to Pac ston McCrae along three and the rebound fielded by Kid he missed the putb Locking wrapped up Johnson and a foul has been called called on Lock and itll be his fourth six on Clemson its four on the transfer from Cincinnati who is from Southwestern Russia and the canes giving the Tigers a taste of their own medicine offensive rebound by link kid unable to get it to go but Johnson getting in the mix with another opportunity and draws that fourth foul on lockin who of course has been spectacular over the last couple of possessions for the tiger christien Reeves has come in wearing number 14 for Clemson heres a long three and no good for Johnson and out of bounds and Brad brell wanting that to be Clemson basket ball from our angle it did look as though Reeves was the last to get a hand on that knocking it out of bounds so another 20 and a reset here goes Bea a three big bucket for Jalil Bea and how about Nigel pack trusting his teammates getting into the teeth of the defense and then kicking it out but they are locked in ready to shoot the basketball shefflin heres Zachary double team off the Hedge Clemsons hit five with their last seven from the floor Wiggins got caught in the air Zachary with five to shoot foul line took pack shot fouled by Nigel pack second on pack four on now Miami I can tell you as a player is so tempting not to reach in there when you know a Defender is going to bring that basketball back to you after the spin but JayZ protecting the basketball getting his hand out as you see pack reaching in getting the arm of Jaden Zachary and willll send him to the line for two so here is at the line hes 13 of 16 on the year and the first one good five for Zachary in the game Cory its important to remember as you look at Jaden Zachary whos from Salem Wisconsin he had a 100 starts in three years at Boston Music College and you dont find that kind of Veteran presence in your league everywhere no you really dont especially at the guard position to be able to have guys that can man the point Point as well as defend opposing point guards like a Nigel pack you got to give JayZ a lot of credit for Clemson really been able to hold pack in check throughout this afternoon 12 to shooting heres pack hit off his foot Ked right away to the Freshman on the drive with the right hand fouled by Reeves Christian Reeves third that is seven on Clemson so Miami will get two here but one and one on the next pair of common fouls and Miami is having a moment right now with Jalil witha whos not got opportunity to get to the free throw line to score possibly his sixth and seventh points of this game and Coach leega trusting The Freshman the highly talented freshman late in the game to be able to make plays more importantly trusting him on the defensive end and the first one is good and you know Reeves now has three locken has four Zachary has two and Brad going to size down once again now with the three guards on the floor forcing Tony Wiggins who has the size to play the four doesnt spend a lot a lot of time down there we over a perimeter guy but they remains pretty solid all seven of his points have come here in the second half those are his first free throws onepoint lead for the Tigers and five minutes to go welcome to the ACC were here WD yep shean has it poked away heres Hunter with 12 to shoot ston McCrae defending now to Zachary shot clock at five and Wiggins Chanty dips in slips it across Dylan Hunter a three first points of the game cold blooded from Dylan Hunter Dylan Hunter now as a junior stepping into the roll where Brad Brownell trusts him a lot on the floor and now knocking down a huge three right there to Gibs Clemson a fourpoint Applause lead Johnson looks at kid pack on the drive into traffic threw it away its a foot race into the back and Bea has it that should have been a at the shot clock its good that is a huge play for a number of reasons and so what Jeb Hartness is saying as they go over to look this see if Bea got that off in time Brad Brownell won a backcourt violation and so what Jal be did under review by hustling back theyre saying that Chanty Wiggins touched the basketball so Bert Smith to the monitor theyre under review Clemson by one for the time being the threes on the board for Miami ball goes into the back court the reason why it wasnt a back court violation Chanty Wiggins touches it there however look at the shot clock the shot clock at 5 Seconds goes to 48 seconds so theres where the concern is right now as Jalil Bea gets the basketball going down theres no way for the officials to be able to see from that shot clock as to what the time really was as we look at this angle the shot clock the ball all oh thats close right there WD yep to see if its still in his hands at zero so what we are seeing is when it goes from 5 and then to 45 is the T of a second kick in thats what youre seeing at home you dont normally see it in that kind of formation thats why I want to point that out so but normally you would have a much smaller number to the right so on the on our screen you only see it there but the concern is does Bea get it out of his hand we can go back and show that because it with the clock on the floor it shows here but they are catching it with two seconds after review the play has been changed its no basket the ball was still in the shooters hand shot the game clock will be put at 405 and Clemson will get the ball on the side and when you see the last replay you see the ball still in Beas hands with 00 and the red light around the shot clock going off so that is the right call but this is it right here when you look its still in his hand there yep and once you see the red light around the shot clock that is a shot clock violation so no basket no basket great job our officiating crew being able to go back over so it goes back to a fourpoint game Bea basket waved off and by the way amidst all of that and the video element in play here really nice job by this crew oh absolutely great job throughout this entire game as well as more importantly on that particular play which is a huge play Hunter Baseline and its a block its going to be on state McCrae as Hunter took the hard drive no surprise here now that one of the best players in the accs got the rock in his hand how about the stats Chase Hunter has scored at the end of a half 13 different games over the last two seasons WD yeah thats the reason why of course I was waiting to use that at the end of the first half when he took the last shot but Brad brell absolutely knows whos going to have the basketball at the end of halves whether its the first or second Chase Hunter made big plays for his team over the last couple of season and his mindset Cory was personified in the NCAA tournament oh he had a huge tournament 17 points a game yeah six assists he was one of the main reasons of course along with PJ Hall and Ian sheff that they were able to get to the elite eight and now Jaden Zachary getting involved in the mix on both ends of the floor to give the Tigers a sixpoint lead sixpoint lead three and a half to go at watsco Center skip back buta thought about it Zachary the Fly By The Freshman got the bounce on the three and Bea who had the three taken away on the previous possession makes up for it with a big bucket right now and you see the Freshman continuing to build in his confidence 10 points and two for two from Beyond The Arc second double figure game of his young career has come here in his first ACC game sheflin thought about the triple back to a threepoint game locking for Hunter eight to shoot kid hedge Hunter fires off the rim shefin another rebound stick back too strong tap follow good lockin gets credit for it hes got a dozen all in the second half but give Ian shefin a tremendous amount of credit for getting the first offensive rebound to keeping that possession alive pack trying to find a crease heres kid now resets flipped it up and it rolled in its very little he can do wrong when he gets around the basket man kid is amazing and finishing it off opportunities that one A little unorthodox but still count the two coming up on two minutes to Applause play inside shein the catch fouled by Johnson from behind and thats the second time weve seen a player look to his coach to say challenge it which shows that these young players are watching a lot of NBA Le there is no challenge in college basketball however if there were they may win that one Brandon Johnson with the block up top as Tim sheon looks on but Brandon did have that left hand in the back of Ian shefflin there was contact Clemson has just three of four at the free throw line all here in the second half sheins first one good hes got a dozen now to go with a dozen rebounds and how about how important this game is these two teams have started the season against each other two years previously they split one and one yep and so now this could be the tiebreaker between these two coaches who have been on the ACC Sidelines now for 15 and 14 years respectively timeout for Miami just under two minutes to play in the ball game in a fivepoint contest quick reminder to you we got top his opportunities with Bea inbounding the basketball and of course you know the inbounder is always the most dangerous guy as far as getting it about getting it back on the underneath or sideline back play Dylan Hunter stays with the rookie heres pack Zachary there and turned over Hunter into the front Court Tigers once again JayZ Jaden Zachary with a great job defensively just getting his hands up in the Trap the deflection forcing to turnover Hunter against Betha out front Dylan to chase now lockin hit the screen kid helps tend to shoot heres Dylan in the corner Zachary a three spins out and a foul from behind will be on Bea how about Dylan Hunter getting in the mix and getting defense I mean offensive rebounding position those as though he were getting a defensive rebound really boxing out Jalil Betha watch Hunter hes boxing out y as though hes on the defensive end of the floor comes away with it one of the many times weve seen players going to the floor after a loose basketball showing the importance of game one in ACC play so kid will come out and Paul Jo Bay will come on the floor so Miamis going to put themselves into the position Cory if Im guessing right here they can switch one through five they can switch one through five off off defensively however they can play looking for a three on the other end of the floor and play faster now without ly kid in the post area youve got all guys on the floor that can shoot it from Beyond The Arc so heres Dylan Hunter who on the year 10 of 15 and the first one good fourth point for Hunter Dylan Hunter made a big three for Miami for for Clemson here in this second half now getting to the free throw line the opportunity to make this a three repossession game front rim Miss its a sixpoint game with 122 to go and look at Miami trying to attack the paint kick it out see if they can get a quick three on this possession pack who is scoreless today by the way ston McCrae back for pack out of the corner rebound locking they got the look they wanted Nigel pack in the corner for three of course hes the guy you trust the most from Beyond The Arc just unable to get it to go minute to go Brad Brownell wants the floor spread look at this one4 set theyre going to burn the clock down ston McCrae defending Chase Music Hunter here goes Hunter against ston McCrae pull up at the foul line got it we talked about who Brad bro trusts eightpoint game 40 seconds left Brandon Johnson a catch and shoot three spins out locking the rebound and a backourt foul on Miami Applause eightpoint lead for the Tigers 333 remaining an opportunity to get it to double figures at the free throw stripe as some fans start to Clemson by the way you think todays a little bit of a win a win today would put him on a sixgame streak and next Saturday Memphis at Little John I will be in Little John looking forward to that game as Penny Hardway in his group who had a great showing in the Maui Invitational sure did very good Memphis team coming into little John which Kentucky found out is no easy task Victor loins first free throw the afternoon is good Cory hes got 13 all in the second half this young man from Anapa in Southwestern Russia six nothing run by the Tigers make it seven in a row and the lead is 10 with a half minute to go pack into the front Court ston McCrae trying to find a pass hell kick Joe Bays three is blocked and its picked up betho will take off Baseline and score around Zachary nice second half for Jalil Betha but its going to come in a losing effort here today and theres a back court foul front Court foul on Bea which will be his second that will be the silver lining for for Miami however it has been a very dark cloud this will be the sixth consecutive loss for the Hurricanes after getting off to a 3 and0 start this season and right now Jim leega trying to figure out how to fix the problems knowing that they have a huge matchup yep versus Tennessee who who is going to be a top five team in the next ranking and a stiff challenge for any team to take on Tennessee already two and0 versus the ACC this year yep Chase Hunter adds another free throw hes got 18 today sheins got a double double and that ball last touched by the canes with 4 point9 to go so all Clemsons going to do is put it in play here and theyre going to walk off with a 10point win LED by a point at the break and some really really big shots down the stretch and stops for Brad brownells team to post this roadway and it wasnt necessarily The Usual Suspects it wasnt always chase hunter or I shein great performance by lockin also
