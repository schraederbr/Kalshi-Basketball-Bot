ACC on ESPN for the 500th consecutive time its a sellout crowd here at Cameron Indoor Stadium Miami here in Durham to take on the Blue Devils at Duke uncharted waters right now for Duke and North Carolina both unranked in the middle of the ACC pack whereas the Kings trying to crash the party along with Clemson who just beat Duke and Dukes last game one game out of first are the canes bubble shoots it here with Dick Vitale Chris Budden is along for the ride as well it is good to be back with you well its great being with you man nothing like it one of the Brave venues in all of college basketball and these teams always seem to play each other close an interesting contrast of styles today as well they just had a lot of success against dude theres no doubt about hes beat him seven times in his career which is amazing when you think about 12 years only coaching at Miami so I think the games gonna come down you get the size with the look at the size of Duke tend to contain that rebounded ability and on the other side a dynamic dynamic duel in the backcourt due to the love one and youre gonna love they absolutely Sensational like you baby like you I made a rock and roll of course Chris Button as well and Chris so much of dealing with Duke dealing with the atmosphere but I dont know Miamis got one player that may not care so much yeah North Shadowmere who grew up in Nicaragua I asked him about playing in this historic building he said I dont know much what should I know well one thing that hes gonna need to know is that Jeremy roach is going to be playing in this game today John shires they practice two days ago he will be available after dealing with a niece or sorry toe spray that hes dealt with all year that offensive rebound to start for Jordan Miller but he missed the flip putback attempt well Mills really a versatile player theyre gonna need him to give a little rebounded inside what way to the gate those three pounds make shots thanks shudson Jimmy land again tell us now our starting lineups presented by Kay Jewelers and you can see Tyrese Proctor out there as a starter for the Blue Devils leaning in and getting the games first points Kyle filipowski although getting Jeremy roach back at some point for whatever minutes dick he can play today is Big Purdue well you know roach is a veteran player he reads that experience hes got star ability he was Sensational last year at the end of the year and Philip husky scored down there is going into great diaper dandies in the country Miller Lost the dribble right off his own ankles taken away by philipowski Proctor goes Cross Court Tariq Whitehead thought about it and now gives it up its a young basketball team John Shire has and approached gives him an adventured presence they need him hes missed the last three games Ryan young in the posts Proctor for three they did go two and one in those three games but he was the stabilizing Force they thought they needed Clemson on the road as todays starting lineups again brought to you by Kay Jewelers for the caves packed the Kansas State transfer very dangerous from behind the arc as you just saw yeah he can shoot the ball but hes really made the transition to playing the point guard slot with Juan Whitehead deep way to he shows moments of greatness moments just a lot of time earlier in the season injury and he is the guy that was rated second while being Guardian are people that do the ratings of high school players seconded America pack does it again he can shoot the ball hey his former schools doing pretty good enough Kansas State unbelievable Tang hes got to be the leading guy certainly for National coach of the year and Chris Bunton was in the middle of all of that on Monday night that win by one at home against ku Applause Music muscleing it up and getting it to go plus the foul is Mark Mitchell so Mitchell gets the best size also and youve noticed theyre trying to post their bigs because its not a big team when you look at certainly by him theres Mitchell a little turnaround inside thats the score little Inside Out action you can watch a little play right here gonna go inside kick the ball out to the open shooter and Mr Whiteheads gonna Splash nothing but nylon only shooting 33 from three so far this season but Whitehead can certainly be a better shooter than that as Mitchell misses the threepoint play opportunity the foul by the way was on look at Poplar his first all right trapped under the basket beautiful give up though for the Jordan Miller Lane talking about a strong physical presence I mean he brings them as a transferred came out of the transfer portal and he has been a strength in time he gets 16 and 16 in Syracuse in their last win Music foreign Applause got it back tough shot tipped around fellow passkey with the rebound sides really bother the money inside foul on walk he got frustrated thats a vowel of frustration frustration Music nice diagonal pass excellent look right there found the open man you know you talk about great diaper damage I rate the laploskey one in the top two number one You Gotta Give It to the kid down in Alabama Brandon Miller has been unbelievable Music Applause Music Applause a takeaway doctor defense Poplar Fades away and connects the Singapore a threepoint play nice little playbyplay right there suspend well gotten a passing Lane Applause knocked out of bounds by Miller Music I gotta check my expectations before the game as he wants right here in the anticipation symptoms hes gonna go right to the rack baby pulls up now a little turnaround Jay but Jim Larry still I said Jeff I gotta deal with all that size he said look let me tell you something talk about dealing with her outside he said hey unbelievable Whitehead hits again and as we were going to that replay you might have heard the noise in the background that was the crowd reacting to Jeremy Rhodes checking in for the first time in four games yeah thats a big fan of white against the score but larenegger said to me says hey did they have size last year Mark Williams seven footer guy put her name that Guero a pretty good player at about 6 10 he said that you had to win no more he said I think we figured okay we cant worry about that everywhere we go to play people think about side side sides that 153 baby filipowski called for that foul so free throws when we come back what have they been missing without Jeremy roach well he can win the basketball he gives him that leadership hes such a veteran player in fine open people he can drive the ball but most of all he distributes three straight two games but practiced just enough this week and John Shire told us before the game Dick Vitale he is not going to be a hundred percent the rest of the season just the nature of that injury but they feel like they can manage his minutes and practice time through the rest of the season its a toe injury to truly created a problem and its creative from former two player as well with the Pelicans when you think about certainly Brandon Ingram a great player hes had a toe injury as well tell you stuff when you get there you cant do the things you want in terms of agility you know theyre all stupid guards down here in Miami you hear about Charlie Moore he said hes doing my custom and then because the average like 17 points a day is picked up where some of that production has left off from last year he was added to the wooden midseason top 25 list well so theyre getting the help from pack as well and Poplar poplars a Dynamic Athlete who has an unbelievable upside they just want to see him play a little better on the defensive man they prided himself defense the general Iron Eagle nominated from the Hall of Fame just a terrific coach but hes done in Miami hes special sweet 16s and the last trip that Miami made to Cameron they came away winners but then lost head to head to Duke in the ACC tournament last year both teams go to the bench for the first time as well with roach as you can see checking into five seconds on the shot clock picks up his dribble and a deflected pass taken away by Poplar floor for the first time as well for the Kings Anthony Walker and Bensley Joseph walk with experienced player looks the guys been around pudding and gave it right to Mark Mitchell phillipowski spin cycle just too strong and then a foul called shove by Derek Lively well Jim lareneg has done a terrific job at un oh absolutely been absent Sensational he bought a house in my area Im like actually I could walk to his house in about two minutes obviously Miami pays well I tell you what hes got that as a second home hes not in Miami he loves down here I spent a lot of money in my house if thats a second home they pay really well and the win baby get a lot of green dont have five kids and have to send them all to colleges also advisable is Derek Whitehead commits the foul Music and they always say dont be the guy that follows the guy but John Shire was trained for this by Mike shazewski and he is struggling through a season at times with such a young team well let me tell you this people the expectations because were wearing a Duke uniform I think theyre just gonna step on the floor this is a young basketball team I mean hes dominated by young kids time patience patience everybody wants rewards instantly if a kid doesnt produce right out of high school with a big reputation hes a failure he cant make it get real man sometimes it takes a little longer for some people took me 35 years to get used to this 35 years there were patient at the waste and my last 90s and theyre still about I still violate every television Mark Mitchell commits a hustle foul as you can see Applause from John Shire he did not mind that foul patience right now hes a Hypersonic shot its one thing that Reed did do well a little offbalance drive by Anthony Walker and got it to go life spotting the opening in the defense tacked it put it into the lane patience patience led to points Applause paint Lively nice move in the posts Off the Mark the tip follow wont go tries again rolls in what a great effort right there what a great effort by Lion King incredible theyre really setting up a great week in practice hes a player unplug but about people got to be patient pack with another triple his third already here in the first half he came in with a big reputation and I always speak to him too I heard the NFL Lively sets the screen rolls finish ES Applause he was rated number one in America Applause back on the drive high off the glass and hell shoot two and he gets banged up Music Nigel pack went down hard as Lively called for the foul thats his second his life he works underneath side look at his tenacious effort look at this effort he was number one in the nation because of things like that you cant teach that jump in a belly but finds the opening of Defense great drive by Metro player Anthony Walker screen and roll right there to lob up on top theres roach man roaching the good good vision tell you a lively man he was very Lively in a few moments hes been out of court you know the kid gets so much heat on social media oh he was number one he was gonna look that up he saw his incredible things you cant teach cant teach 611 can teach Speed and Agility he possesses and he cant teach hes a million Bachelor of the flow hes jumping ability hes been all ready for Nigel pack but to that point talking to John Shire before the game if youre the number one ranked recruit in America and then you go to Duke if you dont average 19 and 10 right from the jump youre a bust yeah like there is no allowance for a player to develop and not everyones on the same timeline but they think his future is every bit as NBA bright as you would think coming in as roach with a terrific scoop what a great move right so much for this team hes the veteran he takes all the young kitties and he really makes them better players because the way he can get into the paint with his driving ability another with the left hand holds it off the rebound pulled down by Ryan young gave it away pack sets up Miller hit the underside of the rim and a foul called on Ryan young so that will put Jordan Miller at the free throw line you know Jordans really in first town player youve seen his versatility look at the penetration right here what a great drive you can score he means so much to do he really is their catalyst they went two and one without them which is really interesting plus the game down to Clemson they were really in control and Clemson really played well in the last five minutes and Chris Budden not only Jeremy Roach coming back with the toe injury today but Jalen Blakes playing with a mask on his face yeah hes entering right now wearing a new accessory he broke his nose in practice took an elbow to it on Tuesday that mask was actually made by a former Duke football player Kevin guesman its a 3D printed custom to his face heres the crazy part they fixed his nose without ever having surgery because having had surgery they wouldnt have been able to make the mask in time so Tuesday he said just fix it I dont need any anesthesia just do what you got to do because Im playing on Saturday thats Music well youre fighting through a tough voice today as well youre in a tough week no no not really the good news was noncancer to grow they took out on Wednesday Music I was hoping Im praying I could be here this is the best medicine in the world Applause Music Arlen Beverly off to Miller and now Isaiah Wong has been quiet here in the first half leans in that hit the back forward first and the young rebound hey Miller may be the best little round player one Loves a great score when he took multiple talents and hes really a terrific player Eddie Walker called for the foul threepoint lead for Miami as we approach the Midway point of the first half sea game you will be there and that should be some atmosphere cant wait to go down there especially see Rick Barnes hes just such a special guy as a coach and as a human being when I was battling those multiple cancers every day whos sending me a prayer just a great great person college game day will be on site as well Music Applause and he has 11 of their 20 from Nigel pack s outside for three to tie it up you never to get rid of the living guys with his Mobility hes able to go inside outside just a special special Town who has delivered big time this first year into knocked down three of his first four long only has one point thus far looking for his first basket leans in thumbs up short hes actually in some tough shots he hasnt what you call really high percentage that was a tough shot there the angle on the inside his first three Music Proctor to filipowski he drives it again gets down the draws the foul shot was blocked by omir he does a great job protecting the ball filipowski as he drives to the goal a beer a very physical presence into Sunbelt Player of the Year defensive player of the year he needs that physicality Miller was called for the foul and coming up next on ESPN we head to rough Wade Taylor Texas A M have won six in a row they take on Oscar sheepway better known as Mr double double and Kentucky this afternoon at two Eastern that Kentucky win over Tennessee seemed to settle everyone down wow calmed everybody down I said before that game before he was like come on man for a guy that did what he has done at Kentucky they built statues for coaches are you kidding me what hes done look at the resume which is the manhood time hes been motivated and inspired serious the other than 37 points 24 riddles heres another producer Kim Bolton when he played with Stanford I mean hey Kim did I say the way you told me to say it except Kim did it in a month Miller in the post around philipowski kicks it back up top for a wide open three the rimmed off for Beverly and then a foul called on omir thats his first weve already had 10 lead changes in the first 10 minutes but thats normally the types of games that Miami and Duke play well both clubs you talk about real good talent well coached I mean Miami Jim Lambert whos been nominated for the Hall of Fame but he did it George Mason was Unreal and thats where Jordan Miller came from out with George bass going to the final four hes unreal Jim larenega arrived at Miami its only North Carolina and Miami that have beaten Duke seven times or more Carolina has quite a few more than something Proctor get down literally playing well whos Kevin might be seven shots Broncos got a good release hes a young kid you know he reclassified to be able to play but he could be a nice Casino an 80 run gives Duke their largest lead Music there is the George Mason transfer on the offensive glass Jordan Miller tips in his own Miss hes got six hes got the scores just has that name are you saying let me hear Jordan you think star star I could even spell it maybe I can get into Duke now graduate school like with shoes no yeah youre right it doesnt chusen oh youre on scholarship wow really good job ceiling inside is Young and easy too tell you what the Dunns been real good post presence coming out of Northwestern hes been really solid for them from the getgo back at the elbow young the rebound showing a lot of patience today too early for some shots trolling turnoverski tried to go behind the back to Young it was tipped out though looks like Wong got a hand on it so it will stay with Duke a little Showtime around the back a little Showtime the placement have exploded he said huh maybe I can do it whats his name magic used to do it bird used to do it the reason I thought of those two guys how about your documentary recently the two of them was an incredible documentary magic of Larry Bird they werent bad a Bullet Pass from Young and that misses so a Duke turnover that was great coming here I mean look at this place you look certainly going to go to Kansas City North Carolina its like the Taj Mahal its like an unbelievable place just because of the history of the great tradition Kentucky same thing passionate fans warm here couldnt tip at home phillipowski with numbers Applause to Granderson Music parent pass for young thats five turnovers now for Duke two turnovers in a row Amir leans in and scores she did a great job right hes so young coming over and he used his body to square his body to the Baseline youll be Brad former assistant coach into people dont realize he was on the staff died here with Chuck Dale one of her assistance God was the head coach big movements thats literally pointed I always learned something Proctor knocks another one down thats gonna shoot the ball hes got five you mean you start always talking about Square your body to the Baseline make the Trap steps through your body hes been such a great clinician still lives I mean this looks good job on the ESPN Applause Beverly a running onehander comes up short and it looks like a foul is going to be called on Ryan young under the basket thats his second 6 51 to go in the first half Duke by five and Jim laronega got some very exciting news delivered by his grandchildren recently youll see that when we come back for you a firsttime Nate Smith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame nominee one of just 14 active coaches with over 700 victories congratulations coach and what a way to find out tell one thing it is an unbelievable feeling when you get that call Jimmy uh hes a great family man his wife Liz I mean Ive gotten to know that well over the years and just good good people and a deserved honor because you have to think someday if not necessarily on this ballot hes gonna make it when youve done what hes done not only at Miami but also at George Mason sometimes its a little while I was on three Bells Oh for free and then when I went once before you eventually made it into a couple of Halls of Fame I think oh man I got a 2008 with an incredible class Pat Riley not bad guy named Patrick Ewing not bad guy named Hakeem Olajuwon a lady was unbelievable Kathy Rush also Adrian Dantley what a class that was I was on the bottom of the ladder in that class I had foul and Anthony Walker thats his second good Music from the corner off the heel for Proctor Miami clubs are always prepared to play hard and play defense they execute offensively and they always very tough to blow them out theyre always in the game or Chad omear rolls it off the rim and filipowski pulls down another rebound theres an excellent post moved by him here just didnt get the ball to go down four or three bounds for filipowski Music contact short gets his own Miss hats off the front rim and its tough to get a defensive rebound sometimes against Duke as Coast to Coast with the finger roll not there but omir is able to follow after the Joseph Drive hes got four OMeara worked really well and he is as you said with the great offensive remap roach has played about six minutes thus far number three with the ball right now penetrating ball movement to Whitehead Nice Shot fake couldnt kiss at home he did everything right and subscribe finally going for the lead Kevin able to do this without walk being long he has not broken out yet I cant connect weve had 10 lead changes and neither team has led by more than five Music approach double team Mitchell bails him out tractor for three way too strong get full opacity down in a post he had to put them back to the basket great post position and create space another three he can shoot the three man hes got some unbelievable range hes got a new go jump shot you can shoot that baby from anywhere thats his fourth main three here in the first half hes got 14 you can see knocked down five triples Monday against Syracuse roach on the drive draws the foul Tuckerman who transferred a Dominion impact player I mean this kid has come here and has been such a major factor especially been him losing guys like mccusty and Charlie Moore just unbelievable to your point how they missed filipowski last trip hes posting them on the inside look right there hes going into the box right in the post and then look down into him you got to get the ball into that guy hes so versatile you talk about versatility philipposky fits that to him see that foul was on omir his second a Miss at the line for roach although talking to John Shire before the game he mentions the last five minutes against Clemson he thought Duke basically outplayed them for 35 minutes but just having that stabilizer the guy whos been through it before on the road in the ACC and they didnt have roach and and he would be that stabilizing Factor they had five freshmen on the floor in the closing moments of that game you know what I like to watch John Shire is so positive really if you cant like this guy that really want him to succeed substance wrong salmon down to Uber Davis and Carolina they both bleed their certain colors none of these games right here NC State was an embarrassment goal they were done 4422 at the half but not believe me gives it up and a foul called on young that is his second you know a lot of people before the season started some ACC is down Im gonna tell one thing Kevin Keach has done a great job you look at NC State and now look at Clemson look at Wake Forest we know Carolina and look at these Kansas Miami absolutely youre talking about a day where Isaiah Wong is really struggling in this game hes over three you need somebody else to step up in one of the most difficult places to play now Japan has been Sensational with 14 in the first half South you know I really like this Dukes team in terms of the potential but because of so many young players they have the inability to maintain an intensity execution compete the way you need to compete in a game like this for an extended period of time and once they get there theyre going to be really dangerous hub Uh Kevin weve got a onepoint game Miami looking to extend their lead as theyve got AJ Casey at the free throw line shooting the one and one Kevin does a great job man his Studio works his butt off he really does hey I look to my left I know were in great shape I look to my left right you missed the magic hes been 41 years doing this and whatd you say before he has probably seen over 500 games Carolina and Duke no doubt against each other he has been in person to 80 jobs and a half right here hes been in person to 80 Duke Carolina headtohead games wow thats pretty good Music his way into the lane and gets shut down and he is shaken up a little bit as philipowski comes away with a little bit of a limb plenty of news and notes though Chris Budden in the ACC yeah particularly in the state of Carolina Duke and UNC are not ranked in the top 25 the last time that that was happened Jake this season has the making around college basketball to just be a wild season with no teams really taking over like the top five spots foreign Applause so were going to get better and better our young players are going to get better and better Duke has missed seven in a row roach tries to break the streak and dust nice sevenfolds nice having that Venture with the ball in his hands today the wind big you need great point guard play someone can make plays when his team is struggling Jeremy fits that double back Joseph connects Applause Music he can stroke the three but finally someone other than Nigel pack hitting one from outside Music does not get the roll that close to a chance for a threepoint play and you know while we have a chance dick vitel lets raise some money for kids battling cancer wow we got a new one here we sold out the one so quick that the man was so great on a new

well have an ACC womens basketball matinee on ABC and the ESPN app Diamond Johnson leads number 20 NC State against Haley van lip and Louisville should be a good one begins at one Easter the Lutheran people were there for years their coach has done a great job terrific job its really saddened up in there to the Mets program I mean I dont I dont understand whether to go out but some players in terms of the transfer portal and move their roster I mean theyve got a great staff to him you should great communication and bringing a lot of people in the Olympic Kenny Payne daddy Manning Nolan Smith former outstanding player here in Duke they got a really revamp and get some real talent playing to beat this one right hand Fade Away short offensive rebound Lively that wont go the back tap Finds Its way to grandison that sets up a roach through and he connects shes the beneficiary but the big guys inside kept the ball alive they did all the dirty work and he got an open look and he made it count and the camera Praises love it look at him my grandsons are in there my grandsons and Cameron crazies Applause back a step back thats short another Lively rebound and a chance for Duke to retake the lead Applause cool Collective guys the three cman Manchester library has been Lively in a few minutes hes playing the Lebowski thats way short Poplar shovels one underneath and the bank shot is good for AJ Casey and Miami opens up a threepoint lead with under a minute to go here in the half no well step back in time as we take a look at todays Wendys wooden watch a couple of North Carolina Tar Heels on the list there is filipowski joining that group from duke Isaiah Wong part of five players to make the ACC list as far as the midseason top 25 for the wooden award is concerned really really deserving all of them but Im gonna tell you right now its been tough to beat the kid I mean hes been a consistent and hes going 10 or 11 straight double doubles dominating defense in the offensively and the reason that Boilermakers are having such a great year and thats zakini Music see if Duke tries to go two for one weve got 45 seconds to go in the half Broach to the corner of the extra pass and a three goes down for Jacob grandison see he provides that leadership ability he made the edge to pass and theyre almost created of the Triple Threat position for a little broad Faith freed him to get the good look to the corner hes a big Buffet but look at that face oh he left some on the ground theres the ball to the corner and its well you lose something on the ground Music thank you Mr roach oh and then happy he is back 15 Duke baskets in the first half 13 of them off assists and we are tied at 38 its been a great time Ive been here since Thursday man I mean Thursday its been a good week for the entire vital family here at Duke right well my grandsons had a big tennis match last night played Memphis some very good Memphis Team every where hes coming from turning big time and they pulled it out I was so happy and pleased to see my grandsons help the team by each winning their match so it was really great right after were gonna go to Martin Im playing top I believe top 10 or top 12 Marvin tomorrow in town back for three a long rebound pulled in by Whitehead and a chance for the final shot at the half for Duke and thats thats a game Anderson for three and we are tied at halftime for 11 minutes out of roach and theyve been 11 000 minutes and Im going to tell you were not showing the statue I go Derek Lively was very active for them too now roach returning certainly has made a big difference as we go down to Chris button coach this one back and forth the whole game what have you seen out of your guys early hardfought game you know played well theyre really good its gonna be a 40minute game what is Jeremy roach giving you in his return today yeah you know Jeremy for us his boys and brothers on the floor hes been in these games uh hes taking off some Rust though but the fact that hes out there says a lot about him and the Boost has given our team do you have any idea how much you can get out of them in the second half well see well well squeeze whatever we can but everybody needs to step up though hes playing a good half we need to finish possessions and you know really valuable on offense appreciate it thank you thank you Chris tied at 38 at the half as we head back for the halftime report and check in with Kevin Connors in the studio all right Bob we expected nothing less out of these two teams Music we are back at Cameron Indoor Stadium set for the start of the second half Duke in Miami tied at 38 Pablo Susan here with Dick Vitale and Chris Budden and the return of Jeremy roach has been big for Duke well generally Rich what now look at him reading the defense good observation how he sees that Godzilla the Lane right there you put a truck through it watch they reverse the ball come up let me get it over up and he is going to attack that Gap hes gonna take that seed there he goes hanging in a year twisted and turned just like you oh yeah now watch this watch a great ball fake prison Defender great vision bites the open man but the reason was 3838 is the tenacity the relentlessness oh man theyre so relentlessness its unbelievable look at Miami oh were on the air oh well we are oh I cant believe Im on TV yeah oh is this really yes its your first time I understand try to control yourself hey Duke started 12 of 17 from the field they finished three of their final 14 to end the half did you see a tightening of the defense on the Miami end well Ill tell you this one of the keys is also were having done a great job of defensive transition as John Madrid pointed out to me its amazing Duke has had zero fast breaks and also six turnovers by Miami zero points out of Duke yeah with 3838 and we got one early with one point I think one will break out in the second half and He was largely invisible in the first half missed three in the lane and then checked out only played 10 first half minutes well they got certainly decked at the guard spot and that time a good challenge on the Miss Applause great position inside big screen by Amir Wong still cant hit a good shot right there because he utilized the screen the ball screamed really well from the mirror Music wide open Proctor knocks it down off the feed from phillipowski phillipovski did the great size looks right over the top of the defense and he makes the great pass come here with the left hand draws the foul you know you gotta remember this when youre talking about Proctor from Australia incredible he should be right now in high school there he is playing in a big time Elite level basketball and thats the third foul on Ryan Young that means lively becomes a player coming off the bench he gets in pounds hes going to keep Young on the floor thinking about so Lively back in Music hey I was coaching today very good yeah it was almost like they were listening to me Applause Music Applause Miami makes you play five on five they really do a great job with that defense that contested jumper wont go for Whitehead it bounces to filipowski thats rejected hell try again knocks it in size size and size that was the big concern that I spoke to Jimmy Lauren on the phone and before the game here today lets go down to Chris button and Dick its the same thing that coach leronega told me at halftime we knew that Dukes size was going to be an issue for us and there wasnt much we could do what he was proud of is the offensive effort and the tenacity to be able to match them bucket for bucket he said the second halfs going to come down whoever wins this one is whos ever able to take their defense to the next level Chris hes a rising star in this business Rising shes already there shes already there oh I would say Russias young you know yes doing a great job in all sports she loves tennis too husband was a husband was a great tennis player in Tennessee the lapowski just picked up his second foul before that it was Lively picking up his third so some foul trouble potentially in the front court for the Blue Devils only 90 seconds gone by in the second half theyre going to stay big ass and so they want to lose those guys wants it now he sets the screen and long instead gets Lively caught on a switch still drive it and kick it out all right and it sets up a wide open three thats connected on by Jordan Miller you know Miller gets the deuce right there this is an area where he has really improved Isaiah Wong has improved big time finding open people theres a tendency when youre a big time scorer like him youre a little frustrated not scoring exactly finishes cant teach that sir cant teach that you can work for him very long and I can work all day long we cant get over a telephone but sure Music put it all time Applause Poplar had a tough time but eventually the ball bounces to Jordan Miller and hes got 12 and were tied again Jordan Miller show we talked about earlier hes a hes a potential or ACC player came out of George Mason school that was so good for Jim laronega and he was so good for George Mason the Lebowski lost it on the spin Proctor finds it nice shot fake by Whitehead lost the dribble though its a tie up and a little extra something from Homer and the officials jump in to make sure it does not escalate beyond that its a hell ball the arrow belongs Applause to the Blue Devils I believe it does Applause the kid it was rated number one preseason coming out of high school Lively watching work on the glass now there he is at the top but he just bounced off that floor he just bounced off Mr Miller says well you get a deuce Lively but Im going to go down to three so threes better than two and you dont have to go to Harvard to figure that out and the arrow did belong to the canes so here is Wong three minutes gone by in the second half Miller has had the hot hand this time hell drive it and the reverse is good 14 for Jordan Miller hes been really impressive hes smooth on that drive he saw him shoot the three and Im gonna tell you an unsung hero right now for just Mitchell doing a great job and I say a while playing the big guy to check him Millers got eight in a row for the canes Proctor picks up his dribble hounded by pack Applause shoot a long three thats an air ball philipowski will save it back to Whitehead but the shot clock winding down hell try one Applause oh man youre talking about Hail Mary town and the roads out and three from Derek lighthead gives Duke the lead back Buddy Miller Thats rejected as Lively pinned it up against the glass Mitchell the other way oh welcome offensive foul they give long position in the charge I would say Mark Mitchell might be surprised as he picks up a second what what about Lively what about life and physicality baby be tough omir says Im dumb now watch this here oh unreal unreal blanket off that class Applause Music oh look at the shop like my Lively Lively is so alive to death of action and certainly brings him out of your seat you know its amazing here Miamis only committed two turnovers two turnovers just incredible unbelievable none of the last 19 minutes but actually keeps you the game and Juan has really struggled foreign overs for Duke and we have had five ties and 14 lead changes this is the definition of a back and forth game two little matchup Zone playing right now a little matching Zone interesting all of this for the canes as well with Wong only one point looking for his first basket and that is snatched away by philipowski he just cant score he was one free to get Syracuse as well the last two games has been struggle City for Superstar I mean despite these numbers

reputation both teams shooting very well from the threepoint land not even in the second half as much as the entire game the canes are seven of 11 from three and Duke eight of 15 I dont think the schedule of the witness game at least one so lets get going offensively Applause Muffler from the elbow no Lively the rebound but Legend really he really has kid has taken a lot of heat a lot of criticisms up people want instant gratification through such a Schoolboy sensation do you watch that kid next year hes going to be on discussion play hes got six points and six rebounds and he sets the screen here Proctor away from it he likes the screen to roll with a goal and throw the lobby because hes got the great bounce off the floor top lock at four Proctor caught on the Baseline grandison again lets not get the roll and nor Chad omear was able to haul in the rebound Applause trades with the left hand cant do it with some open looks for pass the perimeter good hands by Miller to knock away the pass roach was looking for Granderson in the corner and our big Monday ACC Big 12 doubleheader on ESPN an app begins in Blacksburg as duke takes on Virginia Tech at seven Eastern then well take it away go for chiante George and number 21 Baylor squaring off against Jalen Wilson and number two Kansas it will be a big Monday as were back in a moment Music well look at the combined record against Duke in North Carolina prior to his arrival 4 and 31 if they beat Duke today a 500 record since the arrival of Jim larenaga in Coral Gables back in 2011 2012 incredible his son by the wins a pro systems need consultants for years now hes with Ty Lou down there with the Clippers Jay laronega the lapowski muscles it up he just does something fun he knows them to take advantage of his ability he can step out and make threes he can go to box he is a special special talent the largest lead for either team Duke by six Applause pulling down hard as Poplar and hell be whistled for a traveling call Music Applause Music lead the third Miami turnover of the day Jimmy gooners bench one sideline its been a struggle City for Juan and he was the focus you know sitting down an analysts with Mr Shire he was the focus about them in terms of worrying about how theyre going to control him hes on the bench with one point of course he averages close to 17 a game whats the best way to control him get the coach up and take him out of the game Music the Lebowski in the post double up by Applause Music Proctor steps in for two thats short the word was on Wong by the way that he wasnt feeling a hundred percent this morning so maybe its just literally the ill effects of not being a hundred percent physically but he has not been himself today with the rejection stands his ground again Miller cant hit for three Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause and he did a great job good drive by Nigel pack to break up a 10nothing Duke run and keep this a sixpoint game 16 in the game for Nigel pack itll go away man theyre physical and tough and tenacious heres the British mentality its a little part of coaching as curl moved right there approach same shot made it away this time tell you is he important to this team youre seeing it right here today youve seen today the unbelievable value he brings to the Duke basketball team and they love it look at him jumping up and down oh thats 50 numbers 80s perfect scores on the sad future doctors lawyers Jeremy roach perfect five for five a blocked by Lively Miller on the recovery is middle of an offensive rebound and they didnt expect to get too many offensive rebounds it is so aggressive 16 from Miller and double figures for the 13th consecutive game for the canes Applause versatility not step good Edge double team a spin move by roach fouled on the floor its a sixpoint lead for Duke on top of Miami for the wooden award but nine points against Syracuse and again not feeling 100 today only one point no field goals and its tough to win Dick Vitale without him absolutely but its also tough to play at your best level when youre not feeling good so lets give them the benefit of the doubt maybe had a little problem also the shooters game Lively gathers got rejected but a foul called inside on the white head put back attempt this way they tried to throw that little live up on top to the bill ability of livelihood she meets him right up there wow more Chad OMeara with the block but then Bensley Joseph with his first foul thatll put Tariq Whitehead at the line tell you one thing in transfer portal has been good to Jim naronega Miami oh mere you think about patience and plus players she lost a lot less were talking about losing also a mortenberg the big guy he was a different kind of inside player than uh when you look at the mirror whos going to stretch the defense and again last season as you can see there are only nine division one teams that didnt have a player to enter the portal and Jim laronegas Keynes were one of them so obviously he sets up an atmosphere where once players arrive they dont want to leave the chemistry contingent Miller double team wide open Joseph in and out a tip followed by omir wont go Miller looking for the offensive rebound but eventually it was snatched away by Jacob brandison was supposed to match the big three in the first half Music Mitchell had his pocket picked by pack a blocked by Lively on the drive by Bensley Joseph and then pack couldnt hit Joseph the offensive rebound back left alone and thats a Dodge bullet for Duke well Applause Chucks got to make shots and Jimmy Johnson I think he has not really the game dont give up the field jug around dont turn the ball over Miss shot play defense youre gonna win thats a pretty good philosophy heres the shot and a miss for roach gets his own Miss leans in cant hit offensive rebound Lively that comes up short but to follow rolls off that eventually Nigel Packett comes up with the rebounds Music nice little cushion 10point lead back on the drive the reverse rejected by Lively Id say license to the real force of this game odd blocks for Duke Mitchell short omir pulls it down Chuck slush anything good shots here yes they needed that one badly and Nick Miller knocks another one down thats big as usual momentum nothing like the threepoint shot to give you that lift thats psychological lift oh wow what a psychological lift yes sir Mr Miller time and Duke will call a timeout Miller with 19 and again lets raise some money for kids battling cancer dick your Gala coming up again in May and youre raffling off some automobiles well the Dallas gonna be terrific I just got a text from Patrick Mcenroe his brothers gonna be so many people we honor but get this car man get a chance just go to vorg vital raffle 100 I win a silver Porsche come on man a Porsche well Im gonna run the dealer and buy one Music someone we return with todays game track brought to you by Sargento its been a relatively clean game Duke has moved the ball well they have the advantage on the glass but on the road down by five basically without Isaiah Wong Miami is hanging right in there hanging in a real tough but then come here to hang it here Jimmy her its not about moral victories man hes about winning and the you know douche gun team around the last we expected that but Dukes done a great job passing the ball to the type percentage shots and Wong back in ties up roach so well see if in the last eight minutes maybe Isaiah Wong can find it you know 19 assists on 23 goals its really terrific and dude hes done a great job passing the ball Duke is part of our ACC quadruple header next Sunday over on the ACC Network they will take on Georgia Tech in a game that will tip at three Eastern and here is Wong the other way for Miami under eight minutes to go oddpoint game long has philipowski on a switch thought about a step back three and gave it up Joseph tries a three filipowski working on his ninth double double of the season 13 points 13 rebounds for Kyle filipowski pretty good days boys getting the ball down the side with the left hand another offensive rebound drives again that wont go until youre earlier you cant win the game unless one gets him some point production so then early in the game 13 of the last 19 youre in the second half with omir on the reverse not going had come courtesy of Jordan Miller so omir and Wong what they have lacked on the offensive end Miller has done his best to pick up its amazing running down five omear has five points Wong has a single point and yet Miamis right in the game well theyve done a great job with the Miami controlling any kind of running game by Duke Proctor cant hit the three Jordan Miller the rebound whos not been able to get up and down and transition long for three theres his first bucket finally hit one man thats gonna make him feel good and look how big that is gets him down to a ghost Isaiah once had a terrific year hes had her own conference here talking about the great guards in the conference he has to be right in that group roach drives the Baseline thats it to go tough finish for Jeremy Rhodes in traffic hes got 14 certainly to training staff has to get a lot of credit getting him ready for the game whats that they dont win this game without Mr Roof I mean I wouldnt win Applause omir right at Lively jump hook no Miller the offensive rebound is he really multitalented timeout call by Miller lipowski had him trapped when Jimmy Lauren again was really raving about him on the phone with me 73 Bound for Miller to go along with 19 points and Miami down to one time out left with 5 38 remaining so Jim larenega in terms of at least when he can control a stoppage of things the crowd starts to get involved interesting to see how hell use that final timeout well Dickey said earlier that they cant win unless Isaiah Wong gets it going maybe this does get him going oh hes gonna feel so good hes gonna feel so good feels like a unbelievable thousand pounds off his back you gotta believe youre a big time scoring mentally to frustration that fills up by not being able to help your team take a look right there YouTubers last 14 take the common denominator thats one for seven man its almost like you were smart enough to go to Duke hey no no no I couldnt spell Duke and they gave me the G you know Anna you spelled with shoes and before I give anyone props for that big team and a home court to get a win here John Shire from being a club heartbreaking lost to lose this game after playing well now remember this Clemson they played well in the last five minutes they lost the game approach for those last five minutes they have him today Wong forces one theres a bad shot man shot the shot clock was winding down but it still had about five maybe six seconds on it so certainly plenty of time to unload the basketball and get a better look than that Applause Music roach out to Proctor hes got it tell you a roach what a distributor what is distributed we will open hes gonna find you every possession now getting bigger and bigger for Miami and zone defense has been a good Plus for them here in the second half shot across the lane omear an offensive rebound off of Walker Miss keeps it alive Wong for three yes welcome to those three but you know what you better run down there Confederate omir laying on the floor diving for the ball made that happen for his teammate foreign Music jumper wont go Jordan Miller has the rebound Applause honey Walker line drive three from the corner wont go Applause foreign Applause Applause Music Applause basketball games the Third on omear trademark commercials these teams for years hell get ahead of playing unbelievable physical intense basketball look at the hustle good hustle well this is whats the NFL this is the playoffs of the NFL matchup to watch Jaime Hawkins and Zulus to Bellas that will be one to watch top 11 matchup and funds Oscar in Kentucky are next year on ESPN Oscars got to continue to turn and face when he catches it down in the post and continue to crash that offensive glass got to stay out of foul trouble though today great day you got those shorts on the ESPN networks Bob underneath my trousers Music all right guys thanks very much finally we get the goodlooking by towel on television shes talking to the coach whos dancing back to Ramsey Smith the tennis coach dad was unbelievable and that Stan Smith and thats my soninlaw with the blue head Dugout Thomas Cruz play quarterback and not her name back with the Rob Palace no now hes got your grandsons playing tennis here and that was a judge you know brensons got a big match tomorrow Ryan young to the Baseline rolls off the rim and Isaiah Wong has come alive he grabs the rebound hes hit a couple of trees and he has a big reason why Miami is still in this game transition to a double team plus the foul he really is a big plus player what a positive force his coach was bragging about him to me saying you know hes player of the year he was Defensive Player to here as well in a Sunbelt conference look at him that is strong tough talk about tenacious the oldfashioned way of getting three Tyrese Proctor picked up the foul Chris button oh me or did not even grow up playing basketball grew up playing baseball in his home on Nicaragua and thats when he got discovered a car driving by said you need to start playing basketball he did for three weeks was able to join on a team and its changed the culture in his hometown little kids now playing Hoops because they watch him its amazing to see the influence this sport has had back home the first ever player from Nicaragua to attend a division one school on a basketball scholarship and back home he is certainly been a big influence again Chris Benson began his career as an athlete growing up playing baseball Music down in Miami I know right now Prime won 12 tonight would be rock and roll if Miami can get away miles chasing my guy miles its a great great place that brings all the celebrities have you been at Prime 112 Im waiting for you to take me well we have to go there yeah Miami with the foreign flavor as you can see they have five different four different countries represented on the roster besides the US certainly big in college sports last night the Memphis Tennessee tennis team did not have one player from the USA from all over the nation if you can play they can find you the foul was called on Jordan Miller his second but they also wanted to make sure Philippines took that little shot from omir and there was nothing there and it looks like they have Come Away with nothing off of that this will take a little peek at the time situation to make sure thats working so whether we havent even mentioned the referees theyve done a solid job guys get so maligned so many times huh I dont get a little touch there but then again we didnt feel it he looks okay right here youre giving Kyle the benefit of the doubt I dont we dont know we can actually say that the officials didnt its Oscar time he missed the Golden Gloves one point game two and a half to go Proctor goes it pack put the ball in roachs hand hes got it four to shoot 14 approach contested three Applause gave it up in mid Court stopped by roach and then a foul called it looks like on Miller I thought he had found that in three but again were down here I got one eye those guys got six sides for three to three reps Music thats Millers third Duke is two for their last 15 from the floor and that is allowed Miami to get back in it that was the same thing about Clemson game last five minutes they could not could not close it out Clemson made all the big plays but this time as you said earlier Bob really well hang up with lets pick up a double shoes and pick up is that Jeremy roach on the floor to Lebowski size advantage in the post to his left gets hammered and he will go to the line all those little poor fakes he has on the inside these I love the tricks of the trade for a young kid Jordan Millers fourth so hes picked up three fouls in the last two trips down the floor for Duke once you stop once you wont bring two face gonna go over the left shoulder it comes back the other way there he is right there it took about multitalented great impact freshman I said earlier Brandon Millers been the most impact freshman for the Crimson Tide down in Alabama and hes right behind him to me coming up next on ESPN we head to Rupp Arena Wade Taylor in Texas A M have won six in a row Oscar shibway Mr double double and Kentucky todays opponent its an SEC matchup at 2 pm Eastern as soon as were done here at Cameron well Kentucky certainly with that big win over Tennessee then they really struggled first half I think it was down like eight nine against uh Georgia second half they were safe Applause leading all freshmen in America with nine double doubles under two minutes to go muscles it up and hell go to the free throw line smart basketball and a mismatch down there in a post area and roach on him roach could not handle him had to follow him hes calling for the ball down in a post area look at the big guy he just come on give me the run give me the rock give me the Rocks this guy cant handle me come on man I got so much size and strength over here lucky theyre lucky he didnt convert and have another threepointersman at least made the previous the second foul on Jeremy Roach laying short but number one so la foul was a good foul good call because he was in position to score Applause reflection in so important just letting football special teams keep going no toast free throws man especially when you get down to winning time one of two at the line nine points for norchado Mir and its a twopoint game tomorrow Applause I actually wanted to have the ball late in the game Granderson thought about it three five to shoot hell drive it instead gets caught in the lane forces it up rolls it off the rim battlemirs got the rebound a chance for the Kings the tire Take the Lead certainly Bob needs to kind of shot you want in position it was a fourth shot here comes the Kevin Grayson trying to get the defense really pumped up this would be a heartbreaking launch for the young kids they lose on home to my end back double team drives it floats it cant score the rebound harems out to Miller back to the corner a three on the way that rolls off from Bensley Joseph another offensive rebound omir leans in thats too strong a lot of contact Baby Go Right Down the Line what a great effort on the inside theres good storm timeout Blue Devils with a close defensive stand to let those kids battle and battle the battle Applause Music you cant believe on the inside watch this right here what about saw here we go diving to the floor they slide three doesnt go down pick up the loose ball split the defense oh what strong are we going oh man fighting and playing with such pride and passion give me the college game man the pride and passion that kids play with is so you think it was so special Music throws the rest of the way each team has a timeout left the arrow belongs to Miami but Dukes got the ball and weve got about a 12 second differential between the shot clock and the game clock Music Im gonna tell you this I would put the ball on roachs hands initially the throne is someone like Proctor and to get it over there you watch the experienced player hes been there for moments like this it seems like their best possessions have been ball movement and then at some point with somewhere between 8 and 10 seconds left on the shot clock it gets back to Roach is exactly the element that John Shire told us they didnt have and missed so badly in the closing moments against Clemson the last five minutes so were now roach fully struggle lets see what Miami does defensively here Applause Applause s his hands but the hazard here looks in the corner time on that block roach runs the Baseline five to shoot phillipowski calls a foul foreign for Jordan Miller so the leading scorer for the Keynes in todays game hes got 19 he fouls out let me tell you this almost definitely a block now that was a block that was not a choice that was a blunt its bottom Lions of a situation if this game goes to overtime the loss of Miller is a big loss Music played really strong strong game and really good talking to his people AJ Casey The Freshman from Chicago played at Whitney Young will come on in place of the fifth year senior Jordan Miller who fouls out well they get some size seven and Casey and hes a young kid with a lot of skills that has a great upside Applause I mean youd have to go to Duke and figure out thats better than 20 a game rebounds double digits incredible and hes on the line Applause he has a beautiful strike really followed here the rotation and enthusias love it he is Big Man on Campus in many ways size and talent the bmoc and he makes it a twopossession game well the Poplar comes back in you know any fouls right here you know experience quickly and when John Cheyenne be working outside on Tuesday on brilliant player on the floor now hes on that side brings it up timeout the final one called by Miami with 153 to go Applause now its interesting without Jordan Miller he was their best offensive weapon in this game but Wong hits a couple of second half threes pack of course can hit a three are you thinking try three here to make it a one point game and maybe take Duke being able to foul you off the table later I mean how do you approach this well you can approaches if you get a quick quick score but Deuce then you bow trying to steal foul weve talked about that for years but the bottom line is better confirm you gotta Burton you gotta do it quickly I would imagine Packs gonna be the guy theyre going to put the ball in the hand hes explosive and if the threads there you shoot the three well Poplar can shoot the three obviously Pat can shoot the three and Wong who had one point at halftime hes only got seven in the game to this point but hes made two threes in the last half of this half as well so I mean he has come alive well you know we can talk about hes been a little bit ill but really I think we should talk about it we havent talked a whole lot of them Mitchell did a great job at the defensive his size a new thing bothered him a little bit here we go baby its been a good afternoon weve been a lot of fun great environment two quality teams thats the way these games normally go these teams are five and five against one another and their last 10 headtohead games last year Miami won here at Cameron by two and then Duke beat them in the ACC tournament by four theyll be the great two team person that was always special a team with Matt Gerald Gerald talking about theres one more their work listen here we go Applause to take away in a foul called on one and a roach on the floor roach on the floor I said to me the star of stars the reason Im gonna probably win this game is Mr Lynch his coming back has given a team such a psychological lift and hes also done an ability score here he is running out of Defense stop watch us right here and put them all loose hes on the floor gets it and gets fouled Jeremy roach dont tell me it is important it is not important having a catalyst and a legitimate Big Time Point corn and he is one the front end oh near the rebound pack has to hurry five seconds to go hell drive it lean in high off the glass he scores no timeouts for the caves three seconds remaining and Duke get it in can you do to Proctor and theres the quick foul with 23 to go see how the NBA he scored here you get a chance to take the ball at Mid Court option for the base Letterman Court theres a little more excitement into the whole package still a one and one kids should be playing and started in high school here he is standing on the court 23 seconds to the twopoint game here in Cameron Indoor Stadium and one of the elite powers for years in college basketball did this program weve said time and time again how special special hes been heres the chance for pack from midcourt needs it and they win it by two timeouts with a hunt for this situation okay exhausted all in timeouts Ill tell Jimmy Lauren X teams going to win a lot of games but a game like this did you do a big boost and theyre going to make sure theyre gonna make sure that crunch is healthy and he really played about 30 days and just a game you would expect between Miami and Duke a twopoint win for the Blue Devils stay tuned Texas A M and Kentucky is next for Chris button and Dick Bartel
