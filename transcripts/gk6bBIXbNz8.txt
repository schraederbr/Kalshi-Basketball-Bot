hear these teams play 14 days ago were ready to rock ball in the air Baba Miller and the noes and theyre all goals win the tip and Chandler Jackson starts for the seminal in place of green R in the seminal falling to Duke on Saturday nice feed inside immediately to cam Corin and a seminal strike first and corins been shooting almost 80 over his last seven games so no change there that was a great job getting position inside clell Harris Jaden Zachary Mason Madson Quinton post and Devin mcglockton Madson quick fire three bang oh baby Mason Madson doing exactly what hes been doing over the last couple of contests ripping the Nets from Beyond The Arc I mentioned Jackson starting in place of green C Jackson warley Watkins Corin and Applause Miller strong Drive in the finish the NOS immediately trying to get to the bucket inside well theyre attacking Quinton post and thats a pretty good idea the easiest way to defend a really good player is to get him on the bench with foul trouble but nice job that time to cut off the pass into the post talked about Florida State against Duke how about Jared the Kaine against the nolles on Saturday 35 points 8 threes those 35 points the most for a Duke freshman since Zion Williams how about Applause that great defense from Florida State Zachary better offense wow that was really good defense in Boston College you cannot pick up your dribble unless youve got some place to pass the ball the Eagles dodged a bullet that time Zachary the junr from Salem Wisconsin hes closing in on a th career points could happen here tonight in Tallahasse midrange Jay Jackson knocks it down using that big size and Big Frame to create the space would been talking about defense but the offense seems to be working pretty well for both teams here early I remember two weeks ago Florida State shot out of a cannon leading 162 in Chestnut Hill theyre going to call Goal tending on the drive from mlock and thats what you have to do against the semos theyre going to come and pressure you youve got to be able to attack back off the dribble and this is what mlon does and the ball hit the backboard Above the Rim and so you cant touch it after that I dont know that that was going to go in but by rule that is a goal T Dan what do you want to see from these clubs early on well what you what you want to see is you want to see him get some stops on the defensive end but right now both teams are just doing whatever they want on offense driving the ball to the basket for Boston College you have to protect the ball you cant turn it over and let Florida State get out and go and the seminal have to attack again because they dont have their best threepoint shooter they need to get to the free throw line and its nos team that leads the ACC in Tempo on the year nearly 72 possessions a game they have up ticked it a little bit even in conference play as Watkins knocks down the first free throw he has been a key no Darren Green Jr as we mentioned that changes the complex of how the Noles are going to have to attack a team that is last in the ACC in threepoint makes and percentage two for two at the line Watkins and the Nolls take a onepoint lead well nobodys missed yet hav missed the field goal havent missed a free throw kick to the corner another three and that was a great job by Boston College they were trying to take advantage of the mismatch inside getting the ball to post Chandler Jackson saw that dropped inside to help out against post and that left Madson wide open the transfer from ciny couple of seasons ago battled injury last year a career high 7 threes against Miami on Saturday as again Jackson knocks it down boy both of these teams are in fua what is going on come nobodys missed yet theres something to this familiarity Applause thing thats deflected will stay with BC talking to Earl Grant about playing Florida state twice in two weeks he mentioned it he said look yes theres an edge for a basketball team theres intent and theres purpose to this shoot around and to practice this week where we were looking forward to playing the nlls and we know what they want to do they want to take us out of our offense weve got to be able to go on1 and he called it just hooping by by playing him so recently you understand how they can use their length and quickness against Applause you and still nobodys missed as mlock and knocks down the corner three I dont know Ive ever seen this were almost to the First Media break and nobodys missed a shot here turnover something in the water in Tallahassee Millers three back iron first Miss of the game o board Watkins tries to bank it in no a third chance he sticks it in Watkins with not be denied of course Watkins leads the team in scoring and rebounding assists and steals thats a very poor job by Boston College blocking out that time gave him a couple of Applause opportunities deep jumper rattled in and out off the backboard knocked out of bounds post battling in there itll stay with the Applause Eagles thatll take us to our first immediate timeout the Nets are on fire fire at the talk early in this one how about Mason Madson from the corner and then mlon joining in on the party amazing thing about that is theyre playing so well on the road continue to find ways as play resumes you got to keep the ball movement against Florida State when you stand there and hold it that just allows them to tighten up their defense Zachary another three Boston College cant miss from the outside Okay so weve had each team miss a couple of shots but theyve gotten the rebound so there hasnt been a possession where the teams havent scored four threes for the eagles they hit 15 against Miami on Saturday the fourth most ever in Boston College program history Watkins trying to respond and does right back and here we go in Tallahasse neither team can be slowed down well Watkins in conference play actually shoots 34 from Beyond The Arc and were talking about the fact you got to keep the ball movement and that time Zachary had a lot of room and Watkins has a lot of room too and each team is trying to drive the ball into the middle the defenses may be overc committing just a just a Applause tack double figures in 11 straight contest for Florida State and again inside that was Zachary goal tending called for the second time on the Noles really good ball movement that time by Boston College he get the ball down the court you dont want to let Florida States defense get set and then again the ball hits the backboard Above the Rim thats a goal T Zachary has scored at least 10 points in five straight 11 against the canes on Saturday foul called Down Low Miller was jostling with claudell Harris on Harris the Junior from hanville Louisiana Boston College doing some switching and so that really creates you know Miller at 6 F 11 matched up against Harris inside thats really tough and they dont want Harris to pick up another foul quickly so Kellys going to come into G coring shot boxed by post okay thats the first possession where somebody hadnt scored make it two in a row were starting the streak a different one how about the job Earl Grant has done at Boston College his coach in the mid major level he talks about the sense of urgency picking up this time of year is nothing new to him hes trying to build his team so theyre playing their best in March and hes used to the fact where you have to win your tournament to go to the NCA now you take the job at Boston College because you hope you can get an at large bid and dont have to do that but hes his teams in a situation now where that is their option for getting into the NCA tournaments to get the automatic bid something he said that I really liked earlier in shoot around today was that we quadrant the season into rounds were in round three game five kind of like a boxing match Corin jumper rims out I think youre really comfortable for your Boston College with Corin shooting Applause that Florida state turns the Eagles over one of the best in the country at turning teams over count it and one for cam Corin in transition you know Zachary its almost impossible to get a charge anyway and in that kind of a situation where youre down down inside the restricted area on the fast break its impossible this is situation where I think post just doesnt do a good job keeping corn on his back excellent pass and Zachary just needs to get out of the way thats really good play by cor fourth team foul already on Boston College pouring the sophomore from Allen T Texas cant knock down the B his free Applause throw Dan mentioned how hot porn had been over his last nine games battle some injury this season for Florida State another turnover that lengthen athleticism and getting into the passing Lanes but then throwing it right back to the Eagles Madson intercepts nice job by Madson but post has to do a better job than being strong with the basketball Eagles beat that initial wave of pressure and Zachary leaves it short Zachary passed open passed up a wide open one and took it more difficult shot Zachary had 11 points against the nlls two weeks ago in chess Nut Hill protects the basketball at an elite level one of the best in the conference great defensively is now actually playing back near his home as Miller knocks it in Zachary played his Jo ball at Chipotle right down the road from tallah has a couple of seasons ago Welly that was miscommunication by Boston College there nobody picked up the guy driving to the basket thats always a bad Applause idea State takes the lead 19 18 approaching Midway through the first half post sha blocks a foul called on the drive Bob Miller is a guy who can drive the ball to the basket and Zachary hesitates he doesnt pick him up and by the time he tries to get in front its too late and then post he hadnt been very aggressive today but he was aggressive that time driving the ball to the Applause basket post knocks down the first free throw hes from the Netherlands hes Dutch and tomorrow nights mens basket match up right here on acc Network PJ Hall and Clemson taking on Tech at Mish Pavilion coverage begins at 7 Eastern D Styers Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets got a big win over the weekend against Applause Syracuse how about the Eagles trying to mix things up its a full court pressure trying to give Florida State some of their own medicine now like Florida State once the ball gets inbounds they just drop back they dont try to pressure you all the way up the Applause quarter Josh nickelberry in the game transfer from Lal warley to the rim how about the acrobatic layover for Jaylen warley well warley is a big guy and he does a nice job driving it to the basket not much of a threepoint shooter but if he can get to the goal hes very dangerous post is a threepoint shooter Miss 46 on the year had a great look Watkins nickelberry he tees up a triple leaves it short front IR post able to Coral well nickelberry really has not shot the three well in ACC play now two of 19 hero stad Bank not there that was Prince elig B hes in from mlon trying to give him a breather he made that again a tougher shot than I think it needed to be Taylor B Bowen highly rated recruit rims out rebound Madson boy nice job by Madson to block out and go get that one its a good match up here post able to convert on the smaller Watkins and hes fouled Med the Flor thatll take us to another break just showed you he can be and Dan with the way Florida State pressures the basketball right theyre denying passing lanes and trying to get up into you how does a player with post versatility at his size how does that change the game in the complexion well when Florida State switches everything that means eventually theres going to be a smaller player on post and he has to take advantage of that by putting himself in a position where he can catch the ball and then his teammates have to be strong enough with the ball that they can find Applause hes a great free throw shooter 79 on the year earlier this year against Harvard post had 20 points 19 rebounds five blocks two assists and a steal now Florida state with a little Zone press 221 they drop back into the manto man I dont think they were trying for a steal theyre just trying to make FL to state run some time off the clock Dany against post the Yale transfer shuffled his feet thats a nice job coming over to help out I think that was Kelly that got in the way there you know Gs had some tough luck you know he had that knee injury and missed the entire season last year and I think its could bother him a little bit he sort of drags that knee just slightly and Dan during summer workouts he reinjured that same KN and what it turned into a oneear rehab turned into two years plus was able to make his debut against Georgia earlier in December big size rim protector still trying to get comfortable playing college basketball in nearly two seasons foul on the floor as Ali Bay went down but we were just talking about switching creating mismatches and a league b that time got a switch and he was had a mismatch inside against nickelberry and thats just a really nice job by post to find him nickelberry moved Underneath Him league b sophomore from Minneapolis former fourstar who played with Chad hren and Jaylen sus in high school couple of NBA stars oh stay hot Jaden Zachary another three and Zachary comes in hes only shooting 33 from Beyond The Arc in ACC play but when you give him that much time hes going to shoot a higher percentage than that Five Points shy now of a thousand for his career gets into the passing l Lanes the defense reverse layup couldnt finish o Board second chance coming for the Eagles its Donald H now to Zachary against Watkins into the teeth of that defense hand picks it up shoots it not going to be there and now a foul going the other way the Eagles hitting the glass hard though against Florida State a lot of activity down on the boards well that was interesting the guy that made that happened for Florida state was Watkins he got back and he forced Zachary into a very tough shot and the result was Boston College doesnt get a score when they had a twoonone break and the seminal in their threegame losing streak have allowed Duke to rebound 46 of their misses UVA 31 and Virginia Tech 44 Watkins finger roll you know you just cannot Harris didnt block Watkins out and you just cant anytime youre close to Watkins whether hes your man or not you got to get a body on him heres steel armman Mighty this is a funny lineup in the game right at the moment for Boston Applause College Eagles lead by three on the drive not able to convert now Watkins a very little ball movement that time by Boston Applause College Jackson drives hangs hes fouled will go to the line for two but Jackson is big and strong and hes aggressive and hes had some really good games recently thats the second foul on Zachary and thats thats big because Zachary is he makes him go on both ends of the Court he controls the ball on offense and is the key guy one of the key guys on the defensive end Jackson knocks down that first two throw here are next Sundays ACC Network womens basketball games 19th ranked Notre Dame and Hannah hadalo take on the Boston College Eagles at noon Eastern then number eight Virginia take Liz kley hosting Carolina and at 530 Eastern number 6 NC State Isaiah James squaring off against Music Duke and one of the things that weve seen early the aggressiveness of Florida State taking the ball to the basket has really created some foul problems for Boston Applause College got a onepoint Advantage Harris was looking for Mighty youve got to move the ball from side to side youre not going to dribble it up and then automatically make one law pass on the inside thats not going to work is that where you force it to the wing and then the interior touch you have to move the defense around they lost bbo and in the corner for three he makes some pay they love this kid b b at top 75 recruit fourstar had his best game of the season against Boston College up in Chestnut Hill a couple of weeks ago thats only his third made threepointer in ACC play so youd prefer not to give anybody one thats that wide open but if youre going to do it gold Bowen seems like a candidate Harris the lean or no offensive rebounds Mighty has it poked away block shot Florida State one of the Leagues best in Rim protecting are these nolles they lead by two under eight to play Corin turning Banks it in count it and the foul that was some Play Because Mighty was right there Music defensively well Florida State leads by four camc cor and redot in ACC play a little gun show from his teammates as well mer mercedesbenz of South Charlottes Presidents Day event theyve outscored Boston College by 12 in the lane and this is Boston College missing the last shot after Florida States Music pressure Earl grunt talked about that game saying Dan that we had him right where we wanted him we outplayed him after that initial first 10 minutes of the game easy didnt shoot the ball well in that game from Beyond The Arc couldnt hit the threes here today theyre five of eight from Beyond The Arc and they protected the basketball well to start but five turnovers in that last media timeout for the last four minutes Florida States gotten seven points and gotten into transition well and thats why Florida state is on this 90 run you cannot turn the ball over against these Applause guys but it was a very odd lineup That Boston College was playing now they basically have their starters back in and you cant play your starters the entire game but that was a lineup that just wasnt a good ball handling lineup wasnt a good offensive lineup and Florida State thats what a good team does they took advantage of the fact and they really did a nice job against that BC lineup foul on Chandler Jackson teams fourth weve got Mason Matson back in there Claud Del Harris to nearly a turnover on the inbound Harris drops it for mton count it and the foul and thats the way you have to play against Florida State you cant be you cant be weak with the basketball and when they do tip it you got to go get it and thats what Harris did the balls tipped a couple of times and he just does a nice job drawing the defense and finding mlau that wasnt a great pass hard catch by mlon but hes able to score I think thats a really important offensive possession for Boston College and hes got seven points mton first in the ACC in conference games and field goal percentage thats a big and one there to call him the Seas well m glocka one of the most improved players this year in the Atlantic Coast Conference hes a guy that its hard to take him out of the lineup if youre Earl Grant because he helps you in so many ways one of those ways is on the glass he had 10 rebounds against the canes on Saturday five of them on the offensive blast and now the nolles who are in the bonus the foul called on Harris thats his second well Harris has two Zachary has two and that was a situation where Harris just needed to move his feet because the that arm shot out there by Jackson uh by excuse me by uh warley but Harris was the one who made the initial contact so thats why he got called for the foul orley will go to the line on the year hes 69 over his last eight games that numbers ticked up to 76 they been tweaking his his motion trying to figure out his release not a guy that has a lot of confidence shooting from Beyond The Arc theres a former consensus top 30 recruit warley but one of the elite perimeter defenders in the Atlantic Coast Conference he does a nice job getting the ball to the basket and handling the ball doesnt turn it over very much lots of assists splits the free throws one of two now Eagles can tie or take the lead with a three well now Donald hen Jr is in the game and hes the guy whos going to have some important minutes here with Harris up battle to knee injury as Manson found himself all alone inside the paint and he knocks it down tied at 31 yeah you just cant run away from a guy whos in the middle of the lane 3T from the basket adsons got eight points Jackson strips at the ACC logo and hell go to the line see if its a shooting foul or if theyll say its a one it is a shooting foul but again you see Florida State very aggressive driving the ball into the lane the fouls are really piling up on Boston College Zachary gets picked off in hand he doesnt move his feet and get over he just slaps down with the arm Jackson knocks down the first free throw Chandler Jackson hails from Memphis Tennessee was his birthday Applause yesterday one game in high school as he splits the free throws two national championships now keep in mind Zacharys in the ball game playing with two personal Applause fouls ball pressure from Florida State flying around and the NOS create the turnover well thats a bad pass the ball cant you cant throw a lob pass like that just gives Florida State too much time to come over and tip it and you see what happens after the turnover they go down and get an easy passet Jacksons got nine BC has six turnovers here in this first half a near seventh post able to recover heres hand Boston College has to settle down Florida State defense tries to discombobulate you madsons contested three doesnt go in transition Tom house cant connect but Matson thought he got foul on that rebound mson tries again leaves it short this Applause time well BC has cooled off and theyve turn started turning the ball over a little bit and thats a poor formula for the Eagles Jacksons had the hot hand in the first half his midrange J rims out pace is picked up Tempo Zachary cant finish hes fouled called on to house and jayen Zachary will go to the line for two its a bit of a dangerous play by Zachary because hes got a couple of personal fouls but again its just very difficult to take a charge in this day and age you have to have your defensive position established before the player who leaves before the player driving to the basket plants his foot before he leaves the floor and house did not get in position Zachary hits the first 85 from the charity stripe on the year heres our next gymnastics meet right here on acc now were the ESPN app next Sunday afternoon NC State squares off against pit and Fitzgerald Fieldhouse coverage beginning at 400 pm Applause Eastern and the seminal doing what they do theyre you know running guys in a lot they throw a lot of bodies at you and here now Zacharys out of the game so Zachary and Harris out of the game at the same time for Boston College and that Ro Grant has to do that they both have two personal fouls so very important minutes here now for hand and for Kelly a little zone defense well again you got you got guys in foul trouble and Florida state is a team that has really been wearing you out driving to the Bas Watkins triple knocks it down Watkins as we said hes a good threepoint shooter conference play shoots over 34 came to Florida State hoping that Leonard Hamiltons spread offense trying to get up and down the court would be a better fit than when he was at VCU foul down low that should put post at the free throw line for the one and one it will its the S7 team foul on the Noles jir Watkins has 12 Florida State leads by four mercedesbenz of South Charlottes Presidents Day event has arrived this is chance at the NBA and olds have been able to at least showcase that portion of it here this season even amidst the struggle H Hamilton said he reminds him of a Terren man in some ways nles former player now with the Clippers well Watkins is hes just very active on both ends of the court again nickelberry I think thats a little early for him to shoot a three in the possession post nice feed inside mcglockton fouled as he went up for it how about the two bigs connecting there post is a guy who can shoot the three and Florida state has really pressed out on him and hes done a nice job driving the ball past but its hard to get all the way to the basket against the seminal and Boston College has only made two field goals since the 1012 Mark over the last 7 minutes or so what have you noticed about whats made it challenging for the the Florida State Defense has really picked up and I think Zachary with those two first personal fouls has had to be careful and Harris picked up his second personal foul we talked about Florida States defense before the game and Boston College was able to neutralize it early by making shots but they havent been able to do that Florida state has been as disruptive as theyd like to be Florida State second in the ACC and forcing turnovers strong drive by warley good defense by Boston College they get the Applause stop you can see the seminal given post no room for that three see you cant do this against Florida State you cant stand there with the ball above your Applause head for state now will push after the Stop and the flush on the Al to B Bo it he can jump out the Applause gy when you shoot when you miss that badly as Kelly did thats almost like a turnover and Florida State takes advantage they get out and go what a drive there from the Baseline for hand and thats a basket that Boston College really needed Florida State taking advantage of the fact that BC starting guards are on the bench back to the manto man that threepointer by Watkins changed or Grants mind deonce green lost it on the way up rebound by po strong defense two possessions in a row for the Eagles and again on the drive from the Baseline hand has found something hand really does a nice job attacking the basket lonard Hamilton calls a timeout time outa and again its hard its hard to score going against him but as you say Donald hand has figured it out some really good drives onepoint game mercedesbenz of South red shirt freshman from Virginia Beach Tor his ACL last season was returning to the court here this year trying to figure things out had 16 points against Central Connecticut State athletic player better job that time by DC cutting penetration heing halim B Bowen trying to spin it around in Reverse foul calls on Boston College W that was a defensive Mistake by mlock Jamir Watkins had picked up his dribble he picks up the dribble youve got to put more pressure on him than that and because theres no pressure on the ball that allows B Bowen to go back door and it allows Watkins to see it thats two on post so two on post two on Zachary two on Applause Harris missing that first free throw Florida State six of 11 from the line here in the first half they have been a poor free thr shooting Team all season long one of the worst in the ACC dead last in the ACC in conference oh MOA knocks that one down well and Earl Grant doesnt really have any choice here hes got Harris in the game with two personal fouls you cant have Harris and Zachary and post out of the game all at the same Applause Music time mson got stuck long arm with the noes creates another turnover he drew the defense but then he wasnt able to get rid of the ball Jackson has nine swings it into the corner bbo and step back jumper from Beyond The Arc missed everything Manson transition triple count it Eagles lead late in the half again you take a bad shot its almost like a turnover you have to help your defense by playing efficiently on offense and Florida State didnt do it that time and for all their troubles and foul problems Boston College has the Applause lead entertaining high scoring first 20 minutes fun NE your Harris no matter what happens dont foul anybody warley nice spin move to a right hand the eagle did foul and warley made him pay hell go to the line and this is where Florida state has had success all night long hes driving the ball to the basket Donald Han Jr just I mean he allows himself to get turned around and really a nice spin by warley forcing mlock to come over and help Dan didnt even listen to you just completely ignored you well I said Harris shouldnt F and Harris didnt so its okay to ignore me everybody ignores I will never ignore you my friend warley free throw knocks it down warley now with eight points in the first half still plenty of time to get a final shot for BC you dont have to be in a hurry its lots of Applause time Corner triple count it oh baby claudell Harris now with one Jackson at Mid Court well how else was this half supposed to end a jumper hit from Beyond The Arc 4343 I I think they ruled that a two they did indeed rule it a two well get final clarification however Florida State BC both shooting well over 50 in the first half and its been a great game here so far after 20 minutes tied up 4343 here at the Donald L Tucker center now to the studio Justin Walters and Joel Music Barry what adjustments do each team have to make well I think Florida State needs to continue to attack because post has two fouls Harris has two fouls Zachary has two fouls and thats in Florida State they need to shoot the ball a little bit better from the free throw line only eight for 13 and Boston College needs to get Quinton post involved post only attempted two shots in the first half those at 21 12 against Florida State back on February 6th over in chest Nut Hill a lot of those coming in the second half so well see what adjustments coach Grant has made to try and get his best player of the Applause basketball so there you have the switch post has a smaller guy on him but Zachary turns over immediately Florida State you cant stand there holding the ball above your head against Florida State youve got to take it either pass it or dribble it somewhere going over the top to Miller double team comes tries to muscle it up pant staying with it Madson comes out of the scrum its knocked away out bounds itll be Eagles ball that is great pressure by Florida State because if madsons able to get his head up Harris was all alone down the court Dan you mentioned six of 11 for Boston College from Beyond The Arc thats 55 teams against Florida State are hitting 54 from Beyond The Arc over the last three contests and all three contests are ones that de sers drop three game losing ski for FSU after a hot January in which they won six games oh how about that from Harris again Florida States Defenders sort of leave him even though hes in the lane thats great use of the pivot foot by Harris and Harris is a scorer he only took three shots in the first half 15 points for Harris against Miami over the weekend Jackson can shoot the three and you see it there knocking it down from the corner Chandler Jackson has been a spark of offense for Florida State over the last five games now some pass by Applause Miller back and forth we go turnover wow careless from Harris Matson just not on the same page maybe took his eyes off the ball Harris really does a nice job he may he might have actually walked on that play I thought he maintained his pivot flip it looked there like he changed it doesnt matter two points count had eight first half points Watkins leading away with 12 Corin high low Jackson too strong down low but Jackson really has good size and strength and that time just too strong for Madson leard Hamilton Likens Chandler Jackson some similarities with former seminal great Trent Forest as post three from the corner back on again a contested three for post and this is where Boston College has got themselves into trouble against the seminal in the first half of this game and in the last game Florida state has had a couple of Spurs that put BC in a hole and then its just hard for the Eagles to recover a turnover forced by The Eagles the NS committed just three first half turnovers really protected the ball something they have not been doing in their losing streak heres Harris wear at number one kick to the wing is that a triple they going to give it Music two nice ball movement and I think thats a basket for Boston College desperately needed locked it now to double figures he can really light it up at times at 30 points in a game at Georgia Tech this year we have a loser at 67 and 230 lbs zone defense cor it sweet stroke from the Music midrange well you know you can play zone and theyre playing Zone because theyre worried about the dribble Drive which has really hurt them and youve got to be a little bit more aggressive than Applause that would have stay without Darren Green Jr here tonight still no Primo Spears for FSU as well Madson you cant leave him open got a little lucky back on Second Chance opportunity Harris he knocks down the three straight away bomb from claudell Harris and he was he was well removed from the threepoint line but nice ball movement Jackson to Corin hes fouled old stride for the alley thats good ball movement thats an open three youll take that every time and the long rebound all the NOS are clustered under the basket thats just a nice job by post to turn around and found the open shooter Oren knocks down the first threee throw was really thrown into the fire last year for FSU as a true freshman Leonard Hamilton saying so many injuries we didnt have much of a choice and Corin had to kind of be baptized by fire so to speak goes one of two from the line tipped out Zachary has Applause Music it Madson to post good ball movement Harris Madson in the corner the three rolls off the rim foul called on Florida State itll stay on this side of the floor Florida State by one back and forth in t we go mercedesbenz of South Charlottes Presidents Day event has arrived very aggressive when hes had the opportunity inside he has been able to produce hes done a nice job getting position and hes also done a nice job defensively against Quint post this time he has the steal hes the one who knocked the ball away and look whos running the court thats Cam Court drawn the foul got a couple assists and a steel as well like you mentioned well he already has nine points tonight you can see hes cooled off 78 and hes only four or six tonight but uh he has done he has done a really nice job and again hes been the guy who started for the most part on Quinton post they do a lot of switching but post he still has only attempted three field goals had made a three how do you get him more involved well I think got that a lot a lot of that depends on him hes got to move without the ball and find open opportunities you know again the senal do a lot of switching and he has to take advantage Aur gets Miller in the air pushes it out Harris three ball not there skims off the back iron Florida State trying to push it in transition and up the tempo its good job by BC to get back on defense he missed those long threes Watkins had Corin and Corin couldnt hang on and I dont think that was a bad pass either Corin I think was getting ready to dunk it before he caught Music it Hamilton talked about keeping his team positive during this three game losing streak Dan theyve been in every game theyve lost seems to be a stretch of four to five minutes a night where the opposing team finds an answer and the NS arent able to overcome Applause foul called on Harris and thats three its a big deal and he he took a wild shot and you just cant do that against Florida State hes one on Three hes off balance dont take the ball in there and if you do you have to jump stop and kick it back out I mean hes just off balance and he just reaches in and knocks the ball away from Miller thats a little bit of a frustration foul but that is a big deal Eagles in foul trouble turnover by Florida State Zachary all alone for three counted and thats thats whats bailed the Eagles out tonight thats their seven threepoint basket of the game and a nice job on defense we talked about Florida State converting turnovers into basket BC just did and I think they just called Zachary for a personal foul thats three on Zachary by the way congratulations to Jaden Zachary a th000 points now in his career will do it was Nick papic remember that name yes he just reached in Zachary did and you have to understand your importance to your team and thats a situation if the guys passing you just let him go Zachary with three Dan Harris with three three other eagles have two Watkins looking for his first points of the half and he hasnt thats a really good job by Florida State to find the mismatch with Watkins against Zachary knowing that Zachary has those three personal Applause fouls Chaz Kelly into the game for BC those long active hands of Florida State deflex it out of bounds stay with Boston College thats actually a break for BC Glock took that ball into a lot of traffic a near deflection again and it turns into a transition opportunity for Florida State off the turnover foul called is that on Kelly it is its first but Kelly really did not make much of a positive contribution in the first half and they I I mean Kellys a guy who has played very well for Boston College at times in the past hes been in a slump over the last few games now Doug sha is having a conversation with mton and Baba Miller thats 10 turnovers by the way for Boston College the average and thats just a bad you know you just cant throw the ball in bounds like that warley call for the offensive foul and again theyre attacking Zachary and I think thats a good idea but warley just lowered the shoulder thats not the new rule charge you know the new rule charge involves an Airborne shooter but he just turns and plants his chest right into him he hit him once and the officials ruled it incidental but then he hits him the second time that is like the textbook definition of displacement there three fouls now on Applause war now heres post mismatched inside against Jackson and they finally find it count that basket the Eagles Take the Lead first points for post here in the second half well he did a nice job getting position and then mlocked and passed it to him and Florida State still surrounded him though but thats a good tough play by post Boston College needs more of that hes got seven and four rebounds along with three assists now what stoppage of play pointing into the stance Jeffrey Anderson pointing at some fans call in security theyre going to have somebody remov Jeff Anderson is a guy you dont play around with but I did not see what happened but he pointed into the STS and Doug sha went and got a security guy Jeffrey Anderson is now telling the security guy theyre going to show him who they want remove I think thats whats happening youre on to something there and the security guy here is complicating matters hes taking his sweet time getting over Music Applause Applause there and they are removing somebody ball back to play Eagles by two big game for ACC standings here in Tallahassee tonight Watkins firing a three at the buzzer well thats his third three of the game and thats a big one and Boston College now is one of those situations where both of their starting guards much like in the first first half are out here in the second half an offensive foul call and again the shot clock running down and post just doesnt get out there fast enough you have to know the time on the shot clock and you have to get out on him faster because all he can do at that point Watkins is shoot the Applause three 12 straight games for jir Watkins in double figures averaging over 17 points per game in that span he has 17 Again here tonight strong drive and Miller would not be denied at the rack Madson trying to cool things down and he does thats a big basket for Boston College you just get the idea that with their starting guards on the bench the Eagles are just trying to hang on very similar to the first half my friend last nine shots weve seen of have gone in Combined for the both teams theres a turnover know just got tangled up with mlock and fell Music down Jackson back in Florida state has hit its last six field goal attempts from the floor Boston College has hit their last three full P pressure from Florida State now Florida State they pressure the ball in bounds and then they back off and toast is a guy who can handle the ball a little bit that helps relieve the pressure on the guard first time about two seconds to get the ball over the line Kelly midrange J step back no no he had a mismatch posted inside against nickelberry thats the time you have to recognize that in this match and you have to find your big guy and now Kelly compounds there by committing a foul foul on the floor from Kelly well the nolles and the Eagles meeting for the second time this season there are no secrets Miller converts Matson doing what he does to 50 points on their offensive end but they actually won one of those games so after you play the way the Cavaliers did yesterday against Virginia Tech you just want to get back on the court the tar Hills have had a week off Hs trying to go for the alley for the Baseline out of Bounce play couldnt convert got lucky to keep possession that has been the name of the game for FSU they have gotten inside and they have gotten calls as they get to the rim lot of free throws for the NS in this one 15 of them to be in sack that was a loose ball that you know I just dont think Boston College went after very hard Florida state did and then Watkins what a game hes have hes got 17 points hes made three threes hes got seven rebounds he has an assist he has a steal and which is very important because remember Darren Green junor is not playing tonight hes out with a shoulder injury and so Watkins has really picked up the pace from three I havent seen Primo Spears either was one of Florida States top options Off the Bench so the ns are doing this without two of their leading scores well Watkins are excuse me uh green of course has a shoulder injury we we dont know about Spears nobody said anything about an injury for him average 10 points per game for FSU the Georgetown transer who got his waiver cleared back in December Court ruled that the twotime transfer rule would be put on pause by the NCAA saw all across the country teams were able to get their two time transfers eligible at least for the time being but theres just another weak pass and thats a break for Boston College I mean these these really easy lobs that you throw way up in the air theyre not going to work against Florida State I know Quinton post is 6 11 but so is gainy and gainy hes an outstanding defensive player you may be a little hobbled with that knee but you just cant make passes like that against the sers post inside on the drive are they going to count it they are bending and Applause one well once again we see Quinton post gaining runs out on him to stop the threepoint attempt and post puts it down and goes by again the ball hits the backboard Above the Rim and so the officials are going to go and review this and its theyre going to review it theyre going to send the teams to the bench and they have to review this immediately this year the new rule about go tending is you have to make a call and then you can review it that was a quick review they said yes and most of the time you wait until the next TV time out but in this case you have to decide whether it is goal tending in which post gets which case post gets one shot or its not go tending in which case post gets two so that was a fast Im all in favor of fast reviews actually Im in favor of no reviews at all but fast reviews are better dont argue with you there post knocks down the free throat youre seeing him take some initiative here in the second half hes been a little bit more aggressive and I think hes got to be even more aggressive still much like the first game between these two this one has been tight throughout by with a lot more points here in round two B Bowen left alone his triple rims out rebound post thats number five on the evening looking to bring the ball up himself post Coast to Coast block shot by gy gy just did a great job holding his position Jackson transition three not going to have it Watkins offensive rebound tried to slip it down to gainy and Jackson ran into the basketball and deflected it out of bounds well that is a tough pass by Watkins throwing it into a lot of traffic you get the ball there its a lot easier easier sometimes to kick it out rather than try to pass it under wa the I mean these teams they just keep trading Applause shots BC 55 from the floor Florida State 58 Harris post and then a foul C they on the Eagles it was Alig B well and that you know and thats going to put Florida State on the line so theyre in the bonus with 10 minutes left to go in the game and that was just a silly foul Music by Florida state with only four personal files so lets see if they can take advantage they didnt really take great advantage in the first half when they got Boston College in some serious foul trouble they only outscored him by one from the free throw line B Bowen knocking down the first of two and want to remind you that tomorrow night after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week thats coverage you can only find in one place right here on acc Network that was a tough break for Boston College because post had a wide openen three and hell make a lot of those 6261 a ton of lead changes 20 of them in this basketball game 10 ties there another turnover from Boston College way too much dribbling by post I mean hes right next to the basket go for a short jump sh lle to nickelberry his three counted and the NOS really needed that from Josh nipple but hes now three for 21 on the SE on the ACC season but thats a big basket extends the lead to four Florida State six of 13 from Beyond The Arc 46 here tonight well above their season average now a turnover again BC getting sloppy with it warley recovering count it and Applause what two turnovers by Boston College in succession caused by over dribbling and so heres one of those Spurs that has caused problems for Boston College in their previous game against Florida State and tonight as well I mean just over dribbling and the league Bay hes hes very frustrated because hes been called for a bunch of fouls here with very little time in the second half hes got three fouls now the fourth eagle with three fouls a ton of foul trouble here for BC on the road and away from home you know you prepare for Florida State you say okay you got to put the ball down and you got to drive it past them because theyre going to take away what youre trying to do offensively well that thats true but when you you cant be playing around with the ball and when you have a a jump shot possibility you dont need to try to get it closer to the basket particularly if youre 7 ft tall like Quinton po see your point Dan BC 13 turnovers tonight they had been averaging 104 per game thats the best in program history of protecting the ball another turnover for the Eagles well and that was just a situ ation where mlin didnt do a good job holding his defender on his back Florida State on an 80 Run Travel called on the Freshman Florida state is going to be very aggressive and so if youre mton in position inside with a smaller guy on your back youve got to use your body aggressively to keep that guy behind you because if you dont Jacksons coming around to steal the ball and thats exactly what he did D you let off the game talking about how the ACC tournaments going to be key right for both of these two teams trying to get in the tournament the way Florida State plays it gives them a shot doesnt it to make a Deep Run oh absolutely it does and Florida State if they can win this game they keep themselves in position where they might be able to finish fourth in the lead a loss here really hurts Boston College chances and getting out of a two Tuesday game glockton might have got away with a little bit of a shove zacher cant convert ball knocked out of bounds last Touch by the Eagles and now what you see is the Florida State Defense starting to really push Boston College out of what anything that theyre trying to do a very very tough shot thats what weve seen here during this stretch turnovers and tough shots and thats not a good formula for Boston College talking to their coaching staff today asked him who else does what FSU does as Jackson Fades away cant convert Corin now to lley alyu flush Florida States on a tenno Applause run turnovers and offensive rebounds have really hurt Boston College during this stretch Harris and the Eagles desperately need a bucket havent had a point in over three and a half minutes Harris steps back his three back iron high in the air offensive rebound the flush rattles out of the rim another chance and that time Zachary does convert timeout taken by Earl Grant in Applause BC you dont have to look very far to find out why the game at the moment we have the score that we do Boston College turned it over three times in a row NS up seven a little over seven to play as Millers three Bo that got air and only air Im not sure that thats the shot Florida state was looking for with 15 seconds left on the shot clock on the Leonard Hamilton doesnt look like that was the shot he was looking for perpetually the same face for Leonard Hamilton one of the Legends in our game Florida State up seven here well go to immediate timeout Mercedes and Clemson and so I think that shows you how much balance there is in the ACC and so I think there are a lot of teams that could make it to get on a run in the tournament certainly Florida state is one Boston College could be another so Florida State if they get really hot theres a possibility they might even move up into the four spot but this is this game is extremely important particularly for Boston College if they want to climb out of that Tuesday bracket post down low turning off the glass and in good offense well it was and I think post got lucky right there Chandler Jackson was coming to try to steal the ball and post never saw him and he was just able to pick his dribble up before Jackson arrived but thats what BC needs to do Post has to be more involved and Zacharys back in the game and Harris is back in the game with it so theyre back to their starting lineup see if the Eagles can make a little run Miller hesi turn around Jay he was fouled and who got it I think they called that on post Music no was it 12 or 21 21 mlac okay thats better for BC its only a second and mcglockton I mean hes was even trying to block the shot I mean posted picked him up post was in front of him blocked him just hit him on the elbow thats one of those plays where you just get out of the Applause way Miller shooting 51 from the free throw line this season this is the first well now if youre Boston College you might have to make sure you block out does knock down the second Miller now with Five Points the Spaniard and the sophomore on some NBA draft boards some projections and its because of that size skill combo at 611 that he possesses 7165 and see post has to go toward that ball to give Zachary the opportunity to throw it to him haris had a clean look from three but its off to the Applause left Jackson triple thats a big shot that ties a career high for Chandler Jackson hes got 17 hes been really big in the absence of green I think this is almost a must score situation here for the Boston College theyre running out of time largest deficit of the game by either team foul called as post was working down low again theyre going to post and post has been aggressive this just a really nice job by Watkins to draw the defense and Madson cant recover in time the Jackson is now knocked down a couple from out Applause there post berries the first of two free throws and with all their foul trouble Boston College they need some stops thats not going to help the cause well its you you still have plenty of time but youve got to get stops on this end and youve got to score on the other half the Eagles just havent been able to defend without fouling as Miller will go back to the line but off the Miss free throw Boston College just a little slow getting back on defense and Florida State continues to be aggressive glockton now picked up his third personal fou five different Eagles have at least three fouls well youre in the last five minutes so thats not really a huge problem at the moment but Earl Grant he has had to work his way through some foul problems he had hes had to put some funny lineups in the game vice versa though Dan Florida state only has one player with three fouls its orley Miller splits the free throws what do you draw up here well I think you try to go to post at least run something through it mson quiet second half cant that was a good shot and warley blew the lay in oh theyre going to call a foul on the drive late whistle and Wy to the line Florida State again out very quickly I mean one of the problems when you shoot the ball quickly which Matson did it was a good shot but if that shot doesnt go in the basket that gives your opponent the opportunity to get out and go in Florida state did is matsons third foul War much improved free throw shooter in conference play knocks it down and this is tomorrow nights mens basketball matchup right here on acc Network PJ Hall in Clemson taking on Georgia teack Miles Kelly and mamish Pavilion a tough place to play for any ACC team this season coverage beginning at 7 Eastern just ask Duke in Carolina what its like to play at Mavish this season just asked Clemson how tough Georgia Tech can be theres an and one opportunity m Lo and forcing get inside Clemson already lost the Georgia Tech at home and now they got to go to Atlanta and this is a situation where Boston College taking a page out of the fora State book getting the ball up quickly and getting it to the goal I mean theres still plenty of time left in the game for Boston College but they again the formula is relatively simple easy to say hard to do you got to get stops on the defensive end and you have to convert on the offensive end missing free throws doesnt help thats a big Miss Miller head down the kick Watkins pump fake attacks throws it up that will fall and the Music foul Boston College again slow getting back in transition and you have to get out on Watkins because hes made some threes but you have to be under control and Watkins just goes right by well give jir Watkins the double double 21 points 10 rebounds his fifth double double of the year for Florida State second in ACC play other one is against Syracuse Florida State extends the lead to 12 but remember this score was tied at the half at 43 and so Florida state has continued their off offensive pace and Boston College has been unable to because of the Florida State Defense Miller had cor wide open and again corins hands he just hasnt been ready for a couple of these balls but again Ari what happens is Boston College misses and Florida State just beats them down the court its not complicated whats going on let me ask you this do you think the lack of offense at times here in the second half has affected the way BC plays defense well that if you struggle on offense that always affects your defense you know as a coach you would like to say that it doesnt no gets the flyby foul there again trying to put pressure on Boston College that is Baba Millers fourth foul but Boston College has had turnover problems theyve been forced to take tough shots and when you dont convert you just get discouraged its hard to play Applause defense front end of the one and one as the Eagles are in the bonus is converted by Quinton post the Boston College shot almost 60 from the field in the first half and theyre right down around 40 in this half so Florida state is turned up the defensive intensity but the seminal have been able to keep their offensive rhythm going still some time left immedi timeout lots of time left you feel like the eagles need a stop at a score Jackson thats not a stop tayor Jackson has been on fire here tonight he just cuts right through the defense and when you when youre saddled with fouls you get a little more cautious on the defensive end Zachary count it and Applause Music one a lot of whistles here in Tallahassee tonight a combined 40 fouls calls Jackson that time able to get to the rack hes done a great job driving the ball of the basket hes made a couple of Threes hes got a couple of steals and hes really kept the pressure on defensively against Boston College so he may have done something a little bit unexpected for Chandler Jackson but jir Watkins has done the expected for Florida State Watkins has been fabulous Chandler Jackson with 19 points you can see seven out of 10 from the field hes made a couple of Threes as I said hes got a couple of steals but jir Watkins hes got 22 so youve got ja with 19 Watkins with 22 and 10 rebounds a real team effort by Florida State so far jaylor Jackson Who celebrated a birthday earlier this week has a big offensive performance a new career high 19 for him as you saw there and the NS have just used a strong second half effort led by their swarming defense they lead by 10 and Boston College has missed some free throws here in the second half so now Florida State can afford to take their time you dont want to lose your forward momentum here but you dont need to do anything real fast Miller left alone for three off to the right rebound BC every possession now Applause critical Zachary right side of the floor right there you have the mismatch inside Al Bay crosscourt pass hands kick out aligue Bay drives Baseline Turning swatted Away trying to stick with it turnover number 15 on the night for Boston College just dribbled the ball into some trouble Applause there well Boston College in trouble now cuz the clock is definitely working against him theres 10 points down not a lot of possessions left in the game warley inside big block there from Applause post ball Stripped Away again another turnover thats the wrong place to throw the ball youre down there with Harris in the league Bay the guy you throw the ball to is Harris frustrating second half for Boston College who was on a two game win streak had knocked off Louisville and Miami backto back wins Florida state looks Prime to snap a threegame losing Applause skip free throw line for Watkins not there foul cols is that on Boston College underneath yes it Music was were here a league Bay dribbles the ball in and then turns around if youre dribbling against Florida State and you turn your back theyre going to come after the ball and then the second play a league Bay and thats not really on Him Zachary threw it to him in traffic and when youre down on a break in a league base one of the guys with the in haris is the other guy with you you find Harris timeout taken by Florida State and Boston College just hasnt been able to do the same to the seminal and it that first half nobody was stopping anybody each team was just playing really well on offense and in the second half the seminal have gotten some stops and Boston College hasnt gotten enough corer knocks down the first free throw to extend the lead Dan Boston College next goes to NC State and they got Virginia at home Florida State goes to Clemson and then has NC State back to we talked about it these are all big games those are games thatll be difficult games but each team is capable of winning all of those Applause games this a big this was a big effort for Florida State in the second half they do it without Darren Green Jr and Primo Spears nonetheless nice feed from Harris and the Finish inside there by Alig B that was a good assist by Harris but hes been relatively quiet tonight only seven points one minute remaining and Florida State in absolutely no hurry Applause now well Florida States going to get its second win in the month of February both coming against Boston College ironically thats the first Miss for Watkins from Beyond The Arc step back three rims out Watkins has a new career high in rebounds at 11 and Boston College backs off Florida States going to have to shoot the ball again unless they elect to just let the shot clock run Music out really good effort defensively by Florida state in the second half of course those 16 turnovers they shoot 56 from the floor corin will fire one off that wont go hand well put the finishing touches on this game two free points but in the end Florida State too tough here at home a strong second half and Florida State sweeps the season series against Boston College really good defensive effort in the second half and nice offense too for they puts 84 on the board want to thank Luke rodri Kirby C our entire crewp here in Tallahassee all the cameras at the Tucker Center Florida State 84 Boston College 76 pit Wake Forest up next Mike Monaco Randolph chis have fun my friends
