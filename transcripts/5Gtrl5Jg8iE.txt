itkins Applause will pass it off to Mitchell day who throws it out of bounds for a turnover Notre Dame running out the third combination of their lineup this year its with rper for the third straight game starting another four been starting all year with Tay Davis Shrewsberry guy and Alo look for Alo Shrewsberry and Davis all to be making up for B Be anounced they have bur out week to week as rer battles at the post and able to get the basket for Dartmouth very consistent since that Boston College game and who their starting five is they run with it again Cornish maybe their best player comes off the bench and Cornish does a great job right there mundon with a three a great skip for a three look for D to move the ball and look for open threes all over the court Cornish is fantastic leading score coming off the bench which changes an environment as you start a game you know leading score is still sitting over thereo drives in and its just too easy three straight possession three scores for Notre Dame to open this game a great start first 90 seconds here for coming off at big win against Syracuse to open ACC play first time the has started undefeated ACC play since the 1718 season Mitchell day from Beyond the AR he gets the hometown roll on the road another three I me just is going to find way to shoot as many threes and make as many as they can Davis looks for the roll to Shrewsberry Davis down low trying to work some acrobatics giant TS it out of bounds roer doing a great job here of just finding find a drive heres a looto here rer had the bucket after that one Alo

Syracuse feeling himself with this Jam Tay Davis just a great read looks fakes one way goes the other way finishes Right Above the Rim and it comes out with a little bit of pressure here little bit of one two two Zone pressure back to man just to speed D up here Davis spins off Mitchell day rer to the corner cant get it Mitchell Tay down with the Applause rebound H Haskins will shoot a three once he gets across half court cant connect there good rebound by joh get it out quick look at the here G on the roll L it underneath and keev J the captain for this Notre Dame team is going to get called for the foul on the push just an unlucky foul there for J but a good run I I think going to have to use their size Advantage here against Dartmouth whether its in transition or even Julia roer having an opportunity against mundon with a height Advantage posting him up scoring early hes posted up a couple times and had to help I think under Dames got a little bit of a height advantage that they can be able to utilize but theyve got to take advantage of make play Cornish into the game number 10 with it reran corners from the elbow spins it around Shrewsberry cor is wasting no time off the bench getting the shot up getting a good look Shrewsberry great sh goes Coast to Coast great drive by Bron Shrewsberry if hes going to knock down threes and be able to get to the basket and be able to score for another he continues to be a big time threat and thats what Notre Dame needs is to have that threat with Marcus B out week to week weve talked about who is going to step up for right now its Ben Shrewsberry Mitchell D no good on the three Darkness got a green light big green with a green light here continuing any open look theyre putting it up which keeps them in the game they could hit two or three threes I mean Dame will have to have a substantial lead to feel any kind of comfortable sh baring lose the ball tipped out and itll go with dness way Tay Davis starting his night off in a big fashion with a Slammer down the lane Irish up 116 into the First Media break coming in and theyve got multiple guys that can do it theyve got multiple guys that can create for those shots but no today

beat button why dont you after shoo around today hes talking about BR Shrewsberry Tay Davis mataka really have to make it up right now those three have 13 of Notre Dame 17 points so beginning to step up and for Coach Shrewsberry its how does that look if those three step up and Marcus Burton comes back and ACC play what could under Dame look like and what is that potential for them to be able to have that team and you look at it in a long season rather than just one game at a time and Coach sh really has that mentality coming from the NBA with the 82 Game season seeing what Brad Stevens and coach shuberry and everybody else built there he understands that long look at where its at and for right now tonight BR Shrewsberry Tay Davis and mataco have got to be able to answer that Mato answer the free throw right there look at that its almost like youre a broadcaster on Q on Q right there making his free throw you know I got to imagine Dartmouth is pretty familiar with matako after playing in Princeton and then being a grad transfer here they have seen him before just in a different Jersey thats one guy the Scout you already know the Scout for not too much say his name and the rest of its already built in mitel day from Beyond The Arc Daras getting some open looks they theyve got to knock them in theyve got to hit the open looks theyve made a lot of frees but theyre going to have to knock out some open looks nice drive ja is able to finish Alo kicks out to his fellow captain coach did talk a lot about matako and ji and their leadership the team voted on captains this year picking those two well see in shoot around to two different time matako a little bit of a quiet leader giant a little bit more of that vocal leader during war ups and stretches and during shoot around really play off each other well as what we saw earlier today agree and I think in shoot around he was there but being here earlier alako never stops talking hes just not the one leaping through hes out here talking chattering building relationships hes kind of the glue for the team as that grad leader sundra onto the court for the Irish with the Freshman Ford being asked to play some quality minutes and Burtons absence changing up the rotation someone thats also been asked to take out a larger load rer whos able to get his fourth point of the day great drive and finish not D scor in the paint of BU theres a three for dman Williams makes it automatic and it ends a scoring drought of 2 minutes and 30 seconds for the Big Green Ds coming back in a 32 Zone here oo how do they break this

sack quick in motion for dartman and this is rer going deep to the cylinder to be able to get it Roper starting for the third straight game continuously pushing himself forward along with Dartmouth hitting and connecting Beyond The Arc welcome back to South Bend Indiana we already touched upon malos tenure against Dartmouth and he finds a way to play pretty well against the pig green whenever hes squared off against them ERS last time he played him was just January so its not that long ago a lot of players on the court here remember 25 points five threepointers for matako last time he was out here playing against Dartmouth and the Princeton Jersey that time but the grad transfer has given a lot to coach Shys team with the team thats young to be a veteran leader out here playing and competing 3 to1 assist the turnover ratio takes care of the basketball leads the team makes a lot of great plays and great decisions now loo plus six right now in the plus minus in this contest and hes on the court get 32 Zone looking for some angles move the ball around outside some Cutters inside but dark moving well and staying wide here 5 Seconds Alo from deep and Notre Dame crashes the boards and it hurts them there as Jai Has It Go off of Music him turns the ball over what is that zone look giving fits they havent been able to penetrate it just that well and it gets a 32 youve got to attack the baseline or you got to attack the middle for Notre D its whether its on a cut or a drive theyve got to find a way to get moved around the outside quite a bit but theyre looking they just havent had that opportunity yet dark Clos those gaps quickly Williams off to has Haskins Elman row out of umson Applause Darkness shooting it a lot but theyre not shooting it great from three just yet here 25 for three here to start the Applause game upper left open for three as it spin Applause around El Monro underneath rer pokes it free Davis on a mismatch loo frustrated trying to get the

Christmas tree was that time of year good cut they missed Williams on the last cut starting the cut and moving well here Marth and one name a little bit late on that rotation with a great drive a great finish gets past that first Defender help Defender is a little bit late J brings his arm down you got to go straight up has a big fow coming across if youre not going to block that shot yous got to go straight up brings his arm down quick foul good finish by m only shooting 55 from the charity stripe just a three the old fashioned way theyre shooting 25 behind the line so Merle goes threepoint play old fashioned way Dartmouth again in this one two2 three quarter court press but theyve been falling back to man in Zips one across thir hasnt had a lot of trouble with it but theyre starting later in the shot clock after that zone sh Barry gets back to deflected pass heres Barry with a floater in the midrange that was an excellent shot Great Lift on the shot Shrewsberry is taking some good shots and making some big plays Applause Braden Shrewsberry really was a Beyond The Arc specialist last year in his freshman season this year really specialized on developing that floater in the twopoint range hitting 53 of his shots Monro in the twopoint range connects there nice catch and doing a great job Monroe doing an excellent job finishing inside had the hook shot earlier hit a three and now that little quick up on a roll dartman back in a 32 Zone theyre switching up quite a bit here defensively loo gives it to Shrewsberry Shrewsberry with a hand in his face hits one down it continues the knock down shots when he has the opportunity maral hes no good him up by seven trying to extend it to double digits nice pass constantini gets hacked at underneath theyll send us to a media timeout great great great low look pass mon Ro catch and finish great job of rolling not all the way to the rim but rather just short and then Shrewsberry knocking down shots he is confident right now he hit that floater hit the three hes hitting shots hes got a different feel to him on this one he gets a guy on his hip finds constan oi on underneath the basket hes got the guy on his hip has the pass right over the top Bren Shrewsberry making some great plays for another Dame being that creator that they need right now off the glass Kowski as long as they called it its okay on Wednesday night you can call a bank and its okay banks open its a midweek its not a weekend you can use the window if its there its effective GR transfer in from mouth cant use the window that time comes up short one for one on Banks and no for one not so uh may have to look into that Mitchell day stays with it high now Mitchell day absorbs contact trying to fight through the fouls called notter a Dartmouth fighting here in the first half only a matter of time you were going to bring out the mathematics with Dartmouth Im playing a little bit more of the analytics with Mitchell Dan connecting on the first free throw you Google SAT scores for dman individuals had a decent score to get in takes him both going to come back out for Music Applause pressure they trying to get the middle T Davis try to find spots at Angles doing a good job of rotating different guys heres the look Davis down low and thats what they were looking for the whole time under trying to get in the middle of that three 32 and David is doing a great job of being decisive making a play and getting to the rim T Davis playing really well here for another day eight points on the day four for five from the field thus far too strong of a throw but a foul will be called to keep it with the big green Jay Davis Jay Davis making great play the middle of that zone little pass fake gets mcro away from him then gets him a oneonone he takes advantage of it gets a shoulder into him and gets it off off the ri a great read with those two On The Backs side not sure who theyve got and be able to find a oneonone match up against the Applause Z passes off to Monro Im fighting hard on the switch Dame switching a little bit here against Ds pick and roll three seconds on the shot clock its going to be a shot clock violation on Dartmouth really good defense by another Dame theyre switching defensively and D is trying to post up when they get a guard on him hes and other guards have done a good job by know today just not getting them easy looks close to the paint Gman here again in that one two2 three4 court press falling back to Music man this time back to a 32 bounce pass Davis has it go off his foot kesn kicks out to aako moo sees a Applause lane now KES feeds it off to Davis Davis fouled will go to the line for the threepoint play great job theres the end of the shot clock it was only one in the shot clock when he took that but Tay Davis a great he got outside so he comes back with a pick and roll at the end of the shot clock find a look great shot fake again the pass fake on the last play the shot fake on this play t Davis just making great fundamental basketball plays and then having his eyes on the rib and finishing through contact tonight see if we can finish off the oldfashioned threepoint play here Davis has 10 points already thats going to give him his six straight game with double digits thats all have been in the absence of Burton Shrewsberry cant connect on the rebound they got got Music back Cornish whats the Cornish to get going here hes missed a few shots but he is there leading score drives in loses basketball and it goes off playing some pretty good defense Cornish is not in the Rhythm that he has been in for that overtime game against UIC few days ago hit the three with 26 seconds left in regulation they tie at 66 s overtime two teams only scored five points combined in the overtime period UIC walked away with the victory great cut Davis the ACC logo AO great find of Davis who sends it down again Tay Davis playing in the middle of that zone and finishing plays that one Above the Music Rim fler to Mitchell day and Mitchell day is fouled count the basket Dartmouth finally taking advantage of that pick and roll that switch coming across just late transition but Alo to Tay Davis on this end with the Finish again against that zone D Zone alaka with a great Drive Tay Davis with a great cut seals off that back Defender so he can go right up for that finish Davis and Notre Dame pushing forward really just its the three ball that they use to able to get them out in front it is and I think Notre both teams are trying to do what theyre able to do Notre Dame is just doing playing with their identity better than Dartmouth is right now but Dartmouth continuing to shoot threes continuing to get threepoint play there the oldfashioned way they continue to move forward best of they game L six for their the last seven field goals 50 seconds now on the game clock Lo trying to find something and is foul before and thats only dartmouths fifth foul of this first half its going to stay on the four no shots theyve been switching it up quite a bit you know zone is challenging out of a baseline out of bounds set just on who you got matched up depending on what kind of sets they have additionally on the other side you dont always work against the Zone on a baseline out of bounds Dartmouth comes out May locko passes it into Davis Davis sees an opening takes it absorbs contact another great drive by Davis he is confident right now that if he can get in two feet in the paint he can find a way to score it unflappable is Tay Davis 14 points here in the first half daroth looking to hold for the last shot Monroe oh floer up top left it early enough and an air ball that will end the first half no Dame up 3928 after the first half game with double figures since Burton has come out Davis averaging 166 points per game playing really strong for the Fighting Irish will start with the basketball in this second half Applause hunson cant hit it

rushing it being able to get to the rim get fouled get points on this possession if your coach youre looking for points every possession and just being effective Notre Dame open the game scoring on all three possessions to start the game you want to start the half again the way you start and finish Hales incredibly important being able to execute being able to be efficient L Dame looking to be able to do that here was able to go one for two from the Applause line Darth feels like is desperate need of a bucket row keeping it high Williams try to sneak in Monroe big man thought about it pass

matchups tonight hson cant get a little roller now Davis comes away with it great Hustle by rer loo spins it around out off to Shrewsberry t on the shot could have thought about a three drives in kicks out Shrewsberry from deep that was a deep three that was NBA Reigns by BR Shrewsberry confident great kick out by mataco continuing that three to one assist the turnover ratio another great play NBA range I think that is halfcourt range from shuberry its going to be a timeout from coach mlin and the Dartmouth being green bradden Shrewsberry downtown is hitting nothing but nylon on both sides of the Court page Becker Hannah doggo Olivia miles jorama Neel iy one of those great battles catch it tomorrow night 7 pm on ESPN it going to be a great game NE Ivy coming from the Memphis Grizzlies

three by Williams Dartmouth trying to chip away theyve got they got a ways to go but thats their chance to get back in it Alo bounce pass off to Davis the two have connected this time its Davis to Alo and Davis Returns the favor loo the 50490 guy from last season knocking down open threes Williams now has Cornish it off to morau and in the paint hes got some great touch inside when he runs that pick and roll he finds that space would be at the dots on most courts and then just that little quick up floater before getting into contact he wouldnt be able to finish in the paint right at the rib so he has that shot right before before the defender gets there does a great job alako another three why not two in a row b alako 10 points for him tonight Williams tried to match it nowo passes off to Music Davis rer extra with Burton out and has answered the call playing gritty defense and works himself down low trying to play gritty offense hell get called for the foul trying to contest the

mov out there but as we get back to basketball theres some players making some moves Tay Davis Braden Shrewsberry noted Dame effectively being able to play and as they look at ACC play theyve got to continue to rise and Rise the standard that theyre at for them as they get prepared for that with only a couple of games left before ACC play will be all in now ACC play really kicks off there Cornish

kick off on the 31st of December at Georgia Tech in Atlanta cor is more active defensively as well kesn nice move by kesan just rising up into the corner no good Williams is there to follow through

little bit as he turned that Music corner on R off the Cornish that a double team and pass it right into rpers hands not look by Corner probably got to bounce past that one his hands are up going a little more four round one trying to look in the post space it out with other four loo stays with it tried to get the offensive rebound and rer will be called for the foul as cornes was being pushed out of bounds it ends us to our final me round jumper or the little floater that he had earlier you dont to find ways to score in that middle game and being able to figure out how to score in the midrange and I think if he can be that complete player scoring at all three levels at The Rim in the midrange and at the three he becomes an incredible threat for Notre Dame as they head into conference play makes the first of his two free throws Applause thans some both its only a 12point game I mean Dartmouth needs a couple more stops and scores here they are in their one two2 three4 court press third a looking to be patient use up a bunch of the shot clock and then be able to knock in a shot right here Davis getss it down to constanton OA on the loose ball and R is going to be charged for the foul thats not a pass you would draw up at Camp fundamentals but it did get there Dartmouth big New England Centric upcoming schedule for them theyre going to take on the riverhawks of you a really strong team out of American East this year they look pretty good along with Vermont another good team American east and play that before they really get into conference play with pen wo his footing stays with the dribble bottom the shark block and a wedy arrow is going to stay with Notre Dame that Al loo just having such a good night is going to have the wedgie it is just sometimes just unlucky its a soft touch to be able to hit it right there uh end of the shot clock third a with a 22 shot clock reset here Baseline out of bounds possession arrow going for Dartmouth after the inbound and Davis fighting down low eight on the shot clock Davis trying to sneak one in Cornish comes away with it its going to be one on Three hes going to wait for numbers rotates it Williams has it deflected by ji great contest by ji great job being able to get out there and be able to block a three and extend his defense and now another Dame walks it up takes their time with the shot clock its a big stop for Notre Dame theyve got to be able to make those type of plays as Dartmouth is making a comeback here to be able to stop that seconds now on the shot clock T Davis have to go off the glass Cornish works by his Defender gets underneath rper and ji and now its a 10o point but now entire complexion of the game changes if you can sneak it into single digits if youre Dart and Ive got players like H Haskins and Corners that hits a lot of shots theyre over for 0 for nine between the two of them and so they continue to be able to be there cor has found ways to score other ways but 0 for nine from three they hit a few threes its different third a here again starting The Possession at 20 on the shot clock in the half court after the three4 court press trying to force a turnover in on a shot need something good here for you know today I thought about it 6 seconds Cornish goes to the floor kesn for three no good thats a great look that thats a great look he missed a great open look which happens Dartmouth looking to needs to score quick here and Williams is fouled and theyll wave off the shot theyll say he wasnt in motion lucky for him thats thats a tough foul you you could take a foul if youve got fouls to give on the ground but you want to make sure theyre not in their shooting motion Tay Davis gets beat here tries to take a foul before he gets in the shooting motion that was early enough darts in the bonus here though there you go in the bonus one and one makes the first massive right now big green on a 90 scoring R over the last four minutes misses it big rebound from Davis 129 and the intentional foul comes there with Williams D with only 14 fouls he got a couple to give theres always the question when youre that low whens the right time to foul and and and for Dartmouth youre looking to get a steal and if you happen to foul youve got something to give and so for right here youre looking to get a quick steal and they picked up their pressure Ben Brown for darmouth is going to come on the sophomore hasnt played many minutes today hes now on the court and Christensen trying to get their defensive team onto the court and now thats their 16 foul next foul will put Notre Dame into the one andone bonus Dart has been fouling on the catch pass into Imes and Cornish gets called for the foul and this is where a guy like Matt alako right here huddling everybody up his leadership being able to be there getting the guys getting everybody composed in a in a place of being able to knock in a a couple of free throws turn around and get a defensive stop if youre Notre D if youre Dartmouth quick conversation with Coach theyre looking to get up the floor really quick theyve got a bunch of Shooters on the floor some guys havt hit shots youre telling them right now the next ones going to go I need the next one to go for you free throw its that first necessary to put it to a 10point game 11 118 Applause left hson quickly up cant waste too much time in the midrange Cornish trying to get it down to Mitchell day has it tipped away and it will stay with a big green DLS had some had some good Baseline out of bound action with a lot of screens here look for them to try to get a screen to get somebody open here now Cornish trying to get it down to Mitchell Dave Davis works it away and now one minute left good defensive stand by Notre day I think he had Williams there on that screen out of the corner he couldnt quite get the ball to him in Rhythm and here on this Baseline out of bounds had a just quick right here he got Williams on that corner probably doesnt have a lot of space for a three but when youre down right now youre looking for anything thats a pretty good shot but cant quite get it to him good job by Notre Dame be able to trail that Defender not give a lot of room get a def flexion to steal hes makes the first sophomores able to go two for three shooting 66 on the season from the free throw line hes got more confidence the games gone on tonight Dartmouth with under a minute amson back out to Cornish Cornish steps into a three no good Davis going to come down with the quick foul by H Haskins and now with that rebound Tay Davis now puts himself into the double double 18 points 10 rebounds for t Davis really to show how good of a night he had and Tay Davis has had a great night on both ends of the floor being able to contest shots being able to finish hes finding driving angles so well at being able to use his body to get past Defenders finish through contact and be able to finish in space here looking to seal the game if if youre Mah Shrewsberry youre happy for what Tay Davis Mato and Bren Shrewsberry have stepped up done here tonight against a Derman team it has been dangerous being able to knock off Boston College earlier this year being able to beat an ACC team a capable team thin didnt shoot it great tonight but for Notre Dame theyve done a good job of putting him in tough spots not giving them good open looks and then only giving them one shot on each possession as I say that they get an offensive rebound and a foul will have free throw to come and for Notre Dame theyll have a little bit of a break with finals looming next week along with the college football playoff thats coming to South Bend against Indiana then theyll have a holiday break after the Le Moy game today on Georgia Tech in Atlanta and then ACC play starts quick and fast for Notre Dame going up against the big dogs in UNC and NC State question for you though I you Notre Dame rivalry with your brother big big theres a lot on the line here you know I love my brother but hes still a little brother all right so we got a nice little uh I say d say gentlemans bet called it so uh we will be able to uh compete but I still think th day has a really good shot of being able to get it done impressed impressed with how yous done though can catch Indiana Notre Dame next Friday at 8 ocl on ESPN in ABC part of the first round of the college football playoffs college game deck starting things off at 330 Notre Dame able to hold on a late Surge from Dartmouth to win 7765 say dve is such a good game he actually finished that game with one shoe so he had that good of a game in a double double but a great job by Notre Dame being able to play and execute the way they wanted to play tonight to be able to win this game finish off their nonconference play the big game on the 22 Notre Dame does and sends them into f
