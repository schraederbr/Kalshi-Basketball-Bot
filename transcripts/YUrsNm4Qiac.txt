until you have to adjust John Hansen and Cornell in red theem McLoud in Syracuse in white we are underway the 128th meeting between Cornell and Syracuse tips off our officials tonight Jeb Hartness Jeffrey Clark and Ted Valentine and the back door open for the first basket of the game Cooper Nord opens the Music scoring Music Applause inside McLoud double team tries to fight through it it draws the foul well thats the advantage for Syracuse at the very beginning as they have a huge Advantage inside with nahem McLean the 7 foot4 Jr one of the things Adrien ay told us yesterday is hes going to work to try to get him established early the other thing they have to do Jay is they got to get Judah minz going I would look for him play on some plays going downhill trying to get to the free throw line to get to the front of the rim Cloud one of two from the line and Cornell when youre trying to pull an upset against a team that is probably athletically better than you one think you could do is use your depth and Cornell leads the nation in bench points with 40 so this is the starting five but youll see up to 13 different players for the big red tonight one of the things to keep your eye on is who nem McLoud is guarding because they like to run a lot of five out and nem likes to stay in the paint if they can pull him out of the paint itll open up some driving lanes for him the cloud right on Q an offensive rebound kick out t a three missed Music it Hanson number 20 he can shoot the three so great passing team for Cornell that leads to an open three and DJ Nicks knocks it down 59 of their baskets are assisted theyre very good at passing and cutting they dont play off the bound so much Bell pull up pop and he drains it from Deep Well Bell playing off that ball screen action with McLoud and you know McLoud is a roller so he occupies a lot of space when he rolls to the Applause rim eight games in to Adrian on As tenure as head coach Debbie whats different about a coach ay team than a coach Jim ban team that youve noticed well you got to start with the defense first right I mean its not the matchup Zone that coach beheim played all the time and this is more of a mantoman team they will throw some situational Zone in though but thats the one thing theyre more aggressive on the ball attacking on their defensive end because they play up the line and more aggressively but that happens with a shot blocker back of the row too now this Cornell team is not shy they score 85 points a game theyll let it fly quickly that one rattles in and out no good see and you wont see that size in the ivy league but thats a good play right there off two feet by gray to kick it back out to an open shooter otherwise the Clouds going to block that all the way up ahead that great hustle from Bell the to get back denies Applause Music Nord inside McLoud thats for Syracuse has the most physical advantage and M Strokes home the three Jud to Min when hes on Syracuse is usually on yeah he does a good job of rejecting the screen he had enough space to get into the rhythm of his jump shot what a great start for Mintz after five points and thats lost to Virginia number 2 and with Cornell youll get what looks closer to a hockey line change tonight again one of the deepest teams in the country their bench gives them on average 40 points a game that allows you to keep the pressure up on both ends right this is a hardworking team on both ends of the floor they cut hard they space the floor well and they play full court defense here shes started cold just one of five from the floor but the orange on a 6 nothing run right now M from the corner got it again Judah minz red hot to start this rivalry game Cornell likes to run this pistol action Jay in their transition as the first option this is a match up inside they have they had a big on little and they kicked it back out for three so you can still play to the inside even though you have a lack of a size Advantage you can set up your threepoint shooting that way theyve done that twice big three from nazer Williams after Crause went on a nine nothing thats guy Raglin working that week Side Glass against McLoud another open three that one misfires from Applause boothby both teams very comfortable playing this Music pace we see some Zone cor now mixing it up a little bit Cornell got a hot start but then Syracuse has stormed Med back the orange using a N9 nothing run and theyre up as coach against the big red its 42 straight wins for Syracuse probably the coolest was in the dome in 2019 the battle of the beheim Jimmy playing for Cornell before he would join buddy at Syracuse Jimmy put 20 on his brother and his dad that night weve got Jim beheim as a new member of ESPN and the ACC Network youll hear from the Hall of Famer coming up at halftime and hes got to be proud with what his program has done in this geographical rival against Cornell Debbie well its pretty cool that you always play the guys in the neighborhood right I always love that about the big boys playing the smaller guys and uh coach beheim never turned down playing Colgate or playing Cornell or other teams in the area so its good for the region for hoops Music Cornell looking for their first win against the orange since 1968 Taylor a good look nothing but the bottom of the net for Justin Taylor I love situational offense and that atto after time out was designed to get that shot for Applause Taylor Syracuse has started this game four of six from three and three different players have already made a triple they dont have any twopoint baskets yet everything is outside the arc plus a free throw with this smaller lineup on the floor for Cornell and a smaller lineup up on the floor without McLoud for Syracuse youre going to see the tempo pick up for both sides I would look for some fullcourt pressure right here from Cornell after a make or a miss and as much as weve talked about z uh manto man Syracuse likes to play Zone on their Baseline out of bounds Place get shot clock under Applause five really good defensive possession for Syracuse cant get the rebound though a travel gives the ball back to the orange two here comes that full court picking up manto man they will run and jump when its available sometimes it looks like a Run and Jump sometimes it looks like a run and Applause Music trap Starling lost the handle Nair Williams Cornell likes the run in transition right to the rim for an easy two Nazir Williams Music really good defensive habits here by Cornell High hands on the catch keeping the ball out of the middle taking Syracuse deeper into the shot clock mince got caught up in the air Applause great hustle from quader copelan to battle for that ball keeps possession with the Applause orange ak ak Starling right into contact no problem for the transfer from Notre Dame really good no call good job getting into the chest of the defender finishing off the Applause glass copelan digs it out again hes had a nice couple hustle plays in this game and draw the foul clader Copeland Jays its interesting Im watching Cornell and they are crashing the offensive glass theyre even with Syracuse in that category early I was wondering if they would be concerned about getting back in transition for Team Speed reasons but theyd rather crash the glass and theyre theyre hanging in there on the boards Kyle cuff the transfer from Kansas zero and white is checked into the game for Syracuse we talked a lot about Cornells depth and bench production Syracuse would like to get a little more from their Music bench GIS manah and Spins his way in cleaning up the spill Isaiah gray the senior from Brooklyn thats what Im talking about I mean theyre getting to the boards and this Cornell team can get off the bounce in pain look how disruptive they are right here comes up with a Applause Music turnover double team comes in ripped Applause away whistle before that mince three both of these teams running in transition a good Tempo between already wearing his orange on the recruiting Trail bet hes digging in that portal too weve got a good one here as cop lines up with three it was halfway down but rims Applause out SC now just two of nine from three theyve had a lot more success going inside like that to Cooper noord Debbie I love that Brian Earl atto that time coming off the timeout knowing the Syracuse is going to pick up their pressure up the line and you go back door with a great Music feed that one does drop for Copeland whos been active in this first half now a sophomore part of that star studded Freshman Class A year ago for the Orange is right on Q grabs another rebound thats a couple of times that Manon has been able to take his guy into the paint and try to score over a smaller Defender Cornell draws the offensive foul going the other way so Copeland the last three possessions being aggressive he has the ATO and shoots a three and misses then he scores this time he draws a foul Cornell done a nice job getting to the rim cant finish that one and a frustration foul follows Music Min on the bench Music so darling is running the point and theyre just not the same team Syracuse with Judah minz out of the game Debbie he makes things flow tick just smooth the rhythm of the offense and when hes sitting on the bench theyre just not the same no he can make everybody else better because he can go places with a basketball that he wants to go its hard to stop him from going where he wants Bell tried to swipe it away shot clock under 10 big red have to hurry Chris Manning in attack mode Fades away cant knock it Applause down I think that shots too quick I mean one pass and transition this is the tempo that Cornell wants to play at theyre the team that is quick on the trigger usually averaging 85 and a half points per game as we remind you tomorrow night a great double header right here on acc Network Wake Forest looks to make it three in a row as they host Ruckers at six and then how about Clemson undefeated tigers at a rivalry game against South Carolina at 8 that should be a good one South Carolina and Clemson this is the latest they have played in season where they both have met as undefeated teams ever should be a good one good rivalry Little John Coliseum will be rocking for that one tomorrow dont miss it right here on acc Network just Taylors had the hot hand in this first half thats his second Applause Music Applause three Malik Brown poked it away Kyle C lays it up and in for now just moving way too fast right now its allowed Syracuse to find a rhythm in transition Taylor missed it that Applause time go inside Raglin hammers it home and Cornell needed that theyd gone scoreless for 2 and A2 Applause Music minutes Taylor nice job getting to the rim he sets up his ability to drive with his threepoint shooting deep three nothing but Applause Music air up ahead gray I love it J yeah theyre just running and gunning Debbie I mean lets go been a long time up and down without a stoppage its where your dep comes Music in Cornell up the court taking it right to the effort on the defensive end to speed you up I mean this is a a really good Rhythm passing cut catch and shoot team stay down K stay down good to see Jud Min shake that off you mentioned that when he sat even for those few minutes Syracuse just doesnt look like the same team out of rhythm Music offensively Bell clean look and he is money from the corner Chris Bell barries another one got excellent footwork in the corner for a corner Music three Cornell trying to answer the shooting struggles continue for the big red theyve missed nine of their last 10 from Beyond The Applause Music Arc one minz can turn a corner and he is ninth in the nation and free throw makes he gets to the line so often the foul would be a shooting foul so hes going to the line and the one thing that mins will need to improve certainly for conference play is a game like he suffered against Virginia where you are numbers one two and three on The Scouting Report and youre held to Five Points obviously Tony Bennetts defense is built a little differently but MCE is going to take everybodys best shot all season long theres no question about it I mean you play him as a driver first and you live with a couple of Threes And if he can make a couple of Threes then you adjust but you dont want her to turn a corner and get in the paint on you la on 14 to four run left the hook finally drops ran Hansen first basket of the night for the big red leading scorer mince in attack mode again into the lane top take gets it to go Judah Mintz starting to take over he is so good in the middle third of the floor Applause the McLoud and its the largest lead of the night for Applause Syracuse and it is all orange right now Taylor oh Cloud tried to follow it up and could Applause and a foul slows down this electric Pace In transition off their D it looks like the floor is tilted and then you throw it up and its a drop in the bucket for McLoud I mean he barely has to jump to catch this one Above the Rim and finish it number two Sunday afternoon womens basketball double header right here on acc Network Duke gets things started noon Eastern hosting Florida GF coast and then a rivalry game at two Kentucky and Louisville thats this Sunday on acc Network Florida Gulf Coast is a team picked to win their conference they shoot a lot of Threes thatll be an entertaining game against the Duke defense and Louisville dont count Jeff walls team out n number 18 they are picked to finish third or fourth in the ACC I think its a wide open race on the womens side Bell from the same spot this time cant connect hes in two from there earlier tonight hon lines up with three missed it Cornell cannot bu one from Deep they are two of 15 in this game theyve took theyve taken a couple of hurried threes but otherwise they have had good shots good attempts finally one goes Cooper Nord buries it much needed for the big red here comes that full court pressure off the May Basket they want to keep this Tempo high they want to keep utilizing their Music depth the challenge with defending Syracuse full court is Judah mint can see the floor so well it opens up the court to him and he is a really good straight line driver in transition give go g rejected at The Applause Rim batted around in the big red will settle it down for now but this has been run and Gun this entire first half very few whistles in this game maybe a timeout for fatigue its a critical three minutes coming up for Music Cornell when youre greatorg and make any donation anything that you do will help research and we need it youll help make somebodys life Music better heres Judah Mintz hes been the bright spot this first half as he usually is for the Syracuse team Juda menz is so tough on a close out like if youre half a second late or your angle isnt right he is thinking get to the rim get to the paint and hes so aggressive he doesnt dribble the ball he pounds it to the Applause rim hes really good at getting to the foul line as well hey he is ninth nationally nationally in free throws made hes three for three so far tonight he just puts so much pressure on your second level he can get by any primary Defender but once he gets inside to the interior he can put a lot of fouls on your big guys the back doors been open all night for Cornell missed opportunity there Isaiah gray had a step this full court pressure has not phased Jud to minz Cornell had a little success when he was out of the game turning Syracuse over but hes been a heady stti Steady Hand to the back court for the orange I think theres multiple uses of the pressure not just to turn you over but to take you a little bit deeper into the shot clock maybe take you into your third or fourth option Debbie of your Cornell trailing by 9 2 minutes until halftime what do you want to accomplish to close out this first half well I want to keep it to two or three possessions thats for sure but I think you got to feel like the shots are going to fall and the percentages are going to come back your way I mean they have not shot it well L trying to change that too much on it no good it stays Cornells Music way Nord has made the most threes coming into the game for Corell at 22 hes their Music shooter its pretty amazing that Cornell has shot so poorly from three three of 18 in this first half and yet only Trail by nine I think you got to feel good if youre a Brian Earl for that matter cuz like I said I think the percentages come back your way you got to believe youre going to make some threes its not always how many you make its when you make them playing that zone you know theyre going to trap that short Music Corner good play out of that short Corner trap 28 and Booth being the best threepoint shooter on the team 46 from three on the season makes his first of the night just like that two possession game with a little more than a minute left in this first half Starling shoots over a double team cant connect Tapped Out MCE was calling for it too come here come come here come here come here hey hey here Music up Syracuse way Brian erling Corell disagree brown lost the handle swiped Away by Cooper Nord passing cut right here wide open three boot beat too much on it offensive rebound Falls right to Gray hes swatted from behind Malik Brown the Music rejection Isaiah gray tries to play off two feet shows a pump fake from behind as the block all he had to do is Pivot to two threepoint shooters that single point well turn turnovers are even at eight a piece Cornell is plus two on the glass they have outscored Syracuses bench 12 to four Nord CS the lead in half Cooper Nord and its a onep possession game Cornell on an 111 run to shrink what was a 13point lead down to three 10 seconds left in the half mince needs to keep it right here step back three missed it Nord Hees it Corell closes that first half furiously and 11 were three possessions and you know you didnt shoot it well so you know you can be in this game and theyve proven that so far it was just a few years ago that Jimmy beheim was playing for Cornell and Buddy beheim was playing for Syracuse with the Hall of Famer Jim on the sidelines that was Cornells best shot to upset the orange Jimmy had 20 that night Syracuse has dominated this geographical rivalry theyve won 42 straight Cornells last win 1968 Jude de minz starts to scoring in the second half and restores a fivepoint lead DJ Nicks answers right back Cornell unafraid in this second half not surprised that mince gets the first possession for Syracuse and then on the other side Nicks hit the first triple of the game for the Cornell JJ Starling right to the rim and this backourt Duo has come alive for the orange I think youre going to see Syracuse put the ball on the floor and get inside and on the other side its going to be threes for Cornell now you got to make sure you run him off the threepoint line Applause Music 29 it you got to go inside the McLoud while hes posting up that that strong 7 four cleared the runway for an easy Chris Bal layup strong start to this second half for Syracuse after Cornell ended the First on an 111 run three baskets in the paint at the front of the rim Hansen cant connect offensive rebound kept alive Cornell actually won the rebounding margin in the first half they move the ball so well look at the spacing man and fouled on his way to the rim JJ Starling tagged with it I think if youre Brian Earl you have to be pleased with not only the way your team ended the game but the way theyve started here in the second half and you know you have a chance in this game if you stay aggressive now you got to really concentrate on the defensive end and keeping them out of the paint you can see thats the change in the adjustment by Adrien Atrius put the ball in the bounce and get Applause Applause inside Syracuse has taken a different approach in this second half offensively theyre three for three on three straight layups theyre getting right to the rim not settling for outside shots Debbie thats right thats the adjustment here comes the full court press J breaks it well Bell lines up a three and cashes Chris Bell is their best threepoint shooter and a catch and shoot in a corner in transition he is money watch how they break the Press advance past the basketball and its mince that sets up Bell for that extra half second because he gets in the Gap and puts it right in the pocket its a beautiful feed by mince he makes everybody better he makes the game easier for his teammates rebound foul call Rebound is a double figure scorer for them and he has not had a basket yet hes only had free Music throws Manon and Hansen both were held scoreless in the first 10 minutes of this game it allowed Syracuse to balloon the lead all the way to 13 now cut to just a twopossession game darling he has struggled since transferring from Notre Dame to shoot the ball from outside just three of 22 from three to start the Syracuse tenure he wasnt known as a threepoint shooter anyway and he has worked to improve that part of his game but Judah minz has gotten really better at that part and there you see him with a big time Applause block Syracuse continues to push it in transition to no avail there both of these teams comfortable running and gunning we saw a hot Tempo in the first half and that has continued B so reliable when that that shot is going he gives Syracuse a different Applause dimension lawren continuing to push Justin Taylor that time and theyre up by 11 in theory four Corell they believe their depth is going to be a factor in the last 5 minutes of the game when they hope that they wear you down with all this pressure in this full court Applause play Corell needed that Cooper n Music delivers tell you what I is gray does a good job on defense moves his feet he is very physical at the point of contact and Mintz hits another trip and the immediate answer from JW de minz as Chris mannon spins his way in if you can keep men from Catching the ball once he gives it up and man got that assignment in stays with it draws the foul due to Min starting to take over six at ACC PM in Mark Packers house Im going back in a few weeks its fun in there they got a lot of good stuff going on in that basement around show a rankings like Packer does where he ranks the teams every week I love looking at those I got to hang out in there and and uh his dog was in there so that was fun Taylor was there Syracuse back up by comfortable cushion as I say it Ragin knocks down a three for Cornell the big red wont go away continue to punch back I mean this is a well prepared basketball team that understands what they need to do and and one is keeping Syracuse out of the paint which is a challenge as you can see they are so good on a straight line drive so quick and Music Applause athletic right to the rim its too easy e a k the sophomore from California slams it home and its a twopossession game once again a miscommunication on defense when he turns the corner he sees a wide open Lane B off the catch missfires Cornell has made four in a row here come the big red with momentum once again in this game game a geographical rivalry where theyve lost 42 straight but they are not backing down tonight to the Dome Raglin trying to muscle his way in called for a travel Malik Brown did a really good job of holding his ground building a wall not letting rag Raglin bully his way to the Music rim Music Syracuse really doing a good job moving the ball everyone gets a touch thats a rhy a rhythm three because they move the ball side the side and they get a great look Judah in up to 21 to lead all scorers tonight last time he took the court here at the Dome he scored 33 against LSU struggled over the weekend in the lost to Virginia but he is right back to that career best form he showed in the ACC SEC challenge hes explosive hes Dynamic hes got a multiple weapon package to score at all three levels and hes really hard to keep in Applause front Raglin does a really nice job there Jay of playing the low man game right he he knows that Malik Brown is all up closing the cushion and he swipes it through and draws a foul Music Adrien ay first your head coach for Syracuse was highly complimentary of Malik Brown and our conversation with him gives the Syracuse team some flexibility defensively because he can play that five and allow Syracuse to put some guards around him and go small when we talked to Coach ay that was one of the things we asked him about rotation in figuring out what was his best defensive lineup what was his lineup about speed you know hes trying to figure those things out but I think this is a pretty good defensive lineup on the floor right here and on the Baseline out of bounds play theyre in zone Justin Taylor tagged with that foul as the fouls are piled up here quickly for Syracuse in the second half Applause on jakee and another foul three on this possession alone and Cornell in the bonus now for the rest of the game its just a good isolation right here on on the inside o does a great job of drawing the foul and you can see coach ay says go in and get Applause him four fouls on cop so he has to take a seat hes been active all night great hustle plays but a little too aggressive as of late all of Syracuse has Cornell fails to make him pay from the foul line Applause Music look at mince with his shoulders over his di pad up running back and he is on fire again Juda mince hes got 24 on the n looked like Judah M was having a few words with the Cornell bench maybe welcome welcoming them to the Dome another another foul called against Syracuse corells falling into a scoring drought of 2 minutes and 20 seconds but theyll get some opportunities at the foul line the rest of the way thats now four on Bell so the orange have two players with four fouls right now you see mince right there holding him not letting Raglin get to the block and thats a foul its a good recognition by Cornell to find the mismatch and put another foul on Mintz Applause thats one way to cool off the hot hand Jay is to get him in foul trouble to take it at him on a defensive Music Applause end guy Raglin trying to urge this Cornell team on hes at the line line trying to give them some energy missed the foul shot so it stays at 11point lead for Syracuse the largest lead of the game has been 13 Under 12 minutes to go darling in and out no good good ble for the board Falls with Williams and Cornell you want Starling taking that shot if youre cor and another foul against Syracuse this who resulted Cornell shooting three Cooper Nord at the line shooting three when we come back sir they have t 10 different players score in the game and their bench has outscored Syracuse 18 to4 its all a part of the philosophy and the game plan for Cornel so try to multiple bodies keep the energy High play full court defense and try to wear teams down the Judah Mintz checked out of this game at the 1206 Mark after picking up his fourth foul the question for first year head coach Adrien Entre how long do you let him sit because Syracuse is a different team with mint on the bench well I think youve got time here you wait an adjust By the 4minute Mark at at under eight and you see how many possessions youre leading by you heard coach bayham talk about how they had control of the game and then they let Cornell back in and gave him some confidence now Cornell is sing up to a different full court pressure with a 221 back into their man big opportunity for Kyle cuff Jr the transfer from Kansas wearing number zero in white depleted of two guards in the back court right now I also think its a big opportunity for Justin Taylor to find some open shots thats a horrible possession right there that results in an offensive rebound so they get a break shot clock under 10 JJ starlings been quiet tonight finds Bell misfires there see thats where you miss mince theres two possessions right there he can make a play frustration foul Chris mannon reached in after he missed watch gray drive right here get stopped by Mintz Applause B this has been the hot spot cant connect that time kick out Taylor a three its good Justus in Taylor to the rescue first Basket in more than two minutes for the orange Malik Brown stolen away and before he could get to the Bas get fouled great anticipation on an uphill pass from the wing back up to the top and Malik Brown makes a great defensive effort there to get the Music Steal Bells missed his last three hits that one though Chris Bell up to 16 points on the night hes been a nice compliment to Judah minz offensively oh back door open again Isaiah gray runs right through it I mean Shan Hansen puts it right on the Applause Music money I really like the Cadence that Syracuse is playing on the offensive end here Jay the way theyre playing not just 94 ft but the way theyre playing in their quarter Court offensively theres a turnover turn it over that time up ahead finished at the rack AK Oar JJ Sterlings got to make a better decision than that time out Adrien arrey with under nine minutes Clon have been undefeated uh that should be a good matchup and uh the old Syracuse transfer Joe Gerard has averaged nearly 19 points in the last five games so he has been playing well for Clemson Cornell back within 10 Jud Min still off the court for Syracuse now the orange and the big red and playing since 1901 128th meeting Syracuse has won 42 straight that is the second longest active streak in division one who has the longest and our producer Kristen Hennessy has been torturing me since she brought this hoop scoop up about 30 minutes before the game started weve tossed around Kentucky we thought maybe it could be an ACC team Debbie duer North Carolina but I think Mark Fs been at Gonzaga for 25 years there has to be somebody out there that theyve beaten up on during their dominance do you have a guess cuz this is bothering me yeah I know weve been talking about this off air the whole time I I dont know I cant figure out who it might be I have no idea I mean I dont even want to throw out a guess about a West Coast Conference team I have no idea yeah I its a stum I think because hocky Duke and North Carolina have all been down in the you know at least once in the last 20 years whereas Gonzaga theyre the winning his team by percentage it Kristen put me out of my misery I hope it could just be a random team in the Mac The Hoop scoop answer Gonzaga how about that 45 oh that makes me feel good put me on something swap when that was we were talking about pepper or um Pacific yeah well theres your hoop scoop Syracuse trying to keep the streak alive theyve got work him out I mean hes a he is a sophomore but he is a veteran player so you have to trust him with four fouls to think that he could play should Cornell close the Music gap now they have closed the Gap to eight Syracuse led by as many as 12 when mins came out of this game good defensive stop from the orange there out of the timeout Justin Taylor has been the one that has scored since mittz went out yeah I would run something for Justin Taylor and after most atos or after at least two of them thats exactly what coach ay has Music done Taylor and Bell have combined for 31 including seven made threes between those two after they struggled in the 22point loss to Virginia over the weekend good bounce back win for them now trying to close this one out Nord a deep three couldnt connect nice job by JJ Starling to track down the Music rebound Music under 10 to shoot Bell lets it Fly and buries it Chris Bell delivers from Applause Deep hes got five threepoint baskets 13 made triples by Syracuse theyre beating Cornell at their game right now Cornell only has eight threes when in doubt Let it Applause Fly Cornell the immediate answer ker Applause boy Cornell needs to get a stop if they can get three stops in a row and three scores theyre right there 5 minutes 30 seconds remaining shot clock at seven Starling all the way to the rim JJ Starling that looked too easy and it was for the Baldwinsville native through up 20 minutes from the Dome now playing in it trying to close this game out Cornell continues the battle Sha Hansen count it plus the foul Hansen does a nice job of getting behind the defense on a mismatch with Starling who doesnt get any Music help you see that right eye he took an elbow in the Lafayette game four stitches moneyy Applause swatted stays with cor now I was about to crack a joke and say you should see the other guy but youre right it wasnt elbow takes a seat trying to will this Cornell team back theyve trailed for most of this game Syracuse got up early by 13 largest leads been 14 and Corell wont go away its a twopossession game with under 5 minutes to Music Applause go money cor money off on the drive in attack mode Brown keeps it alive a couple of missed layups bounces out kep alive much better job on the offensive glass here in the second half sh clock at five Starling off to Taylor lines up a three cant connect 4 minutes remaining Cornell only trailing by six miscommunication there and a costly turnover fun everything they could handle Syracuse looked comfortable then started getting into foul trouble Jud to minz came out of this game at the 1206 Mark hes now reentering it with 353 to play so 8 minutes 13 seconds off the court and Cornells cut the lead in half they were down 12 now only trailing by six but now you get your closer back in the game and now you take command with Judah Mintz because thats what he does hes playing in winning time right now and its who you trust and you trust Judah Min with the ball in his hands in attack mode hands it off toughness fires from three the window is open for Cornell Big Red Trail by 14 with 10 minutes left to this game they cut it to a two possession game trying to beat Sy for the first time since 1968 Isaiah gray draws the foul I mean this is a good job of turning the corner off the Raglin screen on the elbow a great gray is a guy that you cannot knock off his line he is strong to the basket touch little touch thank you free throws matter all game long but it feels heightened in the final moments of a close ball game this half Cornell has only shot Seven of 13 from the line you know the full court pressure is Applause coming bra this is the second Syracuse a scoring drought of nearly 3 minutes here clinging to a fivepoint game you cant have any game slippage right here like that thats a mistake gray slams it the steel in the slam Isaiah gray makes it a threepoint game I just said game slippage mistake like that time out Syracuse Cornell on a s nothing run all the momentum take another look Isaiah gray trying to will the big red to the Finish Line looking for their first win for the first time since 1968 and theyve got a great opportunity here considering Brian Earls team trailed by 14 with 10 minutes left in this game Debbie Antonelli Jay alter with you Syracuse at a scoring drought of more than 3 minutes Debbie what do the orange need to do differently offensively here well I I like the way they moved the ball their Rhythm and Cadence on the quarter Court offense has been outstanding so off these atos theyve really worked to get the ball to Justin Taylor the mince time in the front of the rim is comes up short jump ball possession arrow with Syracuse the orange keep it underneath their own hoop the shot clock resets to 20 Syracuse has missed their last five shot attempts scoring droughts now 3 minutes and 23 seconds trying to get to the Finish Line only up by three but here Copeland back into the game for the ores playing with four fouls M playing with four fouls shot clock down to five pull up pop Starling gets it3 under two minutes remaining a little more breathing room for Syracuse nothing but air on the three B pushing it draws the foul and hell head to the line for two well that burst of speed in the open court is hard to catch up with this is what Jud mint does he can give you Separation on a possession he can give you separation in a Music game cly Miss there for Mintz the best he can do now with that miss is make it a two possession game up to six but Cornell still within Striking Distance the big red still with three timeouts to work Music with oh he misses B misses them both so youre looking to attack here you dont need to have a three you take the best shot Applause available kick ball he stay with Cornell you have three timeouts do you think about using one now Debbie I dont think you need it with your offense in front of you but coach Earls going here then they are gambling for a steal or trying to play up the line Cross Court pass finds Isaiah gray shot clock at seven Manning pulls the trigger cant Applause connect risky pass Starling they call a foul Starling was running out of court there and thats the fourth foul against Chris mannon his Applause senior CHR my way Chris my way Chris one minute remaining and the foul comes in on Applause Music Copeland Copeland shooting one and one just under a minute left in Applause Applause regulation it rolls down the home bounce there for quader copelan and hell get the second foul shot Applause here no no made them Applause both Isaiah gray Cornell Running Out of Time Cooper Nord has to hurry lot of time running off this clock on this possession Raglin to three needed it didnt get it Judah in the rebound Cornell thought it should have been a jump ball a foul called instead and now mins will head to the line for one and one Cornell moved the ball they had the wrong guy taking a shot at the end I think they were trying to get Nord uh an open look they did a good job on uh fouling Copeland but Copeland made his shots he hadnt been to the free throw line very much this Music Music season M will go back to the line Jay missed the last two white Music five of eight tonight Judah minz 24 points to his name to lead all scorers that one bounces home for the sophomore and this is where hes going to have to be the closer for Syracuse theres going to be a lot of one two three possession games in conference play hes going to have the ball in his hands Applause were now a team that has gone fast all night on these last two possessions have slowed things down Raglin will try and complete the threepoint play but just a lot of time running off this clock here you know Jay if youre Adrien ay I think you got be pleased with the way your team is going to close out this game its not going to be exactly right but you survive foul trouble you play at a pace that most teams dont play because Cornell plays so fast and your defense holds a really good threepoint shooting team buter Copeland seals it cor now will feel like they had a shot had cut it to three in the final minutes and Judah men rocks the rim it closes off a Syracuse Applause win
