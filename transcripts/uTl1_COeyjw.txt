kesan George back in the starting lineup for the second straight game for the canes the 68 freshman from Switzerland in there for Nigel pack who once again is out with a lower body injury they are resting him as he receives more treatment in hopes that he is back in time for the return to conference play and we are underway and yes your eyes are not deceiving you the hurricanes are wearing yellow uniforms for the first time and its an homage a tip of the cap if you will to the tri in the City of Coral Gable oh I knew there had to be a reasoning behind that question you know when I walked and I asked you what color are these uniforms well youre color blind you dont know those are color challenge its different well they have been wearing white most of the season so theyve got a little different shade tonight kans on defense ospreys in their Road Navy with the gray lettering and white trim and the kanes on defense have to guard against this the threepoint shot is the weapon of the sprays they lead the country in threepoint field goal attempts familiar starting four there with again George omir coming off another monster performance hit his first two right at the rim and Im sure this is a game where he can dominate The Painted area which he does against so much of his competition a double double 20 and 17 last time out in only 24 minutes thats dominant that was against Stonehill last week and yes again the threes are going to be flying on both ends particularly for the Ospreys the Miss by amitri Moss brought down by Matthew Cleveland looking to go end to end able to find a man in the corner for the wide open look benley Joseph whos also an excellent threepoint shooter but also excellent Defender you see benley Joseph picking up trying to put pressure on the ball making sure he leads the way defensively for The KES ohir the rebound those 17 you mentioned against Stonehill the uh best hes had for Miami not his career high easy bucket on the drive by Nate lateris could not stay in front of kesan George theres benley with the steel on that possession and this is where Miamis at their best getting out in transition but a turn over by Matthew Cleveland on that possession and that has been the Achilles heel of this Miami team averaging over 13 turnovers a game but those numbers creep up around 20 in their two losses this season yeah Jim Lena telling us after shoot around today that uh taking care of the basketball defense and rebounding are the three things that the coaching staff harp on every single day and we saw that turn over there as Cleveland tried to make the pass Chaz laner no we go pop through the rebound omir on the Fly great feed great catch great finish I couldnt have said it any better myself I was thinking about the catch but I have to recognize the pass and the Finish but omir with his size and the great hands to be able to get out transition to Corral that and also the touch to finish it off with the reverse layup North Florida twice during the tenure of Matthew Driscoll has led the nation in threepointers made this year theyre number two behind only Brigham Young at 12 1 12 made triples per game a rare midrange shot and its an air ball by leres one of the reasons why we thought this would be a highscoring game is because Miami is one of the best in transition as you see popular finding NORAD omir for the easy layup but also to your other number about the ospre and the way they shoot the three we could see a high scoring game in this what coach Risco call that a pillow fight a pillow fight implying there might not be a lot of defense well his ospreys team theyre going to shoot 33s at least and they could shoot 40 and maybe even as close as 50 if they get the tempo going the way they want yeah they average close to 36 33 real goal attempts per game walking in the shootaround today coach visco asked me which number did I like 30 35 or 40 of course you know my nephew Stephen Curry wears 30 his father Dell wore 30 so Im thinking the favorite number 30 but when he said that would be the number of Threes they would take oh I would much prefer to C40 Steph Curry is now your nephew too you didnt know this hes your nephew for real no not for real now you know as we get a chance to look at Matthew Driscoll the head coach for the north Florida ospr you do know and Ive referred to D Curry as like my big brother corre absolutely so whos his son well theres a couple of them in the NBA who are his son and both of them would happen to be my nephew so you claim Seth as well absolutely oh good omir doing damage inside once again he is now 15 points shy of 1500 for his career both at Arkansas State and here at Miami I like the way youre keeping that run and tab going and Miami turning it turning North watera over again and now Matthew Cleveland this time finishes off the break had a turnover early but this time getting out in transition for the dunk a strong start for the canes early well the Osprey scored first but the canes have scored the last 13 and they scored the last two getting out in transition once again wga popper with the kick ahead this time Matthew Cleveland with the flush for two nadir entered the game 21 points side becoming only the third active division one player with 1500 points and a th000 rebounds well hes six points closer simply because of the way theyve gotten out in transition and the way that he has dominated the paint to start this game lets see how the Ospreys come out of that timeout they made their first shot and have missed everything since meanwhile the canes have barely early Miss 6 for eight from the floor and all six of those have been assisted the ospre stay cold and once again Miami with its foot on the gas pedal benley Joseph little strong off the window this has been far from a great defensive year thus far for the Miami Hurricanes however theyre defending the threepointer as well as anyone in the country only allowing 27 to be shot against them from three and of course as I bring that up the ospr make a three ja enzi Off the Bench the sophomore from OVO Florida with his first bucket here he is trying to make it two and a row if you play for North Florida and you dont shoot thre when they are presented to you youre not going to play thats it so you cant really say when you play cuz youre not going to play youll find a spot on if youre on this roster and you dont shoot the three ball you will not get on the court well what are did you say the top 10 guys in the rotation what was the statistic Court the top 10 guys in the rotation all average over one threepoint fi gold attempt per game wow and again everyone shooting you see another turnover this is going to oh Clevelands going to get the foul on that one but you see two turnovers backto back possessions for Miami and thats been the the the only issue for the canes this year its been the turnovers Jim Lara told us pregame theyve had two bad halves this year the second half at Kentucky the second half against Colorado where they played that game at Barclays in New York they were blitzed in both those halves losing both games by 22 plus however they were close games at halftime Chaz lanir with his second made three hes the top offensive weapon for the ospre averaging over 16 points per game that is sixth best in the Atlantic suncon confence and jaaz is absolutely shooting the three ball this year I believe 145 attempts for him already in 14 game that number may be wrong well the facts get in the way of good story again regardless hes getting a lot of shots up from Beyond a threepoint Arc he is the only Osprey who is close to 30 minutes per game we talked about the 10man rotations but he is the guy 162 points per game leads the team shooting 43 from three and has four 20point games already on the young season so Chaz is the guy that they look forward to stepping up and having big nights especially against teams like Miami when theyre playing Power five eight points for omir the Junior from nicar Roga to a quick start a metri MOS cant find behind the range will go popler Soares for the rebound had a mismatch inside trying to find omir and the foul is called on J enzi at 64 trying to hang with one of the better bigs in the ACC coming up next well take you to the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill for ninth rank North Carolina hosting Charleston Southern I cant wait to see where RJ Davis does next over his last six games Cory averaging 266 per game and as impressive as anything as George makes the bucket from the corner five of those six opponents have been ranked so RJs been doing it against some of the bats he absolutely has and hes been playing great basketball as of late had opportunity to be there to watch the game against Florida State talk to his dad pregame as we see the ospr knocked down another three but yeah RJs playing great basketball dad said hes doing all right doing all right yeah just all right but that was really at the beginning of this streak where hes at scored over 20 for six or seven straight games well for the season averaging over 21 a game best in the ACC so yeah I think hes doing all right Casey with the pullup theres my guy we already off to a great start AJ Casey who had a tied his career high eight points against ston Hill last time out and I asked a special favor of him this this uh afternoon in shoot around I need to see double figures another offensive rebound for North Music Applause Florida only way hes going to be able to get to that 10 though is stay on the floor which means he better rebound we did talk about that coach mossor MRI Moss with his first two points we should mention that at that last stop stoppage wga popper went into the Miami locker room so already down Nigel pack for the game well see how long wga is out if we see him again omir spotting up he may not be the best or most prolific threepoint shooter for the canes but he can shoot he can absolutely shoot the basketball one of the areas that makes Miami so dangerous one through five they can shoot the three we talk about the ospr and the way they like to shoot it well Miami advantage of their opportunities from Beyond threepoint Arc as well well the canes are the best shooting team from distance in the ACC theyre sixth in the country at 41 and good thing fortunately for Miami W popular back at the scores table ready to check back in we know that would be concerning for anyone that is a Kane F strong drive by Watson couldnt finish George gets the offensive rebound and hes going to bring it back out smart play by George you see him growing with more and more confidence each and every time out and going step back with a three ball unable to get it but you always are willing to take those shots when you got that guy inside NORAD omir who is always available to come up with the offensive rebound the putot back and hes already in double digits here to start this game 13 points on 6 for six shooting three rebounds number 15 in yellow has come to play Third Team all ACC a year ago nor omir so far tonight playing like a first teamer and then some he absolutely has he played like a first teamer all last year so when you think about coming off of a great season where he helped lead his team to the final four the hype is behind NORAD omir and he has lived up to the hype the only struggles that Miami has had throughout this season normally starts with him being in foul trouble when hes not on the floor theyre a different team we talked about the two halves that Jim Lena referenced he was in foul trouble in the in that game against Kentucky and he fouled out of the game against Colorado 14 points now for omir and again he spent his first two years in college at Arkansas State he is out of Miami prep and we learned from coach larena last week that he actually worked out here at the University of Miami with Hurricanes coaches in attendance while he was in high school but they still didnt know who he was they didnt during the pandemic have the opportunity to see him fully and not until he went away did they realize oh my gosh he is somebody who really could come here and be an impact player in the ACC well they know now they sure do you know the statistical comparisons for no Chad omir especially after his first two years at Arkansas State Tim Duncan Blake Griffin Andrew bogot Kenneth fared Oscar sheway those were the numbers he was putting up at Arkansas State took a little step back last year with a higher level of competition but he is still remarkably productive well those first three guys you mentioned were the number one pick overall in the NBA Draft so um yeah thats great company to be in but but youre talking about Elite rebounding we know Alando Bott and what hes done at North Carolina we will see them next but it was actually NORAD oir who led the ACC in rebounding a season too and right there in line with Bott to do the same this year but when you look at oms numbers you always have to say hes done it in four years what botts done to this point nows in his fifth year omir doing this in his fourth year so Elite rebounding top two active rebounders in the entire country and N Chad omir closing in on 1500 points and he will join Bott and Baylor shyan of kraton as the only guys in the country active with 1500 points and th000 rebounds so again the numbers are just staggering for nor Chad oir I was shocked when I saw shyan on that list yeah cuz hes a shooter yeah I know of him as a shooter I wasnt expecting him to be that that level of a rebounder but you see om here has matched the ospre himself 14 to 14 right now however his field goal percentage has been much higher shooting 60 on the season but at 100 in this game thats only going to help his average yeah he Matthew Cleveland top five of the ACC in shooting percentage theres another rebound for number 15 with his head up looking to run the break give it to Watson and hes fouled on his drive to the bucket thats another undervalued part of omir game he has the ability to lead the break hes not just a guy that rebounds and waits to outlet the basketball he has the vision has the ability to handle the basketball and make plays extremely difficult for your spy man to have to guard that well be back to the Watco center right after this back at the U the Miami Hurricanes playing their final nonconference game of the regular season for 13th year head coach Jim Lara oh by the way the winningest coach in kans basketball history and as we mentioned earlier the only program in the country Cory as you know thats been to the last two Elite 8s including last years final four and Coach El is a perfect 12 and0 during his tenure at Miami and the last game headed into conference play yeah as soon as I saw that in the notes I thought if coach knows thats printed somewhere hes going to say uhoh do you think coach superstitious that what youre saying most coaches are so I would presume that he is although I dont know for sure five to shoot Chaz lanir puts it on the deck and turns it over shot clock violation all right so benley Joseph got that deflection he is clearly the best defender for coacha MH who would be the next best defender and can this Miami team collectively be a good or above average defensive team I believe so and the next best defender would easily be wiga poer who was really one of the guys who was the defensive stopper last year when you think about that Miami team that went on to the final four it was wer POA who often times took on that best matchup benley Joseph came off the bench a season ago so it was normally wer popper who got that assignment heres benley and wugan the back Court together into the corner Watson no Cleveland soaring for the offensive Applause rebound Christian Watson off of his best game as a Miami Hurricane seven assists last time out as North Catt misses his first shot on the game I asked Christian Watson earlier whats up with the seven assist he says well you know Im starting to feel a little more like a point guard Im not sure what coach L was going with that but coach L absolutely loved to see him dropping dimes way he did against Stone Hill yeah they shared the ball so well eight days ago in the route of Stonehill with 26 assists including those seven you mentioned Cory and it was I believe eight from he will head to the free throw line when we come back terrific ball movement in that half court for the cane sharing it and they are up for some of the womens basketball team had a little fun lets see the arm well as you get set to ring in the New Year Sunday will have a womens basketball quadruple header right here on accn beginning at noon Eastern number 22 Florida State host Wake Forest then number 13 Notre Dame squares off against Syracuse followed by 19th Frank Louisville taking on Miami and willll cap the day with number three NC State and Virginia we wish everybody a Happy New Year and Katie Meers canes routed Alabama State here in this building last night now 10 and one a big opportunity for them coming up on Sunday Matthew CLE Cleveland at the free throw line he tells me baseball was his first Passion he played center field until High School coming up in Atlanta and I saw during pregame warmups he and one of his teammates were practicing baseball passes still got a good right arm yeah and thats a valuable thats a valuable tool in basketball if youre going to inbound the ball on a baseline agree shocky didnt stay with it again you can play both I play both well his mom and his sisters were all accomplished soft player so he played baseball but eventually I guess he grew out of it now its 67 you dont grow out now I call Aon about 67 you you dont grow out of it well hes doing pretty well in his chosen sport nowadays he absolutely is doing very well and you know uh nir also was a baseball player growing up oh and Nicaragua nicara yes he he was a baseball player and then chose basketball much later in his adolescence well he is the first ever Nicaraguan to get a division one basketball scholarship in this country theres a huge theres another turnover by Miami Joseph with a bad pass theres a big Nicaraguan population here in South Florida and thats part of the appeal of omir to transfer back home and play in front of a lot of folks who really care about it you dont really need a lot of reasoning to come back to uh is true in this case well call it Coral Gables Coconut Grove South Beach Miami in general you dont need a lot of incentive to come back here its a great place to be especially during the r when our bosses say youve got a game in Miami anybody says no I tell you what that was a beautiful find from George he was not even looking and thats something Matthew Cleveland has been pointing up along the back of that zone multiple possessions but George wasnt even looking back there at Cleveland he was actually looking off the Defenders at benley Joseph count the basket in one that snaps along scoring Dr by Miles see you see George with the fine to clevand and thats something you can tell that coach lar and his staff talk to his guys about letting them know hey guys give Matthew a look along that Baseline hes going to be open and once you get that L now as a defensive team youre always thinking about getting dunked on him back behind you you dont want that theyre going to get much better looks because of it you think Matthew Cleveland could have stolen home run or two I believe so I believe so 67 with bounce you said gr out you dont grow out of baseball uhoh oh wow somebody else who could have stolen a home run or two back in his baseball playing days omir now seven shy of 1500 will go to the line and omir taking it strong to the r just unable to finish that one you dont often see nor chir attack the rim like that especially against when their Defenders there hes normally scoring around guys that time tried to go over top of a Defender I think I like that you know whats amazing is when you see this Miami team come into a huddle the tallest player in the lineup happens to be a guy who is really more of a point guard and Kean George now he also has the hair out yes he does last time I saw him the hair was you know bra it up so oh soaring in omir for a block yeah what would you put the height of keesan George tonight with the hair list that 68 and I believe he is 68 cuz hes taller than omir whos 67 however with hair we going Flex we got to go like flexx and hes got to be at least three in with the hair I would say four I probably go more four he maybe 7t with North Floridas going to just keep shooting the three jack vanderhyden with the bucket and when you look at it North Florida has not had a very good shooting half however its a 13point game omir will head back to the free throw line more chir coming from this denying an opportunity at The Rim huge block shot for omir and I a trivia question I know you already know the answer to this okay but if you ask people around the ACC ACC basketball fans who was the leading shot blocker for this Miami Hurricanes team especially after seeing a play like that from omir I believe most people would get that wrong right and you wouldnt know its been Bley Joseph but he averages Just a Touch under a block a game and it does surprise me that omir doesnt run into more than one block a game Ben is Clos to two blocks again he has 20 blocks coming into this coming into the game and they played 11 games he has 20 blocks from the season that would be more than one per game yes it would be we know listen we know you went Syracuse math is not you got strong to I appreciate that Music ganir with a shot clock down final five minutes of the half foul on the three ball and a chance for four for Vander height and the way North Florida shoots the three they are never out of games you look at it right now and a chance to make an 11point game the kick to the corner bander heighten knocks down to three contact by benley Joseph we talked about him as a shot shot blocker that time getting a little too close and picking up the foul the son of two professional basketball players Jake vanderhyden makes the free throw a fourpoint play dad Allard his mom Kim Kim Brigham actually was a uh All Conference player at umash L before turning pro omir with two more points you know what I got to go back on my numbers Bley has 10 blocks wow so the UVA he he has 21 steals the UVA guy actually made a mistake with his MTH no he 21 steals I just that was a mistake with my grammar I said the wrong word not the wrong number so now that hate you were putting on my Elma you got to take back oh never not never going to do that well thank you thank you for looking it up yourself so I didnt have to tell you yes but Bley does leave Miami and steals blocks and he says all the defensive categories as George comes up a little short on that three and he has been shooting the basketball so well coming in his last five games 11 for his last 19 after getting his feet wet as a college player he has found his stride yeah was shooting in the low 20s his first six games with the last five games has been Spectacular from Beyond the threepoint R Oscar Barrys pass taken out of bounds so North Florida will keep it with this game far has been about NORAD or ACC network has number five Florida State covered in Miami for the Capital One Orange Bowl tomorrow at 2 Eastern the Huddle crew will have a 2hour pregame show followed by a command center broadcast of the game with multiple camera angles and realtime player and team stats then after the game against number six Georgia stick around for ACC huddles postgame show theyll have a complete breakdown with reactions from coaches and players and of course the seol are 13 and0 denied the bid in the college football playoff Hurricanes on the Move Cleveland just so long and athletic able to finish but a nice job by will the popular turning defense and the offense on that possession great hands in the Trap coming up with the steel and then facilitating out in transition well just like the Stonehill game the assists are piling up that is 12 assists on 15 made field goals for Miami but one of the things youre seeing is is nor Chad oir having to get out beyond that threepoint line and defend Applause uhoh thats not good popper holding that left ankle watch the lower leftand corner of your screen as Wugga makes his way over to the end of the B we will see as he was trying to close out and defend the threepoint shooter how he landed on that ankle yeah just simply trying to contest the three land going that ankle of course always Music dangerous omir didnt get the block shot there but he may as Applause well Applause travel wga POA being attended to remember Miami already playing without Nigel pack dealing with with a lower extremity injury as well wi been playing so well couple of games to go a career high 25 points against low then last time out 24 against Stonehill we are right around the corner from ACC play conference play starts well its already started but picked back up right after the New Year benley Joseph knocked on another Corner three in only 4 seconds north Florida had the ball all the way up the court taken another three theyve shot 22 of them so far tonight and that is just about what they want to be doing you know coach Driscoll didnt give me the option for 50 but we could see 50 of them go up tonight heres 23 and it goes down for three Chaz is able to knock down another one I like what Chaz lanir did 10 days ago on his 22nd birthday he scored 22 at Florida State out of bounds it will stay at this end do you believe that was a coincidence or do you believe that he actually playing the score coincidence coincidence okay good to see wer popper smiling will be even better to see him running to the scores table and checking back into this game however most likely miam will hold him for the remainder of this first half nice F better block shot though how about that Max H Lia just off the bench with the Applause denial little hesitation Joseph attacks good job to wall up by Dorian Applause James Music Applause Music Applause lir another offensive rebound thats been an area of concern for the Hurricanes as well finishing off defensive possessions coming up with the board Tim Lena has one of the best whistles in the ACC a New Yorker man its awesome hes a New Yorker everybody in the building their heads turned as soon as he whistled youre born knowing how to whistle when youre in New York I got a pretty good whistle you got yeah but youre not the same type of New York youre from the state of New York new youre not a New York City guy coach Ls New York City you dont have to whistle oh you got a whistle in Al absolutely got to whistle got to get peoples attention best way to do it theres coach Al from the Bronx New York but he has certainly made quite a home for him with the New York hater Cory Alexander Im Doug Sherman back in Coral Gables Florida 15point Miami lead the canes have had a couple of 130 runs and yet with that shooting of North Florida they are still within shouting distance here late in the first half I should have said real New York City person got to show you my you my drivers license yeah I I agreed youre from the state of New York youre not a city guy you dont have a whistle sorry for the audio folks final 10 seconds of the half lob to the rim omir has it knocked away her Lia with another nice defensive play Watson got caught in the midair deciding whether it was to go to Cleveland for the three or inside to omir tried to get it into omir fortunately the kanes are able to keep the basketball Cleveland sneaking down the lane her licker with another block shot the officials confir with 11 seconds remaining in the half its going to be ospreys basketball there was that whistle you saw the whistle while it happened your whistle or the coach s oh okay he wanted to foul in that possession he felt like Matthew Cleveland got a little too much contact attacking the basket wanted to call Applause though here comes the 28 threepoint try of the half if they can get it off they cant shot goes I believe that was still in his hands our fifth air now to see how he responds after turning that ankle Jim Lenas team had a couple of 130 runs in that first half led by nor Chad omir 19 points along with his seven rebounds omir is just two points away from 1500 in his career North Florida meanwhile is on Pace for 54 three shot threepoint shots taken Im here for it if youre going to if you got a chance to win this game against Miami who has beaten You by 20 and now 22 plus points in the paint as North Shadow reaches 1500 career points and a chance for him to go over that at the free throw line but right now the score is 242 points in the paint in favor of the Miami Hurricane so if you got a chance to beat Miami youre going to have to make three so I would expect to see at least 27 more from the ospr here in the second half so now nor Chad is one of three players currently active in college basketball with 1500 points and a th000 rebounds in his career along with Carolinas Armando Bott and bayor shyan of kraton good find lateris wide open three and thats the battle thats what youre going to have to defend North Florida does not hide their secret weapon theyre going to use the three ball regardless as to whether theyre up 10 or theyre down 20 whatever it may be theyre still going to shoot the three and youre going to have to defend it offensive foul now we have seen omir get that ball in the middle of the Zone turn and shoot it and he has made it but that time he chose to put it on the deck and he picks up the offensive foul pretty good company right there great company especially when you consider hes done it in four years Bott as well as shyan both in their fifth year of college basketball omir only in his fourth year two at Arkansas State and now here in his second year Midway through at Miami have you heard anything Cory about whether he has thoughts about coming back for a fifth year here I have not but I would always encourage unless youre a shire first rounder and you know youre going to be taking in the NBA draft come back play another year at Miami of course has been at the Forefront of nil so you know they their guys do very well here football and basketball as well as the young ladies on the womens basketball program there goes wga popper again and grabbing at that left ankle Applause again hes going to try to walk over to the bench but gives coach L the signal to get him go straight to the locker room and you see POA getting after the basketball but Chaz air DOD for the basketball and just happens to catch that left leg of popper as he goes down again grabbing at that left ankle count Christian Watson into the game with the ball passes inside omir now over 1500 Amir came back looking at his hands he wanted to dunk that one but the basketball slipped out of his hands on the way up well we talked about his future and and would it behoove him to come back for a fifth year nice drive by Moss where do you see NAD omir whether its this next year or the foll year when it comes to finding a niche somewhere in professional basketball well the one skill that translates more than any other in the game of basketball regardless of level is rebounding and so in todays game where you have smaller players playing the five position he is a center and you got small but he has of course the ability to shoot the three hes got some skills he can put the ball on the floor make plays but hes strong enough to guard anyone y but his rebounding prow allows him to to be able to compete with anyone on the floor because of how well he rebounds I dont see him being a guy that NBA teams are going to go out and say hes a first round pick for us so which and from knowing that I would say hey maybe stick around for another year do a fifth year of college basketball but I do believe that hes a guy that can find his way onto an NBA roster and possibly play minutes getting the rotation forba I know the the game is played much differently but I keep thinking a guy like Kenneth fi that found a spot in the NBA and because of that rebounding and the effort and some of the other things theres a deflection by omir he comes up with the basketball he just does as opposed to focusing on maybe what he cant do if you focus on what this guy can do its an awful lot of good stuff I dont think theres anything that he cant do the only challenge with omir is the fact that hes 67 yeah because if hes 611 hes the number one pick in the draft so I mean you think about that I mean the dude is spectacular everything he does on the floor but its just the the fact that from a positional size hes at a disadvantage against the guys hed be playing against Ean George for three does the fact that omir has a near 7ot Wings span mitigate some of that for you Cory it helps but still the metrics at 6 7 if youre going to be a five in the NBA is difficult to do however if anyone can do it Im a firm believer that North shadir can make it happen Papa who got off to a great start facilitating but since then not once but actually twice having to deal with injuries to that left ankle area diving for a loose ball gets rolled up on immediately limps off to the locker room we have yet to see wiga return to the bench here in this second half that is the eighth leading score in the ACC with just a couple of points in his 15 minutes nor Chad oir has done more than his share to help pick up the slack and North Florida just keeps firing threes as they do held ball and the possession arrow stays at this end and one of the things that we also have to talk about is we this as great as the starting lineup has been for Miami they dont get a lot of production from their bench so now without Nigel pack on the floor of course kishan George is in the starting lineup and without wle popper now you have have two reserves playing in starter minutes and starter roles right now as Christian Watson comes on to the floor to replace wer popper so the bench has been a concern for the canes throughout this year and it gets you know now with these guys stepping into the main rotation without those two backourt Phenom Christian Watson George going to have to step it up and be even more prod and thats always the risk of constructing a roster as Jim Lena normally does hes not Leonard Hamilton going 10 11 12 deep he normally has a seven or eight man rotation and its done very well but if you lose one or two key guys it can hamstring you well you and I talked in the open about as Matthew Cleland knocked down the three in transition we talked about the timeline of Coach L when the struggles were happening for this Miami program it was all behind injuries it wasnt coaching it wasnt in t lack of talent it was based upon the fact that they had too many key guys with Applause injuries benley Joseph just another one of the threepoint threats on the year over 40 hes made three triples here tonight and now the canes looking like the ospre pulling up a threes on back to back possessions on the break I would suspect we see a three here Watson draws the contact and will head to the line well Christian tried to go with the old threepoint play which worked just as well but didnt they could bucket but the Miami Hurricanes getting up and down the floor benley Joseph to Matthew Cleveland and transition finds the three on the wing and this time Bley says Ill do it myself pulling up the top of the key for three and back inside the watsco center Doug Sherman with Cory Alexander and the young man from St Johns College High School in Washington DC Christian Watson at the free throw line for Miami and without Nigel back tonight and with wer popler gone again with an ankle injury as you mentioned Cory somebody like Christian Watson is going to get a lot more opportunities at least here tonight well coming up next we will take you to the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill for number nine North Carolina hosting Charleston Southern believe it or not nonconference play is almost done weve got three games in the ACC tonight A couple more nonconference games tomorrow and after the Carolina plays tonight its next opponent will be Tuesday at Pittsburgh 700 on ESPN and before we get off of Christian Watson as you mentioned St Johns College and DC let me make sure I send out some love to Pat Bean as he continues his battle against ALS keep fighting the good fight P we all praying for you and wishing you the best John eny missed the three Cleveland pushes the tempo oh that was a block Music I like the way the canes have attacked the zone defense tonight Cory theyve done a great job but it started with the fact they got the basketball inside the zone to omir who had a you know 19point first half so when you got someone operating that well in the middle of the Zone its going to make it difficult to try to defend the canes when theyre operating on all AJ Casey now into the game turnover lets take take a look at that ball movement against the Osprey Zone well it starts with the offensive rebound by George Bensley Joseph being patient then gets it inside to George once again who kicks it right back out to Watson steps in is able to pull up knock down the jumper off the bounce we have gotten word that Wugga poppler is not likely to come back tonight no surprise After Rolling that left ankle again no reason to bring him back into this for the big game coming up this week Wednesday night matchup here at home versus Clemson who is playing great basketball in Brad Brown now whos the early favorite for ACC coach of the year and Clemsons playing right now over on acc Network extra its final nonconference game against Radford up 2112 what do you make of Clemson we just won loss as we head towards January I am a fan as to what theyve been doing they had the biggest win of the ACC the inaugural ACC SEC challenge by going on the road and beating Alabama at Alabama and they have been spectacular this year Joe Gerard coming down from Syracuse making big plays just changed up shades of orange and PJ Hall is playing like an AllAmerican yes a strong candidate for ACC Player of the Year and we cannot talk about Clemson without talking about Chase Hunter who has played great basketball season long and Z with the three Music Applause Music ball ohir back in handling the ball out front oh nice gets the feed from George couldnt finish though great action though nice a number of nice passes on that we got to step out guard that guy thats the challenge for air especially playing against this North Florida group hes got to stay out of that threepoint line guarding guys who can shoot the basketball at every position Joseph attacks and is called for the charging foul coach Lara Nas says no no no no that was a blocking foul repeatedly signaling to the official that it should have been a block would you be in favor of the challenge in college basketball no no no we dont need any more video reviews and monitors and we do it in okay these officials as you know are so good that I dont need to split hairs and go right down to the frame on every single play all right where does it stop I am not fighting you on that one good we fight about enough other Stu we have more than enough to fight about about whether youre really a New Yorker or not go back to that man here comes my drivers license Music again thats Miami Applause basketball Matthew Driscoll coaching hard as he always does now his 15th yearss head coach of the ospre one of my favorite guys to be around love he just constant energy as Christian wat knocks down another three Watson had 10 points at Kentucky his best offensive output we talked about him coming off of a seven assist game against ston Hill last time out his confidence is starting to grow and now without wo on the floor getting more minutes to show it off well hes up to eight points now so what did you tell him before the game well that was actually AJ Casey we talked about when I talked about getting the 10 points but Casey whos in the game now may have an opportunity to be able to get that double figure Mark as we get a chance to look at the North Florida resume so far this season one and five in rad games and of course this team in a program that has a number of wins a win over Purdue back in 2015 theyve got a couple of uh Power five wins where theyve gone out onto the road and been able to beat some teams theyve had a good run in the Atlantic Sun Sun Conference fact that right now coach Driscoll is second winningest in a sun history three shy of Rick bird and when Belmont left the Aon and went to the ovc coach Driscoll took his entire coaching staff to Nashville and had a powwow hours long with Coach bird comparing notes now that they werent going to be League competitors it shows respect and I think its a great resource to be able to tap into that you wouldnt think of otherwise I agree H Harland we see coach Riso coaching up Jake vanderhagen and still coaching his guys regardless of the score of this game but theres a lot of love there this summer coach Risco will officiate his ninth wedding y of one of his former players or staff members and again when you want to talk about love and respect thats it you officiating nine weddings that is I I cant say that theres any other college coach that can have that type of claim to fame on their resume mhm 59 year old from Pittsburgh who has built a very good program up in Jacksonville Applause L teres feeds the post here is the sixthe Osprey Dorian James Doran had a a neat game last time out north Florida played Georgia that meant he matched up with his little brother trying to defend a couple of guys inside finally omir with two more points Applause Music off the lanir Miss Here Comes Cleveland and a foul on the shot that will have AJ Casey at the line well back in August North Florida took a trip every four years a college basketball team can go overseas and have a summer basketball tour in this past August North Florida went to Costa Rica and while basketball is a big part of it they played some games its about team bonding and living through adventures and one of them was a zipline that for team building purposes as far as I know everybody did it although impressing the coaching staff number 55 amitri Moss might have been the most skittish about that Cory well hes not as skittish as I would have been cuz Im not doing it so if its about team building then the whole team stay over here with me cuz Im not going down that zipline no thank you sir theres the team player Cory Alexander for us once again yes thats me Im thinking about the team and saving my life so therefore we can be good I tell you what coincidentally each of their last two foreign tours again they do it every four years North Florida then the ensuing season as Chaz lanir makes another three led the country and made threes and they are in the mix again this year and I do think I dont know what the the numbers are across all of college basketball but when teams take that forign tour you get the extra practice time I do think there is an uptick the following year I believe it is and a lot of it what you mentioned before its that team building that bonding getting an opportunity to spend that time throughout the summer 10 practice days as well as that time you know abroad where its just your team youre not as concerned about social media not concerned Le about all the other things is just about you guys spending time together getting to know each other and often times finding out the nuances of each other on and off four benley Joseph with the takeaway then gave it back up to Moss who goes to his right hand and finishes and to finish the the conversation about the summer tours its even more important now with the way the transfer portal is taken over college basketball because youre going to have 8 nine 10 new guys every every single year it seems yes omir 27 points now extending his Hurricanes career high when you think about this ospr team you have to consider that in the a sun theyre not going to have to deal with a North Shadow me theres no one playing in the a sun I dont know if there many people playing throughout the country that can do what he does but when you think about what omir has done 27 points to him already this evening and attacking the offensive glass the way he did on the last possession and the put back for two the style of play for the ospr can keep them competitive in the a sun even though you know theyre going to come out and shoot 40 to 50 threepoint field goals a game you cant stop it and when theyre making those shots theyre difficult to be and so amitri Moss was a late ad to the roster he signed late in the spring after spending the last two years at State College of Florida in Bradington turned himself into a division one recruit after having no off coming out of Northwest High School in Clarksville Tennessee and so he as much as anybody if youre going to be the starting point guard you got to know your guys and so he was able to go to Costa Rica and get that invaluable time on the floor with them so did he zip line he actually did it he did do it he did do it the last one to go I dont know about that I wasnt there just so you know yeah but you you know you always take an indepth dive into all the all the information so I figured youd ask that question now thatll be for our next Ospreys game you and me Cory well you know what I would love and again whether the Ospreys are there or not I would love to be able to go back and do the ason championship had opportunity to do that game five straight years in one of the most exciting times as a college basketball analy you get who the winner of that game is going to be in the NCAA tournament and it happens on the highest seated teams home court I can tell you it is great fun in college basketball benley Joseph was on the sideline when he received that pass bensleys had himself a nice game getting close to a double double hes getting close to a triple double every time I turn around hes turning the basketball over you know thats my boy Im having a conversation with him with Bley about that at the last break they only credited for three turnovers so hes got at least five now I dont know sounds like youre just hating on no no no thats my boy love him to death head benley and SA St Louis at Nike Elite 100 Camp was one of the very few guys that in a camp setting made defense a priority and what you see him doing still up 26 in this game making defense a priority love the way that he plays love the way that he goes out there and hes a guy that can score more but coach Lara talked to us about the fact that hes concerning himself with facilitating here he is with the back Cleveland leaves it in nice interior passing Casey to Cleveland against that zone thats also another way you beat the zone is when you can pass the ball inside those tight quarters Michael noo into the game getting his first rebound as nor Chad omir has taken a seat well see if omir comes back out and tries to add to his sixth double double of the Year nooka everything but the the Finish loved the footwork got in position to score just couldnt do it we need benley to get another assist so hes got the double figure assist hes at nine points right now nine points nine assist we definitely need another point for Benjamin but we dont want to keep him in there too long after what weve seen with wer popular make sure we get some other guys opportunities out here out of bounds kanes will keep it when we come back got himself a team that is built if they are healthy to make another Deep Run in the NCA tournament they absolutely are and Coach L wanting to talk it over with this team takes the 30 second timeout but youre 100 correct back toback Seasons where they dealt with injuries the 201920 season and then 2021 but ever since then Coach L has been able to get this team to resurge and of course last year a march to remember the first final four appearance in program history lost to the eventual national champions in Yukon but the biggest win throughout this entire time was you got to go with the two biggest wins but you think Houston the number one seed and then beating the two seed in Texas backto Back Games to make it to the final four its time for this man to be inducted into the Nay Smith Basketball Hall of Fame hes been on the ballot now for the second straight year he needs to be in the Hall of Fame he has shown that he is one of the best to ever do this in the college coaching R yeah we found out last week that he was nominated by the naith Hall of Fame voters for the second year in a row they will get the list of nominees down to finalists and then well find out at the final four who goes in this coming year but coach L is not doing it alone nice look there by miles to find Trent Coleman for the land I think its pretty cool that Jim Lenas High School coach at Archbishop Malloy in Queens Jack Curran is also nominated for the Nate Smith Hall of Fame well he absolutely belongs in there youre talking about Coach K who coached so many of the Great not just coach Lara but also Kenny The Jet Smith Kenny Anderson who is one of the best college basketball point guards of all time my favorite ACC point guard of all time no disrespect to Phil for and let me beat you to it uhhuh Lil CA Lil CA my young guy Cole anthon and thats again coach curan was also a baseball coach thats not the only thing as we see good thing to see W POA back on the sidelines was smiling got the hoodie on checking out the rest of the game ice on that left ankle after rolling it twice second time early in the second half he did it late in the first half went out and into the locker room for the remainder of the half and then did it Applause again but one of the things and we talked about Coach L as a Hall of Famer we asked Matt Driscoll earlier today about his relationship with with Coach Lara and he just talked about how great of a person coach L is and I can coign that Jim leega one of the best people that youre going to meet truly cares for his players and most of his guys want to be involved with the program well once theyre gone whether its at George Mason at Bowling Green whether its at Miami in any of the stops hes been his players want to continue to be around him because theyve enjoyed playing for Coach L that much and thats a true character of a man especially when youre asked to lead boys into manhood playing this game of college basketball Yeah couple of years as well as a division two head coach at American International College up in Massachusetts and you can Betty keeps track of those guys as Applause well Watson hes going to have a chance for Applause three ACCC network has number five Florida State covered in Miami for the Capital One Orange bow tomorrow two Eastern the Huddle crew will have a 2hour pregame show followed by a command center broadcast of the game with multiple camera angles and realtime player and Team statistics then after the game against number six Georgia stick around for the ACC huddle postgame show theyll have a complete breakdown with reactions from coaches and players its a huge football game so if the nlls go 14 and0 should they hang a banner should they claim themselves at least as having a share of the national championship um Im Im torn on that one but the reason why I say that is such a huge game is because they have an opportunity to validate the claims that they were one of the best four teams in the country because if they can do what Alabama did which Alabama is in the college football playoff because they beat Georgia they beat the number one team in the country if you know what I yes they should hang a banner if they can go out and beat Georgia then they should hang a banner because at 140 they will be only one of I mean it could be two possible teams that could do that and that would only be if Michigan wins or Washington wins and it cant be it can only be one other team thats 14 and0 which would be Florida State so yes if they beat Georgia they should absolutely hang a banner and especially if they do it without Jordan Travis their starting quarterback yeah back you know prbcs plee uh preol football playoff we had shared college football championships its not unheard of it has occurred before you know UCF went undefeated several years ago and they decided to hang a banner because they were not allowed to play for a national championship and uh with all that the SS did and just kept winning football games in spite of losing their AllAmerican quarterback they certainly would have some sort of claim and and its great that they have been placed up as George buried the three off a nice feed from Christian Watson that they have this opportunity to play the twotime defending national champs in previous number one team in the country to further cement their case if indeed they can beat the dogs that is one way to validate it you beat the dogs you validate that you long and you had a great chance of winning because I would not be shocked as my guy AJ Casey gets the bucket out in transition opportunity for the threepoint play I would not be shocked if Alabama beats Michigan to started off in the first game of the college football playoffs you heard it here first back in Coral Gables and we need to mention once again why yes the hurricanes are wearing yellow uniforms tonight for the first time in program history inspired by the trolleys that run through the City of Coral Gables with the yellow thats on top and I would say nor chadow oir looks pretty good in yellow I would say that he would look good in whatever color uniform they wore today 11 to 12 from the field for 27 points to go along with 10 rebound so another double double for omir if there was one thing that probably wasnt up to St the four turnovers Im sure coach L wouldnt mind him getting rid of those well five canes and double figures in scoring led by that man a new cans career high for him with those 27 points and as Cory alluded to his sixth double double of the Music year so now jakai Robinson has come in for Miami number Applause Music 13 and it is all reserves on the floor now for the canes zeroing in on their tth win of the Season no Nigel packed tonight as he continues to deal with a lower body injury the woko had the ball taken away and then wga poer I told you before the game five teames were going to score in double figures and wle was not going to be one of them would you have believed him I would not have believed you on that one considering he was averaging 17 and 1 half points per game coming Applause Music in nice Reverse by Jah n Applause Music z all right got to Tri a question for you Cory since were here at the University of Miami okay you know their mascot yes Sebastian the Ibis uhhuh why did the University choose an Ibis as its mascot I would say after a hurricane it was the first thing that they saw oh youve read that before I did not but again thats pretty much just common sense well theyre apparently the last animal you see as the hurricane is coming and the first to reappear after its gone by yes Christian Watson one of those double figure scores hes now got 14 points that is a career high he score 10 at rup Arena against Kentucky and hes four better than that here tonight nooka with the quick Applause hands love the moves of jaai Robinson the red shirt sophomore from oening New York another New Yorker from upstate you know jakai played high school basketball DC right did okay just check but hes from ausing okay fair enough and that bottom one is one to keep track of for Miami we have seen wga back on the bench with a smile on his face for whatever that tells you but uh going forward with conference Play Just Around the Corner they need that man at full strength they absolutely do and big game coming up on Wednesday we talked about Clemson visiting Miami huge Showdown Game thatll be on Applause ESPN two of the top teams in the ACC of course Miami picks a finish in the top three this year Clemson maybe the best team in the ACC thus far throughout this early season easy to make that case and the Tigers were number five in the preseason poll as you mentioned Miami was number two behind Duke in head of North Carolina for the bench is going to love that Paul Jo for the second straight game gets into the scoring column and at this end North Florida has taken almost three times as many threepoint shots as twopoint shots not going to get a shot off that time George throw it to the rim two more for Joe Bay yeah but if youre George on that one youre more concerned about the fact that you didnt get the assist after dropping the dime you want to make sure you get all those numbers as a point guard Joe Bay heating up and the bench loving if you love to see this Miami bench celebrate the success of their teammates and now the fifth time this season that the hurricanes have gone over 90 points young man out of West Oaks Academy in Orlando grew up in France with seven quick points a career high for the Miami Hurricanes oh hes got to get it right here free ball get him to double figures youre not going to take a shot clock violation with 4044 no I hope not I hate when they do that you hate when they do that just shoot it its not disrespectful or unsportsman just shoot it I Applause agree skip it there we go ah see what not the right guy for you Im just glad they shot Watson hit the side of the backboard basket interference and a foul and a chance for Applause three now there will be no more shot nope right which Im fine yes but if the shot clock is still on take that shot so Trent Coleman with a chance for the oldfashioned threepoint play you know one of his High School coaches was Eric dampier ah he did yep let me tell you about his son wo baby his son right now is the number one eighth grader in the country wow hes about 68 69 skilled got a chance to be very very special in Mississippi yes okay of course his dad LED Mississippi State to the 96 final four the only time in program history theyve gotten there why do you remember n96 final four so well because their season was ended by Syracuse of course its got to do something Syracuse Miami wins by 40 final thought Cory strong performance by the hurricane hopefully they get wer POA and Nigel pass
