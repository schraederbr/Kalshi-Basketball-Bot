right behind Brett Reed has his PhD in 135 career wins he has one NCAA tournament win as a 15 seed beating two seed Duke thanks in large part to CJ McCollum now of the Pelicans set to get underway as the cousin The Familiar home whites gets the games first possession with Benny Williams returning for his sophomore year and unable to draw the rim and Keith its the rebound for Lehigh art oriented Squad here but theyre given a little size by Dominic Carolyn he could step out Matt to hit the three that Jesse and Amanda man right here is gonna have to play Cameron protects a lot of the game first regular season game the orange have opened and mantoman quite a while and a jumper from the left able to solve that a twonothing Lehigh lead that was the recipe for Colgate take the bigs out let them dominate outside with a passing from the top of the king triple handoff on the near Perimeter here for Joseph Gerard over 1100 career points he and Jesse Edwards will make it go great twoman game and Jesse Edwards who missed all of the games after early February last year back with his injury behind him and poised for a big season figures to be all ACC when its all said and done minute gone by and Applause off the crossover Higgins that hits with a thud and JT tan has it shoved right back to him by Edwards long jumper is piped by the lefthander Evan Taylor goodlooking allaround player real smooth he knew as soon as he released it kind of a weird Back Spin on it but uh bottom of the net and Coach behind right away come in with Justin Taylor as a sixth man Off the Bench well answer a tailor with one of their own on pick and roll Edwards gets fouled leaning in below the foul line and a chance at the line for uh Jesse Edwards on the games first foul going against Tyler Whitney Sydney Edwards and Joe Gerard have great chemistry together and well see those two playing in combination throughout the season you have to try to isolate them as much as possible get Jesse going to the basket hes so athletic he sets a nice screen there Joe led him great as a former quarterback just kind of dropped it off to him on a nice bounce pass the restaurant so Edwards cams the first free throw of the season last race 61 shooter started off better than that had his struggles over the course of the Year first look at the highly touted freshman shooter Justin Taylor as Edwards connects both times pick up D here and then kind of back into that zone defense and now watching the principles as they switch around tan out to Whitney Sydney whos short on a long range try and Justin Taylor the rebound from long range Gerard had his feet set doesnt miss many of those Lehigh the other way with the lead a lot of speed here as advertised for Whitney Sydney but he got into deep turned it over Taylor to mince on the leak out and mens misses his first field goal attempt as a freshman freshman a freshman theyre a little nerves along the Baseline theres a foul as Whitney Sydney soars to the basket and the first foul on Syracuse goes to a freshman Justin Taylor all uh to be expected Matt working out the Kinks the exhibition games are for the purpose of kind of getting some of those nerves out but its not quite like this I really like the mountain hawks just their confidence their Pace you know with so much experience with the guard they still havent seen you know we thought maybe Jalen Sinclair might get a start whos been injured a really great Prep High School player but no real true point guard they kind of use Higgins and Taylor to both bring it up but really likely he has case they are attacking in their IQ theyre not just going up there against Jesse you know its going to get blocked you know JT 10 didnt even look at the basket passing for three right away Wendy Sydney a New Englander makes both free throws average six points per game a year ago Lehigh with the lead Syracuse trailed iup in the second half of its first exhibition game and gave back a big lead somewhat in the second half against Southern New Hampshire in exhibition number two Gerard dispossessed in the lane and Lehigh coming away with a threepoint lead Carolyn passes up the long one Benny Williams sticking with him exactly you know they attack and they bring it out clock at 10 Southpaw jumper is good for Evan Taylor preseason all Patriot league and a guy that can contribute in a lot of wins we saw both fixing exhibition games IEP in Southern New Hampshire the best leading scorers for them didnt come in and struggle to Taylor the best player comes in says Im not faced Edwards on the back door to Taylor who fumbles its out of bounds off of Lehigh three and a half minutes in they arent still looking to get into a Groove here points while taking Matt in terms of answering the bell in a big stage Taylor not shying away heres Justin Taylor for the cues thats not by Design to have three players in the same spot now they get them spread out Music Maryland 69 on the guard Gerard no problem Prince Joseph Gerard III his first points of his senior year Three Degree in difficulty ten two fakes and a step back against the 69 forward slash Center that was guarding him on the perimeter thats when youve seen the NBA a lot of those isos lets keep it going Joe Sydney with Edwards bumping out and Gerard recovers defensively there jumper from the corner off the Mark Taylor figures to be a good rebounder especially for his size and shoot him in some of the front Court to a trailing Gerard is he feeling it then close out Taylor at the foul line not this time got his own immense a clear path against tan a charge his call the little things thats its the how freshmen have to learn that math is you cant drive and take a charge look at all those newcomers on the roster name tags still required even for Chris Bell who changed his name legally from Chris Bunch just prior to the start of the year yet to see these three Kadir Copeland Peter Kerry and munir hemo whos not a freshman but a transfer from Duquesne so far in the game that uh not only the couple of starters but Justin Taylor the sixth man in this one well he came in right off the bat for Belle who uh missed the defensive assignment and is sitting right next to coach Manheim getting a little tutelage and thats whats going to happen early on with freshmen theyll make mistakes and you have to coach him get him better and thats how they learn Levis had the upper hand so far move it from the big man tan a good passer inside little too deep for Evan Taylor and Gerard on the run out extra pass for Taylor too strong Lehigh the other way with Tyler Whitney Sydney good Look Away pass for Higgins stepping into a long one a big chemistry between those two but able to clean it off the rim as Jesse Edwards Vince very close there was uh almost all the way over the midcourt line as he was shoveling that one back to Gerard feed the post Edwards to a cutting Williams got the bunk but not the basket a chance at the line for Benny Williams in the foul by Dominic Carolyn you know if Jesse Mack can pass out of that little post like that you almost have to give him a touch every third time down the court I mean hes he not only is going to draw a double team hes got great footwork hes you know such a size advantage on JT 10 down low he cant slide with him but they bring help Lehigh and he makes the great pass a pocket pass down to Benny and to me you have to play off Jesse a lot of possession for this team its kind of a misconception is they dont throw it into the big man they certainly do when its a capable player like a Jesse Edwards Rakim Christmas orense over the years you can run the offense through those players and this teams going to have to find a different way they just dont have the catch and Shooters like buddy bayheim and Cole swider were oh for two trip there for Benny Williams if you dont the thing you like about Jessicas starting the game is two for two for the free throw line so its not like youre worried about him getting fouled Music elevation for Evan Taylor but in and out Edwards will have no match around the rim against our Patriot League team good pick and roll nobody there this time either for The twohand Slammer by Jesse Edwards nice Target nice find by Judah getting his first assist in his college career tie the game higginson to 10 who played only about 40 minutes last year started the game tonight and a ball pried Away by Edwards to start the break no numbers but Taylor pulls up from 19 Williams just knocked it against the window but no more Higgins collects for Lehigh lead feed and reverse left thats a good one for Jacob alamudu move there by Jacob to use the rim to negate shot blocking by Jesse all right Gerard always involved early in the offense from the dotted line consorts his body for an awkward shot one the whistle didnt get it Higgins on the diagonal up ahead and Whitney Sydney is able to jam with a celebration here in the dome and Ill tell you what hes cast from The High to pretty athletic as well they get out they take what you give them and theyre not going to make many mistakes I had to talk about a touch every time down Gerard and Edwards are pretty much getting one every time to do it go through your leaders go through your most experienced players Gerard on the retreat the heads by tan Edward was open Gerard bottled up against the double but now Edwards off the rotation great find by Judah Mintz threading the needle into the big fella he made those Four Points by Jesse very easy just throw it right to him and beat him to the rim three at the scores table for Syracuse a site we expect to see a little more often this year than usual foul line jumper Higgins is pure Ill tell you what this back corner Higgins and Taylor youre as good as good as weve seen nobody getting back but Jesse Edwards the half court aliu that will bring him to their feet here at the Dome yeah Applause 10 points already for Jesse Edwards the other three for Joe Gerard the journal almost threw that one in from half court left alone for a reason weak side rebound Williams lets see what Mintz creates has a defender on skates ball and a string out to Gerard from Deep tan recovers the rebound that was pretty ball handling did not bear fruit now mins a little Breakaway here toying with tan gets to the goal and lays it in for his first Syracuse points their defense there stayed within the ball side defeat with Judah hes got great quickness laterally Higgins between the circles for alamodun Edwards nearly stole it again with a little elbow Fade Away got it with the leg up YMCA kind of stuff there hasnt been a whistle in a while we got now we got a hockey change all Five Guys two from Lehigh three from The Qs coming in a tough one in the lane hes gonna take a lot of tough shots it feels like and make his share he ties it again at 17 Applause Beyond The Ark for Whitney Sydney gas man they probably want to follow at this point you know theyve been going three four minutes without a whistle Ive got a media timeout coming up alamodun has it pride free once again by Jesse Edwards active hands on the defensive end but Jesse figures to be one of the better defensive players in the ACC this season but everybodys dragging as you point out lots of hands on these right now turns on the pick and roll gathered but can not get it over the rim Jesse Edwards the leading highest scorer in this game with 10 will be at the line when we come back its been a dunk show Jesse Edwards from close range Lehigh getting its share with Whitney Sydney and the orange connecting out at alleyoop too the center from Amsterdam has shown lots of different ways to be excited about him for this year lets talk about polishing the NBA tape in the first six minutes this game hes done everything Matt blocking shot steals assists a lot of easy dumps obviously but just rolling showing footwork showing length showing athleticism um just the most impressive thing to me though Matt is hes not picking up crazy fouls yeah he hasnt missed a shot hes perfect from the field and two of two at the line where he will return well I look at you know six eleven seven foot without length three of them are dunks and one was a step through on JT tan who cannot side with him at this level uh was isolated with him down low and uh you know listen Lehighs got to figure this out the in his screen and roll youve got to send somebody to them block them you have to double them Jesse also has two boards two Steals and a block played a bit with the Dutch national team in the off season theres his first Miss from anywhere tonight wasnt a lock that Syracuse was going to make the tournament last year with Jesse but they were certainly playing better with him one only three times without him after he went down to the Boston College in early February give Syracuse the lead were approaching the Midway point of the opening half foreign Music 55 at Brown his first action and close to two years he didnt play at all last season due to Victory highly thought it was a spark plug type player for the mountain knocks good ball poke free by Copeland but they got a whistle official Ryan cesado Copeland for his first team coach Manheim with that small forward spot you know you go from Bell to Taylor now Copeland trying to find a spark but one guy that came in leap around the north was really talking about I mean this fishing we talk about Jesse six for six and two exhibition games hes kind of been under the radar pretty cool to not miss a shot good way to not get on the radar but here in San patreon League Higgins who has unlimited range Jesse Edwards claims his third board savior Torrance for his first action veteran from Syracuse transferred back home from Marquette we can also second unit theres the two returning starters three newbies a turnover by Copeland Sinclair on the run out leaves it short Samir Torrance recovers on the push hard to take Gerard and Edwards out of the game at this stage so we theyve been performing early to give him a breather at some point but I agree 15footer no but a foul and thats on me adiasa who picks up his first so from Cameroon raw but you can tell hes got some athleticism I love the spacing of that four guys above the freethrow line letting Jesse operate the previous play they went with the UCLA Cuts I mean Samir Torrance tried to screen across for Jesse theyre doing a lot of different actions to get him involved and this is something we havent seen in yeah yeah you might go back to him or Rick Jackson there hasnt been The Bigs to do this with down on that post area to isolate to give him going oneonone to get him uh to facilitate for other guys on the team perimeter players think his passing ability is one thing thats going to make a difference hes got the hands to catch it in the first place this is a tremendous freethrow shooter no but hes good enough not a liability necessarily and can get the ball to the perimeter that way and maybe it makes your Shooters better the first time is Reed spent in four in brown and a bank shot drops for Keith Higgins Higgins averaged nine points per game last year had 15 double figure games all after Christmas theyve really worked the younger players in the conference season mince rattles one down Syracuse doesnt really have that luxury Matt The Freshman gonna have to play absolutely and I like this combination we talked about Joe coming out you got mints now and Samir in the back court Sameer kind of playing off the ball more as a tomb fake handoff crafty move by alamudu but no finish Applause Torrance finds some help there and looking to distribute Music not seen the judamins longrange shot just yet but from midrange pretty good eight points for the Freshman Judah Mintz dangerous when he gets his confidence going you know hes had some spurts in the exhibition game scoreless and some halves but early steal early he missed easy lamp and hes come back with four points you can see the confidence exuding from him Sinclair shovels it inside and fouls Malik Brown comes up to defend the rim and so he gets his name in the book for the first time as an orange player but Syracuse has taken the lead and a fourpoint cushion as we head to a timeout Brett Reeds team not going away Tom his door was always open I love Syracuse but uh was never about the Clinton glamor and did a lot of things behind the scenes as you said with opening this place and uh the Big East is just a great influence on the Syracuse program think about the first lacrosse national championship and all that followed and right through the mid2000s including the 2003 basketball national championship I remember getting on the plane with him to go to New Orleans foreign was from the 1996 final four so that gives you a little bit of an idea about who Jake krauthammel was and he was as solid as the day was long throw down entry feat here and theyre wise to Edwards Matt as you pointed out you got to roll down to him with him and this time of tackle and they just dont have to have one guy on the Lehigh roster that can contain just gotta start stunting him send somebody faking him uh double him make somebody else beat you from the perimeter yeah Baseline throw in they like that fake with Edwards and why not I mean the hottest hand in the building that one was right off the scouting report we saw that in the exhibition season as well very often this ball was handed to the guard Matt but maybe not this year Jesses got a new um role for this team for being hes very skilled and you have to utilize the best player to me right now interior doing everything and uh a key with him all year is going to be to stay out of foul trouble foul prone youd love them to play 30 35 minutes problem is theres a lot of reaching fouls and trying to block so many shots with this height length State position try to stay in the game and uh this is the first team all ACC guy to me match uh so skilled and could average 20 and 12 something to hang out there for a minute 20 and 12 um I think he could do it wow long jumper for Reed Fenton Off the Mark and Kadir Copeland brings it down the break here just gonna have 20 at Halftime tonight yes I would uh I would take 16 and nine thats what you yes youre looking more down thats still pretty good how about 169 with a guy averaging 20 and 12 but again with him in the foul trouble contention right lets talk about minutes played right correct should have that I mean you know last year averaging 11 12 but again how many games was he saddled on the bench with the clown trouble thats the problem sure Edwards averaged 28 minutes per game can that be 3234 and there are capable backups we will see lunar Hema from Duquesne at some point I would imagine as Mintz is able to make both and hes a double figure score already in his first half of his first game with accuse Claire into Tan in the paint again Edwards defending without fouling able to get a piece up the shot and the rebound the show being put on by Edwards in particular mints as well oh how about that getting high enough and Sinclair on the run out off the marks Im here Torrance oh rebounding Edwards that time its a great ball handler flashy player no doubt a lot of changing gears change of speed and new win there to pull it out I like that thank you Torrance down the alley he forced the issue there got a block call so okay you know instant Scout I can tell you is we are not the athletes of Syracuse has but theyre going to try to take a charge for every play you know right here almost two double Champions Dan came over as the second Defender Shannon Fenton I mean both of them were trying to get a piece of the of the charge call there foul actually went to Fenton his first so Im here Torrance a great steadying influence on this team be exciting to see the role he has Chris Bell back for the Orange is Copeland and myths get a breather forget last year you know same year when buddy was out that Duke game played 44 minutes and thats you know now youre going from you know youre coming off the bench again and youve got 11 assists yeah your role is a little bit different is a highly regarded point guard of course have been seven straight free throws made this one by 10 for the first time Fenton good screen away and the basket for Reed Fenton senior from Latrobe Arnold Palmer country captain under captain of the mountain Hawks were a solid senior and great Paul Trumper off there with the high screen with screen by Edwards horns cant get the bounce Music passed there by sitting there but he does get it down inside front Basket in a foul Ma Applause first points of the Season super pass there between two Defenders and great use of the reverse kiss and now this game you know youre at 10 big possession two times in a row VI scores youre in danger you know its going to go 10 to 16 at halftime now youre right back in this game with a free throw maybe you knock it down to five here Williams is a summoned by the Hall of Famer Moma a first year at Lehigh play converted threestar recruit as you can see here Chris Bellman has not gone in since the first two minutes being pulled out substituted right away by Justin Taylor was not a factor in the exhibition games did start both reflected on its way in a foul Applause Music picks up his second Music Joseph Gerard to the line where he figures to get his share again this year one of the alltime great Syracuse freethrow Shooters 88 last season last season afraid of streets of 20 or 30 in a row sometimes beautiful thing about Joe two Matt is its not sometimes when youre a great shooter like that if you dont get to the line as much Joe finds ways later again you know always likes to contact always trying to get drone of contact and um thats thats important for him to be this team and well lead the ACC and free throw percentage Gerard makes both and Jesse Edwards out of the game for the first time again and Coach behind might be thinking look theres a timeout coming up you could bring him right back in in a little while hed only miss a game a minute of game action but to have uh second break in real time Gerard deflects but cannot Corral the ball over the Baseline figures to be a very capable backup got to go on at the end of the year for Duquesne back in the game for the mountain Hawks and JT tan sits with two foul under five minutes to play in the first long arms and Betty Williams always a problem on the Baseline out of bounds for the opponents Sinclair only 510 to his passing Lanes cut down adiosa loses the grip Lehigh able to get set up here a few times weve seen the two trees out of bounds obviously but orange team but not only mantoback Fenton off the rim and off the hands of EMA starting the break in an opportunity for Gerard Noble foul and another trip to the line for Joe is just two for two player of the problems that theyre gonna try to take the charge and changes his body angle there and going to the charity strike again well you know being an extraordinary shooter the just the trips to the line on easy money and in case of Gerard sometimes he might go a couple games without the attempts either shoot if he can get four or six attempts in here youre pretty much automatically talking about five points right there four five six points I see a lot more of him at the freethrow line this year being as a shooting guard youre running a transition there has to be no look to find him but hes so good at not only his step back but a shot faking to get to the rim that you get youll get to the line three to four times again team has made 12 straight and a nine point cushion for the orange back in for Lehigh hes really their best allaround player preseason allconference jumper from Higgins goes begging and out of bounds to the cues Applause coach Behind still in the year of Benny Williams whos progression we will continue to watch just to show the as a freshman last year and well continue to have Growing Pains but incredible athleticism and potential so heres Gerard giving it to Torrance so that Gerard can spread the floor and Torres doesnt need help this time dropping the three years ago to his game since last year confident I mean now hes moving with Joe a little step back flavor there as well its only three for eight shooting from long range last season shot a little bit more from Deep with Marquette Syracuse had other options last year maybe this year could use him ringing the bell is uh bube Moma his second field goal Gerard short on the turnaround Hema gives him another chance deflected Hema collection lays it in for his first points and that Hema is rewarded Matt great offensive rebound right away looking for drone from three got it back a little Karma there off an offensive rebound by Joes Drive zone now into the corner and look at the length in the back which Benny Williams and Chris Bell Higgins too strong a guard rebound for Torrance and eyes up as he gets things started Williams in the middle not the best shot the orange could have gotten on that trip Williams won the foul so an empty trip there for the orange in the transition game but theyve opened up a 12 point lead at Syracuse 38 Lehigh 26 and the hoefer not amused at the moment Gerard may be not far behind and weve seen some good minutes from Simon Torrance Off the Bench of late I really have uh hes kind of been there as a shooting guard point guard but a great rebounding Matt and a big three year big two minutes 30 seconds here for Lehigh to try to get back in this ball game you dont want to go attack down a big double figure number Lehigh forced to move it around here against the zone and coughing it up and you know certainly in this town Matt theres always the debate should or would the orange break away from their commitment to his own defense and Coach behind talk about playing man this year and uh has already indicated that theyre going to do that but zone offense cant be very well schooled this early in the season for these opposing teams theres Chris Bells first points big big for him interesting comment you made because I think the vi came in here eyes lit up see mantoman they ran their sets all of a sudden you know six minutes ago in this half you go to the The Zone on the out of bounds theyve not scored on him its hard to come right in and feel like you gotta have some patience here and they cycle it around Syracuse obviously well schooled in the rotation and decent look that time for Tyler Whitney Sydney but he could not connect gonna have to go in the half neither team is taking the time out Chris Bell online drive this time a bit short I like it though make one get a heat check and stymied at The Rim munir Hema of the block hes shot clock though turn on that one blocked again by move Gerard Bell almost pulled again now he does the foul line thats rejected the party at the moment three three will not be blocked oh dear Hema transfer from Duquesne representing uh the Steel City here with the rejections well done length I mean just the first one the physicality you go up in the second which is coming out of nowhere Applause time out by uh Lehigh in this situation and so near theyll play this high school ball in New Jersey but uh really at the end of the year with Duquesne those numbers dont tell the whole story averaging two points three because uh as the season closed the last seven games or so he played significantly more for the Dukes what a great asset to have you know he transfers in late um and you know again Jesse bean and having the injury last year final problems I mean this guy is a great person to go to Off the Bench to give you the eight to ten fifteen minutes if need be but uh noses roll hes not the offensive no asset that you can have with Jesse but he can do so much down on the defensive ending he Alters all those shots jump shots and trying lips it runs by 15 Lawrence stumbles along the Baseline and that one out of bounds to Lehigh go a little too fast gotta slow down use that double leg stop and uh you cant come in in the air of it either scoring pass you have to finally you know where youre going with before you get into that Dremel on that Baseline that Baseline close up awful fast in college basketball first action for Lehighs Jake betlow senior guard two in brown Jalen Sinclair and its a year injury is up bellows in there to space the floor you can tell already but maybe getting a two for one here this loader doesnt go the shot clock is just a second ahead great patience thats senior leadership you know you dont want to go too early did that in the exhibition game right he knows a clock youre probably gonna go with about seven seconds not panicking either Gerard goes with seven and hits from long range Gerard the third and double figures for the cues in the first half final seconds of the half dwindle out and the orange go into the break with their biggest lead of the game so far thats huge thats a senior leadership Matt you know this is such a great find right here Jesse with the dunk but here the senior leadership Vince its coming down to Jesse all first half with a great jump there the orange scoring which is amazing but uh really Lehighs got to shoot better they have one for ten from three really struggling from the field cant get anything going against man early were getting midrange jumpers no threes against the Zone maybe scored against the Zone one time for the last eight minutes of this first half behind the first possession of the second half goes right in to uh Dominic Carolyn fouled by Benny Williams so youre going to whistle uh come in the paint youre thinking of Jesse Edwards is picking the foul in that first half he drew five fouls and committed zero the orange as a team only with five thousand you know doubled up with 10 called against them so maybe a little conversation with the referees at halftime or Music behind not many photos theyve shot apparel on a 72 percent foul shooter last year Junior from British Columbia has four points in the game now Syracuse had its biggest lead there at the half 18 same starting five as the first half comes out of the second Bell into Williams with his back to the basket and a cutting Essie Edwards draws another foul the sixth that he has drawn and into the line again Tyler Whitney Sydney this time picks up his second commercial pop right there Lehigh or jt10 you got to see the ball we just jump to it played good aggressive defense on just so why not a huge threat there though but as soon as the pass was made to the left side turn his head just back door cut Applause 15point night already for Jesse Edwards whos still 19 and a half minutes to play doesnt take long to reload for the second free throw already nine freethrow attempts for Jesse in the game hes getting 910 foul shots a game that means hes doing work hes building up fouls on the opposition as well its getting close to that four points away from averaging 20 now for the one first game just kind of get those oh you said it was only after the first game I thought its going to start you you know yeah its like golf if you dont Bernie the first hole you cant Bernie alone theres another deep three by Higgins his first of the game theyve had a couple from long range Keith Higgins knocked down 48 threepointers last year Lehigh theyve just one of his previous attempts threes prior to that and Benny Williams had the feet going a little quickly before putting that one on the deck talk about your first hole birdie there Fairway Music Applause Music its perfect California flavor on this team Higgins Applause Dr Taylor here from the Chicago area lefthanded jump shot out front Jesse Edwards boards the miss June immense down the alley gotta stop him and they cannot mince with his first point of the half Music I think its turns down the tan screen here extra pass for Peril in but he was out of bounds along the way and have those on the court recognition were right there early timeout taken by Brett Reed the Lehigh coach to see if he cant stop a little sour momentum here at the beginning of the half lets see what Reid Cooks up in the education continues never know theres going to be a surprise but you go with the Blue Bloods Carolina Duke but the equation to all these teams especially Syracuse is what are the freshmen going to do in their first years have good contributions from First Years in this game could he shoot him in on the ball now Joe Girard pretty good 13 for gerardis knocked down three triples stressed on that its not a true jump shot search watching them pregame and its just almost a quick set shot hes released so quick to find the threads of the ball and its gone he needs it just a split second tan with a forearm shiver into the chest of Benny Williams Music Keith Higgins has range from right there is one of the perilous Sidewinder barely draws iron tan goes to save it and steps on the line though Joseph Gerard a 10point first half and a late closeout here Lehigh has to pay cant give him an inch hes coming off that down screen and perfect angle right there loves to theres a point guard shooting more top threes now as a shooting guard youre gonna get more of those 45 degree angle wings and threes no Williams Returns the favor with a little push off on the offhand gets his first points of the season oh isolation play there and missed his first three good to see him get his first field goal now a steal for Chris Bell in the passing Lane whats he got he settles with the bank shot another timeout taken by coach Reed didnt nothing 24point lead and uh you know the momentums all Syracuse his way but great denial pass right here outside hand goes all the way thought he was looking for the dunk but its wise just to lay it in to avoid the block shot and then excited Chris Bell clapping for himself nine nothing scoring Run for the orange to open this one up to a 24point lead about everybody kind of develops at a different pace when do you feel comfortable when do you feel like youve made it or you know youre fully fledged Bell did not have a great exhibition season and so the Clapping is kind of getting him going a little bit hes not shy you know hes made threes you know sparingly obviously but sparingly but he just he he tells it when he made his first one tonight the next two were forced but he felt like it was a heat check but he just wants to get it going you could tell in practice Im sure he can make three or four or five in a row but as a freshman its hard to find minutes youre not youre no longer the guy thats going to score 20 a game in high school bell not the only freshman of the starting lineup Judah mitz long anticipated throughout the recruiting battles considered the Pittsburgh Wake Forest among others and well be one to watch throughout the year and you may have a couple of special players here so uh it can change pace and angles so fast and at times we get out of control but that midrange jumper is really tough to stop and uh thats thats a really tough to defend yeah I like this idea of picking up 80 90 feet from the basket we havent seen that in a while better be confident to do that and capable to get burned in a hurry hes shot by belly in front of the post and a clear path for Edwards to do his thing the last line of defense standing large at the rib s wow thats walled up right there its great when hes not foul trouble you can go attack like that defensively opposite and the jumper is down for Evan Taylor first points of the half for Taylor third Team all Patriot League last year expected to surpass that this season Williams cooking now with a shirt untucked Applause yeah Applause Benny worry about the call he didnt get the foul on a fade away you know and then Taylors running right by him yeah Taylor the layup there back to back baskets for Lehigh forcing a timeout for Coach bayheim here best opportunity for the orange after a missed shot giving up a deuce but this block and so much of the play of Jesse Edwards had well buy a bed with that or Kleiner put it right into the Powerball right yeah thats true enough to get your attention got the Good Vibes going nearly had a fan hit from half court a little while ago too fans are in midseason form orange looking to get the sharp edge back have seen the lead drop to 19 good wrap around passing there for mints to Edwards they havent had an answer for him tonight foreign Applause something youre concerned about uh uh something we should be watching for well heres a play like that right hows that for at least perfect time uh yes just careless errors I mean you start preseasons okay ACC you get into it you cant throw the ball over you know you have to have a good assistant turnover ratio careless passes and also getting others involved first thats tough for him because hes been a great scorer in a highly ranked player in high school but you know theres guys to feed Joe and Jesse and others and um tough to do and its officially Three assists two turnovers tonight from the right corner his third three of the game long distance makes last year Evan Taylor Lederman personally everything last year scoring rebounding blocks and steals in the lane Vince once again drawing contact lets type A guy who looks for the contact when he gets in the pain Music stripped down her guard as youve known but uh tried to the Lane and and got bailed out a little bit before she would have missed 10 points in the first half just two in the second thank you free throw perfect emphasis product as you talked about of the DMV Fort Washington Maryland Oak Hill Academy close there so hes playing high school ball at a very high level a national level is coming in freshman year of pearl Washington right Tyler Ennis yeah Music foreign Applause Applause Music here we go Higgins with a sudden Edwards not the guy you want carrying it there theres where he gets it almost Gerard its amazing yeah these two have and Joe called for that ball at half court and just uh hell kind of actually pulled that ice off but uh did the right thing and threw it right towards the rim and Jesses gonna finish all those Tyler Whitney and theyve been playing together a long time certainly the guard big man relationship important on every team is Whitney Sydney uses every bit of the ram to get his first point in the second half thanks do so much you know theyre going to rebound for you theyre constantly in the trenches almost like offensive defensive lineman and football and then you can get them out on a run throwing up towards the rim you have to reward him Whitney Sydney makes both theres a guy that just came on in The Patriot League season last year for Dr Brett Reeds who started the last 18 games Gerard with a heat check passed it down this time heres an awkward looking shot but not this time for him hes able to get it in the contacts still not deterred continues to get his points in threes its amazing um yeah the the confidence of Joe you know you lose coal and you lose buddy Jimmy and now youre hooked at as the guy and he has more of a green light you can tell you know hes gonna make be able to make some mistakes and that does kudos for a shooter to know that he can do that and uh you know we talked about Jesse averaging 20 hes got a chance to do it too hes gonna have two 20point scorers on this team because theyre gonna get the majority of the minutes youre gonna have three guys averaging six feet I dont see a third one okay I see two of them to have a chance its gonna be the Golden State Warriors turnover by Gerard and running the break thats roll reversal Whitney Sydney couldnt get it down neither Taylor tan good enough for his first points of the game c10b roval factor in the Patriots just a little I dont know too much athleticism in this game and not enough height off the elbow Edwards trying to get it going with Benny Williams this time Taylor is right there with Joe Gerard and under thrown on that Cross Court pass it is a Gerard turnover for Higgins against Judah Mintz Steve Higgins gets the nine points last years scoring average a sixnothing run for the mountain highs he has a great motive a very active on the ball Defender off the ball getting deflections Williams left alone and unable to handle that amount of space a couple of travels in this second half for Benny Williams Music as soon as he saw me he knew he was coming out Ive been around the block enough to know that leave action for Lehigh up top as we hit the 12 minute remaining Mark Jalen Sinclair back in fresh Shanks the jumper Jesse Edwards headed to a double double tonight Torrance Taylor Brown three Subs in the game at the moment rounds down the alley got his own and the tip is there very athletic from Elite Brown so hes opened his account first field goal weve seen him Miss but hes right there with the Moses Mullen offensive rebound to Pat the offensive rebounds thats get a nice tip in put it right back he did not miss any of his shots the two exhibition games the orange played against division two teams well Brett Reed trying to see his team through to the Finish Joe Gerards put out a show in the orange are headed to 10 uh will be a tough guard you know as you get into conference taller shooting guards with him but listen the way he moves and sets his man up and just a quick flick of the wrist hes a hes a tough guard for anybody in the country to get a sense and hes really excited about a new role playing off the ball its kind of more of a scorer than having to consider himself for bringing the ball up and distributing has had a couple of turnovers in this game and the orange turn it over in this case Vince Torrance guards at the moment with brown and Taylor on the wings and Edwards still in there one rebound shy of a doubledouble Evan Taylor heating up hes got a teamhigh 17 for Lehigh quarter of the game to go came an advertised Matt just uh does a lot of different things and distinct Advantage being a lefthander its about time thats viewed as an advantage kind of got a little I dont know if you like this analogy but really hope Jalen Rose to his game just funky and six six seven long link yeah nice little pulp jumper like Jalen Rose back in the day of the Fab Five a good one Ireland had to poked out Malik Brown on the Breakaway Nifty play for the jam thats just pilfering too The Freshman with his second basket of the night Taylor had something to say about it though Dylan could shoot like that too hes got the whole game hes very no motion to him misses a shot makes her shot love guys like that you dont know uh barely breaking the sweat but plays hard defensively as well off to curl shoot events that was 16 points in the game running right nearly another steal by Brown who figures to be a plus Defender Jesse Edwards just got called for his first foul tonight I see Edwards picks up his first foul with nine minutes to go I think you like your chances well I I dont think hes ever not had a foul with nine minutes to go in the first half how about that lets start there check that out music Al foul trouble with reaches tough doing a great job tonight Carolyn doesnt get the bounce Edwards has drawn seven thousand committed one JT 10 back to Beach California Native and a lesson for Audrey ariasa nice project for Coach Reed and Lehigh fun to follow them in the Patriot though I think that they you know they will be the top tier they did beat Colgate last year give them a run the Patriot league as you know Matt and summoned in these onebid leagues it just comes down to how well do you play in the tournament but in the regular season can you earn the right to host and get a higher seed for that tournament Elaine Edwards just working his way to the basket pick up that offensive rebound there it was they with the orange underneath that that magical 20 points right there got a couple shots out hes going for the 20 and 10 you suggested maybe you could average 20 or 12 Taylor had the ball knocked out Taylor on Taylor there along the Baseline I was wondering maybe if you thought they were playing NBA minutes 48minute games or no just just feel like its a key for him to stay out of bottle trouble its gonna be the key much better shape ready to go this year your lips to Gods ears Lawrence on the scoop shot switching hands and getting it off the glass Music hesitation right there all right gets the shoulders through and notice the left hand you know with the right and then the angle lets get you that foul in one bring it right back into the Defender is side tries to uh a little practice nine points right now match his career high and theres a new one with 10 most points hes ever scored in a college game either Marquette or Syracuse the outcome of this one not in doubt well see if yours finish strong did not necessarily do that in the last exhibition game jt10 and if he moved around the rim he matches his career high he played sparingly last year hes got four points on this one see if Taylor could get going the only freshman whos played but hasnt scored Tyler Whitney Sydney full speed behind the back dribble Edwards left the Baseline open for Taylor but with good reason and it takes it away another trying to get Taylor going here Torrance directing traffic off the screen siber is very thoughtful on the cordon off thinking about that down inside Edwards to Brown for the jam close to post passing great unselfish play there by Jesse knowing the doubles coming and doing it on both things with a with a black steel in the sand from long range Jalen Sinclair long rebound Torrance starts the break two on one with mitts going high couldnt finish it along the Baseline when the ball came down that gives it to Lehigh and then says work on his left shoe but uh smiling appears to be okay thats huge if Colgate wasnt the next game would they be on there if they didnt beat Syracuse last year thats the question but thats uh itll be cold its Fourth game and Syracuse is second High status with all those other Blue Bloods action here as Lehigh looks to finish the game strong they play at Virginia Tech Thursday Luke Brown with some good run here late in the game no doubt you have four four freshmen in there man of our three freshmen at transfer and uh sent me a towards senior senior point guard but good minutes for these guys to show they should be getting more minutes had a nice shift in the first half Aaron pass from Copeland was a little risky got it back quick zip from Torrance to Brown and Malik across the foul gets a chance at the line that seems to be one of those guys that wont be able to create his own shot but in his length hes always in the right spot you know just the ball kind of finds him on offensive rebounds and put backs and uh solid solid player havent seen him really shoot much but at 6 10 you dont really need to shoot much out of the paint but very impressive as a freshman scoreboard quickly must have been a great game tonight Colgate lost by one at Buffalo 8887 but were getting the juices flowing as the season opens thats a great challenge for both of those teams Matt langels Squad looks to be starting four seniors Tucker Richardson among the cream of the Patriot league and Colgate will be coming in here on a winning streak in the alltime series with Syracuse next week Applause Torrance to Taylor theyre trying to get Taylor going he gets the score in this game same with Goodyear Copeland so correct myself two freshmen that have played but havent scored to Brown those for the hot hand lately This Time In Too Deep on the moon with the rebound Sinclair has gone quite a scoring spell all of this game and then did not play last year played only 12 games the year prior to show them some promise Matt turn to the corner good frame more defense good steals a lot of little pulps early but um you know struggling with a shot lately but yes its a good one to punch for Lehigh turn around Ford Taylor at his first points its that midrange kind of that fade aways of the Kobe move you know the fade away that you stole from Michael Jordan but that Taylors shot three shots like that tonight two of them in short thats your standard catch and shoot kind of guy Copeland disruptive along the base line spins it in off the glass pretty moved by Jacob on the moon another Californian on this team from hunting the beach whats up Copeland spinning into his own shot all 10 in the books and Coach going out going to the 11th and 12th man here with four minutes to go weve yet to see John Bola jock and Peter Kerry but they are at the scorers table so hell be hell start his post game press confer some comments on Jake proud handle you can rest assured of that but that I think coach mayheim will be pleased for the most part that everybody got their first basket of the Season out of the way and that only had a moment uh that they could be happy about but still plenty to coach off of as well I really thought first game if this was Titan played seven eight guys but hes played the full time you know while theyre able to end the bench with starters like Gerard and Edwards on the bench sure sure theres two for a takedown in the backcourt and itll be Lehigh basketball when we return for the final segment of this one for Jim behind itll be his 42nd opening win and 47 tries the orange against Leon for Misericordia and Marist three first three home games Misericordia Marist and Monmouth there you go 3M fighting cougars of his recording will be should fall victim to the mountain highs so also our empty resume play on Sesame Street here at the JMA Wireless though Jacob uh alamudu foul thatll take to the basket Peter Kerry recently into the game Justin Taylor Peter Kerry and John bowler jock the last off the bench for the orange carry a lot of Promise Matt but uh youll see hell have to grow into it a bit and look the love is athleticism uh you know hes gotten a lot better he was injured through his high school years and um very impressed you know I know you cant put a lot on warmups but very athletic and uh goes hard in every drill and thats important to get better but obviously a frame you can build on and uh you will see that usually that sophomore junior year here in Syracuse when they start adding the pounds and the muscle Applause its our ball back to foreign Torrance trying to get a jock a free look here and uh down inside by Jalen Sinclair its called for his second person most teams in this Patriot league would give anything for Jumbo or jock and yeah Peter carry it in have these guys in the not only in a rotation they would most likely start from such a level of becoming Syracuse has been doing but this is the 11th and 12th men on this orange team John ball with the member bounce since 1111 different scores yeah were kind of getting the baller he pure carrier Music Applause offensive rebound Copeland and another trip to the line is earned tell the difference in size strength athleticism the uh you have players are having a hard time defending without fouling andreasa picks this one up at your Copeland to the line a jock played this high school ball near Philadelphia a Philadelphia native Lehigh down that way as well Ben canosterman into the game sophomore from Dayton replacing James Sinclair Copeland does his thing at the line Four Points there for Coldplay I love it look at it hes a big guard up at the top looking for steals six four very a lot of length in the back right now too with yeah Carrie and Jack and Taylor a couple of those guys you can probably broke him and said it earlier you can play one through four not one starter in the game right now with three minutes to go Look Away past there it might not have been his best idea and its going the other way with Jake bettlow uh to read Fenton the captain connects smooth jumper I think uh Copeland there is looking maybe to get Peter on the scoring calm and an unselfish pass there on the fast break find the same colored shoes they have a little connection there with the pink Music push off in the rebutting action against Ben kenoseman just into the game Music side out here so this uh his free throws for the jock ey just Relentless there was a another discussion yesterday pregame he is among those wolf and those Eagles fans are pretty excited about the first half Championship that they won in the NFL coach mayheim getting into it a little bit in practice yesterday as they were stretching I dont think theres a trophy just yet never long range jumper here finds its all Jake bettlow and uh deck that Blair was I believe was Beaumont Music got some contact around his face and eyes and betlow able to convert as the teams repair to their corners for a moment for uh Bulma to be taken care of if there was anything untoward this officiating curve well Matt the takeaways from this one in a way are going to be a lot more pleasant than the the exhibition season am I right I agree I thought after Southern New Hampshire that they really struggled to score the basketball in the second half and uh thats I think it was intentional but no upgrade but uh yeah I think a lot of takeaways are you know Jesse and Joe were the real deal and the offense is around them and others kind of uh mints stepped up today I really thought as the third kind of guy and uh Syracuse um you know they look pretty good playing both man and Zone I was impressed with it uh guys are playing hard you have an athletic team and and all 10 guys have scored the 11th the only one that has is Peter Carey which have an opportunity next two minutes but youve got a lot of capable bodies that you can go tendy two minutes to go Copeland tried to Force One in to carry and the Lehigh wise to that Music Fenton trying to get to his office here this right perimeter three taking up front by betlo got boxed out for the board and around the helping the orange out there but itll be a underneath throw in for the mountain Hawks with 133 to play Applause first Jason seigel into the game replacing Fenton knossman the trigger man along the Baseline Temple hard 21 in Brown at the freethrow line guys getting some run here in the dome and psycho able to connect from distance tough to do to sit uh the whole first half 20 minutes and then almost 18 and a half in the second you come in and drill that three in the corner especially here where its hard to gauge the depth perception and all of that on the long range shots a jock will take his own long range and rattle it down hes going to let you know about him very excited very excited hey uh shot clock screwy never reset a little more time for John Ball to bask in the glow heres a guy his Tommy conif comes in Matt 44 in brown along with Brendan Reed son of the coach Brett Reed conniff looks like he might develop into something 611 see a ton of that in the Patriot League you get some skill and some athleticism at that size and the frame founder shop Locker absolutely shoulder frame yeah he doesnt weigh 190 pounds good frame and looking for the ball in the Baseline 10 on the shot clock read the Cardiff got a steal by Taylor momentarily John Balls got other ideas shovel ahead to Copeland for the reverse kiss its fun to watch hes just hes playing all the way hard and putting on a show but uh does it the right way hes not hes not Id love to play with him hes very unselfish but just fun to watch Applause Copeland gives a foul here Copeland what a great open floor player multiskilled and magic Syracuse basketball yeah a little Up and Under a little Flair and coaches tell him get back on D I love that guy now caught him had it blocked by Kerry a second so this one will come down on a special night in the books its number 999 for Jim behind central New Yorkers and orange fans around the world are thinking about an even number already with 1100 wins to his credit since
