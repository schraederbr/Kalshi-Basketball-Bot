its an elimination game if you will this things must win yeah both teams definitely need to win probably because we talking about January how huge it is to get that o off your record and we will watch this backcourt matchup and two highs scoring guards for both clubs and it is an early a Louisville turnover and those are the things Ryan that have plagued this Louisville team is that those early turnovers because youre taking possessions away and for a team that sometimes struggles to score you have to be able to get to your offense 15 in blue is the Freshman low thrusted into the starting lineup for the first time this season Hinson for three in and out no good and how about Diaz Graham with an offensive rebound the sevenfooter inside its Austin for three no good another offensive rebound and good and we talked about H and for a GU has been struggling to see the ball going to the basket its always good to get some easy ones get that layup going and allows you to build up a little confidence early and it is another Louisville turnover Austin with the twoand slammer and Austins one of those guys that can drift out in the three but you see him get that steal go up high for it Kenny pay doesnt like what he sees from his Cardinal team one minute and 3 seconds into the game and we have a Louisville timeout well heres the thing is the its basically the energy that theyre showing because again for pit they come out with that sense of energy theyre hitting the offensive glass and then when you look also as the early turnovers thats not a good sign for for Louisvilles team Brian were talking about 63 seconds in what message can Kenny Payne possibly send to his team in 63 seconds into the game well to settle down because obviously you hear the chatter thats going around the fact that they have not had an ACC Victory you want your young back to be able to make sure that youre running your offense and then you have to limit them this pit team is one of the best in the league at offensive rebound so two possessions a two turnovers for Louisville Applause yovanovich shot clock and it is a Pitsburg turnover good defensive sequence by Louisville and again for Kenny Payne you want to be able to limit pit for touching the paint because again this is a team that shoots a lot of Threes but in order to do that you got to have the breakdowns and force the help now Pittsburgh does lead the ACC in rebounding and rebounding margin Johnson for three Austin skies for the rebound and here comes Carrington hes fun to watch with the basketball little slip screen and Austin with four quickies and one of the things weve talked about bu kinging is his scoring but his vision and how hes able to get everyone involved again you see how hes a the thread the needle early on that one Clark into the paint and yovanovich draws the foul and Carrington as I said triple double in his very first game I think everyone thought he would be good but how about this good well you see the dime he drops off to a slashing Austin Austin does a great job of being able to finish around the rim but then carington no one thought that he would be this good and have an early impact as he has already yovanovich just two free throws on the entire season he is now two of three from the charity strike and Kenny Payne will go to his bench early as Caleb Glenn will be coming into the ball game yovanovich makes a pair and yovanovich will take a quick seat and get a message from coach Payne Caleb Glenn was one of the players that Kenny Payne talked about he thought that could be a player that can impact this game especially with the weak of practices hes had pit will shoot the three as many as 30 a game but both all baskets have come inside today and its another pit turnover Here Comes sky Clark the other Applause Applause way and nearly a third Cardinal Applause turnover Clark Applause Johnson with a fade away C it nice shot by Johnson and thats started by Clark with the penetration you force Pit to have to converge allows Johnson to be able to touch the paint Nice Shot acrobatic move so since that timeout four straight for Louisville message received by the Cardinals Diaz Graham thinks about the three and and how about the start from Zach Austin and Austins that guy is like you know catch me outside because Im feeling it already seven points hes been the the the L Offensive start for for pit right now he averages seven a game James drives the athletic guard off the glass and in lot to like about Mike James and heres the thing about this pit defense is that theyre going to limit you on the perimeter Louisville is doing a better job since that time out timeout of being able to hunt the paint and get to the cup Zack Austin the transfer from high point seven quick ones for the Panthers nearly I said almost made it 10 wide open Applause three well the Panthers we know they will fire it up from behind the ark already a handful of Threes this one finds nothing but the bottom next hammering at home its a high octane showdown in Winston Salem outlet for w look out when wga popular in Miami battle Hunter salers and Wake Forest nothing but the bottom of

it all comes in to focus wccb News at 10 were just what you need ACC basketball on the CW is brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 10050 years and how about the offensive spark for the Panthers and head coach cable from Zack Austin he averages seven a game he has seven in the first four minutes Brian I know your choice of drink you know in the summertime might be a Seven and Seven but how about Zack Austin starting off today you talk about only seven points a game but I love his energy and theyve done a good job of being able to get him started the Panthers have already fired up four threes make it five Diaz Graham front rims it and here come the Applause cards Clark and the hype from carington able to save it Diaz Graham up ahead throws it away Diaz Graham couldnt get that out to Hensen but heres the thing when I look for Louisville Ryan is the fact that this is a team thats running their offense and theyre trying to get into the gaps we talked about the fact that with pit theyre going to limit you for what you want to do on the perimeter but Kenny Payne has them coming out focus on Shifting the pit defense and trying to get into those gaps the feder RICO Federico the Junior from Helsinki Finland into the game for the Panthers and Glenn thought about three Clark takes Applause three and low looks to push the other way Louisville down to seven scholarship players well get into that in a minute Hinson for three book it all net and those are the looks that you want to get for Henson you saw low break down the defense you passed up a good shot for a better shot Hensons off to a good shot because a good start because his ability to knock down some early shots a look out if Hinson starts to heat up and an offensive foul on Mike James his first actually they will tab Caleb Glenn with his first personal yeah Caleb Glen got a little anxious over there trying to set that screen for Clark you know those are those turnovers that frustrate coaches because what it does is it takes the possibility of a shot possession right there but you got to be happy if youre Kenny pay that youre able to at least run your offense and Curtis Williams number one in white into the game for Louisville carington Jacks a three oh it is on fire yeah thats one of the things again at 65 can have the switch can get his shot I love how bu Harrington has been able to balance getting everyone going and getting his offense as Applause well now Pittsburgh shooting woses have led to the 0 and three start in ACC play and how about Williams Off the Bench and into the scoring book yeah comes right Williams comes right in Louisville doing a better job and you see them running their offense get some things to go you see Bob Carrington losing his shoes I always have to get it my my my eth grader my daughter does not tie her shoes and its interesting you see a lot of the players this days they dont really tighten those shoes and you see them losing more often than not how do you play without tying your shoes I mean you know what my shoes are not tied right now so Im hoping they dont slip off during the game now P loves to shoot it from behind the arc oh henon thought about it from the logo shot clock at 10 low into the lane and an instant presence from Williams Off the Bench James in the open court from the glass and in thats where you get going when you turn good defense into offense Louisville getting the stop getting out in transition you see they giv pit different looks Kenny pay talked about with them having a short rotation theyll mix up the man in the zone and playing a little Zone Carrington can hit another offensive rebound for the Panthers hitson into the lane throws it off now Johnson one on Three thinks better of it slay and a unbelievable block from feder Rico excuse me Austin Austin at the other end oh he cannot miss Austin is filling it Ryan comes up with a big block on one end Z Austin with Applause 10 the Winston Salem transfer from High Point Zack Austin with 10 in the first seven minutes of the contest and that will be a foul on feder Rico so Austin doing it at both ends defense leads to offense yeah you see Austin on the recover with the big block and then a lot of times when you Trail the offense you see right there on the break Austin being able to square It Up Knocked Down at three was like Hey do you see me if you dont feel me Im in a nice little Groove well what a developing story averaging seven points a game 10 points in the first 10 minutes but Austin picks up the hand check foul there now on 55 sa Austin we talked about both teams and how desperately they need this win Ryan both teams coming out with the energy but its pit that seems like theyve been able to do a better job of being able to score Louisville is doing better as far as putting the ball on the floor but its the threepoint shooting that seemed to be the difference in this game Brian obviously you were a great great alltime shooter at Georgia Tech and into the ba and playing professionally pit shoots 30 a game 33s a game they fancy themselves as a really good shooting team but they havent fallen the last couple games was it just a matter of time as a shooter was that they were going to start to go in well heres the thing you you heard Jeff cable talk about them getting Inward and sometimes you get a little frustrated you get your head down when shots dont go you have to stay with what youre doing and believe and its the quality of shot that you see pit getting in this first half touching the paint and passing making the extra pass that you just see Austin getting it over to Diaz Graham now the Panthers not shy from behind the ark Louisville struggling on the offensive endes in a hurry the big fella inside Huntley Hatfield and what a dime by Clark because what he did he was able to pull two guys you saw Huntley being able to drop get down low DED it off to him and again Louisville even though theyre trailing in game much better at being able to attack the paint and the quality of shots are a lot better than what theyve got in the last two games Austin In and Out Boy he is feeling it he looked at his hand was like you know I expected that would go thats how when youre feeling Applause hot Glen thinks about it not really his game and then has it stripped another Cardinal turnover Diaz Graham gives it right back Williams in the open court oh nice you see Williams come there on the break and it throws around his back and again one of the differences for Louisville in the first half is their ability to be able to turn good defense into offense and you you see this Louisville crowd showing their Live Again Louisville doing a good job of being able to get the fan base involved yeah coming to their feet in the up Music Center dad you okay its our phone Bill we pay for things that we dont need loaded bundles The Reckless spending no

thinks shes at a resort again yeah she told me when youd rather not resort to a virtual Resort this is much better in real life it matters where you stay looking good babe Hilton for the stay Ryan bur back with Brian Oliver Zach Austin did not score against North Carolina he only took two shots against Syracuse nine points was three for three from behind the ark hes looked really aggressive and right looks like he came in this game understand I got to get a little get back we wondered if not having ishmail lean those 12 points how would it impact this pit team but right now its been Zack Austin in this first half thats basically given Jeff cable that shot in the arm of all that they really needed he did cut his hand there that is what caused the stop in the action to attend to that right hand a trainer is going to stop the bleeding probably put some kind of wrap on it but that might be the only thing that slows down Zach Austin and and dont think that because hes feeling it hes not anxious to get back into the game because when you get in a Groove you want to be able to get back in the game you dont want to take a chance and lose in whatever momentum youve already established William jeffris into the game for the Panthers the Eerie McDow Applause product and he draws the personal foul on yovanovich crowd one in the traveling yeah I thought yvanovich was able to stay there and that last little push right that little nudge at the end he played solid defense for the most part but Kenny pay has talked about the fact that you want to stay in vertical you dont want to give give them extra opportunities I thought that yovanovich did a solid job that last time on Applause D coach Payne trying to get his team to fight fight fight a young team has to learn how to scratch and Claw every second of every game oh low from distance Jen low I thought that hes come out and hes Let The Game come to him hes been able to get everyone else going and you said that last time caring to penetrates a little bit gets him an uncontested three pit five of 12 from behind the arc and yovanovich loses it low to the ground digs out another loose Music ball great Inside Outside Inside Federico feder Rico beautiful high low you see Diaz Graham be able to get the ball over to feder Rico that play basically was started with Shifting the defense and a nice dive cut so just like that five quickies from the Panthers and what was a fourpoint lead and a pit timeout it balloons that quick Brian heres the thing pit is playing as well as they can on both ends of the floor if youre Louisville stick with the script dont get impatient shot clock it one airball shot clock does yovanovich have to shoot it I would have thats what I was thinking about he made the attempt right there I like the kick out but he could have gone up and because maybe draw the foul right there but again we always talk about how good this pit team is on their rotations theyre doing a solid job of forcing Louisville to get to the second and third options plus he finds Huntley Hatfield who has to Jack a three with one on the shot clock four different Panthers have knocked down a threepointer here in the first 10 minutes I thought it interesting we talked with Jeff Cap we talked about how his te have been knocked back a little bit with the two losses Syracuse and and North Carolina but offensively theyve been able to get whatever they wanted you see a little Runner that couldnt go by low and Jaylen low with the floater but it will be a foul underneath on Huntley Hatfield number five Huntley Hatfield and that will be his second and hell have to head to have a seat next to coach Payne yeah thats a big blow for for louisv begin because again with a short rotation and Huntley half field is theyre big and that forces Louisville to have to go small now a really small and Diaz Applause Graham Applause jeffris and the offensive rebounding its always a story for pit great pass from Johnson talking about a dime how about Johnson threading the needle how did he see him Brian man talking about it getting the through the needle has a wonderful pass and a better finish lead is seven Applause low Carrington for three and Johnson looks to come the other Applause way another look well weve talked about the fact for Louisville how they get in transition how about that threat the needle from Johnson to Glenn for the Finish if Kenny pay this is what you want to do you want to get out get those easy ones to go because again for a team thats trying to find a win Ryan getting that confidence and getting this crowd before uh behind you is is a Applause must a great match up here of young Applause guards Carrington oh hes got a great midrange game and its nice because again you get a paint touch and get to De G uh Graham Force the defense to help a little bit and then you get a little midrange Applause jumper now the Panthers have not seen the ball go through the net at this rate in some kind of time Williams in and Applause out Henson thinks about Applause it and Carrington will reset Applause things oh wow I thought hon may have traveled before the bump what you think and well get a look at that when we come back right now it is all Panthers by nine on the CW Dad Im a cop youre not a cop you have a bad not yet not ever were not partners shes a con artist her particular

weve got you covered lets take a look at our Pacific Life game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial security for more than 150 years Brian I get the idea this would be an offense youd like to play in the Panthers on Pace forget this 53o attempts oh without a doubt because again you know its the the quality of shots that theyre getting R because again when people think about them throwing up shots is how theyre getting these threes they doing a good job of being able to balance transition threes touch the paint making the extra pass I love the fact that Jeff cable Squad passes up good shots for better shots and its the quality of shots that theyre getting I think theres such a thing you could draw a line in the sand of the Steph Curry era and the threepoint shot the idea of a team shooting 50 threes in a game seems absurd but everyone can shoot from behind the ark now well this its a point of emphasis on all levels of the game because whats a lost start is the midrange because now what you looking at is that the analytics say that you go and put up the volume of Threes And what you see with this team thats what theyre doing they get the volume up but its how theyre getting the threes well this is one of the nigas for the Panthers is uh Hinson from the free throw line a great threepoint shooter obviously just 64 hes really struggled from the charity stripe he makes his first well and heres the thing is that a as a guy thats trying to get off The Struggle Bus you want to be able to get those easy ones you know right now hes been able to find the basket but then getting to the free throw line if you watch him in his rhythm he stays consistent in that and gets a chance to knock down all three for me as a shooter thats going to give me more confidence with knocking down shots the more I see that ball go in and the lead goes from four to 12 in a heartbeat well heres Louisville theyve got to continue to stick with their offense you want to get into those gaps make those extra passes and keep touching as you see nice shot down by Johnson but that was set up by the penetration of James forcing the defense to help now Tyler Johnson knocking down the triple when the Cardinals really needed a Applause basket carington splits Up and Under oh hes got the full range of game and we talked to Kenny pay about that you he wants his team to play solid defense but you cant fall victim to stop and then the Up and Under but Carrington is really crafty around the rim Applause James going one on Applause three and sky Clark with five on the shot clock Clark he drives and throws it up and that will count and those are the hustle plays you see Glenn come up what look to be a a desperation shot by Clark but those are the things that change around you see right now Louisville is still within strike bking distance theyve got to get some stops and cut down those turnovers first offensive rebound for Louisville Hinson at the other end he jacks a three and misses can the Cardinals find some consistent offense James for three oh book it three ball side pocket you get a stop you get out of transition we talk about going for one good shot to a better shot and now what you have is that Louisvilles been able to narrow that lead and again you get some Rhythm together we talked about Glenn and the fact that he starts this play by being able to get you know the offensive rebound again Watch Glenn come over here and gets the foot back thats one of the things to get him start but then what you do you get a stop and you come down you force pass up a good shot for a wide open shot James knocks it down and now you look at this Louisville team has been able to go on an 80 run over the last minute 35 seconds well from Kenny Payne standpoint do you have a feeling that okay eventually pit is going to not be able to continue to shoot at this percentage we just have to hang around what heres the thing is that when youve seen Louisville be able to get back into this game its their defense its them getting stops its being able to get into transition weve talked about the fact that when you look at their offensive struggles at 72 points a game its the shooting 28 from from behind the AR theyve done a better job in sustaining how hard they played in this first half Applause so an 80 run from the Cardinals Austin inserted back into the game for Coach cable Hinson inside theres Austin again and all of a sudden Here Comes Louisville and Clark a untimely turnover and those are momentum pillers youre on an 80 run you could ill afford to have those unforced turns Hon oh shot Honey Austin thinks about it Austin takes it Austin misses you wonder where Austin goes out hes got that bandage on his hand missed his last two wondering if thats going to be a issue for him for the rest of the game now Tyler Johnson has been Louisvilles best player as of Music late huge height Advantage for the Panthers heres one of the things you have to stay away from if youre Louisville you cannot allow your offense to get stagnant you want to be able to continue to shift this pit defense because again theyre going to do a good job with their length and being able to force you off the threepoint line and theyre going to close those gaps and Louisville forced to call a timeout unable to inbound the basketball and those are some of the frustrations you can see from coach Payne you know the stories are well documented 4 and 28 last year that is not Louisville basketball yeah absolutely I think its the execution because sometimes you miss a a pick you dont get allow guys to get open you forced to use a turn turn a timeout that you werent planning on Tuesday on inside the NFL nobody breaks down the game like our crew with highlights and Analysis you wont find anywhere else this week the guys take a look back at the last week of the regular season plus they preview super Wildcard Weekend its inside the NFL Tuesday at 87 Central only on the CW and of course Pittsburgh fans theyve got a uh pretty important game a little later this afternoon the Steelers on the road at the arch rival Ravens Im surprised that youre not sitting you here with your black and gold underneath your your shirt there understand that this is a huge game for them yeah huge game right here as well Clark for Applause three and that thats a shot by Scar Clark that maybe he makes but I feel like for Louisville thats not whats allowed you to be able to cut this lead shot quality and having offensive discipline is something that you have to be able to maintain now Hinson drives the lane and lays it off the glass but heres the thing we talked about Henson his ability to get out of that slump you dont settle that last time you have to honor the threepoint shot he goes hard to the basket and hes having a good first half Brian Louisville two possessions with the lead at six unable to continue the Applause momentum James for three and that length of Pittsburgh starting to take its toll on the glass Applause and sky Clark picks up the foul he cant believe it when you watch this bit team play Ry one of the things that that impresses me is that theyre going to play with Pace space theyre going to run when they can theyre going to spread you out then a lot of times you look at it five out the way they run the pick and roll theyre always diving a guy forces the defense to converge and thats how they end up getting these wideopen threes its not that theyre just jacking them up off a pick and roll action and Alexander p into the game for Louisville number 23 in white and its an offensive foul that last time feder Rico getting a little too anxious and for me coming off a screen I always tell my big guys stay put let me do the work to get myself wide open dont take a wide open shot away from get a replay of it and watch the play here as you see Fed Rico go down Hensons coming off the pin down and then that fact right there just a shift uh not sure if I maybe maybe that was low that that was called for the offensive Applause foul well the Cardinals have been decimated by injury forced to only seven scholarship players something to watch and that is why Alexander Payne forced into action out of bounds basket and its another turnover and thats the play right there that really decimates this W bille team is though those turnovers you saw Johnson penetrate you cant make that offbalance pass and traffic like that you got to be more under Applause control low getting his first start of the year for pit and its another offensive foul this time its feder Rico feder Rico that picks up the personal so a game is slowed down just a bit were back on the Music CW you dont have to wait until retirement to start enjoying your plans with Pacific Life

duke looks to make their Mark against Virginia Duke versus Virginia tomorrow at noon 900 am Pacific only on the CW well Brian we talked about Louisvilles injury issues down to seven scholarship players that means head coach Kenny Payne having to play his son Alexander just they need the numbers you look at what has happened to Louisville Trey white the teams second leading scorer hes out today with a groin JJ trainer out for the year that was just announced today Emanuel okap for out today with an ankle injury and announced on Thursday is Dennis Evans is out for the year yeah obviously and when we talk to Kenny pay he mentioned the fact that as as sad as is is that its the next man up hes got to be able to have bodies we talked about the fact that theyre limited as seven scholarship players the blow for not having JJ trainer was that they actually thought that he may be eligible for this game and its its a big blow for them with his length and his leadership and James thinks about it huge height disadvantage against feder r atin but takes it to the glass James how about Mike James with a little bit of bully ball realizing that hes just got to go and get it and sometimes you want to just give a player the ball and tell him go get you a bucket the sophomore out of Orlando James taking it and its another offensive foul for the Panthers and you got to be frustrated if youre je Jeff capable because thats three possessions that you basically took yourself away and it gives a momentum up back to Lou Louisville because again well just a little bit over 3 minutes gives them an opportunity to be able to cut into this lead only down six and pit going zone for the first time with the Diaz Grand Brothers both on the court at the same time Johnson in the lane James fires and connects Mike James cannot miss how about Thompson tiptoeing on the Baseline right there you see the L faithful behind the team Louisville has cut this lead down to three the Young Center has come to life crowd on their feet this is what theyve been waiting for oh and Diaz Graham gets knocked to the ground hell head to the line for three with the crowd on there feet and Ryan heres one of the things that you play solid defense for the majority of the shot clock the last thing you want to do is bail out Diaz and you see right there the close Johnson comes over challenges that shot the last thing you want to do is he tued him right there on the wrist the crowd complains but you watch all day and then the other play Johnson makes a big play gets it over to Mike James to knock down that three and a couple times now the Panthers have been fouled shooting the threepoint Applause ball as Jorge Diaz Grant heads to the free throw line where hes a 71 free throw shooter so uh coach capable electing to go with both Diaz Grand Brothers both guys put on about uh 15 to 20 lbs in the off season Jorge has been struggling with an ankle injury but weve really seen the Improvement massively uh from guo Diaz Grant and pit much better from the charity stripe in this contest than theyve been in this 0 for three ACC run you see pit extending their defense and good trap right here all that length and Johnson nearly turns it over and then so these are the things that frustrate coaches you see Johnson go down grabbing his backside oh my goodness all right thats uh and sometimes for young players you get caught doing a little too much and you see getting too caught up right there and it basically Falls over Diaz Gram now not many teams in the nation that can throw out a pair of seven ERS that can both shoot it from behind the ark no other team in the nation can send out a pair of twin brothers that are 7 ft from the Canary Islands are the Diaz Grand Brothers via IMG Academy in Bradington Florida Austin got off to the hot start up under lot of English and Huntley Hatfield able to secure the rebound hes playing with two fouls Johnson draws the foul little out of control but heres the thing is that if youre Kenny pay you like the fact that hes pushing the pace and even a little out of control what hes doing hes creating offense hes create opportunities for his teammates number four Tyler Johnson he shoot the one one so its a one and one for Tyler Johnson 80 free throw shooter The Freshman for Brooklyn and and makes the first coming up on the Subaru halftime report well get a preview of our next game on the CW Wake Forest versus Miami well look ahead at the ACC scoreboard check out stats and highlights from the first half as Johnson knocked down a pair as sky Clark is back into the game for the Cardinal Louisville has done a good job of being able to sustain the pit run early because it looked like the way pit was shooting this ball they were going to run away with it theyve cut this lead down the four with just a little bit over the over one minute and something to look for Brian sky Clark the leading scorer oh low bares another triple thats a dagger Clarks yet to score yeah and that is true because again I think that Tyler Johnson is coming and giving them the spark as you see pit fall out into what it looks to be a 32 imagining having a sevenfooter at the at the hill at the head of that now pitch sixth threepointer of the first half under a minute to play lead is seven its another turnover low behind the back to Diaz Graham and hell head to the free throw line and those are the turnovers that our momentum Killers youre playing a Zone and you turn it over you give pit an opportunity to get out in transition the 11th turnover Bryan and thats what if youre Kenny pay you have to like the fact that you been able to do some good things half court but its the 11 turnovers that are taking opportunities away from you it look like the reps are going to look at shot clock and maybe that last foul and pit already with 11 points off of Louisville turnovers and the Cardinals have on several occasions fought back to make it a one or two possession game only to have a costly turnover well heres the thing is that pit has kind of changed up their looks from offense to I mean from from Zone to man and you see I think theyre going to go ahead and play on Louisvilles got to continue to be patient with their offense and continue to move that zone because you dont want to get stagnant and you want to get into those Music gaps and now it is Diaz Graham back to the free throw line as a clock malfunction was the reason for the pause in play theres uh 40 seconds left in the first half and Coach Payne talked about finishing halves and then getting off to good starts in the second half and currently a sevenpoint game uh you know what would you like to see Louisville with that last 40 seconds do with the basketball well I think theyve done a good job of being able to attack the gaps be it a man or Zone and obviously you take away those those turnovers I think that the energy and the urgency that they played with has shown that theyve been able to stay and hang around but this last 40 seconds you got to get a good play and make sure that youre getting an uncontested penetration for a wide open shot or touch to pain well Jorge Diaz Graham looks very very comfortable at the free throw line Applause and pit which is really struggled from the charity stripe the entire season is now8 for eight in the first half about a 9C disparity game clock shot clock heres what you dont want to do you want to you dont want to go east and west you want to attack the gaps Force the help try to get inside and force them to converge the length of this zone is really causing Louisville problems Clark tries to create three on the shot clock Williams fires and connects sometimes you just got to its better to be lucky than good and you see that last time Williams knocking down that three Carrington with three with two with one oh no good and Lille well head to the break with the Panthers leading 4034 a wild first half of a to start the second half normally I come out and I watch guys to see if they have a little bit of of a ladder because if you take time to have to warm back up to the second half that allows me to be able to go at you and those little Spurs of four minutes can turn the game in your favor well pick comes out and the throw down Austin picks up in the second half where he started the first half but Ryan you always hear me talk about how you move the defense that last time car moved the defense got it over to Diaz Graham and then you saw Hanson on that back cut and then basically they took advantage of the ship and no weak side help Louisville has really struggled ending halves and starting hals lets put a circle around can they stay in this game first five minutes and a traveling violation from James again when you watch pit and how they opened up this second this play right here is that watch car he drags two guys that gives Diaz Graham wide open and then you get hson is basically taking advantage because youve already got two guys occupied great play by pit to open up the second half 12 turnovers now for Louisville and once again inside and its an and one Diaz Graham the sevenfooter well you go back and you ask me about how you open up the Happ youve seen right now is that pit has come out with opportunity to go on an immediate 0 run and watch this last penetration you see low get it over backside to Henson Henson realized hes got Diaz Graham right there for the possible and one and its these these five old runs here and there that are basically momentum starters because you thought Louisville closed the first half with momentum now you have pit opening the second with their momentum shift and the Cardinal spot so hard to get it to six and then pit opens the second half on a 0 run do the Cardinals have an answer and its a Ticky tack on Diaz Graham reaching in on Huntley Hatfield and if youre Louisville what you want to do is that e even as pitch shifts their defense from man to Zone you dont settle you want to make sure that youre making crisp passes you dont want to go for home run hitters run your offense attack the gaps get the UN uncontested shots and continue to make this t uh pit team uh work on defense Johnson into the lane and off the glass it is Huntley Hatfield missing a layup but even if Huntley field misses that shot it was a good quality shot you saw Johnson be able to draw two guys the dump off those shots will eventually go sky Clark the leading scorer for Louisville is scoreless a goose egg for 55 in white Johnson to inbound James Baseline he h the big first half misses there good challenge by Henson right there staying Applause vertical now Henson thought about it Austin off to the quick start again this is Henson for the three ball and Johnson in the open court for Applause Louisville Caleb Glenn into the game early for the Cardinals jump hooking good hey nice move by Glenn because he realized that Henson was not going to fight that much bodied him a little bit and get a nice little jump hook over the left shoulder again Louisville does a better job when he can get stops and get into their open Music Applause Music offense Clark and low low always under control a lot to like about his game the you see Jaylen low with a little bit of a chicken wing right there got to his spot got some separation with a little a little fade there love his game because hes not been sped up and hes out the game to come to him from Missouri City Texas Jeff cable knew of him as a about a seven or eighty old is when he started to to hear the stories about Mr low no foul as Johnson draws a lot of contact and pit up 11 looking for their biggest lead of the game no good can and sky Clark get going with something now maybe a free throw will do just that Brian and thats the guy that I think for Louisville has got to get going because again they they need skot Clark and his ability to score points and again Louisville has shown that when they can get stops and get out an open floor theyre a dangerous team and you see Scott Clark gets there puts the pressure on the defense and draws the CL draws the foul shoot Applause and you can see his season breakdown and obviously this is as poorly as he has scored the basketball all season that is his first point of the game and Coach cable he found something in that first half with the Diaz Grand Brothers incredible length against a very small Louisville team especially when you go to change up your defens from The Zone uh to the man theres nothing more than length because again you put both of the Diaz brothers out there thats hard to overcome because theyre in passing Lanes as well and Louisville the much smaller team applying some pressure Carrington really the only ball hander Handler on the court for pit so a true contrast of styles right now Louisville small and quick pit incredible length Diaz Graham oh the big fella front ends it smallest player in the court grabs the rebound but how about Hinson calls a timeout thats hustle how about to play the 5050 ball you see Hinson get on the floor right there again turn over by Louisville Louisville faithful letting him here we got a good one KP is asking whats going Applause on when moderate to severe ulcerative

Johnson hes done a lot good today but four costly turnovers is he trying to do too much Brian well and heres the thing is that you found out multiple times that with his energy and how hes pushing does a little too much trying to go too too fast so you take a look hes got those seven points and five rebounds but the four costly turnovers and turnovers have been the story for Louisville as a team just five assists but 14 turnovers and every time the Cardinals seem to get something going they promptly turn it over pit basketball with a ninepoint lead Carrington thinks about three Diaz Graham wants three Austin inside and he picks up the foul as Caleb Glenn just a massive height Advantage for the Panthers who are already a great offensive rebounding team and that is the third personal on Caleb Glenn number 55 Austin hell shoot Louisville just seven scholarship players four players out today to injury as Austin makes the first coming up next we head to Winston Salem for a pivotal conference matchup as the Hurricanes face the Demon Deacons its Miami and Wake Forest its next only on the CW pit has yet to miss a free throw what has been an absolute Bugaboo for the Panthers this year suddenly becoming a strength yeah this is a team that has up until now shot 66 from behind from at the free throw line but done a better job and heres the Zone again Brian with the sevenfooter out in front it g Louisville a lot of problems in the first half but thats way theyre going to you see get to get the ball right inside and I love the fact of that for Louisville penetrate that zone you be able to get some good things whenever you do that and you dont settle the threes will eventually come and now it is Louisville showing Zone thir and sky Clark just picked up his third

Pacific only on the CW well critic Choice Awards in this game right now sky Clark leading score for Lobel just two points and and how about the uh chess match were seeing here from the Panthers electing to play both Diaz Grand brothers and really providing pit a huge height Advantage well I think what its done again is that is giv them that extra length especially the defensive side of it as far as being able to have length and its been a little bit of a a challenge for for Louisville as they mix up their defense and now its the Cardinals playing some matchup Zone go go Carrington really the only ball handler on the court for pit five on the shot clock touch pass Diaz Graham oh book at the sweet stroke of Jorge Diaz Graham from distance how about from one twin to the other again best way to attack his own get it inside out and the lead balloons to 12 that matches the largest lead of the game is this a danger zone for Louisville absolutely and I think for you cant stay out on the perimeter you got to get that ball inside Huntley Hatfield discards Diaz Graham and hillhead to the free throw line number 2 we talk about the Twin Towers and the fact that how theyve been able to play off each other and you see get the ball inside one two into the other see nothing but string action and again best way to do is it force that defense to come in a little touch pass threat the needle knock it down yeah the one under twins activate a little threepoint shooting there love it Brandon Huntley Hatfield he hasnt done much today and he bricks the first he is a 75 free throw shooter lead is 12 talked about that first five minutes of the second half pit doubled their lead in that first five minutes and when you look at it right now with pit being up now 11 for Louisville you got to get stops I felt like in the first half when they were able to go in their runs got some stops got into transition and thats where youre going to be able to cut down this Applause lead the Diaz Grand brothers from the Canary Islands they are such a difficult matchup as they can both really shoot from behind the Applause ark Caleb Glenn providing massive spark Off the Bench Williams Austin Skies high for the rebound and I dont I again if youre Kenny pay thats not the shot that you want right now because again this Louisville team is last in the conference in three threepoint field goal percentage run your offense attack the paint manto man again Henson thinks about it drives blocks the shot he wants a foul no call James in the open court can sky Clark get underway sky with two wise nearly turns it Applause over and there is a Louisville turnover their 15th Huntley Hatfields got to be a little bit more patient hes expecting that double team to come but hes got to allow his players to get in position he cant come off that ball too soon thats result in a turnover lead is Applause 11 pit can they deliver a knockout punch Hinson oh in and out and this would be Glenns fourth if they got him B on the cards number Glen thats his 14l now that is hit Glenns second personal foul his career high in points coming into the game was five he has eight today so could ill afford to lose him hes been a real bright spot and you see Caleb Glenn down there trying to hes under size when it comes up to Diaz Graham fighting down there but then has given Kenny pay some positive minutes so far in this game pit does lead the ACC in rebounding and rebounding margin and Henson will head to the free throw line for three foul shots and these are the things when you talk about the frustration start to build up for for Kenny Payne is that you watch right at Mike James on the replay Chase around Henson and right there all day every day thats a foul the Louisville fans are upset with that but when you watch the play the last thing you want to do is for a guy that youve been able to contain for most of the game give him an opportunity to go to the free throw line and this is the third time a panther has headed to the line for three free throws and pit has not missed from the free throw line but heres the thing Ryan is that in the second half youve been able to keep Henson relatively quiet the last thing you want to do is give him an opportunity to get to the line get some to go and get him in a nice little rhythm and 13 it is now the largest lead of the game for pit was trimmed to six at the half in under seven minutes that sixpoint lead has balloon to 14 Ls got to find some offense Applause again Clark into the lane finds James and he continues to be red hot but see there was a p ction by Scott Clark that forced the help and allowed him to get the ball and find Mike James wide open thats the success for Louisville its penetrate Force to converge and in Kick Out does Louisville have another run seven scholarship players Carrington up under back rims it feder Rico the offensive rebound the length from the Panthers taking control but its a turnover Applause nice play by Scott Clark he could have ped it right he could have James another three and another bucket but you see the difference that last time Hunley half field waited for the double team to come out realized where it was coming back out and you got Mike Clark with two consecutive threes and here comes Louisville one more time crowd into it Carrington midrange oh he is so good and thats a momentum thats a momentum killer right there carington understand gets to his spot talk about it 65 having enough length to be able to shoot over bigger Defenders James again oh he canot okay now he okay Mike James is in the house Mike James is like come on Im feeling it baby an absolute flamethrower from behind the arc singlehandedly keeping Louisville in the game Mike James a Onan show oh and Louisville takes another dagger to the heart Zack Austin another triple we got a lot of back and forth it seemed like we got a three ball pattern you see Mike James saying thats a one time three then you know what kick it out look for me again and he say you know what ride my back I am feeling it Mike James is in the Music house next hammering it home its a high octane showdown in

Courtside Saturday here on the CW The Young Center coming to life as Mike James singlehandedly keeping Louisville in this game but Ill tell you for every Louisville run in this second half pit has had an answer and Ill tell you Zack Austin 17 points remember he was scoreless against North Carolina but the story for the Cardinals is Mike James well for Kenny Payne and his willb team you know theyve been able to try to find ways to get back into this game and Mike James has come in has been lights out from behind the arc 5 for six 21 points very good for Louisville team that normally only shoots 28 from behind the yard does he force it a bit and he draws a foul on Austin right you youve seen some of the things as Louisvilles trying to get back into this this game their ability to be able to touch the paint Thats forcing pit with their length to have to converge theyre getting uncontested shots and if Im Kenny Payne I tell them to be patient get those gaps shift the defense and get to your second and third options and not always take the first shot that comes to you sky Clark 0 for four from the field he is Louisvilles leading score great inbounds pass from Johnson Huntley Hatfield loses it plenty of time on the shot clock theres Clark and still now 0 for five from the field you talked about pitting the fact that regardless of what Louisville does is able to continue to keep their lead if youre pit run your ball actions run guys off the screens hit the gaps pass up those shots and touch to paint Applause Carrington under 10 on the shot clock Clark took one to the face no call and Carrington will head to the charity Applause strike on the cards number one first WS is second now listen every great shooter every great scorer you were one of them goes through a game like this but Clark the body language 0 for five from the field can he still help his team without scoring well heres the thing he cant allow his offense to dictate his defense he still he needs to stay youre still within range here youre talking about that this team is only down 11 and youve been able to go on runs he still has to stay engaged and then take advantage of the opportunities when they come to him a reminder Duke Virginia CW womens Hoops tomorrow right here on the CW so the lead is back to 12 the pit panther they Achilles heel in ACC action has been free throw shooting they are a perfect 15 of 15 Louisville cant seem to catch a break Clark driving creating Williams in and out no good pit in transition Austin Applause Federico Federico into the lineup hson fires and conects is that the dagger as pit goes back up 15 good ball movement no hesitation by Blake Henson again talk about a guy thats found his rhythm pit right now an 80 run time out cardal now pit has had the answer from behind the ark Coach Jeff capable in his sixth season at the Helm of the Panthers they won three straight against Louisville in this mini uh tail spin for pit Blake Hinson has been unable to get it going he has it going today and Ill tell you those chips to the free throw line have really been a big factor and we talked how do you get off The Struggle Bus and I thought that hes done a good job of being able to mix it up with some threes and get to the line and get to the bucket and then for Shooters you have to find a way to get the ball in and it takes off the pressure because if all youre doing is shooting threes puts too much pressure on it but I think that for Louisville again they have still shown that theyve had runs but this pit team has been on all cylinders Jeff capable has to be Happ happy with how theyve been able to offset these Louisville Music runs well the story is for Louisville theyve been well documented Kenny Payne in his second season back at the helm of his alma mater 4 and 20 8 last season for Louisville and a turnover out of the timeout and again we talked about that active hands for Applause pit well Louisville it is a fan base here Brian that they expect Elite eights in final fource not eight wins one of the proudest basketball tradition schools in America alied Rico how about the vision communication for Carrington and and feder Rico feder Rico right there behind the defense who guy call slipping and the lead is now Applause 17 pit feeling it Louisville searching for answers Johnson back rims it James the offensive rebound Clark for three finally sees it go through and that may be one of the things to get Scott Clark going again interesting to see if Louisvilles got another run in him theyll have to do it with defense pit shooting an incredible rate here in the second Applause half Hinson oh big guy big fella fing it right now it was no hesitation in that doesnt look like a guy thats been struggling putting the ball in the Applause hoop Henson really struggled a week ago against Syracuse andet watch watch Blake hinston as soon as he gets it he understands all he needs is just a little time and for a guy like that you got to you cant allow him to catch that ball in his shooting pocket hant right now you can tell him hes in a nice little Groove oh great pass inside sky Clark thats five straight for the Cardinals leading scorer good pass over by Tyler Johnson Too Little Too Late Brian well heres the thing is that for Louisville you got to get pit out of their comfort zone theyre running their offense theyre shifting you theyre getting their looks youve got to be able to blow up some of these actions and not allow them to get where they want to go Henson drives draws up under and louville the other way James and he had made three straight that was a bit of a heat check and heres the thing is that for Mike James I know youve hit three three I would have Lov to see him put his head down and get to the basket thats one of the things that Louisville tends to fall in love with the three especially in Applause Music transition federo inside gigantic height advantage and James scrapping to the bottom theyre going to jump it up it will be Louisville basketball Mike James great hustle yeah great rotation over there those are the 5050 balls that you want tie it up right now Louis Bill still trying to climb in but it seemed right now too much pit are your headlights cloudy and oxidized making your car look bad are they underperforming when you need them most cak COs headlight restoration kid

again yeah she told me when youd rather not resort to a virtual Resort this is much better in real life it matters for you stay looking good babe Hilton for the stay welcome back to the CW lets take a look at our e play brought to you by Hilton Hilton for this stay and how about Diaz Graham to Diaz Graham you always say the twins always stay in sink how about the look tip pass from one Diaz to the other and again anytime you get the Diaz Grand Brothers on the floor it seems like its turned to positive results for Jeff for Jeff C and the B Panther team today now from the Canary Islands the brothers have come a long way to the Steel City and they have provided pit a lot of really good minutes today the Panthers Now by 15 in search of their first win in ACC action Clark gliding to the bucket great pass James Up and Under but misses fights for the rebound hell pick up the foul but you have to love the action especially coming out of the timeout the penetration as scar Clark that gets Mike James an opportunity to finish just couldnt finish around the rim 16k and not yet in the one and one so Louisville will inbound underneath their own basket Clark does look to have a little uh jump in his step with five straight points for Louisville Transfer from Illinois drives here good defense from Jeffers Johnson now step back and short ared it so heres the thing is that for Louisville you cant get into Spurs where its just one one any of those opportunities that shot by Tyler Johnson was a little oneonone you got to be able to get your opportunities by picking part the pit defense because theyre just too good Federico great pass inside but better block where did Clark come from oh my Clark Kent was that Applause Superman in the pass James thinks about it now Williams and hell head to the free throw line as Federico Federico picks up the personal we talk about again for this Louisville team as know Kenny Payne wants to see the effort and the urgency but right now down 15 youve seen them still fight and thats one of the things thats escaped them earlier in the season is having these droughts again great penetration at last opportunity we goes to the line so Federico Federico 33 in blue and they like the name so much they named him twice the story behind that in the Sudan you name your first son after your last name thus the name Federico Federico the same first name as the last name so if wondering at home why its feder Rico feder Rico I just love feder Rico feder Rico name so nice you got to say it twice thats right and Lead is 14 talked about a desperate two teams in this contest and Mike James just continues to fat fight and Claw and if Louisville is looking for a symbol of how to come back from these epically Dark Days the fight that Mike James is showing and thats exactly what theyve done in the second half you see Mike James theyre extending their pressure theyre fighting trying to go after balls trying to get the tie ups and thats the thing is that you cant allow pit to run offense you see good pass by Carrington and how about the block while Huntley had Applause toi well for all the contractors of Kenny pay no one can say this team has ever given up well and you see Huntley had F over here goes up for that block and thats what this Louisville team has done theyve gotten a lot of backlash in the P for not competing for a full 40 minutes you see Mike James get tied up thats a vet move by Blake Henson using Jamess aggression against him Applause and some frustration starting to really come out of these Louisville fans starting to come out of Kenny Payne you know that every player every fan associated with Louisville they cannot believe that this is their team with this record well and and heres the thing is that theres a transition obviously theyve had some injuries youve got a very young ball club and so the transition with young players and trying to get the right players to to and thats been something thats been much of a hurdle and I think that whats really hurt is the nonconference losses early in the season and pit has still yet to miss a foul Music shot I mean and heres the thing is that for Louisville there are obviously still opportunity to come back and win this game but you look at how this team has been able to compete for the first and second half still got an opportunity here but you have to be happy with how theyve been able to play hard Johnson and Johnson continues to fire away the lead is 16 Henson piling up the points and and heres a thing for pit the clock is your friend youre youre up 16 you want to run your run the clock you dont want to be forced into quick shots carington thats a thats a dagger you run clocking and youre able to get a a contested three right now to extend this lead up to 19 points and there are a lot of Rumblings that Bob Carrington could actually be a one and done kind of player and take his talents to the next level as soon as next Applause year Williams answers with a three of his own good penetration and kick over to Williams you see Louisville extending their pressure Applause and Carrington the thing you got to like about him he always in control well heres the thing is that when you look at his size at the point uh does a good job of using his length rarely gets sped up has a good balance and Court Vision to understand when to run plays and when to go hunt his offense double team Applause jeffris waiting for the call and its an offensive F yeah good recovery by Scott Clark being know to step and watch the rotation of sky Clark you see Jeffers comes there make sure hes outside the restricted area absorbs the contact right between the numbers Louisville still in this game plenty of Applause time cannot afford many more missed opportunities jeffris hounding Clark out front go Williams and its another Louisville turnover I thought Will Williams Miss Huntley Hatfield he had Diaz go uh Graham right on his backside pass at the last minute when he wasnt ready 17 turnovers for the Cardinals Diaz gra the rwi a chess oh man oh my goodness yes gra all the Tomahawk and Clark will head to the free throw line what did we just witness Diaz Graham saying you know what my goodness you know what we go ahead and see if anybody invite someone to my poster again Diaz Graham coming in to your living room pit

yeah 59 9 huh good Music deal lets take a look at our Pacific Life game summary presented by Pacific light creating Financial Security for more than 150 years and certainly for the Panthers and getting on track Blake Hinson was a huge key and it was big for Blake Henson to get off that Struggle Bus to he came in and did a good job of being able to find his offense and again we know that this is a volume threepoint shooter was they to get going but then you know earlier on for Louisville it was Mike James I thought when they were able to get going and comeb back into this lead hot shooting from behind the arc you see 21 points today five for seven from behind the arc and when Louisvilles been able to climb back in its been the play of Mike James and his offensive out today 18point lead 3 minutes 40 seconds remain here and Kenny Payne talked about trying to bring Louisville back Brick by Brick he is elected to go young in the transfer portal uh certainly coming off of last years 4 and 28 record patience is is something that fans dont have a lot of so heres what Im going to tell you is that this this pit team is a good team when they they cooking on all cylinders because you look at that game you know against Clemson against Carolina and against Syracuse those are all games that they should have won and then when when you look at at playing in the ACC good point guard play and having a guy that can go get you a buck is essential they have that for this Louisville team The Brick by Brick is competing for a full 40 minutes thats something that youve seen that they didnt have earlier on in the season well Huntley Hatfield trying to cover Bob Carrington is a mismatch that Louisville will have to try to live with here Diaz Graham back rimson another rebound for Mike James Johnson in the open court slides it under and sky Clark getting underway and a quick timeout as we have an injury at the other end and that does appear to be the star freshman Bob Applause Carrington bub driving to the Lane for pit Diaz Graham received the pass and it was Louisville going the other way as Carrington lets take a look you see the penetration of Bob Carrington seem like he just got sandwiched in between Huntley Hadfield and and pain from his reaction it may have been a Blow To The Head as he is once again stuff in the stat sheet is Bob Carrington but our take a look at our player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom and when pit needed a spark early on Zach Austin provided well I thought that he started the game with that energy and being able to give them uh points around the basket and the threepoint it was that first half that I thought they really started it out for them you would see that through throughout the entire game Zach Austin and his energy his is the guy that shoots the ball well and goes up high on the pogo stick has been huge because again they did not have ishill Leed today and missed that 12 points and I thought that Austin did a good job of filling in and taking up the pace thats his first coach Payne once again down to seven scholarship athlete playing his son Alexander Payne limited minutes but it just gives you an idea of how much this Louisville program has had to adore with the injury bug this year two players that they really were counting on this year out for the entire season and were in the first Saturday in January and these are guys that you expect to have heavy rotational minutes and again when you look at the forecast of what you do what youre using and what you need not having access and then you getting down to only seven players especially in an ACC thats much better than it has been the previous years and pit has missed a free throw 19 of 20 one week ago at Syracuse pit was 11 of 24 from the foul line 11 of 24 one week ago and today they are 19 of 20 I believe its the same 15t shot but but but it shows that when you get in the gym and you work on things that how that could be an asset because again when you look at the pit team and how many games theyve lost and not shooting the free throws that on pits number two always pays a Music factor a lot of fouls here late still 2 minutes 41 seconds to go as weve just crossed over the 200 Mark two hours in this game a reminder coming up next year on the CW a good one Miami and Wake Forest as soon as were done here at the yson hey one dont got it straight in hey go straight in over here okay now Mike James he is stuck around here and seems to be in it to the end to bring Louisville back to National and ACC prominence and good to see bub Carrington immediately back in the game for pit thats a uh a wonderful sign for the Panthers and if youre Louisville you continue to play solid defense you got to extend you cant allow pit to continue to run clock off time off the Applause clock Diaz Graham and it is a blocking call on Alexander p number 23 Zen thats his second 19 and pit will head to the free throw line for their 21st and 22nd free throw one one but boy they uh they let one slip away a week ago at Syracuse missing those 13 foul shots in what turned out to be an eight point Applause game and it is another Cardinal turnover and is good as Tyler Johnson will be hes got to get those turnovers under and thats one of the things hes done a lot of positive things but when youre playing the point guard position you have to be careful and mindful and protect the basketball Austin thinks about it takes it makes it yeah only fitting Z Austin has been that guy that has stepped up for pit today our player of the game continues to just absolutely shoot the Rock Applause theres Glenn inside Glen from Johnson a 90 seconds to go what did you see from Louisville that makes you believe that Kenny Payne can turn this around well and they show that the playing hard and consistent I saw some good things in getting stopped theyve got athletes and shot makers that you can get out in transition um I think that they have to continue to cut the uh the turnovers down and then obviously the interior presence I thought they did a better job of being able to get stops and then finish at the rim and Henson and that will allow Louisville to get some WalkOns into action3 and remember just seven scholarship players for a team thats obviously struggling with morale struggling with turning things around and then to be hit this hard by the injury bug well I think one of the things is a testament to the players that they continue to play hard because again with all the chatter thats going around Louisville basketball and then how unfortunate with the injuries this team came out and played hard from beginning to end balls fumbled around and low will keep it out front as far as the Panthers go could have should have would have its not hard to see the Panthers going to Forno in the ACC and probably ranked inside the top 20 in the country if a few bounces went their way in their first three contests when we talked with Jeff Cap we talked about the fact that getting their swag back because this is a team that came out was able to do a lot of good things and and theyve got the pieces youve got great uh point guard play in Carrington you see Percy Miller knock down that shot youve got shot makers and you got the length down though to compete and be one of those teams and this will do it Caron will likely just dribble out the clock so Pittsburgh will get its first win in AC DC play the Panthers will improve to 10 and5 1 and three in conference Applause play and pit was uh content to run things out but the officials say you cant move the pivot foot just yet and that will do it it will go down is a 13o win for Pittsburgh and
