terrific start Tyrese leads him an assist and Steals and of course all of it centers around the preseason player in the year of the league in thats Kyle filipowski who gets us started against rokas utus and were underway with lasa winning the tap theyve got terrific guards jir brickus and also khil Brantley thats Brantley firing a pass across the floor and anoir Gill to work on filipowski and knocked away and an early turnover puts Duke in transition thats great defense by Applause Duke here is filipowski lost it against yotus and Duke has turned it over briefly Mitchell got it back not yet we get a hell ball that will stay at the Duke end of the floor and Mark Mitchell the sophomore from Kansas City comes in averaging 14 a game and a careerhigh 20 against Bucknell last Friday and the Blue Devils 30point victory this is a small Lal team yotus tries to defend filipowski and will commit the foul first on Ras 610 260 from konas and Lithuania and the first on the explorers of Fran duny now in his second season at his Alma moer yotus is a big guy 610 260 lbs they list him and they really dont have anybody else of that size if he gets in foul trouble and hes got to guard filipowski so Fran duny is going to have a hard time keeping that guy out of foul trouble how about Fran duny sitting on 599 an upset tonight would be career win 600 he would be the 23rd major college basketball coach to win 600 games Proctor on the drive in traffic fallway and it rolls in it is noticeable how how much a year has done for Tyrese Proctor physically and his early returns prove from a basketball perspective hes going to be a lot better as a seconde player as well Baseline Brantley shovels it into the corner desan Shepard missed everything filipowski the Applause rebound filipowski nice pass from Mitchell and Martin Mitchell puts the blue doubles in front five to nothing but thats Mitchell inside going against brickus and hes a 6 foot guard no way he can handle the 69 Mitchell inside rck his handles here is brandley John sha and his staff concerned about the veteran guards that lasa put on the floor yotus at the foul line and roach and Duke waste no time left it short Gil the recovery for the Explorers l s is off to their best start in 8 years at 40 this is their first road test they were five and eight away from Tom goolo Arena a year ago and lost their last three in the regular season of the A10 they look to penetrate they look to shoot threes and Duke has really handled that so far Gil had it rattle out from three lead for filipowski and he missed the layup remember KY got shaken up here on Friday against Bucknell theres a spot up jump shot and its good for khil Brantley 39th start tonight for the Junior from the Bronx hes their leading score at 172 and Lal on the board 2 and 12 in and Lal does not look to play racehorse basketball West but they really like to get it up in transition and take the first Easy Applause Shot manto man yep roach trying to measure the screen from filipowski here is the Freshman McCain skip out for roach twopointer good Jeremy roach needless to say has played a lot of basketball in Durham senior from leeburg Virginia averaging just under 12 a game but hitting better than 50 of his shots coming in hes a guy who can create his own shot hes really good at that midrange jumper yep average 13 points in ACC play a year ago Gil trapped feeds Ras yotus blocked by filipowski and on the in line Isaiah Barnett working with Terry Osby and Clarence Armstrong Awards it to Duke as Ryan young checks in to replace filipowski well we just showed you the struggles Lal had in the half court but when they can get out and go they are pretty effective brickus I mean both of the guards Brantley and brickus like to take it down sometimes the three but that pullup jumper from Two and transition is really in their wheelhouse roach and Ryan young did come in to spell Kyle filipowski during the dead ball a moment ago Mitchell strong with the right hand and off the window again Mitchel 69 Gil is Applause 64 Duke with this threeyard lineup theres a spot up two bounces away off the hand of Brantley McCain working into Applause traffic heres roach on the drive and got the roll Jeremy roach has got four on a pair of field goals and that was some kind of strong move right there and early ninepoint Advantage for the Blue Devils Shephard or brickus rather whips it to Brantley back back into the corner standing three is good for jir brickus and again thats the way they want to play West you get penetration you force a rotation and they find an open threepoint shooter so brickus averaging 14 points a game scores easily Ryan young misses and yotus couldnt handle it knocked out of bounds itll go to the Explorers one we continue from Cameron but Jeremy roach the most a food drive where families were on hand to receive turkeys and other canned goods for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday and Caleb Foster told the uh charl observers said they made me who I am today this is why I wanted to give back youve got to give back to the people who helped you become who you are not bad for a freshman Dan to see the big picture no its not bad at all and he took his three freshman classmates with him yep nice event TJ power went along with uh Jared McCain of course and also Shawn Stewart great to see those guys helping out out the Charlotte area Lal the ball but an early sixpoint deficit nice pass inside rokos yotus his first field goal yotus almost lost that ball West what a great job by brickus inside there what did Chris Carell tell us this afternoon these guys are playground guards yep and he meant that in a very positive way these guys can just create things yep theres a screen out on the perimeter and ball got knocked away kickball will stay with the Blue Devils theres another look at the pass the pass is one thing but look how he draws the defense in Ryan young went over to double team and the rotation didnt come down and you he almost lost the ball going up but he was able to get it to go in roach has got to get it in hustles to Ryan young to beat the five count from Clarence Armstrong Foster on Q and the jump shot shot bounces off the back iron recovered by Shepard whos been quiet so far for the Explorers Gil Runner with the right hand oh anoir Gil from our nations capital with his first basket and all of a sudden what was once a sixpoint leads cut down to two on a couple of laau baskets here nice job by Gil to drive it to the basket 7 nothing run in total Mitchell tries to snap it does with his third field goal the dog gives Mitchell six Ryan young is a hard guy to double team because the first thing when he does when he gets the ball inside hes looking to pass it snaps the Lal run rickus working on roach back for Gil Lefty three at the top and the rebound for Shepard got deflected Brantley little hanger and ahead here is Blakes Foster young left alone and were going to get a foul on jir brickus off the ball for his first itll be the second on the Explorers this is what they want to do penetrate and then get I mean thats a tough shot hes a lefthanded player but the great pass by Young and a really nice job being patient by Mitchell letting the first Defender run by and then just taking youw right to the basket yep so Proctors in the game we get our first look at Shawn Stewart as well from windir Florida wearing number 13 for the Blue Devils heres Proctor back to filipowski who returns for replace Young and Kyle cant score through traffic and yotus finally pull up jump shot morero took a rare two Dan morero he takes twos he just doesnt make any just doesnt make any TW has made Seven field goals all year theyve all been threes here is Proctor on the drive followed by Stewart eight field goal of the young season for 69 Shawn Stewart Stewart is very athletic and bouncy and if hes going to attack the basket like that hes going to get a lot of rebounds Duke back to a sixpoint lead four in a row by the Blue Devils Gil being patient on the screen guns for three in hits anoir gill now with five thats just his third three of the Year careerwise Wes hes only a 29 threepoint shooter but he likes to take him and you just cant give him that much time Chris Carell was talking with us about the the veteran presence of this Lal team Gil a senior brickus a senior guys that influence the play Caleb Foster a quick bucket he comes in playing about two dozen minutes a game through his first four college games of course had the terrific game against Michigan State a week ago in Chicago Gil lost the handle on it and we get a shuffle for the travel and that will get us to a timeout Lal turnover Blue Devils by five first half action continues from durl every year as I carve the annual holiday nut ball my remember a together on an army touring team in the early 70s when theyre both in the Army thats an amazing story isnt it here is McCain who plays with Proctor filipowski Foster and Stewart on the floor for the blue Music devs Shephard brickus morero Gil and yotus out there on the floor now it was interesting we were privileged to be part of the brief conversation with Coach dumpy and Coach Kay today and we were being told about some of the venues they played in on this Army touring team in the 70s Stewart the offensive Rebound in the bucket for his second field goal four for Shawn Stewart won again if he is willing to work that hard on the offensive boards I think hes going to get a lot of opportunities yep and inside they feed Shepard and theres the dunk from desan Shepard averaging 12 and 1 12 points and a lead pass is turned over by the Blue Devils too fast too soon for filipowski fivepoint game Gil for Shepard and heres Gil working against Stewart tough match up for the rookie but he bounced it and blocked it away how about that and stepped on the in line itll stay with Lal boy what a good play sequence wise defensively for the young freshman Stewart moves his feet very well now on the offensive end you see the screen and roll they go down in the lane and he gets himself to a point where hes trying to get the stop nice ball movement that time by Lal morero has his first twopoint basket of the season and Lal to within three of the Blue Devils here is McCain trying to squeeze through turns it over to yotus and now Shephard in transition and Stewart slapped it off the glass but a whistle and a foul Terry Oglesby out from underneath tags morero I dont know its on faler I beg your pardon I dont know what McCain saw but he threw that pass right and he hit yotus in between the three and the five but really great job by Stewart to get down the court and block that one free throw by uh Shephard is good his fifth conversion of the year hes got three points dont forget Saturday at 11 Eastern we start your Football Saturday on acc network with the Huddle Crew live from Carter Finley Stadium and at 630 a complete rack wrap up of those games as we get you ready for State Carolina on acc Network at 800 Eastern all on acc Network and all available of course on the ESPN app four for Shepard the Duke lead is cut to one now now were halfway through the first 20 minutes here and despite their dominance on the inside Wes again you say this is a onepoint game yep and some of the cautionary tales that shy staff was offering have produced here early as filipowski scores on the turn his first field goal hes got three points thats what you call getting close to the basket woo morero missing on the three filipowski the nice block out good Hustle by Duke on defense to get out and contest that shot heres Proctor weaving in traffic spots up and hits Wes I watch Proctor play and in my opinion that may be the best part of his offensive game yeah that ability to pull up in the midrange off the dribble feels like its a developed piece of his game from a year ago too Dan Brantley Shephard tend to shoot for the explorers and here is yotus trying to work on filipowski reroutes with a right hand left it short and a foul on filipowski thatll be his first and the second on the Blue Devils here in the half we talked about Dukes size advantage and yotus is as tall as filipowski but Phil watch filipowski just walk him down the lane and that was very nearly a dunk you cant get any closer than that and this work talking about with Proctor he creates space off the dribble doesnt Force anything going to the basket that nice pullup jumper Im telling you Wes if youre a guard who is as quick with the ball as he is and you can make that pullup jumper youre going to score a lot of points yotus misses the first of course Proctor is from Australia now lals roster is a little more pronounced you have Lithuania Venezuela two from Spain one from Argentina one from Turkey one from Serbia and the other guys are all from that I95 quarter thats it yeah that Mike Bray used to talk about Mike Bray and Michael wilbon both talk about the I95 quarter seven international players and then eight from the I95 fourpoint lead Yus got one of the two and a foul off the ball and thats going to be on Ryan xan 67 freshman from Princeton New Jersey hes the backup center he comes in for yotus and xan he 6700 lb as opposed to 610 260 yeah heres roach for foster Ts up a three back rim Miss Mitchell gives Duke a second chance and its Proctor from Deep 83 of the year for Tyrese Proctor he got seven thats Dukes lead splitting the double team Bradley to the basket couldnt finish it terrific out effort there and here is Proctor on the kickback Foster a standing three xan couldnt control it itll stay with the Blue Devils that was a great defensive play by Mitchell going straight up and forcing a difficult shot by Brantley and then Mitchells the guy who got down the the court and put the pressure on the rebounder to create another possession for the Blue Devils heres a kick out for roach and now Proctor Bo Zan and filipowski are going at it yep and filipowski cant finish rebound pulled away Inside by tunday valberg fasi one of those freshmen from Spain we were talking about the Sassi wes 34 for Lal kick out for xans three air Baler Ryan is just one of four now on the year after the Miss and whats coming to Cameron unless youre serated after an airball kind of feel like you get cheated on the experience Proctor knocks down to three duke by Music seven and now at 19 and a year we were remarking today at Dukes workout I mean a bigger physical presence clearly certainly more basketball maturity from a year in the ACC here is Proctor catching shoot three on Q okay maybe hes more than an adequate threepoint shooter Yep this is really a good response by Duke Lal cut it to two and the Explorers have gone three minutes and change without a field goal Music fasi little ball screen to try and get Bradley free good switch by the Blue Devils communicating there really nice job by Mitchell to move his feet for to shoot brickus trying to find a seam and xan somehow or another caught the deflection and scored fourth field goal Ryan xan now do you think brickus was trying to pass that to Zan I think it got deflected to him or blocked depending on your preference of choice right oh do you get an assist for that no I dont think so theres Proctor he gets two and now tyres Proctor is on a tear hes taking over the game yep sure is hes got a dozen threepoint shots pull up jumpers drives to the basket yep and its 10 and filipowski draws his second itll be the third on Duke filipowski finds himself with two at 611 on the play so just a pass by I mean its not like Proctor makes a hard cut he just goes to the free throw line turns around goes back beyond the threepoint Arc they lose him y theres a look at Tyrese he probably was as surprised as anybody when he turned around he was wide open yep Brantley yotus has come back in the game to replace xan by the way backside rebound for McCain Applause Music Mitchell hell stand three and leave it on the back rim Stewart has returned by the way with filipowski picking up the second foul heres gil on the drive and Mitchell commits his first four on Duke Wesson thats a play last year where I think Mitchell tries to step in and take a charge right but this year with the rule change its almost impossible to get a charge in that situation so he just tried to go straight up but he still committed the foul y so heres anoir Gill at the line explorers are three of four at the line and the first one good dont forget a busy week 13 of ACC football on acc Network well get you started right here in Durham pit and Duke George Sedano Orlando Franklin Maryland pay will have coverage at High Noon then Virginia Tech Virginia in Charlottesville Chris Cotter Mark herlick Sher burus will be there and then Tim hasselbach Taylor tanon bom and I will be at Carter Finley Stadium in Raleigh for State Carolina all Saturday all three games on acc Network and always available on the ESPN and heres Lal showing some pressure and Proctor just does make it across the midcourt line in the 10 count now you want to be patient but I mean you were almost a little too patient McCain long two at the top and Gil rebound Brantley a look ahead Far Side brickus boy he thought about it didnt yes he did senior from Coatsville PA theres Gil and the rebound for Stewart good Outlet yep Proctor on the Move skip for McCain and hell push up a two thats too strong look at Stewart keep it alive now Proctor another one no and finally yotus is able to pull it away I read a great quote about Shawn Stewart from one of the scouts that saw him as he matriculated up through a basketball in his prep career from windamir Florida heres Brantley on the drive Stewart blocked it Mitchell and Proctor sneaks Baseline and here here is Stewart they called Shawn Stewart a pogo stick who can guard all five spots and we have seen the bounce early and often here in this first half its a 10point Duke lead the drive and score thats brickus hes got five well he did a nice job using the basket to protect the ball from Stewart who was lurking right behind him Duke is at 50 from the floor and there is Mitchell tapping one in for his fourth field goal he has eight and its right back to 10 Again Wes when youre a small team like Lal you really have to try to cut down on the dribble penetration because once you start rotating it becomes very hard rickus left the two short heres the deflection to McCain roach off the dribble and were going to get a whistle and foul I believe on Stewart as we go to a timeout first on the Freshman from Orlando and windamir who is picked up a third field goal on a twohand dunk blue Devils lead is Music 10 what a staple of his legacy is that huh oh could roll you could have a Rolodex of unbelievable defensive players oh in his run without any question Gil the runner and the baket thats the second time weve seen that shot and keep in mind Wes that Gil hes a lefthanded shooter but just about everything else he does is with the right hand so that was a shot with the right hand but it was the drive with the right hand you get a lefty shootter you figure okay hes going to drive to the left well thats not what he does Foster sneaks through offensive foul Gil stepped in front on the Freshman Foster thats his second well now the thing the thing with Gil is he has to have his hes got to be established before the guy plants before Foster plants and I dont know about that yep so an eight point game third turnover on the Blue Devils here in this first half three on LL by the way Music too so young Blakes Proctor Mitchell and roach could finish the half here for John shy meanwhile anoir Gil trying to get going and yotus will kick it here is Shephard going Baseline back for yotus a shot fake and a foul on the Blue Devils itll be on Jaylen Blakes six now on Duke first on the Junior from Somerset New Jersey theres Jaylen Blakes and John sh wants to visit with Isaiah bar Isaac Barnett a little bit here Applause and the free throw by yotus no good dont forget ACC PM Friday on site in Raleigh Mark Packer will have a bevy of guest we get you ready for the final regular season weekend of college football highlighted by number 20 North Carolina in NC State Saturday night at 800 here on acc Network Yus miss him both hes one of four at the line that really hurts you know Ls done a nice job staying in the game now they drop back into a two3 Zone but these last couple of minutes here are going to be key for Applause them young backing down on Gil Mitchell stripped of it on the way up it will stay with the Blue Devils with only three and a half to shoot look like grantley hurt his finger thats good def on the other hand by the way cuz hes got the left thumb taped up already coming into the night well hes got two hands but you know hed like both of them to work and now a timeout a 30 second use it or lose it for John shy well step aside when youre great more of the catch and shoot variety here for you you got time to dribble it and and also time to turn it over well you dont have time to throw it to the other guys if you want to get get a shot on Fourth on Duke in this first half yotu squares on Young and left it on the rim heres an outlet for Proctor he leads everybody in scoring hell leave it for roaches triple and young tried to keep it alive fights for it and last touched I Believe by the Blue Devils it will go to with 95 seconds to go in the first half thats great Hustle by Young and yotus wesle theres only been four games of course for low but in four games yotus comes in he has zero assists so when he gets the ball inside hes going to shoot it and I think the Blue Devils have done a nice job being physical with him hes had a tough time finishing Gil a attacking on the drive and were going to get a foul as young ended up on the deck yotus you know its interesting the Blue Devils have struggled to score here the last few possessions and Lal has been unable to take advantage of it no field goals no points really the last 2 and 12 minutes for Coach shs team heres Proctor down the lane the scoop and the foul on shepher desan Shepard the Jr from Philadelphia his first fourth on the Explorers Shepard had 22 and N in their win against Bucknell this uh quadrant of teams Duke the Screaming Eagles of Southern Indiana who will be here at Cameron on Friday Bucknell and Lal are playing in a uh we John sh looked at us and said its a Blue Devil invitation do you like my idea its very nice branding on your part um its actually called the Blue Devil CH BL devil challenge Im sorry thank you and its a its a really good idea you get its they call these multiple team events mte and the thing thats important about that theyre exempt from the number of games you can play and so here they get to play three extra games for the price of one for the price of one and they dont have to go to Hawaii thats it so you find a collection of teams and you rotate around and its an mte of sort here is proor spinning on a whirling dervish and left it short Duke back to its largest of 10 oh my and an alley oop for shepher desan Shepard now weve seen two guys wearing 13 and can take the elevator to the top floor here in the first half Stuart and Shepard now you talk about a pogo stick there you go so Shephard cuts that from happening so yotus will sit on the bench with two fouls and the size is down barrero has come back on the floor along with fasi here in the final stretches and Proctor can wind in this first half down heres young providing the screen foul on area a little scoop and score for Ryan young twoman game worked out and Dukes going to take a 10point lead to the locker room here at the half Tyrese Proctor two Rus yotus only has one we inadvertently ticketed yotus with one that ultimately was awarded in the final version to brickus and speaking of brickus just got hit in the face turned the ball over and here is roach a little soft touch for filipowski second field goal very quiet first half by K filipowski standards he had two fouls he only played 10 minutes he may have tweaked that ankle a little bit here is Brantley trying to find a way inside through traffic had it stripped out of there and Isaac Barnett I thinks going to offer a foul and does on filipowski third on filipowski first on the Blue Music Devils now brick is really trying hard to get to the basket oh oh that was an oddl looking sequence he was stumbling and stumbled right into filipowski knee and I dont care who you are where you are that doesnt feel good and Bradley then was no worse for the Bradley got banged around too so both the guards have taken head shots here in the first what 40 seconds of the second half khil Bradley 76 at the line and first one is good these are two terrific guards Chris Carell nailed it when he told us it be a playground battle with these two guys you see their numbers a year ago they accounted for 30 5 of the offense 32 points combined coming into today so theyre kind of doing their share to try and keep duns team moving North here filipowski three from the front now hes sort of stationed himself down inside most of the game but we have we know that he can shoot that from out there and thats going to open things up if hes going to make that one largest lead of the game filipowski has got eight now in the ball game thats his third field goal heres Gil working on roach pair of Threes out of the corner morero bumped and foul by McCain thats a foul but McCain did a nice job getting out there quickly because morero as we said in the first half all his field goals this year been threes he hadnt made any twos so you want him run him off the threepoint line KY filipowski you know if youre going to go that far off of him give him that much room hes going to make most of those sure is so brickus came out of the ball game a moment ago thats how morero was brought back on the floor by coach dumpy Gil did he step out of bounds he did Terry oasby is one of the best officials in the country he saw it Fifth turnover on Lal and Lal suddenly is in a danger zone here West y real quick in the second half too Music Applause Dan filipowski heres roach all the way in right back to filipowski and one terrific pass by the veteran roach here morero his first sophomore red shirt from Venezuela liles first team foul roach is a guy whos a great playmaker Wes he can create his own shot he can create shots for others and this was just a great job again that dribble penetration forces the big Defender to come and then theres nobody left to guard filipowski so heres filipowski the free throw good of all the things filipowski did a year ago hes got 11 hes already got seven or eight here in the second half of all the things filipowski did a year ago rickus the three left short Proctor and Duke three on two and Tyrese fouled on the way to the basket its going to be on desan Shepard second on the Sol and second on the Junior from Philadelphia so filipowski was the fourth player in ACC history last year to be the ACC Rookie of the Year and also the tournament MVP pretty good company when youre just one of four back to Cameron in a moment theres seconds hit all three of his field goals here in the second half he scored inside he scored outside really versatile and and thats you know hes a versatile player anyway we knew that and hes shown that versatility here in the second half Proctors going to get a couple of free throws all three field goals for Duke in the second half belong to the sophomore from Westtown New York 35 career double doubles he had 11 in ACC play a year ago on his way to being not just the ACC rookie of the year but the national freshman of the year as well Proctors three of three at the line hes got Music 15 hes really helped set the offensive tone for Duke and I think hes also helped set the defensive tone because the small guards for L we showed you their numbers coming in they have really struggled today yep 18point lead the hill gets a little steeper for dumpys team bounce pass otus with a right hand nope McCain who is scoreless by the way coming off 17 and 10 against Bucknell filipowski oh nice move with the left hand and Applause scores 20 now biggest of the night for the Blue Devils 13 for filipowski and a runner off balance from Bradley almost three minutes gone second half and here is Mitchell and Brantley will commit the foul first on Bradley third on was take you through one of these serowski is a load in the post and he dribbles and this is a great move where he makes uses that pivot foot he turns to the right and then he turns back to the left the Lal defense dropped off once he turned the first time and that allowed him some room to turn back the other way but thats a great job maintaining his pivot foot on the inside Mitchell at the line first trip tonight and his second Miss in 15 tries dont forget the ACC huddle kicks off a busy Football Saturday at 1100 am from Raleigh here on acc Network and its 630 Saturday night theyll get you ready for State Carolina at Carter Finley and then huddle after Dart Dan thats where you get all week 13 everything you need to know Kelsey Rigs and crew right here on acc Network and available for you on the ESPN app yotus the screen Gil the lefthanded three is short rokas cleans it up inside second field goal for yotus sophomore from Lithuania who a year ago averaged four and A2 points three and a half rebounds hes got five here tonight the Duke defense continues to do a great job getting out on the shooters nothing easy or contested from the outside for L roach to three gil on the run out here is brickus w I think what he should have done is stop on the outside and shot the three nice pass Yu is the dunk now Dan a lot of folks going to say no charge there on the contact the back down well thats the officials got to decide whether there was enough contact there to Warrant a foul whether the guy just fell down Terry oasby with the whistle on khil Applause Brantley you know he it looked like he leaned his shoulder into him hes off balance thats usually one you see called so to bonda Roach and Duke after the foul on Brantley that was an important basket for LEL theyve already got a steep hill to climb and dont need to make it any steeper heres Proctor what a pretty shot that isow 18 now for Proctor on if youre a s West youre not going to get this all back at once but what youd like to do is go on a little six or 70 run there yep and thats swatted by filipowski look out roach has got friends hell take it down and lay it up and he rolled off on him Mitchell had it and hes fouled on the second chance thatll get us to a timeout breaking the action on Bradleys third foul five on Lile Blue Devils up 18 when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks Vol heres Mitchell at the line couple of free throws for the sophomore from Kansas City and Mark Mitchell who came into the game 13 of 14 at the line this year is 0 for three Applause there we go nine for Mitchell 19point lead now for Duke number nine in the country this week are the Blue Devils of John Shire got an interesting schedule coming up theyve already had an interesting first four games when you look at kind of the dynamic of their three in one start yotus now they played two Big Time games out of those first four games and they didnt really play well against Arizona but they had a chance to win that game theres Mitchell cleaning up a Miss for his fifth field goal now with Applause 11 now they played Dartmouth they have played Bucknell with Michigan State in Arizona also in the lot 11 for Gil thats his first basket of the second half but that that game they played against Arizona Wes and the fact that its a home and home yep early in the season thats thats exactly what college basketball needs to help build interest in a time when youre dealing with the NFL youre dealing with the NBA theres all kinds of other distractions for the fan Proctor three ball out of the corner good oh its a two Isaac Barnett said Proctor at a foot on the line so that is 6 and A2 20 in the game now for Proctor regardless Wes that is some job with the pullup jumper with a guy in your face Brantley fouled and I believe Caleb Foster will get his first third on Foster itll be the third on Duke and another look here at the Mitchell delivery this a really nice job by Mitchell to deliver it but they run him off the threepoint line and off that dribble that is a tough shot to make we y lots of times when you run a guy off the fre threepoint line and he steps inside off the dribble hes not going to make it but Proctor has been very accurate tonight Shan Stewart has come back in the ball game you see Proctor with young Stewart McCain and Caleb Foster so look at the three guards now Dan on the floor with the two freshman and the sophomore Proctor the grad student young and another freshman here in Stewart 6 minutes into the second half Brantley into traffic and with two on the clock that is brickus a long three thats one way to describe that heres Foster to the basket and it rolled off the front rim and interestingly enough West that long three by brickus was one of the few uncontested opportunities that Lal has had brickus a crossover kick for Gil and the double team and a whistle and a foul and the foul will be on Stewart another look at the three from well out well steuart Stewart didnt go out to guard him because he thought surely this guy even if he shoots it hes not going to make it but with the shot clock running down you got to get a little more pressure on the guy than that so young is out filipowski is come back you can really see how these two guards brickus and brand they try so hard to get dribble penetration and Duke is able to stop it and then react back to the other players filipowski almost the turnover Shepard collects the deflection one to shoot and another three that time Brantley went begging but a very again another contested shot hotly contested shot Proctor for filipowski another Lonesome three tell you what Philips got 16 13 of it in the second half and hes opened up the catalog for Coach boner here in the second half he has shown you the full dossier ahead of the holidays and the thing with filipowski West is he is going to be everybodys top Target they people are going to to attack him its going to be important for Philip howski while he to show these offensive skills hes got to stay in the game and he picked up those two fouls in the first half but youre worried about the penetration but you just cant drop that far off of him so thats going to be a question for John Char what do they do when filipowski does get in foul trouble yeah heres McCain hes scoreless tonight still is and thats a one of the dangerous things about Duke West you theyre not going to rely on the same guy every night and thats sort of a scary thought Shephard and pro to the backside rebound look at transition developing nicely McCain will take another crack at it on the board ninth three of the year for Sacramentos Jared McCain and Wes McCain was getting ready to shoot that ball from the time he crossed half court he had total confidence in Pro and Proctor just put that ball in exactly the perfect spot yep what coaches call a shooting pocket Brantley now brickus whoa got by McCain and scores jir brickus with 10 on four field goals one of the few times theyve been able to create that pullup jump shot nice pass and Stewart an easy dunk eight for Shawn Stewart well the one thing weve established about Stewart he can run he can jump and he can dunk yep hed be fun in the open floor on the drive Gil with the left hand Nice Music Shot Gil drives to the right and then comes back with that left hand that was a tough shot very well defended Philip palski Blue Devils by 22 next de ball will get us to a timeout heres filipowski oh nice pass fake right back for McCain another one sure I like the way he releases the ball Dan Russ I like the way he positions himself when he catches it hes ready to go yep sure is Blue Devil lead its largest now 25 but all cut back now on the bucket by Brantley hes got six were almost halfway home in this final 20 minutes at Cameron tonight and the rebound of the Miss from Proctor by yotus eight rebounds for Ras and a reach in foul will get us to a timeout the foul will be on McCain Sean their ticket they have made a day in change out of their first visit to Cameron in 42 years West that was just great that they got everybody together for the picture yep and Gil on the score they last played January of 1983 Coach K second year at Duke the Blue Devils won 6160 in Philadelphia Philip palski missing on a leaning Applause three did I tell you how the game ended no you did not okay that mans team won on a tip End by Mark Aller with 9 seconds left now heres the boner trivia question of the night okay who had the Miss shot that Aller tipped in for Duke you know kind of that roster that feel of the Blue Devil team theres a blocking call on Mitchell on the drive by Gil well he was in the restrict area who would have missed that shot well Jay bis missed a lot of shots Jay bilis is not the answer its an excellent guess however the foul is on Blakes so not Mitchell I said Blakes I I said Mitchell its Blake second six on Duke by my count he was not in the restricted area West but you have to have your defensive position your legal guarding position established before the Airborne offensive player plants his foot prior to going airborne and he didnt get there in time and what the officials have been told unless they are 100 certain that its a charge theyre going to call it a block all right Isaac Barnett is going to go to the monitor here Clarence Armstrong going to swab the basketball so they are going to put the ball in play off the Baseline no free throws thats a good piece of officiating right way to use the review system well mainly because that review took no time at all inside bounce pass fasi and here is Gil fasi by the way just four field goals and 11 tries coming into the game six to shoot for brickus against Foster and threw it away he was trying to get Brantley but he threw it to Clarence Armstrong instead Wes that was that that offensive set there for low sort of indicative of the way the game has gone you get penetration kick the ball out and the guys who catch the ball are not ready to shoot it and that allows the Duke defense to recover yep on the drive heres Mitchell for Blakes and a block on Gil thatll be the first on anoir Gill sixth on the south okay so Aller tipped home a Miss January 8th 1983 of Tom Emma Tom Emma okay old number 2 two for the Blue Devils where do you come up with these things I went back and found the AP story to believe it or not the archives of the Associated Press very handy for things like that three on two and here is Gil a fast moving layup for his third field goal of the half hes now got 15 not many opportunities like that for the Explorers so far this evening no and thats why its 19 with eight to play beg your pardon 17 for Applause Gil and a reach in on fasi another look at the transition chance and this is what they want to do Bradley pushes the ball up and Gil has been a guy who has really attacked the basket and nice job by filipowski no reason to foul that particular play the foul on fasi and and heres filipowski on the front end and the free throw good dont forget full lineup of football comes at you starting at noon from right here at Wallace Wade Stadium about a pitching wedge from where we are then Virginia Tech Virginia for the Commonwealth cup at 330 from Charlottesville and then State Carolina from Raleigh by the way the wolf pack is into the cfp tonight for the first time this season congratulations Dave Doran team theyre 83 Carolinas 8 and3 playing Saturday night at Wayne dayfield in Raleigh tap by Blakes here is Proctor Duke by 20 Mitchell roach got caught in the air got it right back to Mitchell and fasi wrong place wrong time foul will get us to a break 740 to go in Durham blue Devils about 20 Im looking forward to seeing what the ACC SEC challenge gives us next week you see where Duke is the notable nonc cons here as Mitchell goes to the line the loss here to Arizona was a terrific highlevel Game for college basketball the impressive win against Michigan State and the Champions classic at Arkansas is John shy draw well even though Arkansas has not had a lot of success at home against teams from North Carolina this year that does mean thats going to be an easy game for Duke of course Im referring to the fact that you and see Greensboro went in there and pulled an upset yeah terrific effort from Mike Jones as Spartans right absolutely anytime you can go in to Arkansas and get a win youve accomplish something yeah in fact the uh assistant to the head coach Mike shogy who sits at the front of the Duke bench next to John Shire we were talking with him today he might be the only guy on the staff who had has any experience going into Bud Walton Arena when he was the head coach at Elon they went to Arkansas and played in one of those uh nonconference November December games thats par are going to get a couple free thr thats going to be a tough challenge for Duke but there are a lot of really good matchups you know Miami won their tournament they beat canza state today and theres Mike shoggy but the next game that the hurricanes are going to play is going to be at Kentucky yeah and so that is going to be a heck of a game those are two really really good teams Kentucky right at the moment playing a little smaller they shoot a lot of Threes mhm North Carolina and Tennessee is going to be a heck of a game I think pit Florida is an interesting game I think thats another interesting game absolutely uh Proctors got his first 20point game by the way as a Blue Devil tonight and hes actually added to it hes got 21 now make it 22 I think the the value on some of this is going to get real interesting fast and Dan will have the same discussion we had with the old ACC Big 10 challenge how much of it comes back to help the league once those NCAA tournament parings are announced and where does the value of the game in November December help you in midmarch right well Wes the whole the NCA evaluation tool the Whole Net business the Met tricks that they use they tried to make every game in November and December important and I think theyve gone overboard a little bit so thats certainly the case so Im not sure that just because you win a challenge that that makes you the better conference a lot of it depends on matchups and where the games are played some teams are up some teams are down but Wes its interesting now were into the ACC SEC challenge right for years we had the ACC Big 10 Challenge and before that we had the ACC big East challenge yep a lot of challenging going on yep and Stewart missed the back end but a lane violation of fasi will get him another one so all that starts next week but its fun the ESPN family of network its fun those are games that people are interested in seeing and were talking about ways to in November and December to drive the interest in college basketball and thats a really good way to do it 10 for Stewart all of these are season highs for the Freshman from windir Florida 25point lead for Duke Gil step away three pretty shot rattled out and it will belong to the Blue Devils and heres Jaylen Blakes into the ball game for Coach sh to replace Jeremy roaching Jeremy Roach I think John shy has to be very pleased overall with the performance of the Blue Devils particularly on the defensive end there were times where they sputtered a little bit on offense but they have really not allowed Lal to get anything going particularly in the second half yep Foster Runner nice second field goal for Caleb Foster got four points tonight theyve got a lot of guys who can put points on the board Wes and they came in averaging 823 per game through the first four theyre going to finish with at least 82 tonight oh what a no look for Stewart Philip palski and a 10 Duke run has shown you everything here in the second half so much for the worrying and Meandering about a threepoint first half well this just he has scored it and delivered it here in half two Wes one of the things about him is when he he gets the ball in the back court whether its on a steal or a rebound he can handle it very well and this just thats the classic definition of a notor pass I think he surprised Stewart with the ball and again steuart shows you that if hes willing to run hes going to get a lot of opportunities 17 tonight for filipowski hes got four Music assists in 23 minutes Music Man scary Dan its very interesting Wes you know last year we spent during this time of the year in November and December you and I spent a lot of time we did a couple of Duke games and it was really fun to watch The Duke team sort of grow before our eyes and I think thats the same thing youre seeing here is watching the Arizona Game and you know of course getting ready for this game we watched all those games on tape and its just very interesting to that this Duke team incremental Improvement but thats what youre looking for at this time of the year yeah the other part about this is and we were talking with John sh about this today he had to have some time also to work through some combinations hes got 5 and 12 minutes to go in a 29o game Dan hes going to be able to see a little bit of confidence with certain combinations here as this game winds down so were going to get a look at Blakes McCain Foster TJ power who played 11 minutes on Friday night against Buck Nells going to come in first time we have seen the uh Shrewsberry Massachusetts freshman at 69 on the floor and thats a guy he specifically talked about today yes well theres Blakes with your freshman class yep up from Hickory Ridge Middle School in charlot thats right yeah from uh a Thanksgiving food drive if you will that Caleb Foster had over the weekend north of Charlotte and now TJ power on the floor for the first time and we watch brickus launch another three if he has any room at All West hes hes pretty good I dont know how it works in the A10 but I would just offer this you might want to cover two on the perimeter I dont think Im breaking news to anybody thats been in that League the last few years though and were going to get an offensive foul called on Stewart another look at brickus off the perimeter third on Stewart seven on Duke oh this pump fakey gets Stewart to fly by and then just really takes his time Wes takes that one dribble moves to his left and buries it and when Stewart flies by he flies by well you know his like his shoe tops went by brick Music nose Gil working on Blakes Baseline for Sassi a little scoop with the left hand and one forun de valberg fasi his first basket jar and the foul is on Jared McCain its his third fasi may end up being a pretty important element for Gran dumpy during the A10 season 68 over 200 lb hes a guy who played has played internationally with the Swedish team he scored an average couple of years ago he 19 points a game playing in the Summer with the Sweden with the Swedens under 18 team so hes a guy thats pretty talented and a timeout will be asked for by Duke here and John Shire coaching points if nothing else up 23 four and a half to go tonight at Music Cameron NORAD omir were going to have to brush up got to help NORAD the Duke control room says uh stuffing corn pudding nice nice job with no no G on pudding apple pie mashed potato sweet potato casserole and and one for Caleb Foster as we rejoin you from Cameron youre the one whos got the masses arriving to Western Virginia to join you so you got to tell me

chocolate chip Che cheesecake uh chocolate cake uh pumpkin muffins pumpkin pie I got a lot of things I got to bake tomorrow I think people would be surprised to know that one of The Luminaries of Atlantic Coast Conference basketball is actually a master pie Chef well I dont know that I would call myself a master pie chef but I do like to make pie and my siblings at least are nice enough to say that they enjoy him brandley at the free throw line after the fourth on Applause McCain and he hits them both here eight now for Brantley four free throws couple of field goals 24point lead for Duke here is Foster nice pass for Stewart and the basket Sean Stewarts got 14 tonight 8458 cut to the basket nice pass faass at three well the young man from Sweden knocks down his third three of the year six all in the half and we were talking about that before Wes you got to be ready to shoot it when you catch it and that time he was his Duke continues to rotate out very well and the rebound for Gil against TJ Applause power Bradley wants some space against jayen Blakes nice ball movement another fasi Applause three and heres Blakes for foster inside Stewart too far underneath got it back and it rimmed out he got his own rebound and scores a third time the charm for Shawn Stewart I think Gil got a hand on the first one but he was able to do the old Moses Malone miss a couple times build up his offensive rebounding numbers on the drive Brantley and and the foul foul will be on power his first couple of free throws here for Brantley well Brantley and brickus have not had a lot of success with their dribble penetration but they are Relentless in trying to accomplish it sure are dont forget Fridays ACC PM Mark Packer live from Raleigh for Eastern get you ready for our final installment
