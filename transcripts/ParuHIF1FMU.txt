the junior out of Philadelphia some think he would have one of the best jumpers in the NBA if you threw him in the association right now we are set for basketball underway another season of college basketball coming your way on acc Network extra its the canes and the Highlanders Miami will possess the basketball first theyll get it down low to nor cadir inside to Matthew Cleveland the transfer from Florida State Miami with an early two nothing lead thats a great read by North Shadow May right there the Double K fast Matthew C came on the opposite side for an easy layup for two Robinson H grave Buchanan and de graph on the floor for the Highlanders this is a team 7 and 23 last season under the direction now of Grant Bill Meer in his first season one of 25 division one coaches making their debuts this week a three is on the way and its good early Ive been watching this guy Adam hes man he has a beautiful stroke if you look at NJIT Ts offense they really move the ball and theyre moving out the ball every single second nor Chad oir for a three nor Chad oir shot that ball so smoothly and confident I believe in that shot he shoots it so quickly that is not a shot that hes really been all that confident in throughout the course of his college basketball career he would do it a little bit last season but boy that looks a lot better this time around 100 you notice he stepped into it with confidence shot the ball very smoothly Ive seen NORAD shooting 500 to 1000 shots a day so be expected to see a lot more threes from NORAD this game and for the rest of the season foul was on wga popper his first team first Miami with an early 5 to3 lead Robinson top of the key with the basketball and he hands it off to hes he hes who has a three already tonight led the entire American east in threepoint percentage last season hell fire away again that is short an offensive rebound taken away by Bensley Joseph into the front Court North cadir great finish great steal great finish great footwork you may look at that leg and say oh that was a simple play up but for somebody that big and that strong to be able to have his feet planted and lay that ball up like that is something special to see you Canon strong to the rack with the right hand no good ball rolls out of bounds off of NJIT Miami basketball starting five for the canes tonight Matthew Cleveland the transfer from Florida State Denley Joseph inserted into the starting lineup this season a three on the way for a popper no good Nigel pack is all over bu canon in the back court 7 to3 Miami leads theres the takeaway popper will fire away again for three and that one is short off the backboard Matthew Cleveland with an offensive rebound it rattles around and thats out of bounds and Miami retains possession of the basketball I love that shot by W popper he missed one shot the neck was an open shot coach L says shoot that shot we believe in you w a lot more and he did not play in the exhibition dealing with just a little minor tweak but he is good to go tonight Nigel packs floater no good out of nowhere Matthew Cleveland I dont know that might have been a pass or it might have been a floater either way we got two points on for the Miami Hurricanes Matthew Cleveland a couple of points early here the Florida state transfer he led the seals in scoring and rebounding last season he broke Miamis Hearts here in Coral Gables and it snapped what would have been a perfect 170 season at home for the Miami Hurricanes the graph hands it up off top to Hess now over Far Side Robinson Corner three on the way no good skying for the rebound to gra his put back attempt is no good thats what I really love about Matthew Cleveland he can get it done on both sides offensively and defensively Cleveland will fire away for three and that short good look open look very open look little flat on the jump shot little bit of a line drive got to get it up get that elbow up in the air well see a different result next shot Jack take me back to when you were playing first game of the season fans back in the building nice crowd on hand here tonight at what point did you feel like you really started the settle down was it the first shot You make oh man the first shot I mean soon as you step on that floor you know this is the first game all summertime youre putting in the shots youre putting in the work youre ready for this moment you missed one you shoot it again I said you miss to you make pass down low for degraph with a body and the shot no good omir battling for a rebound down low with Buchanan I really like this match up for the Hurricanes playing against a big man like number 33 is going to be really good and help them for the season coming up bucket good there for maai gray the senior made 26 starts last season for the Highlanders scored 10 plus 10 times hes on the scoreboard and Matthew Cleveland and nor Chad oir with all the scoring thus far for Miami here comes omir to the wreck and its good give him another you see if you look at that matchup lir is a little bit stronger and faster down bottom so expect him to attack that big man every single play or every opportunity that he has cuz he cannot stand in front of NORAD this guys a freight train going down the middle omir will attempt to convert the threepoint opportunity after the foul in the bucket was good omir to the foul line for for Miami and that is good and now kesan George and Michael Nook couple of freshman for the Miami Hurricanes will check in early very surprised by the early Subs very surprised by the early Subs we know coach L knows what hes doing so lets lets see what we get out of this Michael Nook a fourstar out of Toronto and then kesan George hes been sneakily The Talk of the Town in Coral Gables freshman out of Switzerland a top 250 player he is really really good as NJIT gets a bucket great play attack the Freshman no wco on the pick and roll we kind of got lost there but lets expect him to get it back on the next play his early action for the Freshman Matthew Cleveland little PP fake underneath for noo his first point as a Miami Hurricane great hands great finish like we said in the exhibition we need noo to dunk that basketball when hes that that close to the basket he was eye level with the rim and he decided to just lay it heres Buchanan on the wing working on Cleveland hell get a high screen an off ball switch in the face of noo little silky smooth touch there nice touch shot the ball with Supreme confidence right there Elijah Buchanan in his sixth college basketball season spent his first five at Manhattan his career has been riddled with injury three on the way no good for Bensley Joseph but the Highlanders think theyve got something special in and Buchanan if they can keep him healthy 100 you can see hes playing with Supreme confidence you know hes hes hes a 5year senior how about the newcomer Matthew Cleveland underneath for the Freshman the kanes lead 14 to9 season six NCAA tournament appearances with the Miami Hurricanes basketball program four sweet 16s two years ago he led the canes to their first ever lead eight in last season their first ever final four before they were upended to those Yukon Huskies who would go on to win it all coach one of the best in the business and Jack what makes him so special you are around this program so much his demeanor he never gets rattled you know as a player if you look over to the bench you see your coach rattled you know you may get rattled but coach L has a great demeanor very confident very poised and thats why his programs are very confident very poised when it comes to postseason its amazing only coach L and Larry Brown the only two head coaches in NCAA history to take two different teams to a final four of course it was years ago now that coach L took that incredible George Mason team to the final four you know coach and Larry Brown kind of look alike right very similar very similar uh both very very good at what they do too huh very great at what they do very great at what they do all these Wings Over The Air for coach 255 of the Miami Hurricane 725 wins overall an incredible incredible year spanning decades for Jim leega so 14 to9 Miami leads Bley Joseph to noo little cut by George wga popper a three and that one is good he finally gets one to go well if you look at his first three wga shot was first two threes he shot the ball and backed up a little bit on that shot he went straight up and landed in the same place he shot the ball I think thats what helped him get that basket in the ball and PRI that that ball in the basket yeah and prior to the media timeout they had taken him out of the game very very quickly and coming out of the break wi go was right back in theres a foul on the floor Matthew Cleveland might have been gone over the back heres another look at that shot Jack straight up straight down didnt drift back thats very key to shootting you be got you got to be able to go straight up straight down land in the same spot stay with your shot nor Chad oir checking back in now for the Miami Hurricanes and on the other side for NJIT Jake gold ber The Freshman out of IMG Academy here in the State of Florida now AJ Casey who got some run last season the Miami Hurricanes will check in as well he played in 29 games last year this is a big year for AJ you know Coach Alex best a lot out of this guy thats how he comes to play today he was the number one player in the state of Illinois just a couple of years ago as Miami forces another turnover and omir starts to bring it up the floor before he hands it off to Kean George good defense there by Buchanan popper will work on him and hes going to pull up hes going to hit thats a beautiful jump shot beautiful jump shot very high releas and he was very poised he didnt get rattled got to a spot elevated basket thats a little bit of what we saw in recent Seasons from the recently departed Isaiah Wong who would Elevate and he would hit thats a big role that theyve got to fill this season wga is ready for it thats a beautiful pass in the corner a three on the way and its no good Mi down with a defensive rebound Here Comes popper lays it up for nor chadow Mary cant handle the pass cleanly great pass great hustle back and a quick three in transition is no good nji t with an offensive rebound into the hands of Francis a deep three for h no good oms got the rebound hes going to start to bring it up the floor AJ Casey another pass towards the rim and Bley joose throws it away I really like ner Chad getting that rebound and pushing the basketball he really gives University Miami advantage on fast breaks thats something hes been working on Mai gray will take a seat for the Highlanders Daniel shrier checks in for NJIT down low for shrier he got blocked at The Rim Miamis defense stingy look at that help defense by W popper you know he gets it done on both ends and now poer throws it away he was trying to get it back out top of the key for omir and Buchanan in transition hes fouled 199 Miami leading theres a look at Grant Bill Meer one of 25 division one coaches as I mentioned making their debuts this week a native of New Jersey in a seat Hall grad he just spent one season at Maryland under Kevin Willard he was at seatan Hall with Willard for seven seasons and hes been tasked with turning around a program that went 7 and 23 last season you know coach Willard has a winning pedigree when you coach under someone like that you can only have a winning pedigree so I look forward to see what coach Greg has going coming forward substitutions here for the Highlanders Buchanan missed the first and he missed them both missed a pair Buchanan the only Highlander on the floor that scored here tonight omir has already got eight hes got a couple of rebounds hes going to fire away again for a three whoa baby once again stepped into that shot with confidence great rotation flick the wrist nothing but the bottom of the net he has poured in half of Miamis points here tonight Tariq Francis handling the basketball now for the Highlanders he works in he floats one up no good a soft touch and theres a foul on the floor with 1137 left the play in the first half from Miami nor Chad omir hes a bad man and hes hitting him from on a roll in the opener here in 2023 2024 tonight omir already 11 points hes two of two from threepoint territory a couple of rebounds and Jack this is a a young man whos got a bright future ahead of him also averaged in his first season in the ACC coming over from Arkansas State last season a little over 13 points and 10 rebounds a game a double double you can see that hes been putting working in the off season hes really steing into his jump shot with Supreme confidence the way the balls coming off his hand the way the ball is rotating going to the basket you can tell hes been working on his shot in the off season out of the break by me leading 22 to9 on the deck is BU Cannon a near turnover and that is going to be turned over that ball rolled out of Bounce over there on the far sideline line great active Hands by University of Miami hands on the ball hands in the paint thats what you want to see on defense especially early in the first game of the season N9 minutes into the opener kans leading by a Bakers Dozen tan Georg and thats a deep three for the Freshman Off the Mark two strong off to the right back comes NJIT a three in the corner is good thats you dont want to see Miss a three and kind of late till a contest in the corner for three for the other team the three for Tariq Francis The Freshman out of Pittsburgh he poured in 11 in the exhibition against Sean Hall an exhibition by the way for the Highlanders they lost 6860 to Sean Hall they had a uh a healthy lead at the half so expectations big this season Francis again for three no good an offensive rebound and a foul and the foul is on nor Chad omir who will ask for a little assistance from Nigel pack getting up as Robinson H gray and de graph will check back in for NJIT playing a team like seen haunt exhibition is a great confidence booster for your team coming into your first game of the season and coming down here playing University Miami and ACC team a final 14 well I asked around a little bit earlier this afternoon you know you know exhibitions you might see a lot of run for freshman uh SE hall went in there they stacked it up like it was their opener and NGIT put up a terrific fight so theyve got some confidence coming to Coral Gables theres a three in the corner oh that babys good from the wing wow Buchanan Buchanan knew he was shooting that shy as soon as he caught the ball as a shooter you got to be thinking shoot before that ball touches your hand six quick points after an eight nothing run by Miami Matthew Cleveland open three from the wing thats too short he collects his own Miss popler will pull up and that is no good University of Miami is a little flat right now on the jump shots has for three and hes fouled hes going to go to the free throw line hes going to get three opportunities from the charity stripe if you watch this NJIT team play they are not nervous at all theyre coming in here trying to defeat the Hurricanes if hes gets a little bit of daylight hes going to shoot the ball The Graduate out of California made 24 starts last season he led the American eastn threepoint percentage he averaged 10 a game he scored 10 plus 16 different times as he connects on the first great size for a shooter as well hes hes a pretty big guy hes a 64 guard High release beautiful rotation on his shot at a West Lake Village California Miami has already committed six fouls a little over 10 minutes into the the first half so NJIT already into the bonus as hes hits the first two and a 13point lead for Miami starting to evaporate H makes all three its 22 to 18 a 90 Run for the Highlanders terrific energy might needs to get a basket right now they need to get a basket right now slow down this momentum half double teamed in the corner Cleveland over wga popper back up top for Bensley Joseph trying to slice and dice Cleveland will try to get there he gets the Defenders off their feet his first attempt no good but AJ Casey is there to clean up the Miss AJ Cas is a very Dynamic player he can play inside can play outside as you can see right there after the offensive rebound Robinson up top down low for degraph wide open and oh a block no thats a goal tending violation on AJ Casey that help side has to come a little bit sooner on that defensive play the AJ Casey might have gotten turned around a little bit up there top of the key and it left the graph wide open down low Nigel pack brings the ball across the timeline for Miami a little stutter step high off the glass no good but there to clean up his Miss Matthew Cleveland and a timeout here for the Highlanders out of New Jersey Miami leading 262 Matthew Cleveland the newcomer the transfer from the Rival he looks pretty good here at the opener for the Kings Tonight these mov look in the F mov look in the future look I dont think theyre ready for some people just know thats not going to fit thats not going to fit really no Id cut it in half and make two chairs those are the people who know youre in good hands with all state Grant Bill Meer just used his first timeout hes got three left the Highlanders trailing the Hurricanes 2620 go back to 2006 Jack mclinton and uh you and the boys from the U rolled up to Central New York and uh you were playing Binghamton at the time an early season matchup you guys would handle business well that wasnt really the case and you know you kind of look at this one tonight and Miamis got their hands full very similar very similar a bingamon team came up here at University of Miami was not scared got a little run and if you get down sometimes its tough to get back cuz that momentum keeps rolling and that confidence keeps building so we want Miami to kind of get some B get some defensive stops and make some shots so we can kind of get this momentum slow down mid Majors with a little confidence feeling like theyre playing with house money let it rip for 40 minutes you never know whats going to happen its a crazy game its a beautiful game this NJIT team has nothing to lose has back with the basketball little right hand floater that rattles in and out a near turnover Nigel pack will fire away for three and hell connect one thing about that nights with pack kid he is going to let it fly if you give him any daylight thats a huge shot for University Miami Robinson stops and Pops exactly what Miami wanted and he misses wga finds pack inside and he gets rejected the ball rolls out of bounds a Timeout on the floor Miami leading by nine Nigel packed he was Sensational last season in particular in the NCAA tournament hes got a deep three great look off to the shot what you see on that last three opportunity for Nigel Pac that was a very pro move you notice when Nigel pack came off that pick and roll he glanced to his right to throw the defense off to get him an open look big an undersiz shooter everything matters that look away got him that open shot pack with his first points of the Season Miami with the basketball coming out of the timeout and pack handling the responsib AB IL right wing a Stutter Step finds a wide open what smooth stroke very smooth stroke wer was thinking Im letting this ball go as soon as it touches my hands the result another three by wer po go back a couple of minutes Miami had an 8 nothing run that was countered by a Highlanders 90 run now Miamis on an 80 run of their own over the course of the last minute theyre leading by 12 basketball is a game of runs as you can see and Miami is out and running and wers got a pair largest lead of the night for the canes a 10 run and they lead by 14 wga has crazy athleticism crazy athleticism he threw down a windmill dunk in conference play against Duke here at home last season and it almost brought the ceiling down on this place AJ Casey with the basketball hands it off Cleveland tried to throw one down no foul on the play whoa and then on back on the other end Sebastian Robinson with a pair wow beautiful pass by a casy you know Great lead pass all Matthew CL had to do was catch the ball and go up for dunk unfortunately he missed it but I like to see AJ getting the ball out in transition getting it to his man and getting the dunk Cleveland with six points and five rebounds popper for three that is deep but you give him just a little bit of daylight hes going to bury it too much daylight one thing You noce wga shot it looks the same every single time it doesnt waivers thats a sign of a great shooter pi and roll top the key Miu will switch Defenders heres a spin and a foul Im loving Im loving the way Elijah banan is attacking the basket right now theres another look at that deep three from wga popper my goodness smooth stroke one of the best Ive seen in the country its Jack mclinton territory out there hes shooting the ball with so much confidence right now and Coach H gives wga so much confidence to let play Fly and let him play and thats what you want if youre a shooter and a dynamic guard you want your coach to give you Supreme confidence and thats what we go pop againsts with Coach H checking in now for Miami Christian Watson a sophomore who appeared in 11 games last season Jake Goldberg set the check in for the Highlanders big opportunity for Christian Watson right now cominging in with 5 minutes and 48 seconds saw a lot of energy from him in the exhibition defensively I think that what thats what keeps him on the floor right now you know we have a ton of scores hes a great scorer but right now we need him we need him on the defensive end play hard talk communicate if he gets an open shot needs to be able to knock it down look at that pass from Cleveland down low a terrific finish from Casey great pass great finish you notice this lineup is very Dynamic you dont really have a true Center in the game you have you have Cleveland you have Casey both of them are not really big men but theyre very Dynamic players that can play one through five and they can switch youve noticed now theyll probably switch everything right now with this lineup well they swinging heres a three from Hess o he buried it great shot great shot on the Move great feet you noce he playing his feet let the ball go Adam Hess has nine Hensley Joseph thought about a step back three now a step back three for Joseph is good he buried another one neither one of these teams are that shy in the threepoint shooting Department tonight theyll let it rip not at all I love the way when Bley caught that ball he attacked the paint thats one thing the young kids watch when you get the ball in the close out attack that paint make that defender back up Miami leading 4226 now slicing and dicing through the paint no foul on the floor Sebastian Robinson check that that was Tariq Francis who hit the deck hard I love this lineup for University of Miami this is a different look weve never really seen with him before pack into the paint he finds a wide open Bensley Joseph three on the way its good and Grant Bill Meers going to ask for another timeout with 402 remaining in the first half Miami all of a sudden has extended their lead to 19 it is unselfish basketball they find a wideopen Bensley Joseph in the corner thats something that you want to see with the new team new players unselfishness Miami is really showing that moving the basketball is a great thing to do 402 left to play in the first half of Miami a 6 nothing Run for the Hurricanes theyre eight of 14 from threepoint L couple of minutes ago coach L made a small shift in the lineup theyve gone a little bit smaller although everybody Nationwide the last couple of years says they cant win games this small but this ones paying off again jack it reminds me a lot of UNLV Running Rebels its a very Dynamic lineup on defense you can switch one through five you have Matthew Cleveland AJ Casey very athletic guard Wings big man that could really get there and be dynamic on defense and offense Lord chatt mirs only played a little under 7 and a half minutes hes got a couple of fouls so too does Michael noo in Just 2 minutes and 18 seconds of action so coach L is running a bit of a smaller lineup out there its paying dividends notice everything they are switching switching everything oh and a miss at The Rim by Jake Goldberg Christian Watson with the basketball he looks up top and he finds Nigel pack better get a hand in his face hell shoot it from half court pack working on Goldberg and Goldberg The Freshman swipes it away now on the deck maai gray Miami trying to force another turnover a three and that is good for Adam Hess this kid Adam hes is making a name for herself today shooting the ball with Supreme confidence you can see theres no nervousness in his body he wants to get a win he wants to make shots he wants to help his team win his basketball game hes got 12 hes made three threes Fenley Joseph a three on the way to short AJ Casey offensive rebound he pops he stops he misses Matthew Cleveland with an N one hell head to the foul line great Hang Time the last couple plays AJ casy and Matthew Cleveland have been all over the offensive class thats what you want to see from guys coming in like a AJ Casey thats how you stay on the court Matthew Cleveland once again I keep using the word dynamic you can see he can get it down on offense defense rebounding anything you need Matthew is a all utility guy he gets in there and gets it done we popper checks in for Bensley Joseph Matthew Cleveland LED Florida State scoring and rebounding last season 138 points a game six rebounds hes already got eight and seven in his first game as a Miami Hurricane here tonight that shows you dont really need to have the ball to score so the guys out there young guys play defense rebound you dont need to be dribbling and shooting to score the ball couple of years agoot different way yeah Matthew Cleveland couple of years ago the Sixth Man of the Year in the ACC and hes on the Julius Irving preseason award watch list and his first year as a Miami Hurricane gray to the rack left hand no good a foul on the floor and thatll go on the Highlanders and on to grab coach Alis stand small Co Im really liking this lineup its the first time weve really seen this lineup and small have a lot of threats on the court right now Levi lwal checks in now the Freshman out of Laurel Maryland at 67 195 lb nobody for years now has believed in this small ball right how they going to beat these big old teams in ACC Matthew Cleveland finds a wide open wga popper in the corner bad shot no good rattles off the rent but they are so so darn good in transition forcing turnovers you know speed kills speed kills and you can see this right now this University Miami basketball team I know its a little different we were actually having a conversation off there a couple of minutes ago Jack heres a three on the way thats no good and the rebound is in the hands of Matthew Cleveland you know the NBA actually going a little bit smaller these days as well for sure the whole game is becoming smaller you know deep threes transition shots you dont really want to see a lot of midrange right now you dont see a lot of Team Tre midrange jump shots boy a layups for Matthew Cleveland hes got 11 and eight hes going to be sniffing a double double in his first 20 minutes of action as a Miami Hurricane Runner no good for Hess Cleveland down with the rebound thats his ninth hes got 11 n in the opening 20 minutes of his Miami Hurricanes career in a three no good for Nigel pack now Christian Watson will fire away thats no good its great look by Christian Watson you know when Im on a you dont like to talk about the sneakers James Harden all these guys had the hardens on another big three in the corner a lot of James hard sneakers out there on the court right now that time the Freshman Jake Goldberg freshman shooting the ball with confidence thats what you want to see near side corner three here goes Watson towards the rack he lost the basketball but Miami will retain possession with 45 seconds showing on the game clock here in the first half from Coral Gables tonight on that drive you got to push the ball out in front of you you might want to take one dribble extend the ball and go for a flush or a layup pack into the paint hands it off Watsons got a bucket great attack great finish his first two points of the Season Miami leading by 19 11 on the clock five on the shot clock hes has it hes not scared to shoot it bombs away no good and its going to be Miami basketball leading by 20 I said 19 I beg your pardon Miami leading by 23 seconds left to play in the half PR is going to shoot this ball right now popler wga popper well if hes going to take it out Nigel pack see what we got 3 seconds I might just take it and head to the locker room to be quite honest with you wga monkeying around he hands it off to Nigel pack in Miami through 20 minutes of play to open up a new season puts 52 they hang 52 on the Highlanders you know guys I want to miss that percentage up they got there for the first time in program history last season in AED immediately to start the second half a turnover and nor chadow with a flush being able to move that fast stop one a dime and Elevate like that thats a freak of nature that is not normal thats why some NBA teams are very high on NAD because of small things like that that a lot of people cannot really do whats his Prospect for a guy like that maybe a little unsized NBA but you know there theres theres a lot to like H for three o it rattles in and out cant teach motor this guy is on 110 all the time aloop no good nor Chad got his own rebound running down the floor he handed it off to wga popper nor Chad oir was back in the paint back turned to the basket he knew wga was going to hit it he knew it smooth jump shot I mean I think W shots got even better from last year maybe its the confidence knowing hes really that goto guy on this basketball team great Pace by the big fella might want to stay in the paint too strong up the floor Matthew Cleveland in transition he missed the lay on that one but look how they got the ball up so quickly no dribbles pass the ball up Court Miami with a quick five nothing run to start the half a battle down low and nor Chad oir came up with the basketball and said hey I can dribble The Rock too baby a turnover by Bensley Joseph yanan comes back the other way he hands it off to maai Gray hes got a bucket its good finish he want to definitely get points off turnovers thats what NGIT just did gray with his second bucket the night hes got four another three on the way wga popper no good fighting for the loose ball on the rebound Nigel pack off his fingertips itll be Highlanders basketball heres another look at that slam quick twitch muscles stopping and going straight up and yamming that thing hes special n Chad is one of the best power forwards in the country first take for Adam in the Finish also a hook shot there was elevated notice how he attack the basket put the ball in front of him finish away from the defense theyll probably find a lot of real estate too if he pump fakes once in a while from three everybody just thinks hes going to launch it up there theres a foul on the floor and thats going to be on Maki gr lets go back to NORAD for a second Jack cuz I think its interesting this is a young man who transferred from Arkansas State a lot of people probably not paying close attention to the Arkansas State basketball program they do very well for themselves he answered questions quickly about his ability to play in one of the V Premier conferences in the country hes just simply unbelievable he has a crazy work ethic and an amazing modor reminds me a lot of myself you know I transfer from Sienna College the University of Miami you know and when you come from smaller programs the odds are against you so you always had that chip on your shoulder you look at nor Chad hes coming out here every night with something to prove and hes proving that hes one of the best power fors in the country heres wga he pulls up thats no good and nor Chad on Q has an offensive rebound then its ripped away by El Buchanan Buchanan in the paint slips it out far Corner M Kai gray is working on Bensley Joseph hes fouled the bucket wont go hell head to the line for a pair if you notice a difference in NJIT Ts offense right now the beginning the game theyre moving the ball a lot more youre seeing a lot more oneonone play right now and thats what happens you get down you want to play oneonone and be a savior but at the end of the day stick to your guns move the basketball get the defensive movement get easy shots its a great test for them to open up their season its actually amazing when you look at this program they have nine freshman this season one Junior one senior five graduate players its going to take them a little bit to uh get used to playing with one another 100 And theyre not looking bad you know very young team but also a very old team you got some and six year seniors so its will take some time for him to you know bring this thing together but Im liking what I see from the NJIT team right now maai gray goes one of two from the free throw line so Miamis lead is 20 packing the paint left hand off the glass HS good and hell head to the free throw line what a move on the big guy K de graph that was a great finish by Nigel you definitely want to see that a lot more from him you know obviously you used to Nigel shooting a lot of Threes we want to see him finishing more at the baskets once he catches that ball on the threepoint line the defense is running at him being able to take one two dribbles and finish at the basket thats great to see from a undiz guard he finished that over at big man that was a great finish by Nigel pack a Fearless finish on the big guy Nigel pack fourthe Junior average 136 points per game last season shot at Team Bass 404 from three point land had 15 threes and scored 82 points in the NCAA tournament he was the Midwest region most outstanding player what an incredible first season he had incredible season by now Japan hes on the Bob Koozie point guard of the Year watch list preseason second Team all ACC nor Chad preseason First Team all ACC Miamis lead now 2 3 14 seconds on the shot clock up top great great help by norat great help three no good Nigel pack with a rebound those are small things that you dont see that helped defense that NAD provided allowed Adam not to get an open look swung the ball forc to three he got a easy transition layup for dunp Matthew Cleveland now with 13 points needs one more rebound for a double double to start his season oh nice finish there Elijah Buchanan The Graduate AJ Casey set the check in for Miami nor Chad oir spinorama in the paint and he cant finish at The Rim hes not happy with himself omir with 13 points and four rebounds and theres a foul on Matthew Cleveland and thats going to send us through a timeout heres another well back here in Miami tonight college basketball is back it is great to be back with you the 13th ranked Miami Hurricanes have a 23 Point Advantage out of the Highlanders the New Jersey Institute of Technology out of the American East out of the timeout to the free throw line Makai Gray hes got five points tonight leading score for the Highlanders Adam hes got 14 Elijah Buchanans got six rebounds he leads NJIT in that department Matthew Cleveland nearing a double double hes got 13 and nine he is on the floor after the Miss rebound into the hands of wga popper Bensley Joseph will bring it up the floor High pick by AJ Casey popler hands it off the Nigel pack a little bit of breathing room far Corner W is going to pull up he loves what he sees the snd wow he very very smoth jum shot not a lot of motion in between the shot and the release hes got 19 points he is 7 of 14 from the field five of nine from Deep what did you want to see from him in the first game back comes Matthew Cleveland and a whistle on the floor that that could have gotten dangerous heres another look at the wga three probably shouldnt leave him that much room its a great pass by NAU once again nigu is very good at looking away notice how he looks one side throws opposite great pass great shot hes got 19 Jack hes got 19 as Cleveland misses the first free throw look coach L stuck his neck out there to start the season in his media availability he said I think weve got maybe the best midrange jump shot in college basketball and if you put him in the NBA right now its going to play there you know thats thats high praise thats really high praises Matthew Cleveland takes a seat I mean coach ell knows what hes talking about hes seen a ton of Pros hes had Pros in previous years and yeah wo poer is always in the gym he eats sleeps does everything in that gym meet me at the rim nor chadow Mir a ferocious block on Elijah Buchanan look at that shows the biceps yeah see him if you notice hes very hes a very quick jumper thats why he gets so hes able to get off the ground and in the air faster than a lot of other guys at his position I think Buchanon thought he was by everybody too and he was going to have an easy flush and nor Chad came out of nowhere itll stay Highlanders basketball wow mirs got 13 and four first block of the Season great help great help good ball Movement by the Highlanders and then at the very last moment shrier The Graduate out of Santa Monica throws it away thats great help defense if you help defense the next guys to come in and help and thats what university might me doing in that last play great execution on defense by Miami wga turns it over great great attack great attack we just talked about that you catch the ball in the perimeter somebodys running at you you need one or two dribbles get to the basket great finish Nigel pack gets blocked at The Rim Francis for three looks good and he buries it Jake Goldberg ready to check back in for NJIT wga pulls up and he misses offensive rebound om with a flush another flush from Royal Flush going on with NORAD right now hes got 15 Poppers got 19 and one thing I like to see with both of these players theyre not exerting a lot of energy to get these points its coming very easy to them three bounces out now its in the hands of hes he misses omir just turns around hands it off the pack who finds a wide open Bensley Joseph for three a bit too strong off the back of the iron that was a great look great looking transition youre going to see a lot more transition threes this year from University of Miami pass with a quick trigger probably a bad shot there no good omir up the floor he finds wga popler wow what a terrific finish and Poppers got 21 in the opener great Euro Step to the inside reverse thats a read and react play thats something that you work on in the gym read and react and right there he brought it to life in a real game and he finishes with his back turned to the basket great floating he misses too strong and uh Miami just running here theyre trying to run the Highlanders right out of the gym theyre going to do it asking for a timeout as Grant billm Miami leading 72 44 heres that nasty looking L are we in Miami or are we in Europe its a lot of Euro steps going on right now 1209 left the play in regulation from the watsco center here on the campus of the University of Miami tonight Miami the 13th ranked hurricanes with a 7244 lead and a bit of a different look coming out of the timeout and the media takeaway by nor cadir he puts it on the deck he hands it off to AJ K what did we just talk about nor Chad putting the ball on the floor initiating the fast break nor Chad spins hours at a time working on this ball handling and its really paying off and people are really being able to see the the late nights in the gym and what hes been putting to working hes got another takeaway after that ball was tipped by Bensley Joseph right to omir Watson hands it off to Casey bombs away for three that is too short did not follow the shot started the fade away were seeing a lot with these guys theyre shooting the ball and theyre backing up you got to go straight up straight down and also follow follow up with your rebound hey never KN when youre going to get one to the rack bucket no good you know nor chab with the basketball he didnt have that in his toolbox last season he hes not bringing up the ball up the court with a purpose right we didnt see that last year thats one thing thats makes this Miami team super different and super Dynamic is that your big man can get the defensive rebound and push the ball up the court and also not only just push the ball make the right decision that last play he made the right decision on that finish he is very composed when he puts the ball on the deck at least uh through what 30 minutes of the opening game now Robinson top he looks down low for the graph and it was nearly taken away by Christian Robinson and hes going to get called for a foul heres a couple of looks at that omir pass its pretty great pass you know not only is he pushing the ball hes also making the right read Miami up big 7744 back here with the watsco center only three teams in the conference and the AP Top 25 to start the season Duke ranked second Miami ranked 13th North Carolina checks in at 19th after very disappointing season in Chapel Hill last season you know Miami they were picked to finish second in the ACC this season Jack thats the highest projection in program history so expectations still lofty even with the absence of Jordan Miller and Isaiah Wong expectations very very high I think theyll live up to these expectations they have a great coach and Coach L and theyre playing very unsub as what you want to see what a move by nor Chad oir he gets fouled and he almost just finished that bucket you know the one trademark of a coach out team as well when theyve been good over the years they only get better like this aint the best youre going to see him this year wait till you see him in December wait till you see him in January and it all builds up to March yeah thats something that Coach O you know takes pride in he he cares about March hes not running guys onto the floor early in the season hes treating his team like an NBA program so when this March comes this teams ready to play theyre firing all cylinders where Chad omir makes the free throw pretty good from the charity stripe was omir quote unquote big guy last season for the hurricanes of course he missed that one to soon a little Jinx huh I guess I dont think he kept his fingers in the cookie jar huh he did we talked about that in the exhibition I didnt Jinx him he did not he did not thats one thing that I like to I want to see with nor Chad is to be very very laser focused on his release and his finishing of his jump shot in his free throws Miami up big here if youre the Highlanders Jack what do you work on here in the final 10 minutes obviously you dont play the scoreboard at this point you want to work on execution you know at the beginning of this game NJIT was really executing right now youre seeing a lot of oneonone basketball and its not leading to the result that you want so you want to focus on executing bad shots better offense you talked about this earlier that ball didnt touch the floor right there nor number one okay ball so hard got to find me they playing Miami is balling so hard somebody better find them they look good tonight nor Chad oir and Matthew Cleveland with double doubles nor Chad with 20 and 10 Cleveland with 16 and 10 wga popper with a career high 21 points here tonight and something tells me he might set a couple of new career highs throughout the course of this season the way hes playing for sure young fell in the game Michael noo in the game ball is on the deck and the Highlanders come up with it thats what you dont want to do you want to get the ball on the inbound play off a timeout turn the ball over great shot three by I like when I see Francis freshman playing with a lot of confidence thats not an easy shot no nice step back great rotation shot he had 11 in their exhibition against Sean Hall up top noo oh Nigel pack gave him a really good pass no woko is going to the line thats something hell learn I dont think he was expecting it but it was a beautiful pass by Nigel he could have just dumped oh yeah if you notice Nigel and ncha they have that connection already Blended together you know Mike and and Nigel connection is were still put everything in the blender we havent pushed start yet but once that strawberry and that banana start getting blended up its going to be real smooth he laid That Thing Up perfectly for him he was surprised he said where the heck did that thing come from and Michael Nook will go to the line for the Miami Hurricanes and thats what I talked about Michael I want him to dunk the ball around the basket when he gets that close to the back he needs to be thinking dunk on that alley if hes thinking dunk hes going up and get that basketball a lot of times he likes to catch the ball come back down and lay it up you need to catch the ball and slam it bro youre youre very very very big right nobodys blocking your shot AJ Casey and jakai Robinson back in now for the Miami Hurricanes jakai Robinson an interesting guy he he appeared in seven games last season he was a fourstar top 100 Prospect coming out of high school its been very difficult for him to get a lot of playing time yeah you know sometimes you never know man one thing I will say and I will commend on him is that he sticked around right he did not leave hes been loyal and I hope to see a lot more of him this season never complains always ready to play play always ready to help his team win games look at the Young Bucks on the floor now huh George noo Casey Watson and Robinson deep three on the way no good you must have heard me my boy great put back by no thats what you want to see with a guy with that length and that strength go up get the ball Rock the basket kanes in the home white Topson bottoms tonight outlined in green and orange and noo opts for the uh fullfledged royal blue royal shoes tonight there he is again oh I thought he got fouled hes got whacked on the wrist no call heres another look at that putb oh if you notice when that putback he had his elbows and arms a little bit bent I want him to really fully extend those arms to flush that down hes making himself play a lot shorter than he really is thats a big dude hes really big 508 left to play Miami with 90 points Miami would definitely break 100 today tan George looking to say something about that that three is no good that was way too short just want to watch Kean George in the exhibition last week thought he really impressed AJ Caseys got the basketball and theres a foul hell go to the free throw line he just got whacked a couple of times first time was by Levi lall its great Pro hop by AJ Casey very strong move once again I want to see guys do more of getting the ball out of the way of the defense you want a pro hop extend the ball out to the left finish with the left hand foul was on Adam Hess and now checking in for Miami is Paul Jo Bay The Freshman out of of France I like Paul great length great defender can knock down open shots lets see what he giv us when he comes in this game right now bunch of underclassman in there now for the canes four and a half minutes left to play Adam Hess has been very quiet in the second half I dont even I think he may have took one or two shots I think thats something that coach said we need to shut his order off CU theyre going to be a lot more Dynamic guards in ACC that will have great starts but you have to be able to stop those guys the game goes on great job by University Miami on defense on Adam H Adam hes The Graduate out of California with 14 points tonight n great execution right there nice little back door cut by the guard on the opposite side that was Justin Anderson number two he played in 26 games for the Highlanders last season great touch around the basket I like that very good touch thats what you want to see got to be able to finish all those inside the paint loving the defensive intensity by jakai well we saw that in the exhibition when we we commented on it fairly quickly for sure for sure knocking no with a three no good and here comes Robinson in transition very quick with the basketball quick feet free move great move feed your big fella its a great move you notice how he caught the ball not a lot of time thinking about his move foul on the floor one final break from the watsco center Miami up B another great move right there ping the ball going right away Liberty Mutual customized my car insurance and I say it and coming out of the break Michael noo will go to the free throw line for the Miami Hurricanes you know what I like to call these last minutes of a basketball game whats that Carpe deal these guys on the court need to seize the moment they need to seize the moment the game is not over you need to show your coach and the staff what youre built of continue to play hard continue to execute and noo makes a pair hes got a nice little touch there the big guy does from the free throw line huh great touch great back on the basketball and now nocos got himself a defensive rebound M just got hitting the right eye a little bit there got hitting that braid I dont know if the hit hurt more than how tight those braids are but either or hes still moving boy Robinson quick on his feet hes going to go to the free throw line thats a pretty move its a great move you notice how you move the ball away from the defense when he got to the basket Im not sure if well get a replay on that double crossover but hes really extending the ball out the way you see that he had him on ice skates ice skates and move the ball out the way thats something that I want to see a lot of these younger guys do is dont just get in the game and get in the lane and have the ball right in front of you extend the ball its going to get you closer to the basket and allows the ref to see a foul so Robinson will go to the free throw line and he misses the first looking for his first point of the Season here and hes got it jakai is on the board ladies and gentlemen great help good trap up top there yeah underneath o thats great finish good look good finish great pass a lot of greats on that play sure was you know in that last pass by George you never want to throw a onehanded pass you cant bring it back want to keep two hands on the basketball when youre passing the ball to a teammate 9755 little hesitation to three is good great Pace by the point guard great dish thats a tough shot to be able to pump fake and then shoot the ball off the pump its a great shot Joe Bay down down low for noo right hand hook shot no good you definitely want to see noo get those reps in thats really good to see right now cuz your mind really going to need him as the season continue going to get a handful of changes Kevin up here for NJIT you know as Francis is really getting more confident as the game goes on making a lot more plays trying to get in the paint and make plays for his teammates and I I think he also knew that he might have been coming out so you had to get that last play in you know how that goes look over to that bench you see four or five guys coming time to go time to go hes pack them up baby pack them up upcoming for the Miami Hurricanes Jack you and I will be right back here just a couple of days on Friday 7 o starts Miami and UCF Miami will uh drop that final four Banner here inside the watsco center thats a nice matchup ACC Big 12 second game of the season great match up great match Im looking forward to that see what those UCF Knights from Orlando look like theres a block by Robinson Joe Bays got it hands it off to Watson great drop off pass to the G transition I like the intensity of Miami playing that they havent really put you know they havent really took their foot off the guys theyre really getting the ball in transition getting the ball up being unselfish Watsons got five points tonight looking for a sixth and seventh and uh trying to put Miami a point shy of that 100 Point marker tonight and he misses the front end of the two freebies and he walks all the way underneath the Baseline not happy with himself after that free throw attempt he really wanted that you can tell yes he did I mean you the free throws are free you know what I mean you want to nobody there t those points up oh he missed them both and nooks got an offensive rebound and through about three different guys he came up empty thats uh thats strong though strong rebound got to finish that down there open three no good no I mean hes piling up rebounds extended his arms on that one though made himself big Watson hes got a wat see this is the time where a guy like Christian Watson who didnt get much time in the first half comes out and shows what he can do in this basketball G hes a very very skilled player one minute left to play in the opener today oh hello kesan George just got put on the deck Miami bench just put towels over their heads and turned away Kanan aint going to want to see that again is he yeah you know how that goes at least it wasnt a crossover you know Paul Joe B to the rck and why hes got 101 points here tonight with the left finish by Joe B beautiful finish right there out of France a fourstar prospect and the number 14 player
