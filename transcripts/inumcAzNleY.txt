am Hildreth really came out firing first half put up some big numbers finished for the night 19 points he was an efficient seven to ten from the floor Music and we are underway thanks for spending this part of your Saturday with us as Wake Forest controls the tip in the home white jerseys Hampton in the royal blue the Pirates out of the Colonial Athletic Association I buy Hildreth this is the putback attempt and car goes down two high percentage shots Off the Mark for the Deeks Music Wake Forest out in mantoman before them containing ball penetration in this game do not want to give Hamptons the paint touches off the bounce or catch Applause theres a steal Well Done by Hildreth your man under the spotlight he lays it in Hamptons offense in short supply they only shoot 38 percent from the field and thats why again uh keeping guys out of the paint as you take a look at the Hampton starting five its going to be imperative for Wake Forest in this game uh to force uh Hampton to shoot contested jumpers and not turn the ball over thats something Steve Forbes has emphasized uh does not want these guys to give any live ball turnovers uh in advance of Fort Hampton Steve Forbes coach of the year last year in the ACC what a run they had theres your starting five with the three guards Appleby has been terrific the transfer from Florida to hook shot by Monsanto the junior six six 15 minutes a game seven and a half points so much balance Huck you saw that against South Carolina state you mentioned it and if that continues theyre going to be a tough team to play yeah yeah tonight though as Hamptons able to get a three to go theyre out without Damian Williamson hes out uh this afternoon so certainly theyre going to miss the production uh his offensive production Godwin within three seconds ago Carr the Delaware transferred with a jump book and you know Andrew Carr is one of those guys that unherald him but he had 13 points in 20 minutes in an NCAA Tournament game last year against Villanova and that gives them another option in the post I think what it does in Steve Forbes mentioned this hes a true inside outside threat you saw right there the last possession that hes able to post a smaller player and hes also a very good threepoint shooter as well too so again he can be a guy that can pose some matchup problems for opposing teams illegal screen against the Pirates so another turnover and yeah the matchup problems I think any opposing coach playing Wake Forest this year youre gonna have to spend a lot of time when you talk about defending them already three turnovers in the first two and a half minutes for the Pirates and theres Hildreth again he is Crafty isnt he yeah he continues to play well hes got some really good footwork once he gets into the paint three launched no good by Bethea eldrith wide open three there and thats good for Zach Keller freshman from Colorado Colorado 5A Player of the Year in a terrific start and a timeout so Wake Forest has built an early eightpoint lead Music season the winningest coach at Hampton 207 wins and been a welltraveled program theyre hoping to find a home in the Colonial Athletic Association after four years in the Big South many years before that in the meac but a good time out Huck but another turnover and problematic here comes a three no good the crashing rebound attempt by Keller so Wake Forest aggressive in the early going well right now if youre Hampton one of the things its been too easy for Wake Forest thats something coach Joyner and staff do not want again another or really call that an uncontested layup right there they got to do a better job trying to force a Wake Forest into some more difficult shots right now awakes getting some high percentage opportunities at The Rim or some open looks from three yeah the nine to nothing run says it all three no good that was fired by Dean their best score at 15 a game Nesbitt with the rebound but he threw the ball away here comes Ty Appleby for the dunk Music well hes Electric in the open floor so much speed hes gonna be a man to watch all year in the ACC right now I think Steve Forbes and them uh are thrilled uh they found another really good of guard last year alondus Williams uh four week CC player of the year and we asked Steve Forbes a little bit you know hes like listen lets pump the brakes Im not sure hes going to turn into the ACC player of the year but if he keeps playing like this uh hes doing a little bit of everything shooting well from the threepoint line averaging close to 19 points per game I think though John the big thing for him uh he is a high assist guy similar to Alanis Williams whos one of the top guys in the ACC and college basketball an assist uh he does that as well too he can set his teammates up for some easy opportunities the turnovers continue for the Pirates can they capitalize again with Carr yes sir threepointer for Andrew Carr 18 point lead for the leagues 13 points off six turnovers and thats it right there for Hampton uh they have to do a better job taking care of the ball just cannot give Wake Forest those easy looks foreign Music oh yeah set it in Ty 213 went far and I saw an NBA our former geeks on NBA rosters headline by Paul but Jake laravian alondus Williams both guys we saw play last year Malcolm and Moravia was a first round pick eventually traded to Memphis Williams signs a twoway deal with an accent they were superb man credit Steve Forbes and staff a great eye in identifying guys that are a fit for their system and I think thats the key word fit for their system Jake laravia though and alondus Williams those two guys were matchup nightmares and now both playing for a pretty big paycheck at the next level and you know look theyre excited about Thai Appleby as well too early on uh he has been impressive with his assist and his ability to score hes a guy thats going to create some problems for opposing ACC teams as they get into conference play pull up by Hamptons douche Dean and thats off the mark and out of bounds off the Pirates 17 to nothing run over the last four minutes for Wake Forest big part of its been their defensive success Dan you look at the points off of turnovers uh 13 points off of turnovers thats pretty much your ball game right there and the Run uh Hampton right now needs to settle into this one and cut down on the turnovers three is good what else is new Monsanto hitting from distance one guy if youre Hampton uh one of the better Shooters in the ACC Monsanto last year came back no earlier than expected the staff really were amazed at how quickly he came back from in the Achilles tear and hes a guy slimmed down during the offseason and theyre expecting big things from the Mario man set Monsanto Music could take by Kyries Mullen as he drew the foul the foul was on Bradford the Kansas State transfer but theres Monsanto imagine what he can do not only distance 42 percent I saw the defensive end of the floor Music todays rivalry weekend college football match its right here on acc Network in the ESPN app seven and four Wake Forest takes on a 74 Duke of the Tobacco Road Series that dates back 1924 thats between Philly Eastern and at eight the Series dates back to 1950 seventh fourth fifth theyve won three straight scoring off against the Miami team looking to get bull eligible him he didnt even gain 100 yards last week against Clemson three well off the mark this fire by Clinton Bobby Clinton and freshman is Hampton have to do to get going on the offensive end well that right there again not a great look at the contested three but they did not turn over I think its simple as this you got to run your offense and then defensively I said it earlier in the game its just too easy right now for Wake Forest another uncontested dunk credit Wake Forest theyre running their offense and then theyre getting uh some high percentage shots that was Bradford with the power slammed inauspicious beginning for the Pirates need to get deemed going too but that will help their cause three by banister Daniel Bannister they say he can guard all five spots and is a gluelike performer Music missed by Hildreth Here Comes Hampton and an offensive foul right here its on God wouldnt Wake Forest has been dominant first 10 minutes says it all Bradford the power slang Applause I am poop Music Pirates of Hampton theyve had a nice tournament history three appearances in the tournament under coach Joyner and how about that in 2001 you remember that how they beat Iowa 4th 15 season defeat the number two seed also tournament win against Manhattan seven years ago so theres a history there theyre trying to rebuild again theyre a 919 last year 5 and 11 in the Big South when they finished 10th coach Joyner so respected within the coaching community and his resume says it hes done some really good things at Hampton theyve had some success in the postseason and you said hes looking to get back there with this unit early on in this game certainly I know going into the half hes going to talk to them about tightening up the turnovers thats really been the story for them and then defensively they got to make some adjustments but using this as a teaching tool as they get closer to conference way and Jordan Nesbitt just hit a threepointer and he was the 69th ranked recruit in the class of 2021 when he originally signed with Memphis went to St Louis after that theres a turnover by Wake Forest Nesbitt launches again that was regrettable but Music nesbeth has a wellbalanced game yeah hes a guy as you said highly recruited coming out of high school and last time out he had a huge game 25 points 14 rebounds so certainly uh they think hes a guy that as he gets into conference play uh hes going to put up some numbers do steam of the threepointer and then hes six to nothing spurt for Hampton Steve Forbes reigning ACC coach of the year he averaged 27 wins per season coaching the Juco ranks in an East Tennessee State Forest hasnt been to the NCAA since 2017 will this be the year hug well certainly again hes already got it going in the right direction and I think the big question mark for them is going to be whos going to be that consistent third and fourth score Williamson looks like Appleby those two guys have been solid I think this guy right here with the ball if he can continue to play at the level hes been playing the last few games and certainly it makes them even more of a dangerous offensive team theyre playing without Davion Williamson for the second straight night hes an allecc candidate fouls on Clintons first bit of a rut for Wake Forest in the last two minutes with Mildreds going to the bench see if Hampton can capitalize Music drive by Deuce Dean kept alive for a moment but about as far as basketball thats a break for for Wake Forest theres four guys there Hampton was almost able to come out with another offensive rebound Music as far as trying to snap a nine to nothing run for Hampton but a travel thats good ball movement in that time Hampton able to come up with a turnover and you can see this last two to three minute stretch Hampton has been better defensively and theyve been able to get some shots to go in for him and certainly Steve Forbes used that time out does not want to let them back into this game and cut it to single digits Lucas Taylor the guilty party on the Travel just checked in good bass on the post but nesbeth gets double teamed difficult task and out of bounds Pirates basketball you like the idea of going to Nesbitt in the post I do and right now that seems to be working for them he keeps getting uh some pretty good looks hes got two feet in the paint with the ball Music Captain 72 points per game opponents putting up 80 a game I saw Lucas Taylor his first for the digs part of that 13team Colonial Athletic Association seen a lot of maneuverings the last couple years with all the conference affiliation shifting deep free good idea by Dean they tracked down the loose ball rebound Applause foul so Hamptons regaining some offensive composure and John its the second chance opportunities uh coach Joyner has to be pleased with how his team has battled back into this game it looked like wake was going to run away with this thing early in the first half theyve just been battling chipping away at this deficit Thomas hits the first free throw today at 2 30 Eastern the ACC huddle crew gets you set for the final regular season weekend of the football season well also have halftime shows and free and post game shows throughout the day at 6 30 you get a complete wrapup of the afternoon games also get to accept the prime time matchup between Pitts Miami on accn at eight all right here on HCC Network and the ESPN app also hear from the Huddle crew at halftime of our game that ones on the mark cam Hildreth first bucket in 338 for the Deeks Music he hits that consistently Huck tough cover yeah again he is I think that third guy uh The X Factor guy Nesbitt pretty fast and converts Ive been impressed with their ball movement right here uh theyre changing up their defense I like this move by Hampton trying to slow uh this weight team down that was too easy for Zach Keller uncovered in the post and Wake Forest great passing team you give him that all day look out yeah they just picked apart that threequarter court pressure rotations were a little late before Hampton and youre right thats his beautiful passing uh through the Press by Wake Forest overwhelming points in the bay and Edge Plus 14 and a steal by Mullen Nesbitt back to Mullen he gets pushed to the post and out of bounds its Wake Forest basketball Wake Forest has been dominant theyre shooting 56 and a half percent come on right back Tim Tebow inaverbo for the ACC Big Ten challenge last year Big Ten the upper hand ACC has won five of the last 13 you dont want to go anywhere Monday through Wednesday coming up in a few short days and I know hockey youre going to be busy as well and certainly some Spotlight games you watch youre going to be entertained thats for sure yeah bragging rights are on the line every year we have this debate certainly though the ECC had a really good NCAA tournament run but I think this sets the stage right here Music certainly you want to try to win these challenges and prove that you do have the better conference top to bottom forest and Wisconsin Tuesday night at nine at the Joel in winstonseld hey Hildreth who spotlighted in the open on his way to a triple double perhaps hes at seven five and five doing a little bit of everything really impressed with his footwork but defensively hes been solid defensively as well too right here getting a rebound again uh he is doing a lot and without Damian Williamson uh certainly theyre going to need his allaround production in this game well that range from Monsanto fella left him open on the perimeter Hampton looked like they had figured things out for a couple minutes but after a nine to nothing run Wake Forest regaining some composure and here comes and he land but a flop woman flop warning balling with the land he had the new rules now though theres no warning and that was a flop thats a good call uh Teddy Valentine book the guy whos been doing games since I was playing back in the mid 90s hes right on it hes a veteran official and look whether you like the rule or not I like it theres no place in the game for uh flopping mildren knows that hes been playing a really good game as you take a look at the ruling now there is no warning its a Class B technical one free throw and theres no warning giving anymore and I like that John you know again theres no need theres really no need for him to flop in that situation uh youre in pretty good position youre trying to draw a foul clear flopping Valentine again veteran official right there on top of that do you have any um runins with Teddy Valentine none we just knew and again hes consistent you know whether you like him or not hes a veteran hes one of the best because hes consistent and you know thats why you really can ask for as a coach you know how hes going to officiate games and then you adjust but you know I I joke with him every time I see him though he looks I want to know what hes doing for the Fountain of Youth the same he really does such a great personality always fun to talk to him before games Music hes definitely over 60 man and uh hes out there still running around and he looks like hes in the gym every day Music Mildred car wide open good weak side rebound John you cant ask for a better look if youre awake thats a wide open look off of beautiful dribble drive by Hills and Music like that look by Monsanto why not Music he is capable of heating up quick the coach Forbes and then rave about his uh scoring ability and again a guy that has slimmed down during the offseason coming off that Achilles tear last year where he came back much earlier than the coaching staff and training staff thought he would use another guy that just spaces before for this uh Wake Forest offense he said three of their seven threepointers Luke tarian in the ball game for the Pirates Taryn 17 minutes per outing five and a half points Applause erratic drive both players bear the brunt hildred down along with banister problematic I think they might have been things again Hilder trying to come over gamble yeah they might have been on the landing people on the landing Music thats one you feel a couple days after the Forbes though just calls him a competitive dude speaking with him he Raves about cam Hildreth and he said he is just one of those guys that just goes about his business tough competitive and hes going to come out of the game right now Music Applause yeah exiting seven points Music we talked last night the broadcast we had with Virginia Tech about the development under Mike Young and the players that he guides every year they get better under Mike young I think its very similar with Steve Forbes both of them many years in the Southern Conference and Forbes Teddy Valentine with a discussion 10second violation you dont see those often but it might they might take a look at it rarely in particular Hamptons not depressing so its not like a situation where theyve been pressing the whole first half Music it up now I think the the question is did wake half possession again that ball was on so I I again when do they take possession of the ball and I think thats part of the discussion stay with the call not overturned 10 second violation against the Deeks and I think thats what Steve Forbes is asking for right now again right here so they dont really again in in my estimation they dont gain possession into Monsanto I believe takes the ball now again there might be a different ruling on that but it looked like a Hampton player knocked it out of the Wake Forest players hands weight got possession originally on the rebound knocked out of his hand but possession had already changed thats the interpretation and a misfire another turnover for Hampton for pass by Nesbit and John thats really uh the story and discussion for Coach Joyner as they go into the half look 13 points off of turnovers and missed opportunities its just too hard to overcome on the road car too strong but he follows Music Applebee with a three you got it Ty Appleby 10 points second wake player in double figures with Monsanto and Applebees Edition from Florida has been superb I think thats uh Steve Forbes talked about with Applebee that pops out is his leadership and he said early on in their trip uh their tour of their European tour I said no not his game he said just how the guys gravitated to him and you can see early on that he was a leader in the guys like playing with him and it shown up in his stats yes hes averaging close to 19 points per game but hes also leading the way an assist up her game as well too foreign Music Forbes is the guru of the transfer portal Music and the car Edition is helping solidify that sad joke like hes gonna run the break Music excellent Ball moving around the perimeter and the three by Monsanto Music Applause saw damari Monsanto last year certainly coming back from that Achilles tier conditioning was an issue this off season you can tell he looked different he really worked on his body leaned out or got stronger and Steve Forbes said it helps him in this area right here his ability to shoot the ball largest lead of the game for Wake Forest theyve made nine of 17 from distance four of them by Monsanto Runner and a fouled what a burst by Wake Forest they have been deadly from all over the floor it is Tim Tebow off of excellent ball movement right here Hildreth and the lane again unselfish play extra pass this guy you give him any air space he is going to make you pay and this right here pull up hand down hell make you pay three ball so he is shooting at a high percentage for the season 42 last year he was close to 40 39 from the threepoint line uh Steve Forbes really has a bunch of guys on the perimeter uh that can make it easier for a guy like Appleby to work off the dribble twopoint shot of his season high he has five field goals Hampton as a team has seven hildred thought about it now the take and the runner good decision by Cameron Hildreth Applause Nesbitt quick trigger one thing that Hampton needs to do how it seems at halftime is settle things down theyre a bit too fast on the offensive end arent they yeah and its they got rigged back within Striking Distance I think they cut it to about 11 or 12 but then they got away from what they were doing offensively they started taking some quick threes again again when they had their most success they were working the ball around and getting the ball into the paint unfortunately this last five minute stretch theyve gotten away from that and then defensively theyve had way too many breakdowns Monsanto we just ran a package for him uh you must identify him anytime out on the court car a percentage she looked for the neeks they are feasting post Thanksgiving Music how was that pie on Thanksgiving Day still working that one off but uh apparently youre bringing up some bad uh you know things that Im gonna have to think about after the game but you know back to this right here your coach Joyner again youre trying to get yourself ready for conference play uh these are little things just break you down they snowball especially on the road Music if I was on Applebees first Jordan Nesbit one and one weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help this winter agency Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective to snap a pic or take a video tag it with a hashtag all the devotion post it to your social just might see it on accn es bit coming off the big game against North Alabama on Tuesday Music there he is in the front Court skip pass ill advised that was sloppiness on the part of Hampton and Clinton was the beneficiary Music well you can see what theyre trying to do there be a little bit more patient but its just been those careless turnovers right now 18 points off of turnovers for weight only one uh for Hampton thats the story right there again on the road 2014 is that just a frustration foul Huck yeah obviously that was a that was a frustration foul right there Wake Forest has got them spread out and then theyve been knocking down shots it gets frustrating almost uh depleting fouryear defense where youre trying to call back into the game you have a turnover and they come down space the floor and then knock a three down its gonna be the first follow shot for wig after the foul was on Trey Thomass first like far 75 percent as a team at the line Elizabeth converts well John Ive been impressed Hildreth his decision making has really been good throughout the early beginnings of this season um settles doesnt settle for jumpers uh will pass up contested jumpers to try to get the ball into the paint and then find teammates or come to a jump stop jumper hes got great footwork once he gets into the paint yeah his vision is terrific great Court feel presence foul line drive another turnover Here Comes Appleby trying to split the defense will he launch doesnt beat the clock simply dominant from Pillar To Post to the first half and 29 Point Wake Forest lead the Deeks well on their way to their sixth win of the season Applause coming up the Huddle crew back careful with the basketball the big numbers mountains has mentioned throughout the half magnified points off turnovers lets see how they start the second half first five minutes Hampton the adjustments and then obviously ball security Im sure coach Joyner was talking to his team about that they must cut down on the turnovers also be good to get their leading scorer more involved theres the drive and a foul is called aggressive drive to the hoop but they foul on the Nesbit this is good team defense right here and yeah again that angle looks like clear and again its all about positioning theres a veteran crew in pretty good position to make that call now again I like the adjustment by Hampton not settling for Jumpers in that first half 29 from the threepoint line try to get the ball into the paint but thats just good team defense by Wake Forest you saw South Carolina state give up 54 on Wednesday night one shot of that total in the first half can they go back to back over a hundred Music Andrew Carr the Delaware transfer nice move in the paint with the violation Here Comes Nesbitt Music douche good luck he usually hits that averaging 14 points per game 32 percent shooter though thats kind of the tone for Hampton in their one in four start their shooting has been 38 percent in the field and thats their best offensive possession of the game get a stop defensively and then they got out in transition but Wake Forest continues to shoot the ball well and you can hear people yelling shooter shooter every time Monsanto catches the ball too much air space and hes got NBA range as displayed on that last three tying his career high with 17 points five threes and eight attempts season High 103s made by the digs its a gamehigh 30 point advantage Music car original starting five for Steve Forbes Applebee and well done just in front of the elbow tie up will be 18 points per game leading the league in assists Huck six assists per routing and thats what I think is going to make him special and in the discussion of being an allleague guy once they get into conference play if he keeps putting up numbers like this uh yes its one thing to score and thats what was impressive about alondus Williams last year yes he was one of the top scorers in the ACC but he also was the top assist guy and I think thats a thing a sign of a really good player Music can you make your teammates better and early on that has been the case for Thai Appleby guy who scored 1600 points for Cleveland State and Florida before coming to WinstonSalem as far as riding momentum after a 25 win campaign they were 137 in the ACC finishing fifth lost in the quarterfinals of the NIT to Texas A M Music D nice fade away starting to jack it up and gain some confidence and thats a big time pullup jumper he was a guy last season 14 points a game pretty good assist guy fifth in the big like he was a guy that can hand out some assist as well too so certainly they need to get him going uh offensively Music be in the tank but contact in a foul Music and Hildreth his second Music Dean with 10 plus points and four of his last five including the season high at East Carolina from Columbia the home of South Carolina South Carolina Clemson battled today in football Gamecocks coming up an upset over Tennessee put up 60 plus looked like a basketball game best time of the year Ill tell you man its you got college hoops college football you got NFL NBA every day you got something your head spins its fantastic you and I will be back on the network tomorrow BC and URI County forum and Chestnut Hill new start three by car is good Andrew Carr I love his game hockey hes one of those versatile stretch fours and hes going to be a terrific focal point for them as the season moves along and hes a guy two seasons at Delaware has NCAA tournament experience and then last season in the game Tournament game versus a game versus Villanova he had 13 points so Steve Forbes Raves about his basketball IQ I think the biggest thing for him is his ability to play inside and out they can play him at the four uh smaller teams maybe potentially slide them over to the five but hes a guy that could shoot the ball and also post up steal and a foul the first Daniel was sloppy but Andrew Carr not sloppy at all hell take the three and thats been the story of the game Wake Forest leading by 28 Applause Music 1 team gears coach in their upcoming schedule to be at Western Kentucky Saturday and then East Carolina Tuesday with Furman on the docket conference play heats up he talked about his success that hes had in years past in the postseason and certainly trying to get his team ready uh for conference play and a little family connection my cousin Ed Huck could be coached with him on his staff at Hampton for one year and he said hes just one of them the most decent human beings very well respected within the coaching ranks and certainly again looking to get back to the postseason its the Huckabee coaching tree well the one thing with Hampton again when they have not turned it over theyve had some pretty decent offensive uh possessions the problem has been turnovers and then their inability to contain dribble drives right here again Hildreth continues but to play off of two feet thats a great jump stop jumper under control and yeah Ive been impressed John again uh going back to the beginning of this season he has not settled for jumper hes does a nice job with his head fix and then he drives the ball hard under control and plays off for two feet and he completes the threepoint play hes been hunting buckets all day hunting them against South Carolina state Wednesday night in their 105 74 Victory when he had 19 all right three is good big time hit for Marquis Godwin thats great ball movement its just been inconsistent but again back to my earlier point when theyve not turned it over and have some pretty decent ball movement theyve had some good possessions offensively and theyve just been inconsistent in their effort in that department five for 19 from distance the blowby by Ty Appleby you know you talk about feed aspect playing uh two feet more thats something that Steve Forbes wanted Thai Applebee to improve upon low shooting percentage for guards means they take a lot of shots off balance going away from the basket he got off two three more got a better chance to be under control said Forbes would you agree absolutely and you can take notes from cam Hildreth again very rarely where you see him jump off of one foot and you know a lot of people dont understand that concept and try to get young players to understand that but if you watch a lot of the greats uh Colby Jordan whatever uh Lebron now they get into the paint unless theyre on a fast break uh now Luka doncus you look at how he plays hes always under control and playing off of two feet you just have much more control and Hildreth has got that down up to Perfection when he gets into the paint foreign Music Valentine and his crew Music looking for a potential kick to the Head Music car fighting for the 50 50 ball is that inadvertent um yeah that one they might that might be a flagrant and he might get tossed again the question is is it a basketball play or is it an intentional frustration elbow and again I think this angle will give us a little better View yeah um yeah that that could be a toss and thats right in front of the referee and again youll understand the frustration uh your team obviously down uh youre not shooting the way you want to you half turnovers wakes got it rolling I think that that could be an ejection Music were just waiting to get clarification but I heard Teddy Valentine say hes gone and yes I would not be surprised in this situation but veteran crew theyre not going to let this thing get out of hand flagrant two and an injection Mullen is ejected and look its not its not even I think a question about the group thats right in front of the referee youre swinging your elbow uh and theres really no need for it and I think its more the intent and whether or not its a basketball play again youre not trying to swing and get the guy off the whistles already been blown and then you swing your elbow really unfortunate situation right there and of course again frustration uh you get it but you just cannot do that anytime you make contact above the head area and particularly with the elbow its right on camera but theyre just not going to mess around with it no correct call unfortunately Kyrie small and he has ejected the three by Appleby is good largest lead of the game 33 for Wake Forest Ty Appleby such a smooth shooter third three and three attempts how about just one miss from the floor you would take that right you had days like that a piece Ill come back in barely I remember ones like this man theyve just got it going and its been all off of excellent ball movement nobody really looking for themselves or just being selfish with the ball everybodys gotten involved in they have been lights out as you said over 50 percent close to 60 percent from the threepoint line pretty impressive number there 14 assists too Huck 27 makes Tyrion at the line todays rivalry weekend college football matchups right here on acc Network and ESPN app its 74 Wake Forest taking on a 742 the Tobacco Road Series that takes back to 1924 thats a 3 30 Eastern any this Series dates back to 1950 74 pit they score up against the Miami team looking to get Bowl eligible miss all the outstanding action here on acc Network Zach Kellers been quiet The Freshman from Colorado LED his team to a State title last year back door to Tyrion douche Music Appleby the rebound here he comes with numbers Music Applause again superb shooting by damari Monsanto man is he on fire and I think the the question now is for Steve Forbes how long do you leave uh theres starters out there and obviously 13 minutes to go in the second half but as this lead gets closer to them putting up another hundred certainly you dont want anybody playing obviously the wrong way and then you start thinking about uh Music yep right now they just got it rolling six for nine for three from Monsanto Music hes in high already surpassed his career has 24 hes tore away from tying that active work by Nesbit taken away by Hildreth Im out Wake Forest Applause this is something you become familiar to seeing Monsanto off the break from Appleby hell take it and hell make it Tim Tebow in a verbo and if he let six AllStar selections go to his head hard to give back to the streets that shaped it thats the fighting Spirit thats what makes a lion medella root for those with a fighting spirit youve been working from home but your roommate just took up percussion as a hobby no no you need to drum up a new job quick and get out of here I need indeed in indeed you do an Indeed Resume is more than a resume it makes it easy to personalize your job search and even helps the right job find you I see youre willing to relocate for work yes Dynamic 2 of Monsanto and Appleby combining for 37 points 14 and 19 for the field and the threepoint Marksmanship that is a coachs nightmare if youre Hampton but man Steve Forbes that continues even half that pace its gonna be a fun season in the ACC for the Deeks well Steve Forbes mentioned something that again I I you can see in the way they play he said look these guys are like playing together and he talked about their trip that they took prior to beginning this season he said look weve got some bonding with these guys but they really enjoyed uh playing uh with each other and you can tell and how they share the ball the high assist numbers guys willing to make the extra pass those two guys right there today had it going for me though the key is Thai Appleby again he is taking over that role like Camp replacing alondis Williams but certainly uh Steve Forbes wouldnt have found somebody that is similar in style of how they play they both could score and theyre both High assist guys media timeout Lake Forest superb in WinstonSalem Music its Tim Tebow in a verbo his upcoming schedule the ACC Big Ten challenge theyre at Wisconsin on ESPN 2 on Tuesday and Conference opponent at Clemson Friday LSU game will be in Atlanta on the U and Upstate and Rutgers so interesting collection of opponents for the Deeks were going to improve likely to six and one if this route holds true Hampton coming out feisty with a layin by Tyrion with Malcolm Huckabee Im John Mina perel producer Everett an outstanding crew thanks for joining us on acc Network but the Deeks are gonna ride the wave Hawk and they have a varied offense and a tenacious defense and a terrific coach so theres some good combinations well I think when they get back full strength remember theyre doing this without their second leading scorer Davion Williamson uh hes out hes day to day they got some you know they have some pieces I I really think uh the improved production of this guy right here cam Hildreth uh he could be an X Factor guy in this lineup to go along with Andrew Carr I think Andrew Carr is a guy thats going to create some problems some matchup problems uh in the ACC the Delaware transfer talked about his NCAA tournament experience so Steve Forbes has put together a nice roster theyre going to get tested though with this upcoming schedule theyre going to have some chances and opportunities to just find out how good this unit is go go Steel on the inbounds by Dean well youve been involved in blowouts before as a as a player mentally when youre up by 30 plus how tough is it not to drift its very and this right here is what Steve Forbes uh it will drive coaches crazy again drift the breakdowns lose your concentration you can use a lot of different words but you want to continue to play the right way this is two turnovers now like you get some guys into the game that again dont get that many minutes if you get in get your opportunity you want these guys playing the right way playing hard but not giving up believe were now speed Forbes is going to be forced to call a turnover that this keeps going uh in the wrong direction so its about playing the right way and thats what Steve Forbes is going to want to see with these guys when they have a sizable lead good for Hampton for adjusting in their on a six eight to nothing run now in the last 87 seconds another turnover with a double dribble double dribble on Nesbit and Steve Forbes talked about some of the turnover issues that theyve had and he said look guys just trying to do too much and on that last possession right there thats trying to do too much again you have a huge lead no need to try to make a pinpoint crosscourt pass just make the simple pass to the wing run your offense Music Bobby Clinton with a threepointer as he joins their threepoint Brigade 14 makes for Wake Forest a season best 26 attempts from Beyond The Ark foreign Music sparkling line 14 10 and 8 deep three well off and deflected hildras triggers will this be the ninth assist no it is not easy Miss by Clinton three by Deuce Dean Music quick trigger by Dean Clinton the drive out of control and Pirates ball and just a little loss of concentration again Steve Forbes and certainly no coach is Happy until their zeros on the clock and the game is over and theyve won but again its about his guys playing the right way he understands whats coming up that schedule we showed it they got some really tough games thats a rugged schedule like most of them are in the ACC what do you make of the accs trouble against the buy opponents a lot of people shocked that thats happening Im not because of the transfer portal and because the its been a seismic shift in terms of practice time in terms of schedules in terms of back to backs in terms of you know everything factored in its a whole different ball game now well Im gonna steal a line from Steve Forbes and uh last year when we spoke with him at the beginning of the Season uh he mentioned his reasoning for the reason why hes not shocked that you see some of these early games you have a couple of head scratchers um you have all these transfers coming in some of them guys that are quote unquote experienced guys but theyre learning new systems theyve been learning a way for four years or two years whatever program they were at you almost have to reprogram those guys and Steve Forbes had an interesting comment and I would agree he said freshmen are almost easier because they just dont know any better they havent been in any college system so you really dont have to reprogram their mind youre just creating habits and I think thats whats going on right now theres a lot of parity within the mid Majors ranks and you said it John you can get old really quick some of these schools and so much parity so I think its more parody thing but I think its also an overreaction believe me the ACC is going to be just fine and when it comes NCAA tournament time and will this be here they get eight teams that hasnt happened in what four years in the tournament its the conference that deep to give the mate could be even nine portal clearly is change the game Music its just a reality and I know theres some coaches that dont want to deal with it theres others that fully embrace it like Steve Forbes Clinton with numbers with Hildreth and theres Clinton with a flush nine assists for Hildreth hes one assist shy of a tripledouble Applause Music how many triple doubles you have in your career huh laughs youre just waiting to ask me that question and I didnt think it was a legit question I think it was more you know one of those let me let me already ask him a question that I already know the answer to and that would be zero well see I thought you had at least one in the steal and the foul were gonna have to go deep in the books were gonna have to dig out those BC record books to figure out at least one Wake Forest up by 32 that was State last night in Portland the Phil Knight Invitational 7065 Virginia and Duke both playing well and North Carolina some consider that a shocker it was the first win over a number one team by Iowa State in almost six years and TJ oldsenberger had tears in his eyes in the postgame press conference and Caleb Grill scored 31 points Malcolm Huckabee but youre not so stunned no and you know I remember uh having multiple North Carolina games uh last season and having a joke with Hubert Davis uh one of the games everybody was all up in arms they had lost the game they werent playing that well and it was fire Huber Davis he doesnt know what hes doing and then a couple of weeks later they had a couple of big wins and its hes coached a year so you know again I think its certainly concerning uh some of the things that were going on in the game take a look at a beautiful lob and I think that is the triple double for Jim Hildreth what a beauty what a way to do it on the LOB triple double for cam Hildreth londis Williams did it last year against South Carolina Upstate but before that awake it hadnt happened since 1996 when Tim Duncan Music put one on the board what a day for Hilda and what a Blow by Bobby Clinton that kid has a bright future only a freshman Music but I think youre right about North Carolina theres always a overreaction still very early seven games in plenty of times for them to correct it and theyll get back at it quickly so much talent on that team headlined by Armando big cut and Caleb love and I think the big thing John that you always have a Target on your back obviously youre the number one team in the country youre gonna get everybodys Best Shot but uh make no mistake about it they have all the pieces all those guys coming back led by Armando baycott but I think its their backcourt I think their backcourt holds the key they have one of the best backboards if not the top backcourt in college basketball Music is going to head to the bench Steve Forbes says time to take a seat after the triple double well preserved Applause from a small crowd and heres the play good way to add the punctuation pulling up if youre going to get a triple double thats the way you want to finish it off that right there the 10th assist of four cam Mildred and hes celebrating with his team and certainly the last two games for him have been outstanding shot the ball very well again one of the few guys I see now in college basketball playing off of two feet youll see a lot of guys shoot floaters are off balance um Steve Forbes talks about that thats something that hes worked with by Apple Beyond but he has been playing outstanding a fort wake forests cam Hildreth Kenna replaces him 40 in white elbow jumper by Quitman who has nine in the second half speed good Hustle by Canada pumps the ball away dunk feed the triple double what a day for Cameron Hilton hell remember this one in WinstonSalem Music I remember when I first started flying yeah at eight all right here on acc Network and the ESPN app foreign huddle show spoke with Jordan cornette when he was in Boston a month ago or so and its great to see him show on the road up three is good banister Music You Gotta Give the coyote some credit as theyre playing hard huh down by 26 points theres a 32nd timeout but not easy to as you talked about to keep your focused in a blow up no it isnt and I think right now uh what both coaches talking to their teams about is is get that Focus back finish out the game the right way again if youre Hampton or right now obviously youre going to come up short again but now youre working on things for the next game things that youve probably been working on uh leading up to this one and he wants to just get his guys ready uh for conference play on the other end for week four Steve Forbes gets a chance to get his guys some rest his starters some rest guys that dont get that many minutes and now again keep your focus play the right way dont turn the ball over finish this game out strong 10 in white Zhao ituka its an interesting player for them as he has the ball played the other night and he lays it in he is efficient hes a transfer from Marist and last year hes 15 a game 53 for the field 41 on threes he might be a con a contributing factor for them as we move along Steve Forbes said he is built like a tank a full back sized guy a strong lower body and and says look hes a guy that can provide us uh some valuable minutes said capable score and I think his ability to defend and then break down Defenders and get into the paint is going to be keys for him if he wants to get more minutes yeah the Mac Rookie of the Year about that by Kenna Nifty Traverse laying by Jenna a little used came in seconds ago for cam Hildreth after hell just triple double Applause bench erupts that makes it all worthwhile doesnt it those guys put in the same amount of work as the guys that are playing a lot of minutes and they enjoy seeing those guys get rewarded with these type minutes and games like this I took it with the three his per 40minute scoring average last year was 277 for Marist Id pop a number Steve Forbes says he can get to the paint on anybody Music comes the emptying of the bench with under two minutes to play Applause Music John were gonna have to dig for the last time week has gone back to back 100 point games Music well we have our Ace staff man Kevin Maloney on it hes gone back 20 plus years he said he couldnt find it huh just got word from Sid sports information director for Lucy Bears first time they did it back to back 100 point games would be since 197778 my goodness impressive offense for Steve Forbes and the Dinks dont miss ACC PM with Mark Packer Troy Boston and Taylor Tannenbaum well talk football well toss up the latest from around the conference does Orange Street accf and the ESPN app busy Mondays it always is on acc PM digesting the weekends events all the way back to the late 70s huh triple digits small crowd is hoping for it one of the lessons learned by the Pirates Huck in this one well they got a lot of work to do ball security I think they showed flashes uh they came back with them tried to cut it to single digits uh early in the second half uh just the breakdowns uh with their ball security I think it starts there way too many points off of turnovers 25 points off a turnover for Wake most of that um in the first half and then defensively its hard to set your defense up when youre basically running back uh trying to get back in transition because you turned the ball over Applause thats probably the big takeaway if they take care of the ball as they get closer to the lead play theyll have some opportunities to win some games I think for Wake Steve Forbes look its about getting guys back to strength but hes found another really good one in Thai Applebees to me these are hes gonna be a guy that is but talked about a lot as we get into ACC play to go along with Williamson but I think its the X Factor guys to me that were impressive cam Hildreth triple doubled uh he does a little bit of everything thats he Forbes calls him just a tough dude and Andrew Carr uh impressive those two guys I think Andrew Carr and cam Hildreth if those two guys uh can give this type of production and ACC conference Play Wake has another opportunity to make some noise in the conference fans wants him to go for a hundred could this be it no they gave it a shot but its a good summary how you just posted about Wake Forest as they beat Hampton never in doubt 27point route for the Dukes who improve to six and one and drop the Pirates to one and five takeaways for Wake Forest is they are going to be a very difficult team to play 19 assists in this game is spread all out you had four players
