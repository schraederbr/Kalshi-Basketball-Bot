in college basketball Tony Bennett reminding us before the game these two crossed paths a number of times long before they became head coaches tonight their teams battle it out to begin the new season it is underway Virginia wins the tip and the whoos will have first crack at it in Beakmans hands fittingly enough initially and there is that movement youve come to expect from Virginia on the opening possession of the Year beakman kicks done for three and itll R down Virginia strikes first and thats a fitting way to start the season if youre UVA a lot of ball movement to start that possession wasnt stagnant they ran their stuff come around the curls the help was there kick it out to your open shooter for done there is that Trio right beakman dun McNeely they saw time even if it was limited a year ago lets take a look at the Virginia lineup in full as we get our first whistle of the contest as dun picks up a foul to go alongside of that bucket and youre going to see uh as we said players that have had roles for Virginia that are going to be expanded here in the new campaign absolutely I think Ryan Dunn is the pure example of that uh hes going to have a big impact on defense but also on offense like we saw a big Wing man has an NBA siiz body and hes going to be looking to shoot that ball and be able to get to the hoop at will as well jakori Smith to the line knocks down the first point of the year for Charlton State he exploded in to their lone exhibition against Howard Payne an all Lone Star State battle really LED that team to the charges they would score over 100 points and cruise toward victory in the exhibition portion of the Season he really was the Catalyst goes to the line here and will try to even things up if he makes all three rebound Virginia and here is the UVA starting five Applause alongside dun mcne and bman who we discussed roie and of course grow the transfer from Oklahoma so many transfers well be discussing throughout the night Kai that will be key this year absolutely and in this season as we see another threepointer up and good this time is Andrew roie getting it on the fun knocking down that threepoint shot from up top speaking of transfers the St Thomas transfer involved and heres the familiar face beakman slams it home so what I love about these first three possessions by UVA three different players get a touch they get out they get to run and theyre running their sets so well the defense has been aggressive which they Pride their themselves on and its helped them get out to this 82 score well we were told by coach Bennett this week that it was a slow starting Virginia team in their two exhibitions off to a quick start here he said the second half was so much better theyre getting off to a very good start here in the one that counts the one that matters most theres a first Bucket from the field for Tarlton state State as the layup is good and youre going to see a whole lot more Gaddy along the way today no doubt well look at the full lineup for Carlton in just a moment Virginias possession has the first two minutes behind us and an 84 start for Applause UVA McNeely tries a three wow true and MC he is the definition of a shooter that is what hes out there for on the floor catch and shoot the basketball and Coach he actually wants him to demand the basketball and get those shots more shot right at 40 a year ago from Beyond The Arc off to a solid start thus far this is going to Rattle off the back of the rim shot followed nicely and that put back will go down for jakori Smith hes an impressive player he is and I like how tton state is getting after it early theyre going after those 5050 balls when a shot goes up theyre not staying stagnant feet arent still looking to get those chance opportunities and putbacks so Cory Smith averaged right at 10 per game a season ago they look for him to elevate his role in this his senior season thats going to be top of the backboard and out to Tarlton State heres another look at that McNeely three and lets take a look at how it transpired well it was the ball movement it first starts with the attack on the Baseline and then the extra pass to your shooter and weve seen a lot of great ball moving in the first couple possessions of this game by you UA just real Applause unselfish and take away by bman Applause Underneath more of just what you called for here Tai and another chance for McNeely off and he capitalizes again well the mistake that Charlton state made on that one Lou Williams he cant even go and try to help in the middle just a little bit off of a shi a shooter like Neely hes always ready to catch and shoot with his hands up and he knocks down his second triple of this ball game back in groves down to the bucket and laying home another bucket is Gaddy Gaddy with the first uh couple of his buckets of the night well where UVA is having some trouble is their defense is meant to keep the ball out of the middle and Charlton state has been able to get in there but another person able to get into the middle on that one is beakman with the score just a easy drive to the hoop its like he heard you right down the lane goes bakman and Virginias lead now doubling up Carlton state drive to the bucket and a whistle underneath and a foul call tell you all about it on the other side quick start for UVA as they lead 168 out on the think about the stability that the likes of Ki Clark provided and he wasnt alone Ty all of the points all of the minutes represented on your screen must now be replaced by Tony Bennett crew yes and so far theyre doing a great job right up 16 to8 in their season opener but they rebuilt their team through the transfer portal added four players and Harris brose Miner and Rh and um you know theyre doing a great job so far with those key departures youre were looking at four of the five starters up over 70 of the production from a year ago and after returning almost 90 of the point production the year before so these are uncharted waters to some degree but coach Bennett talking about how he has seen these players go grow up before his very eyes obviously you look at this edition of the roster and the unquestion leader is beakman as we discussed you got the other two players whove already been key factors in this one who saw time a year ago and it really is then about who is going to step up and fill those shoes absolutely and I think a positive thing that we see here right with the college basketball Landscapes they come and they go theres always going to have to be people that step up and we see coach was not shy to sub in some new guys as we see on the floor right now in bonds we also get a first look at Buchanan and youre talking freshman now he is the Premier freshman out of this group who provides Virginia some of that size that departed in what you saw earlier and hell take a shot but the rebound with a fresh clock for Virginia McNeely getting ready to attempt to knock one down heres beakman wide open his shot will Rim out and it is eventually clean the boards by Gaddy once more all good looks on that possession by UVA but what I would have liked to see was some dribble penetration uh obviously theyre knocking down a three before that possession they were four for five from deep but theyre best when they get into the paint and they can kick out and find their Shooters MC Neely good start for UVA as we said we talked about those as on Q he pulls down this board and kicks it out to bacman you mentioned the transfers Tai theyre going to be critical roie who weve already seen from St Thomas the transfer Harris from Georgetown Graves out of Oklahoma and the merot transfer as well in minor all will be a factor and heres a blocking foul as it gets physical well one thing doesnt change even if the names on the back of the Jersey do right the physical nature with which this team plays basketball for sure we see them getting after it early in every aspect of this game going up there again is Leon V fell kind of hard there but theyre theyre gritty and theyre going to get after it and when you play in a conference like the ACC you have to be that way by Nature foul going to be whistled on Smith thats his first and its going to take bomb to the line and knock down his point his first think about the the job he did in the scrimmage the the Blue White scrimmage they talk about just how important it was to to get him going really was phenomenal in that contest and they look for a player with a very high ceiling to emerge this year as well a high ceiling and also a high motor we see the way that he gets into the paint and he can jump out the gym and going to keep the guys on their toes with the way hes so active and he seems to be a young guy right but very vocal already pressure being provided up top its roie and he is right there with the Tarlton Stak shooter coming down the other end of the floor heres Virginia now Im not mad at that shot by Lou Williams as McNeely open I thought he was about to let that one fly because they they got a paint touch and they were able to get a shot up speaking of open you cant be more so than Leon Bond thei was right there yes they talk about his slashing ability how he can get to the hoop but a shot like that hell knock down as well thats just all about reading the defense knowing that I dont have to press to try to get into the paint nice little baby jump shot on that Baseline area is money six to shoot for Charlton State Virginia thinking perhaps they had forced to turn over trying to sell it but the officials not buying our officiating crew by the way in this one Tony Henderson Adam Fay and they are joined by Anthony EES the responsible for things between Virginia and Charlton State on this quick start I think Dante Harris thought the the hug to the ref was going to change the call there stays with the crew in purple and eventually gathered up by Roy talk about what a passer he is I will he moves with the basketball its time its St Thomas for a tremendous freshman season the mid major and what a complete offensive player he can be loses the handle here and tlon in transition late home as theres a basket for Benjamin and that was nice uh just simple transition didnt try to do anything flashy or fancy just enough to get themselves on the board and theyre still in Striking Distance and theyre doing a good job I think defensively to try to hold off Virginia they dont have the same size as Virginia but being disciplined is whats going to help them in in their defensive sets really elevating but contact with the body results in a whistle as Gaddy went up and thought perhaps he had secured it cleanly nearly he L the team in blocks last season so you know hes the guy whos going to go for it and he wasnt afraid to go at him meets him at The Rim but based off of this yeah we see get some on the arm just a little bit right there enough for the rest to call it its going to send Buchanan to the line will this be the first of Buchanans points in a Virginia uniform not going to come on the initial free throw but another one coming for the youngster remember tonight at nine Eastern number two Duke Coach Dartmouth willll wrap up the night with the nothing but net crew in Durham what a way to tip off the season the ACC season particularly on the ACC Network and the ESPN app and there it is BU canon in the scorebook as a Virginia Cavalier and boy to they major things from this the leader in many ways of a talented freshman group yeah we spoke to coach before the game and he spoke very highly of him just saying he hes ahead of most of the Freshman right now and um out of Idaho doing his thing so far in this game rebounding the basketball and just trying to be assertive not overdoing it well one thing hell learn how to do kick it out to Ree pakman and now for sure General expanded role here in the new season handling it well thus far to the tune of a 10point Virginia lead though that is lost out and will send us to immediate timeout Virginia leading Tarlton State the crew out of Stevenville Texas a town of around 20000 just Southwest of the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex and the Lone Star State selfdescribed Cowboy capital of the world I mean I love it and weve seen them so far theyve been getting after it like some cowboys only down by 11 in this game G but about Charlton State they play their opponents pretty close um a fact about them theyve never Trail by nine at the half against a power five school and that list of opponents include Kansas Michigan Gonzaga Baylor so theyre tough changed here today in terms of trailing by this much double digits first time that had happened with the team Billy Gillespie regularly takes on the road how about this slice to the bucket and the Finish is true laid home by Murray well you like that early on that they have a tough schedule this season theyll be starting their conference schedule earlier than normal November 29th and so you want to get out and play against the opponents like that of a UVA looks like that caught Harris up around the face and the result is an offensive foul itll be Virginias basketball foul and the back door pass right there is just right on the money beakman is doing a great job of facilitating the basketball and when we say he is preseason all ACC first team its because of his ability to do things like that the New Zealander T Murray with the bucket to finish things theyre going to take another look at this foul you saw it it caught Harris it looked like in the face the foul caught immediately but this is going to be our first review of the night well from first glance at it uh if it was a a elbow and it too high you see Harris is over there potentially got a runny nose from it or I dont think hes quite bleeding been a tough start for Harris remember he did not play in the second of the scrimmages had an aggravated shoulder after performing really well in the initial scrimmage against the reigning national champions Yukon right here at jpj didnt play in the Maryland scrimmage and it looks like the start of the Year getting a little tougher here yeah I think for him its its just all about getting his footing back when hes a quick guy he hasnt played at this pace getting up and down and then hes also playing off the ball at Georgetown he was the primary ball handler so just learning and coming into his new role it may take some time and I think again playing against a team like Charlton in your first game of the season is going to be the Catalyst for getting your feet up under you so well see if he can come along more in this game yeah he ends up with uh yeah he actually is bleeding I believe the training staff having to really do some work on him here and it appears as if our officials have finished reviewing the play and now the discuss the ultimate determination I think on that swing through it it might be upgraded just because his arms went above his shoulders to try to clear space with Harrison when you play a gritty defense offensive foul at the determination of our Applause officials so it will will be Virginia set to inbound the basketball and the review provided Harrison of time that all the work was completed and hes ready to go itll be in his hands as Virginia goes back to work yeah hes tough again they believe hes going to be completely okay after having to miss that second scrimmage and thats good news for Virginia so much experience at at Georgetown that they hope translates to here in Charlottesville and its going to be a touch foul out top thats going to be against boo boo Benjamin and though its his first it is a fourth against the Texans well with all the early threes that UVA made Charlton state is really playing up pressure defense on the catch theyre looking to crowd their space and almost seemingly trying to run UVA off the threepoint line hey you thought that that may be a weapon that that Charlton state would try to use 15 of their first 25 points in that scrimmage at home at historic wisdom gy Came From Beyond The Arc thought maybe they would need that Virginia time susceptible to that shos been on the other foot and then theyre getting contributions from everyone including B thei third who lays another home just ahead of the horn I think its been tough for Talton state to really consistently find their Rhythm cuz again look at how the defense is hounding them and then its a lot of east west you got to go north south try to get into that paint and score and thats a a good one right there where you get the ball on the inside and you tried to operate um that was fou on Buchanan looks like on the inside as Tony Henderson whistled him for his first foul Bond goes out and we also have a Charlton State substitution as Emanuel innocenti an Italian works his way into the contest one of the international players on these rosters again roster of 21 theres a number of them to keep up with for Tarlton State then you talk about the 16 newcomers the one thing that somewhat gets lost is Harris has now whistled for a foul up top couple of quick ones picked up by UVA all of the sudden one thing you do notice though a lot of seniors a lot of experienced players for Tarlton State well with that because they have a lot of players whove come from joos community college and that is uh you know in the mid major level how you kind of want to build your team youre not always going to be able to put freshman into the game but if you have somebody with some junior college experience under their belt youve played at the leg level with the physicality in which youre going to go up against you see that physicality is hanging with the play is jakori Smith now hes eventually going to be whistled for the foul and it will be Virginia basketball but Relentless in his desire to get it back at just inside the 10minute Mark in tlon state theyre switching to put on some full court pressure now where just a little light pressure though make some time run off the clock for UVA thats Thomas working on Harris pman flashing all the way to the far side it will be in his hands but they have located ree bakman number of purple jerseys collapse on him just two to shoot Virginia will not get a shot up that was great defense by Charlton State everybody was moving on the Flight of the ball and now they just have to find some offensive Rhythm I think their defense has been solid for the most part except for giving up some Second Chance opportunities on the boards but thats going to be given when UVA does have that size advantage and heres one of those possessions that UVA is going to work it into single digits on the shot clock defensively and with four to shoot still trying to clean it up down there and eventually throwing it away back court itll belong to Virginia one of the questions coming in was Virginias length you know maybe not the size youre used to seeing for Virginia and obviously when you hit the ACC will be a different animal as they get their sea legs underneath him during the nonconference but you are seeing Virginia close the paing passing Lanes very quickly here in this one yeah theyre running and trapping one of their defensive principles is when that ball goes into the painted area theyre sending two over automatically and theyre showing their hands theyre trying to refrain from fouling and I think theyve done a a magnificent job of just moving on the Flight of the ball as well and like you said showing off their length and cutting things off not letting Charlton State get super comfortable Harris lost the handle momentarily but still with it seven for UVA to shoot seems to be a comfort level with that for Virginia however Buchanan tries to get something up just ahead of the horn but it is rejected two defensive focused teams you know that has been the foundation it has been the pillar of Virginias success under Tony Bennett for the last 15 years yeah and they take pride in as beakman nearly comes up with the Ste and um and when talking to coach pregame I asked him about his defense and our guys able to you know you have so many newcomers are you getting those principles and stuff down he was like defense is defense at the end of the day its not super hard to learn but its more about being first to those passes and so thats why you see that theyre able to get into those gaps as quickly as they do because theyre not really priding themselves on trying to get every steal but its about being in the right place at the right time helps that you have the defensive Player of the Year in the ACC on your side right he continues to provide ball pressure up top his anticipation is just great pretty good scorer too Shoots for the hoop here slices through the lane but doesnt quite get it to fall off the front of the rim step back thats closed up tton State they havent been able to run and thats because on the Miss shot UVA already has two people back into the paint and so its stopping them from having a transition game going theyre having to run their sets shot clock is getting low and they havent been able to get anything off well its at four again to your point eventually going to Rattle out and it appears as if Dunn is going to get a hand on it hell work it off of a Charlton State Defender Timeout on the floor Virginia out front 2511 being an NFL fan is the greatest unless youre home and hes able to be that twoway player that you will want on your team ACC Defensive Player of the Year who can really break up plays and gets his team going by his ability to jump those passing lanes and get out and run and weve seen it here tonight already where hes been able to be that perimeter Defender but also run the squad major lift for Virginia that he decided to return he was projected to be a second rounder in the NBA draft believes by coming back certainly with his defensive ability youre looking at a first round pick moving forward he said I want to get better as an individual and as a basketball player Im coming back to Virginia because I believe we can do great things again this year Well burying itself out in the opener thus far for sure and the growth and development uh I think at the next level a team always wants a great defender but as I spoke about in the open continuing to polish his scoring abilities as well is going to be key Virginia always seems to have a great defender hes the latest in a long line of those defensive players of the year in the ACC you think about the way Dunn has played defense those two really the two on the Squad that that have that high ceiling in the NBA conversation because of their ability to play Such solid defense that goes everywhere but down for Charlton State and McNeely the rebound thats a great look though by Lou Williams he was wide open in The Corner Spot up and let it fly in Charlton State they have yet to make a threepoint shot in this game now they havent taken a ton of them but when you get the opportunity to have no one in your face those big Defenders by UVA you got to knock it down isnt it amazing as is this work down the left side of the lane for Harris for everything done so far his first bucket of the night its a memorable one I like it a little finesse to his game Up and Under and comparable to when he was at Georgetown people would say his game was something like Allan Iverson you can see it in his quickness and his speed and the way hes able to manipulate you to get to the basket and score and thats the term they continue to use in talking about him quickness and its when he decides to find that extra gear and contact from done out top well what Ive liked so far is he hasnt pressed you see he gets by these two Defenders boo boo he doesnt commit all the way and hes able to sort of force his body through that up and under and just finish around the basket seamlessly second personal foul whistled on done and he will take a seat not alone you see a breather coming for jakori Smith on the top Charleston State side of things just the fifth team foul against Virginia there it is you called for it the first three ball of the night finally drain for Charleston State and it is innocenti who gets it done well he made the contested three now you make some wide open ones and you have yourself a ball game here go back to that point 15 of their first 25 points in the most recent contest that Howard Payne exhibition Came From Beyond The Arc somewhat surprising that its taken this long 539 to go in the first half for Tarlton state to knock down the first in this game well with the game of basketball sometimes you just got to see that first one go in wouldnt be surprised if a a couple other go up now and they just start falling pakman returns for Harris that foul on Musa thats a first but it sends McNeely to the line first personal that is of course on Musa and the initial shot goes down for McNeely the ACC Fall Championships continue on Wednesday night semifinal round all matches right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app the home of ACC championships McNeely true on both free throws and MCN pushing toward 10 points he has eight to lead all scores on the Virginia side thus far well in an article that I read on uvas website written by Jeff White uh he he just spoke about mcneel and how coach has been demanding him to take shots it was times last year where he would get into the game and minutes were limited right but his impact went far when he was ready to catch and shoot and be a person that wanted the basketball and he said this season he wanted to improve on his handle but with coming with improving on your handle you got to be confident in that shooting ability that hes gifted to have and 12 off the bench in the NCAA tournament contest against Ferman of course that was that 4113 Loss Virginia has some experience with that right fman out of the Southern Conference little more purple out there maybe not what you want to see right now if youre a Virginia fan but they do have experience with that you think about it that early exit in 18 and Virginia came back in 2019 won that National Championship the pre Premier moment coming against the team from Texas Texas Tech and coming after some of that NCAA heartbreak like they experienced at the end of things but he was one of the bright spots in that final game of the year a season ago correct and coming back I know you can feel that pain all summer long thats probably the loss that lingered in their head and as a player you never want to feel that type of hurt again Virginia used it as a motivator for that unbelievable run and the 19 championship and they have the road map certainly for the type turnaround the type Redemption season that the college basketball really the best one college basketball had ever seen when you talk about what they experienced from one year to the next to to head to the top of the hill and be the longest serving champion of all time right we had the pandemic clear out the tournament the next year and Virginia just remained the champ for a while to rebuild that Championship pedigree with so many new faces and on this opening night showing the ability to score to the tune of nearly 30 on the board with inside five to go in this first and a nice crowd tonight in behind this group too it speaks to whats been built here in Charlottesville Im loving it the student section is exciting mcil another three up and good its all flowing here early on in this game or late in this first quarter first half I should say thatll get him a little more involved here at jpj loving what they are seeing from mcne the first of double figures give him 11 three of five from the field and those three coming from Beyond The Ark well I love how his teammates are seeing where hes spotting up at and every time a pass is made to him hes ready on the catch lost out and it will head to the other end of the floor well hes got 11 leading every everybody what a start to the new campaign for Isaac mcne here is the latest three for the West Virginia native being an NFL fan is the greatest unless youre getting in on the action 5 for nine from Deep you have roie knocking it down done but its been all about Isaac mcne who is three for five his teammates are finding him hes ready to catch and shoot the B basketball and its been nothing but money from Beyond the AR yeah perfect from the charity stripe and a couple of chances in the three of five start from downtown think about this Virginia off to a red hot seven for 11 start from the field in full and still after cooling off a bit shooting 55 in this first half contrast that with 31 from the floor for Charlton State thus far with just under four to play in the opening half of action Applause heres mcne takes it to the interior that pass lost to jakori Smith ton State doing a nice job knowing their personnel on that one okay we we cant let him get another one off make them put the basketball on the ground results in a turnover couple of buckets for jakori Smith couple of buckets for Gad not in the Personnel grouping right now and as we say those two are at the head of the stat sheet he separates himself jakori Smith lays one home matches his jersey number and hes the leading SC for the Texans well just late on the backside help was UVA on that possession Reese beakman got caught on the other side and perfect read by Charlton state to be able to score that one but he makes up for it with the and one and going to be going to the free throw line well we talk so much about threes Here Comes one perhaps the oldfashioned way ree pman to the charity strike however you can get it and I like this he puts the defender on his back and is able to scoot through two others is down low for the an1 that is just a tough bucket by the experienced senior bman knocks it down nothing but the twine he has seven and trails only McNeely who leads the squad pacing Virginia with 11 three minutes remaining in the opening half Carlton State team that Virginia has run well out in front of a Carlton State team used to keeping opponents close used to keeping Big Time opponents close you you referenced it a little bit earlier but this is a team hanging around against Power five competition in recent years in the first half and and not just any Virginia tried for another threepoint play here instead the foul will create a scoring chance from the line for buy but lets go into that ju Just a little bit more at number three Kansas at 20th ranked Michigan at number three Gonzaga at 12th ranked Baylor now here at Virginia thats the environment that coach Billy Gillespies taken this team into before tonight they had never trailed by double digits in the first half no deficit more than nine they LED AM Stanford BC and Arizona State at the half including Stanford and Arizona state in the last two season openers so this was a team that expected to come in here and hang around and Virginia has had its way for the most part in this first half with Charlton State impressive for UVA well its all about them coming in here and they didnt underestimate Charlton State they said were going to put our foot on the gas early and its shown in this first half and Charleston state has played a ACC opponent in Boston College and was actually able to defeat them a season ago so theyre not shy to this level of competition but right now they havent been able to find a rhythm and you have to credit UVA because they have made them so uncomfortable on the offensive end of the floor and then when UVA has the basketball theyve been able to find their teammates again going back to that threepoint shooting and knocking down those open shots and a great point and so important that they got off to the quick start that seven of 11 start from the field for Virginia really setting the tone calming everybody in the building because basketballs back and sending a message to Charlton State as well it did and Virginia they went on their scoring drought a little bit they went a little over 2 minutes and 30 seconds without scoring the basketball but when youre playing this type of hounding of Defense just look at them all over the floor the double team doesnt come on that one but minor able to force the travel theres no way that you can really set in and get comfortable especially in this environment where its packed out tonight and not of great concern because of the way they play defense when you see those droughts in Virginia showing you why as the lead is held fairly steady still up 3717 as beakman brings it up the floor closing in on two minutes remaining in the opening half season opener around the land and certainly here for UVA tonight nice Cut and Miner couldnt quite finish but guess whos there by the third lays it back in Leon by the third with one of his more recent moments in this half well he got the crowd going with that one hes just as athletic as he wants to be sticks with the play and is able to get that one to go down with ease well and showed his elevation on that last sequence as well trying to run out with it is Harris but whistles going to bring this to halt well Miner the back door that was ran to Perfection but nobody puts a body on Bon the third thats okay put back by him and I also love hes another guy who draws a comparison to a a former UVA standout Justin Anderson and you can see it with how agile he is his athleticism but also they say his personality is one of a kind as well and uh hes had a good showing in this first game yeah and look for it they talk about how hes been working on a fallway jumper thats pretty nice as well well in addition to his ability to slash to the basket you saw elevation on that last image from B the third its going to be a foul as beatman tried to work his way a little closer to the bucket thats a second personal on miles but uh double digits now on Tarlton State as a unit and beatman is back to the line trying to add to his seven point total in this first half true on the first as it rattles down well Saturday morning the ACC huddle crew going to kick off the day at 11 Eastern 60minute pregame show leading to BC hosting Virginia Tech thats at noon theyll also have halftime shows pre and postgame shows throughout the day after the game stick around complete wrap up in interviews all part of the ACC huddle this coming Applause Saturday inside the final minute of the opening half of the year and scrambling for it that thats on the sideline and will be Virginia basketball and Virginia here I dont I dont know if they they practice it too much but opportunity for a two for one some college teams do it some college is dont but it seems as though theyre just going to get into their set and try to get the best shot as possible but opportunity to really run their stuff and and try to look for a opening Harris little stop pop and He will draw contact disbelief from Gaddy who was whistled for the foul and that is going to be a second personal on Gaddy and again maximum opportunity for Virginia from this point forward they raised their hands inside John Paul Jones Arena for Dante Harris whose first rims Music out Virginia working their way to the line regularly in this first half Cavaliers 10 of 12 and of course Harris will see this one Rim out as well but thats opposite just the seven free throws that have been shot for Tarlton State more made for Virginia than shot for the opponent that always serves you well just a little too strong from Benjamin and with the shot clock off beakman going to slow but as the newly anointed in many ways Phil General all on his shoulders now you know hes always played alongside as we talked about Ki Clark youve seen his ability to bring the ball up the floor and control it his team now and on this final possession of the half he slices through and puts the exclamation point on the opening half of basketball 43 on the scoreboard for Virginia ping staff as well plus 10 advantage and bench points and 15 of points coming of that variety Carlton basketball to begin the second half having made the trip to Central Virginia out of Stevenville Texas the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex just outside of it about an hour or so Southwest of Fort Worth rural Texas cowboy country and here are the Texans working through on the opening possession that rattles around after a Miss layup going to be kicked out for a three ball it wont go and its Virginia as as reee beakman cleans it up two good looks by Charlton State on that possession able to get into the paint but more of the same from McNeely picks up right where he left off to begin the second half none other than him he has such a pure stroke getting the ball quick release its hard to close out on him because as soon as the ball touches his fingertips its up theres a little individual competition going on here right this Virginia team talks so much about what you do collectively as a unit you accomplish great things and then that creates individual opportunities thats something that Tony Bennett certainly preaches a lot along the way but beakman had the final bucket of the half to even him at 11 a piece and he comes right out here to begin the second half of action and reclaims the lead on the stat yeah Ill take that is what mcney said on that threepoint shot and you have to credit his teammates too for knowing where the hot hand is and finding him able to hit his fourth triple of this game with ease saw Tony Bennett there 15 years in now as at Virginia well Izzy miles able to knock one down right at the horn Virginia going to take you to the extent of that shot clock and using every second of it this time is Carlton on the board in the second half behind miles Iz he miles for all the talk about the senior Laden Squad Tarlton has one of the youngsters that is expected to make a major difference for Coach Gillespie freshman Alla Alabama and hes one of their top recruits that theyve been able to get since being being in the D1 era and you saw how he was able to get up on that last play for the putback hes a high flyer real energetic guard and expected to have some big numbers and Big Time with Charlton State wide open look for Williams that will not go from downtown that was Lou Williams who fired away on that three for Tarlton yeah easy to forget quickly it goes inside heres a whistle easy to forget that this is a Charlton State team that is making the transition I mean in the last 20 years theyve gone from niia to division 2 where they had great success and this man Billy Gillespie was brought in to lead the transition to the division one ranks in the whack and its not an easy thing to do seeing that you dont get the postseason experience when you are going from your transition from division 2 to division one they just got their first postseason invitation last year to the CBI and they accepted it so a lot in store for this Charlton State team and F and score for the Wahoos regardless of who the ball ends up in the hands of more ball movement for Virginia that creates a scoring opportunity for Groves and he knocks down a tray and Groves we we go back to the talk about comparisons right another guy who was compared to Sam Hower plays for the Celtics now spent some time in the G league with the main Red Claws who can absolutely fill it up and shoot that basketball and we saw that on that last possession Benjamin answers it on the other end of the floor he knocks down a three and we got a brief pause here as a previous play is going to be looked in again so were told theyre looking at something off the ball tie which could potentially be a a flagrant foul so potential flagrant being looked at off the ball by our officials well I saw Gaddy uh crouching a little tripped up and wonder if running through the lane he got chucked in in a way that wasnt legal so on the back side of the threes traded one for bro for Virginia and here I I dont think its going to be any thing there if if it has to do with bro being on e e e Music well we were giv the full explanation official says it is just a common foul but they were dealing with a little difficulty technically on the look is the reason it it took them he wanted to make sure we were wear just a little longer its not that they were looking at anything they felt was consequential they knew right away once they uh secured the look it was a common foul to the light of everyone back to work we go and in bound coming underneath the bucket and out top miles with it and enough disruption provided by roie that the ball is lost out of bounds and hell handle the inbound pass for Virginia you know last trip down the floor for UVA Jake Groves hit that three you were talking about him began his playing career at Eastern Washington before transferring to Oklahoma at both stops played with his brother this is the first time not playing with his brother but they expect hes able to come in because of that big 12 experience something those in the Texas footprint know a lot about that big 12 experience because of that they expect him to come in really hit the ground running and and boy has he ever already for Virginia well coach said they had a need for a fourman like him so they went out specifically and and were searching for someone with his ability to knock down shots and to be able to stretch the floor and we have to mention about Jake when he was at East Washington he was a walk on at first he worked his way up in the ranks to be a starter here at UVA this evening thats a great Point Ty what a journey it has been for him you think about some of the individual Journeys to this point for so many of these players when you discuss all the new faces on both sides up to the wing and putting it on the floor all kind of disruption from beakman but somehow maintaining control of the basketball is Williams and he will be rewarded with the bucket and the foul call hes going to the line to try to complete the and one those inside jpj wearing the home colors had other thoughts on this well I think its a great play by Charlton state right there able to just find his way into the middle of the paint great things happen when teams are able to get into the middle of the paint against that UVA defense and Lou Williams the second leading scorer from this Texans team a season ago is continuing to show his ability to try to find little SC team and gaps for potential scoring opportunities and Lou Williams the leading returner when it comes to scoring you mentioned second on the team a year ago among those coming back to Stevenville he had the high water mark in 2022 2023 beakman boy the length makes a difference there to hang on to it for roie and its going to be whistled against Virginia so it will be Tarlton State basketball you know we were talking about it Gillespie hired in 2020 right in the middle of things he was hired in March to lead the division one transition you know his first head coaching stop was Texas El Paso so hes very familiar with the Western Athletic Conference earned an at llarge bid in the NCAA tournament in year two you may remember in that 2004 NCAA tournament they had Maryland on the ropes nearly had them beat when he was there so its somewhat of a homecoming for him not liking what he sees right in front of him here as Virginia takes takes away that possession from tlon state with the block well hes a great coach with a heap of experience and I know hes going to have these guys in shape in no time and what Ive been most impressed about the Texans is though that theyre down they have never seemed to be out as far as their aggressiveness and that and the way that theyre playing with and and trying for each other a little mishap right there but for the most part defensively theyve been trying to really get after it gun takes a shot thats going to be back of the rim and heres that block from the youngster we talk transfers so often weve had the returners make their Mark heres the Freshman involved time on the Flor its his 64th birthday tomorrow November 7th 1959 he was born just a short drive from the campus of Tarlton of course he started in the western Athletic Conference with utel youll remember his stops at Texas AM it was that near win over Maryland that earned that Texas AM job now back in the Texas AM system of course Kentucky a stop along the way that many will remember in the early stages of his career and after a season at Texas Tech underwent that kidney transplant didnt know if he would ever coach again but credits the the new life he was given the the Regeneration the the Redemption story something he talks about believing in and a chance to come back and coach basketball right in the shadow of where he grew up and uh believing hes going to be able to lead this Charlton State team to to Heights unseen at the division one level it really has been quite a journey for Billy hes done a great job thus far and I can tell that he has a great spirit my fellow Scorpio buddy over there November 7th birthday Im November 12th um I got to chop it up with him a little bit before the game and seems like just a great guy and and a perfect fit uh when you talk about teams you have to be a fit for the players thats on your roster um you can see him over there coaching them up and smiling and thats what it all comes down to and that is how he was able to earn this job at Charlton State well Texas born and raised and again he played at at nearby gford high school he said I always dreamed about playing maybe in wisdom gym historic wisdom gym there at Tarlton State instead hes coaching there hopes to lead them to a few more big wins now in the division one ranks and it is the return to division one for Billy Gillespie his crew bringing it up the floor trailing Virginia 5227 here dipping inside 15 minutes to go what have you noticed in the early stages of this second half theyve been more aggressive trying to score in this second half Charlton State and Virginia are knotted up at eight points of piece so theyve been able to close that Gap as far as them getting comfortable in their sets and trying to score and their offense hasnt been as stagnate theyre putting the basketball on the ground and trying to get to the Music cup again dribble penetration right here by tton state comes back to that Baseline side cant get it to fall but Im not mad at that possession they kept the defense on their heels dun puts it on the floor comes right back his Direction just out of the reach of Smith as bman goes down the lane he draws contact but wont get the basket to fall bman might have got away with one right there and when I say got away with one look like he he had a few little extra steps keep keep an eye on the footwork here one two boom jump stop okay the jump stop I think sells it a little bit when he got into the lane to get to get it off but at first you know with his quickness and his speed that rip through on the initial it looked like that extra Glide was a travel but nonetheless again Im over here theyre over there well at the end of the day bman to the line and he knocks down another and bman already working his way to the 15point threshold in this one and in doing so becomes the leading scorer for Virginia Ive been really impressed with beakman and his Poise and the way hes been able to run the squad a lot is expected of him to be a Defender that is Cad and up in your face the whole entire game but then you also have to run the team on the other end of the floor too he has to be in amazing shape for the role of this twoway player identity that he has oh yeah so much emphasis on the defense and and how long it takes to kind of come into your own in the defensive system that is Virginias trademark you said it Ty he handles every bit of that business and oh by the way is the floor general for UVA making it look like hes done it all his life on a night like this hes not even hardly breaking a sweat out there its going to be another whistled on jakori Smith now thats three on Smith and the te foul on Carlton in the second half well jakori Smith he has to be smart here and know that hes needed on the floor and try to get the lob up there to buan and I think thats a great read by McNeely on the slip for the big guy but jakori Smith I I you want him out there although the deficit is Big still you need him to get the Reps and to also be smart because hes going to be a key piece for the Texans throughout this whole season well if Smith is somewhat concerned with three heres Williams now who just picked up his fourth so four fouls on Williams yeah some foul trouble for the Texans here now one thing we do know is do they have a bench certainly 16 newcomers 21 total on that roster so they have the subs but you want your experienced guys to be able to play it is depth unlike youll see elwe and a big time bounce back on the other end as Williams lays this home you said it plenty of places to go with it I think you almost got invest in name tags right at the start of the year so many coming from so many different places just the sheer numbers on the roster and it speaks to the opportunities that are being given to so many of these Charlton Texans to make their Mark well making his down the lane to just simply lay it home it is another Virginia bucket by dun and bman he had to give up the foul there because on the drive dun hes able to go by Smith and Elevate but oops there goes the shoe on his way down the Grinch that stole Christmas flies off and into the the base line but heads up play by beakman to give up that foul so his teammate could get his shoe back on now Buchanan going to be reliev now as back into the game for Virginia Leon bind the third remember B the third was closing in in that first half on on a potential try to to to make his way toward you know already eclipsing the second half of 10 on the rebound side hes got six of those hes got 10 points points already a little bit of everything as another foul has picked up to send to the line on this occasion Benjamin well again the Freshman for Tarlton State heres another of them in boo boo Benjamin youve talked about a couple of times tonight Ive liked what hes been able to show hes been aggressive and been able to really show off some athleticism to get into the rim and hes been able to impose his will on the defense best he can and I think he has a bright great future for the Texans and rattles up and down touching every bit of the rim before falling for Benjamin who has eight in the contest just like that Benjamin suddenly the leading scorer for this Charlton State Squad with his eight well its definitely been by committee to try to put them in this game and able to come up with the still there Izzy miles with the easy one in transition and UVA they they got to tighten it up here yeah powering back as miles he has six in the contest well the Texans theyre putting on that full court pressure and and if anything their pressure it doesnt seem to me that theyre looking to get turnovers the turnovers are a plus but trying to take some time off the clock so by the time that UVA gets down there its its less for them to operate in their sets and the Texans good on five of their last seven including each of the last three attempted and heres another rebound numbers are there for Tarlton State thats going to be pulled down by Benjamin again so the run that Tarlton state was looking for to try to chip away at this Virginia lead midc half Smith puts it on the looking for the an one here in just a moment to climb through an 80 run the moment of the second half tie and a 2minute 18 second score scoring drought for Virginia at the same time suddenly the Texans chipping away well theyve been able to force three turnovers in this half on Virginia and its just been about them coming out with a a mindset shift I think in that second half about we have to be who we are at all times in the first half they didnt show that uh I think right now this run is just a catalyst of how theyve been gritty and theyve been able to really be on top of it defensively and those defensive opportunities have led to offense Barnes completes the threepoint play makes it a 80 run for Coach Gillespie and Company by the way that whistle going to break the third personal foul picked up by McNeely who takes his spot on the bench now hes the only Virginia player in that situation with a third foul nice back do its kicked back out to Groves and hell make it count that might be the highlight re of to me almost the entire game because of the athleticism that Harris showed on that Baseline cut and I think maybe at Georgetown he would have tried to go for that up and under shot but knowing that he had a a shooter and grow relocate to that Wing who was ready to catch and knock it down that could be the shot that gets Virginia back on track when we talk about offense and perhaps because of the moment they needed something with Tarlton making that run and Virginia gets it but the bank open up top and that comes home for Barnes says he knocks down the latest three how about that shot from Barnes he is heating up for Tarlton well Barnes he is a scorer uh he comes from Community College scored 40 against Barton College at one point in his career so hes looking to hoist that thing up in that time it was pure heres beakman the kick throws again second answer for the transfer spe from Oklahoma think about this we saw it in that last sequence you you talked about the drive down low youre seeing the new faces for Virginia those that have transferred in to make their Mark rise to the occasion to end that run certainly and I think its been all about knowing that you have to hone in on the moment things werent looking too good for Virginia obviously they have a large lead but they have a big game on Friday against Florida and so you dont want any type of drop off more than what we already saw so coming here again Barnes leveling things up keeps it for himself and just steps into it and I think that could have even almost been a foul but here comes another three on the other end of the floor Gro is able to have his feet set pure knockdown so its its been trading baskets from the threepoint shots on both sides these last couple possessions well and could they be more different from one end of the floor to the other weve seen just about every kind you can imagine including a number of them the oldfashioned way Virginia having been good at the charity strike for the most part tonight will miss this were 14 of 20 before that Miss by bakman and battling it inside is B the third hell take this away heres a transition chance for UVA Harris will back it out smart decision by Harris there not to try to force anything but get into uvas set working with the leftand dribble gets it to beakman he sees a wide open look and another three goes down this is Road getting involved in the threepoint party I mean you couldnt be happier with the way that UVA has shot the basketball in this game uh if my stats would update it says theyre N9 for 17 from D but I think theyre actually theyre 10 for 18 theyre shooting 556 from Beyond The Arc and it starts with teammates having their eyes up ready to find the shooters well youre showing those math skills yourself youre doing that in real time you are correct they are in fact 10 of 18 if they would have made that one I think I was going to throw the headset off and just walk out the gym but this one come on now here comes another front of the rim and trying to snatch that away on the rebound and looking like he he was a little perhaps shaken up in doing so was jakori Smith he is whistled for the foul and thatll add a little insult to what could potentially be some type of injury here he still doubled over in the lane I dont know if his arm got caught up up uh in that area or it looks like hes actually grasping his growing area but uh yeah jakori Smith now beginning to to move uh toward that bench area and hes going to continue but U that foul was whistled his Direction and and again we talked about him picking up his third a moment ago so now you got Williams who picked up four jakori Smith having picked up four two of the senior leaders and starters for tlon state now both with four fouls as knocks down the front end of the 1 and one well a reminder tonight and its coming up in about 22 minutes or so number two Duke hosting Dartmouth will wrap up the night with a nothing but net crew in Durham what a way to tip off the season on the ACC Network and the ESPN app most believ Duke to be the favorite kind of going away to some degree with the pieces that they added the last two recruiting classes that John Shire has put together there of course this Virginia team and a host of others in the ACC this uh Virginia team that shared a portion of that ACC Championship as a co regular season champ a year ago well have something to say about that as we teams all across the region and heres the whistle out top will take us to our break forgia stays in command they answered the second half push from Tarlton State and have responded very nicely in this second half with use of the three ball SEC tournament titles under coach Tony Bennett of course the big title that 19 National Championship so many of them come out of the ACC every year most believe though tie going into this season at least the consensus of the prognosticators is that Duke is a clear number one this year I think so too though Duke they bring back their core and then coming in on that preseason ACC player of the year is of course Kyle Philip Philip KY excuse me for that um and for Duke theyve been at the totem pole and continue to rise to the occasion and for Miami this is also a big thing for them too this is the highest that theyve been voted in the preseason poll as well in their program history especially after coming off the run that they had a season ago so its going to be interesting in the ACC and then we see coming down North Carolina and both Virginia both got one first place vote and well kind of go from there in ACC so I think the they got it right as far as that goes and well see if things kind of shift or or shake out any differently as the season goes on yeah kind of a crowded pack Virginia Clemson Wake State pit on down the line you go but you mentioned those three Miami coming off the final four appearance in Houston last year something the Texas folks watching from out further west know a little bit about and and the results are there for Miami I mean what has been done of Late by this Miami Squad who who can question it I mean yes they lost Wong and Miller added Matthew Cleveland for from FSU really hinges on Nigel pack one of the best in the ACC what can happen there and and just a tremendous year bow the moment perhaps coming your way wow out of nowhere look at this I mean brought to their face 30 plus and still bringing able to bring in the crowd that type of excitement but that is why Leon Bond the third he opted to red shirt when he first came to UVA and it has paid off um he was given the option to do so and he felt it was going to be best for his growth and his success here at UVA and hes been the key player Off the Bench when you talk about bringing the excitement the pizzazz the wow but also just being disciplined within the offense and he had a year under his belt due to Red shirting to learn that offense to see the style of play and to also just be everywhere that hes supposed to be at the right time on the floor shot goes up nobody puts a body on on your head nearly and that gets the crowd excited in here once again I mean just amazing athleticism to go up for that putb dunk I better see that on social media later hes a reminder Ty that we can have all the conversation we want about preseason expectations and what is going to be but there is so much movement in this game now its a different landscape with the portal how many pieces you can add how quickly you can add them Tony Bennett seeing his team rise to the occasion on this night with those new faces like Bon thei whos just as pestering on the defensive end as he is on the other end of the floor this kid is good I like him I I like what hes bringing to the table you need a guy who is a X Factor and everything that hes done in this game says X Factor and I want to be a winner look at how he puts his long arms in that passing Lane to gobble that one up still sticks with the play and is able to earn himself a trip to the free throw line off of Just effort and I think that is a great word to describe the play that hes given to UVA tonight is effort defensive Catalyst for offense the reward he gets to walk to the other end of the floor for a scoring opportunity the first one rattles out on bond the third but hes going to try for a second here already as we told you in double figures in points and hes got nine rebounds to go along with that impressive takeaway you saw a moment ago so he is on the verge of securing that double double what isnt just uh a flash in the pan that blue and white scrimmage youre going to get the traveling call thats going to send it the other way but I think thats what Virginia fans have to be pleased with what theyve seen from him tonight it wasnt just kind of a big moment in the scrimmage hes doing this against somebody elses colors tonight and hes doing it in the games that matter I think and he gets a standing ovation as he checks out right here but its all about knowing your role too he hasnt tried to do too much go over the top but the things that his team needs from him which is get them those extra possessions be at the right place at the right time to be able to get those exciting putback dunks and its a testament to how hard he worked while he was a red shirt to be able to come into this offense in the game as a whole just so seamlessly and you could see what these players are able to do when they go up against ACC competition like we were talking about against a moment ago yes but it is a reminder that with the new pieces you can add with the young players that can come in and make a difference it is maybe tougher than ever before to know exactly what to expect from one year to the next in in a given League certainly in the ACC because theres so much movement for sure and I think every single game counts uh obviously once they go up against those bigger opponents they say itll be the true test but I think an even bigger test is when you go up against a team that is lesser than you on paper right because you have to continue to play at the level that youre expected to play at thats going to be a foul on Harris and he picks up a second personal going to end up sending Barnes to the Applause line well what a week on acc Network in terms of football the week 11 lineup for Saturday starts at noon BC hosting Virginia Tech in Chesnut Hill and then at Yankee Stadium pit squaring off against Syracuse capping the day with Duke what a football story theyve become this year were talking about the their basketball program multifaceted endur this year theyll be taken on North Carolina and that Tobacco Road rivalry at 8 and all three games also available on the ESPN app you can watch it anywhere FL with it for Virginias Murray just over 5 minutes remaining still a commanding lead for UVA you know we were talking ACC a little bit a moment ago and you know John sh you mentioned filipowski Whos Back tyres Proctor going to be a part of that you throw Mark Mitchell in there and the sophomore Seasons that are expected from that group Jeremy roach now the veteran they added Caleb Foster Jared McCain to a 279 146 conference record a year ago I mean a very talented group there in Durham on the basketball side right in in the Cameron side we talk about football coming up this weekend I know you keep an eye on thear Hill bot back they did lose love to Arizona but the Freshman Elliot Cubo expected to play a key role for Hubert Davidson company and then you talked about Miami and and so much they bring back its going to be an exciting year in the ACC I think the interesting thing about the ACC is the teams who are going to have to come into their own by finding their identity because there are going to be so many new faces I think Miami is really on paper the only one that has a few familiar faces and then Duke you know they have a whole bunch of newcomers as well so its going to be interesting to see how everything sort of shakes out in the end and throughout the season and great first showing for UVA and their new faces no doubt about it Murray picks up the foul thats his first going to end up sending Izzy miles to the line and hell shoot a couple couple bonus in effect on that scenario you know Tony Bennett talked about being a new landsape of college basketball he said everybody whether they want to admit it or not its experimental for them right now but he said I love about college basketball that its not cookie cutter its still about coaching decisions you still get to choose what your programs going to be about and you know what this programs been about Ty the pillars of this program have been clear under his leadership he talked about doubling down on them this year something weve seen this team do through now a half plus of basketball well it goes back to our conversation that we had with coach before the game where I said well coach you guys arent ranked in the preseason Poll for the first time since the 17 18 season and he was like well I first of all I didnt even really realize that yeah didnt even have an idea or a clue and second it just comes down to preseason stuff is just what it is its the preseason its about what you do when you get in between those lines when that ball goes up and it actually starts and so far theyve performed well and I think with all the new guys that theyve had uh tonight exceeded expectations especially from a scoring standpoint able to put up 73 points on the board I have to love what he said he said it gives you the opportunity to stay faithful and true to your value something youll no doubt see Virginia do moving forward nice little stop and pop bucket there Charlton State still fighting and you see he still got that figh in him Tony Bennett coaching as if its a one possession game to step up kind of lead the way for this squad some candidates making their presence known tonight Ty well its definitely Isaac mcne and we have Leon Bond the third first with his terrific shooting I cant get over 15 points in this game for him you also have your other guys who are picking it and grows and then heres that put back the emphasis on the game and Leon Von the third who has 12 points nine rebounds what Im most impressed with though is the five offensive rebounds because that means youre really putting it all out on the line and imposing those Second Chance opportunities for your squad well the talk was de that there was going to be plenty of it for Virginia it was just a matter of defining roles and obviously in the early part of the season with the way the schedule lines up Tai Virginia will trying to be will be trying to discover exactly what the best fit is going to be but how about this quartet for UVA tonight and what theyve done for Tony Bennetts Club its been great and and Tony Bennett has been able to get a lot of bodies on the floor 10 guys have been in the lineup and weve seen some different executions Harris has been on the ball a little bit when beakman is out of the game weve seen beakman play off the ball mainly on it but it just shows the versatility that UVA should be able to have throughout this season gave a little bit of a window into that on media day right he said we think well be able to perhaps play nine or 10 along the way this year that has certainly been what has happened in the opening stanza of this new campaign chasing it down after its tapped aside as Murray and then the foul is going to be called on what Barnes thought he perhaps had as a clean steel but everything comes to a halt on the whistle good effort by Barnes on that play and hes been hustling all up and down this court this evening trying to get his hands in there on the passing Lane I I love the fact that again down by a lot of points effort still top tier have to love you said it the the effort and energy that has been provided by this tlon squad throughout the night well talked about the schedule coming up for Virginia some some notable dates for you to Circle as you look ahead at whats coming up this year for UVA well um coming in a few days on Friday here they have Florida Wisconsin Texas AM uh first ACC game coming December 2nd so they have over a month to prepare for that but that ACC SEC challenge always highly anticipated and then going forward uh I think that big test against Florida is going to be the one right there and this game is going to have to be the one right right set them up for that going to be fun to get that underway also a short trip down to Charlotte for whats going to be a Full Slate of games on Friday that Virginia will be a part of so much to youre not waiting your way into the basketball season anymore now you just Dive Right In its off and running its on and popping and its a basketball Fans dream you know some seasons closing up and some just starting and we cant let the whole night go by without saying congratulations our Texans are still celebrating to some degree the world championship that was won by the Texas Rangers oh for sure out in the Metroplex last year on the baseball side of things and there are connections coach Billy Gillespie wanted to make sure you knew hes a big Rangers Fan growing up in that area and theres a Virginia connection how about Josh spes the former closer that locked down Virginias College World Series championship in 15 securing the final out of the World Series for Bruce Bos Texas Rangers to the Delight of Texans everywhere a uh a week ago so connections between these programs that extend far beyond the basketball for tonight well I love that cuz you just taught me something new just now with that come on with the baseball knowledge Here Comes done to the line it speaks to the athletic uh impact of uh of both of of these programs both of these regions of the country for sure and they will uh walk away well Virginia it would seem with a sizable Victory on this night trying to put the finishing touches on it here as they do what tie are your takeaways from what youve seen from Virginia in this one well we talked about the death just just a couple minutes ago I think its been on for them where theyve been able to play a lot of different bodies now theyve had some droughts in this game but what I love is their response coach will call a timeout theyll come back at it and been able to run their sets and get into it right and I also again uh I I keep raving about him but Leon Bond the third hes hes by far been one of the most impactful players that has touched the floor from his rebounding to the way that hes been able to score the basketball and again still talking on that bench a lot of personality and I think upside for that kid another trip to the line here as done will knock down another free throw Virginia from the line tonight attemps connecting on their 20th in those 34 attempts and you know you you track this stat we kind of referenced it in the first half but they have connected on 20 free throw they have allowed Carlton State just 19 of them tonight I mean its a coachs dream to get to the free throw line 35 times in the first place but I think thats an area where theyre going to have to continue to work on this week in practice especially going into their game against Florida only shot 60 from the flight from the stripe excuse me so if we had to pick out a flaw it would be that free throw shooting if they can continue to improve on that moving forward that will be huge they greet the Virginia Beach native Tristan how who comes in to the contest in the latter stages and also a nice hand on the departure of some of the key contributors tonight Dunn takes a seat over there Murray will pick up a foul just his second with just two and change remaining Virginia having posted 77 and holding Charlton State at least to this point under 50 Izzy miles can see to it that they crossed that threshold and he will miles now in double figures with 10 miles and Barnes at least for now are the two that are going to end in double figures for the Texans I me the Texans I think they take the positives away from the second half that they were able to have they were able to keep up with Virginia as far as trying to keep the scoring even goes and and limited uh as far as the score goes it doesnt really reflect or look at that but Charlton state was able to put up better numbers in the second half from a scoring standpoint well on what has been as a touch foul out top will be char miles and thats his fourth personal he becomes the fifth player on the Tarlton State side of things to pick up a fourth personal but nobody having picked up the dreaded fifth just yet Paris to the line its been somewhat of a welcome to the family night for fans here inside jpj theyre getting to know so many of the new players The Freshman the transfers there is a lot to hop in the car tonight and head back to whatever destination youre seeking to be very pleased with for Virginia fans I think Wahoo fans have a lot to look forward to as the season continues to progress and well see more breakout games and performances I I believe from up and down the stat sheet I wouldnt be surprised if its a new guy every night who is able to put up substantial numbers and if you want to start a new season kind of erase the memory and every team except for one at the beginning of a new year has to do that of what was and build upon what has been this is the type of night youre looking for if youre the whos chance for some key late moments in fact at just over a moment remaining as Harris handles it up top calling for the basketball is how and he just misses as he connects with the iron Harris thought about stepping into it as we go inside a minute heres how tried to lay it backward wont go down fans are in behind him though yeah I mean its a great look by Dante Harris right you find how on the cut just a little off off balance on that shot wasnt able to turn around all the way for the reverse layup to see it through Howen Murray come back after combining for just over a 100 minutes alongside all the transfers we we talked so much about you know you got the Freshman Buchanan weve seen Gertrude and Robinson theyre high on just the six new scholarship players but to everybody at some point you know willll be a contributor for this Virginia Squad and there it is the first to depart is Miles as he picks up his Fifth and Gaddy comes in to replace him well it was a positive rookie debut for Miles here finishing with 10 points four for eight from the field have to take that positive away from him and then just three turnovers against this pesty UVA defense so as a freshman and this is your first big game going up against a ACC opponent I would say its a job well done although he foued out he really did hold it down yeah left it all out there with those 10 points as you said he and Barnes the two and double figures for Virginia its beakman leading the way
