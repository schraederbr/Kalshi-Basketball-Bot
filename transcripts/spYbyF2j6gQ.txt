good basketball so far this year GMan yeah really Brevin Galloways the only guy theyve gotten through the portal so this group has come up together theyve come together um and uh theyve got some theyve got some good size in this starting lineup which theyre going to need against Louisville the first place Clemson Tigers tip off tonight tip sales out of bounds itll be Louisville ball Bill Covington Junior Clarence Armstrong and Jenna Renault officiating this evening here at Little John well the fans know about L Ellis but Mike James redshirt freshman for them we touched on them at the open thats really blossomed for this team you know its amazing how quickly guys come back from Achilles injuries now I mean that used to be a career Ender its true Monsanto up at Wake Forest be back after like eight months and James uh just for miraculous Kevin Durant has done all right they put 20 seconds in the shot clock that cant be right it should be 30 thats a mistake unless they change the rule before the game Ellis kicks it to the corner and Huntley Hatfield knocks down the first shot of the night who needs 30 seconds on the shot clock yeah and uh thats uh you know this is not a great shooting team in general and especially from three but uh hes got a 610 guy and Huntley Hatfield who can step out and knock it down Tigers looking to answer Galloway cant connect this is the start that Kenny Payne was looking for Ellis their leading scorer and Curry tips it back up and in five nothing Louisville you know most of Louisvilles guys are long but he has got some great size to him good job getting on the offensive glass Curry a wide body Music high points from the big men for Louisville Huntley Hatfield hitting the three Curry getting the Tipping PJ Hall going to work on the Block on the glass its Tyson and one his progression from four years ago to now is the archetypal progression that Brad Brenna would like to see from his young players yeah and that extra year hes a leader um you know again the great size up front and thats a big match up the key on here early because theyve got Kamari lands a freshman on him and that could be a big big matchup in favor of Clemson double doubles in the last four games got eight double doubles on the season seventh most in the nation and whats the guy who I mean last year I havent averaged ten and five yeah so thats a thats a massive step forward for him even you dont usually see that big a jump this late in your career Applause as a freshman he averaged one and one well and you know we talked about now in Louisville on offense that um you know the step up that James has made is really that complements Ellis he needed some help in the back court Ellis being chased by Chase Hunter and now in the wing lands with six to shoot Brandon Huntley Hatfield offensive foul really nice defense by shefflin that time and they isolated him off the dribble and thats just a great anticipation sliding over cutting off the Baseline getting your body in front Applause Music percentagewise about 39 a lot of guys shooting north of 40 Tyson to the basket hes got all five for the Tigers lets see how do you guard him I mean he needs a great threepoint shooter can put the ball on the floor especially to his right hand that time freshmans going to have his hands full this evening got to be ready to move your feet Applause Curry versus Hall Curry kicks it to James pretty good defense by the Tigers and shefflin gets the rebound everything but the finishing thing you like about James is his size at 65 being able to get in and see over people fast deflected tipped by shefflin but Ellis comes up for the turnover LS you see the quickness bursting into the front court and all the way nobody stopped the advance of the basketball but and this is the pace that Louisville would like to play at Applause the Cardinals of course have lost five in a row spirits still really good around this program which is not an easy thing to do when youre getting beaten yeah the effort has been there especially recently and they have made progress Mike James certainly leading the way in that category as Hall comes up short from the elbow Cardinals are three for five at this end of the floor I think theyve finally settled in on a lineup with this group out here they seem to be really playing well together and Withers has given himself off the bench double digits his last two games and imagine well see Jalen some point soon The Freshman lands who replaced Withers in the starting five kicks it clock at two James forced a fire caught irons but the rebound for Hunter Tyson Chase Hunter how good was he in the closing moments on Saturday a pitch well just another one of those guys whove come up in this program and uh there were some arguing about the noncall on the one end but against Hunter youve got to lock in in transition both he and Ellis great off the dribble case finished with 17 and the one point win over Pittsburgh Wilson 50 and ACC play for just the second time ever last time they did it Rick Barnes was on the sideline for his team they went through the elite eight nice job Alice chasing him down from behind yeah James the other way 9697 that Clemson was 50 in the league they beat Jeff cable the player back then they beat Jeff cable the coach on route to 50 in the present day 10 to shoot Ellis to the corner Louisville looking sharp all movement wise and lands pays It Off from Deep thats good on two fronts for a freshman you like to see him knock down his first shot to get some confidence in thatll probably help him on the defensive end of the floor a little closer to the bottom of the league and threepoint percentage but two for three to start Tigers over two from Deep after that Tyson Miss and thats the one thing you know if Im like right now for him guarding him were going to force Tyson to take some jump shots oh good defense by shefflin deflecting the entry pass but better hustle Huntley Hatfield sets up Curry and hes got a chance for a threepoint play Cardinals doubledigit underdogs coming in a little John the only winless team in the league but Louisville playing with

40 years would you keep trying though how long have you been working on that oh wow USAA its for the military community and their families early fivepoint lead for the visiting Louisville Cardinals here at Little John Coliseum and its time for tonights keys to the game brought to you by your local Ford dealer what you got GMan for Kenny Payne I mean turnovers have been the stat for this team all season long theyve really got to try to limit them tonight only one so far in the first five and a half minutes for Clemson home stand 50 for their next five are here in Little Gym John a chance to really grab hold of the conference only one of their last six games in this building but they play pretty well during that stretch despite being gone a lot obviously great wins in Blacksburg and at Pittsburgh last week but heres the thing Evan I mean this program historically has been really good here but you win championships on the road and thats whats going to separate them as this year unfolds I was on Chase Hunter his first before the break Curry unable to complete threepoint play Dylan Hunters into the game for the first time for the Tigers replacing his brother he picked up the foul Hunter Tyson trying to find PJ Hall deflected out of bounds itll stay no theyre going to call it Cardinals ball but a really nice job funneling Tyson instead of letting him get middle from that side to his right hand they made him go to the Baseline had some help and caused the turnover JJ trainer is into the game for the Cardinals Applause Seven and Seven against the Deep song Saturday Jalen Withers out there as well and a block shot will keep it with Louisville PJ Hall that time hes working his way back for some injury issues last year with the foot this year with the kneecap good recovery good help along with Chase Hunter PJ Hall had a couple of big plays down the stretchen pit hes just a great basketball game only 15 total turnovers combined between the two teams on Saturday at the Pete Second Chance opportunities are the gift for Louisville here early on and this is one area too I mean you know when theyre theyre the correlation between the low field goal percentage and opportunities for offensive rebounds but Louisville taken advantage of it here early in this game making them a presence on the offensive glass there is the ACC rookie of the week Mike James now he was on track I think to have a pretty good freshman year last year for Chris Mack and ultimately Mike the geese and the torn Achilles injury in October on the doorstep of the Season kind of delayed everything but and you look to overall a little under nine points but in conference up over 14 points a game thats a huge sign Applause Chase Hunters back in foreign for the first time tonight Music little Brooks to Dylan Hunter Tyson all the way doesnt get the bounce Louisvilles got the rebound okay early on Louisvilles been really active defensively and theyre playing with a purpose reaching foul going on Dylan Hunter Music again James gets a breather lands back in player never suited up at Little John Coliseum but you remember being teammates with Kenny in the NBA and the Sixers 3990 drafted him out of this team he was a freshman on their championship team in 86 NBA freshman on our Atlantic division champs in 8990 that was a fun year I bet Applause in and out for trainer and Kenny Payne certainly has paid his dues in the coaching ranks too it wouldnt just show up to Louisville and get the head job Dylan Hunter unable to connect incredible hustle from Middlebrooks but he was on the line lets go back in the time machine 198990 GMan is the uh big fella in the top middle not Sir Charles at the bottom middle of the ball put me behind Barclay in uh number 18 that Derek Smith Nolan Smiths dad whos an assistant here so a lot of ties for me and uh this program right now what about that particular season in your career stood out the most who won the Atlantic division that year and beat the Celtics um for that and actually clinched it up in Detroit um with a win on their home floor just its just like this its like this Clemson team very very close knit and still to this day Kalyn Withers from deep and its fifth seven are you talking about it seven excuse me coming off the benches last two and they may find something there but you know hes going to play starter minutes Music inside for schefflin Chaplin stays with it and scores just seen his growth too offensively hes gotten a lot more confidence in himself Big Time multiple dribbles inside started five of the last six games for the Tigers by the way you mentioned a big win over the Detroit Pistons for our younger viewers the Pistons were legit back then well that was the those were the years they won

most foreign energy on campus today first day of classes for the spring semester the first place Clemson Tigers back at home starting a home stand for their next five here at little town but Louisville has been the better team through the first eight minutes partly due to our hearties star to watch L Ellis only two points but a couple assists hes taking care of the ball G man what do you thought about so far yeah I mean well the good news if youre Louisville now you see his numbers over at the last seven hes going to get peoples attention and hes at the top of the Scouting Report when youre preparing for this team but in this game one of five so far the rest of the team though five of eight so theyve had other guys Step Up Now Ellis is a high volume shooter he shoots 40 percent on the year so hes gonna take a lot of shots to get his numbers but uh he will has shown that he will do other things and distribute the ball from the league and scoring 178 points per game so far this year for Louisville Josh Beadle Chase Hunter RJ Godfrey Reverend Galloway and the big man Ben Middlebrook who has the offensive rebound bowing forward in the corner Middlebrooks creates another possession if he can get out of the Trap Galloway takes it and Clemson cannot find the range theyre over four from Deep this is uh these are good minutes so their starting front line Clemson is out of the ball game right now a little bit smaller up front Applause Withers hit his first shot Off the Bench and then turns it over Galloway all the way and hes blocked by Withers but Godfrey is there staying with it for two nice job of not uh conceding the layup right there that time going down getting the put back but that last turnover by Louisvilles really a snatch out of their team 14 of their turnovers are nonsteel turnovers Applause yeah too many careless trips at this end of the floor through the first 16 games shot clock winding down Miller realizes it doesnt hit the rim and Currys put back wont be in time well thats the thing without having a true floor leader out there on the floor because thats the guy who keeps control and keeps track of the shot clock and theyve had a couple of possessions now in this game Evan where theyve had the clock on their back Applause and averaging nearly 17 turnovers per game and theyre almost on Pace for that theyve got four turnovers in 10 minutes released that one thats you know the dead ball turnovers are the ones you can live with you can set your defense up but the ones at the half court that lead the baskets are the ones that have been hurting them Music what do you think about Clemsons offense so far too youve been uh just kind of moving the ball around the perimeter and that shot has not been there Hunter knocks down to three finally its the first three that theyve had in the game but uh you know I think the Louisvilles really except for a couple of uh Tyson drives hes kept him out of the paint good ball movement sets up Percy Miller too strong and then throws away the offensive rebound theres a look good swing that extra pass you know I remarked to you in the pregame warmups that Ive not seen a team work on their passing as much as Clemson you know did before the game in their preparation and it shows up in their lack of turnovers sure does theres a togetherness about this team Applause and yes Brad Brownell or Hunter Tyson about the start to the season they they talk about the trip to France that the team went on in the preseason the camaraderie they built on and even more off the court oh Godfrey nice move up and under they let him get to the Baseline man he created something out of the you know basket out or something I didnt think it was there great length using the rim to his advantage a Louisville lead 169 or 167 I should say and its nine straight for the Tigers and the lead for Clemson courtesy of Brevin Galloway timeout Kenny Payne Music again Evan where is the turnover right out front this is just the first pass through the fast break good job Brevin Galloway all right look at this I mean hes right here hes dead in the water but they let him get underneath the basket nice job getting around James HeMan one of the interesting Dynamics even in just the past week has been guys like Godfrey and also Chauncey Wiggins getting some key minutes and stepping up so we talk about the experience hey hi Dabo good to see you hey coach its a basketball school right now all right Music what a fabulous man Ive had the chance to get to know him over the years uh just an amazing guy what hes built here and on the football side but um but how about weekends I made the mention the fact that and still the starting front line for Clemson is not in the ball game right now and why because they got the lead and theyre expanding on it right now so good good rest minutes 110 run over the last three and a half what will the Cardinals have out of the timeout oh nearly a steal for Galloway but he will be called for his first personal foul Applause this is the thing too with uh you know now you know with with James stepping up that they really need to get some backup minutes whether its from the Philly or Hershey Miller trying to take the pressure off so those guys dont have to play high 30s in the minutes campaign talked about that on Monday in the ACC teleconference Ellis been playing a crazy number of minutes Applause but its just hard to get him off the floor hes 10 of the anchored everything they do offensively Second Chance opportunity here for Louisville needs help nice job playing him off for pick and roll needs to create something and that was Nifty and you see thats where they need him on the floor at the end with the shot clock hes the guy you can put the ball in his hands and he can create a shot for himself Josh Beadle into a crowd Hunter Tyson PJ Hall remain on the bench shot clock down at five oh nice dish middle Brooks and one really nice job no

paint and Clemson does a great job cutting off their opponents angles and playing together with the defensive end yeah theyve drawn a couple of fouls too and then this whole comeback has really been fueled out in the open floor off turnovers number wasnt there in the first four minutes of the game Evan but so far six movable turnovers 11 Clemson points foreign Music Payne is going through right now now look you had a great career but I looked it up earlier today you went two and ten in the ACC your first year playing college basketball so you have experienced some Growing Pains not necessarily like what Louisville is doing now but well advertise we also that freshman year were ranked in the top 20 before our best player got hurt so if theres a reason why we went two and ten how do you deal with the adversity yeah you just you know then it was it was it was a growth period for me it was my freshman year and uh you know I I was counted on more than I normally would have been but you know from a coaching standpoint and Kenny talked about this with us today patients and uh and you know I just think his his connection Nolans connection here with the university is going to be huge going forward and he talked about it you know yeah could we just sell some things out to have a good year this year and then struggle in years two through four maybe but he didnt want to go that route and I applaud him for it shes been emphasizing culture building it the right way no good for curry when this uh this program has been through a lot in the last 10 years for sure Tyson hes just playing with so much confidence out on the floor Applause oh great defense Beetle pokes it away dishes back and Tyson gets hammered Applause lands picks up his second this has been a common theme in the last eight minutes uh turnovers really unselfish play right there here it is just a couple of ball screens right there that uh Hundley Hatfield got caught underneath on her Tyson 81 at the line as he misses the first well pause for a quick message from Coyote Tractor from my experience if you work the land youve got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo but Evan how about uh you know at the free throw line This is a little bit of a oneoff game here early but as a team 87 percent in ACC play its going to win you a lot of games theyre 11th in the nation in free throw percentage number one in the ACC Applause Music you dont beat yourself thats the first half of the battle maybe three quarters of it sometimes you see the difference between the value of the the basketball and a team that is having trouble handling it right now in Louisville and a team that really takes care of it in Clemson again the shot clock winding down Withers blocked shot clock violation Applause good recovery and that was a good help too you dont normally see a guard get that block but causes the 30second shot clock so just to mention it again the Tigers forced four turnovers in the first 10 minutes a game Louisvilles turned it over four more times in the last four minutes Tyson comes up short this time Applause Tigers now two for eight from Deep Louisvilles three for six from Beyond the yard nice pass curry good spot and the foul on PJ Hall despite the fact he believed he was straight up well if you watch them theyre doing a nice job of playing Ellis right here look at the how theyre playing him in the pick and roll game but that pass is available thats not much and uh but Curry is a guy he can absorb contact inside and still finish Curry knocks down the free throw dont forget coming up on the Toyota halftime report our driven feature with Brad Brownell the leader of the first place Tigers also first half highlights and stats and a fivegame Wednesday night in the ACC tale of two halves at Cameron Indoor earlier tonight Mike you talked about uh coach Capel could bring in his pit team back into Cameron had a great first half with uh coach Shire a little fire on those Blue Devils in the second 20 Hunter kicks it away sticks it and after trailing by as many as nine the Tigers have stretched the lead to eight and not just on the offensive end of the Four Points off turnovers but on this end of the floor really playing well but a good finish right there for Withers smooth shot and an important shot because it was Clemson on a 216 run before that make Applause a little matchup zone right now for Louisville Galloway and thats a way to shake up the zone eight for Brevin hes been hot lately coach Paynes son Zan in the game for the Cardinals Zan has made one field goal all season one and done that trip for Louisville Galloway are they looking to get grabbing another shot here Music Chase Hunter will take it rebound Ellis Music Cardinals are plus four on the glass but thats another costly turnover beat over the bucket Tigers lead into double digits and that was just outstanding mantoman defense I mean he had Ellis on an island out there just picked his pocket apologies to Cardinals fans whove heard it before but the turnovers are piling up 14 points for the Tigers off nine Louisville miscues Mike James nice taken finish Applause caught Galloway with an elbow too but its going to be a chance for a threepoint play for James Galloway picks up his second the ACC freshman of the week trying to will Louisville back into the game but goodness Cardinals got to take better care of the ball Josh Beadle another talented freshman wearing orange Music in a crash get cash no matter the size of your rank

dominating Duke last week and then over the weekend getting the victory in Blacksburg over the Hokies Miami back in Action tonight winning over Boston College its a noon tipoff with Tom wermy and the legendary Mike jaminsky okay well I hope we have a legendary matchup in the back porch between those two and that called the first game down to Coral Gables in Miami took care of business well there in the second half yeah but they were down 16 in the first time that wakeup call comes a little bit late well after Pitt lost it Duke tonight theyre only two ACC teams with fewer than two conference losses 50 Clemson Tigers and now the 51 Miami Hurricanes under Jim larenega and that was a loss at Georgia Tech too so uh hyper result that gives Louisville hope coming in here tonight no looking ahead at all you know I made mention of the fact that theyve got four of their next five here at home but uh you know you just have to walk in you know you got Duke coming up this weekend you cant get ahead of yourself in this league games already sold out here Saturday afternoon 5 pm tip Music caucus here little John on Saturday not that its this is my first conference game this year Evan with the students here and its a huge difference Hunter Tyson gives the students something to cheer about wow I mean thats you know if youre if youre gonna have to pick something you know you want them taking jump shots hes just too good getting into the lane but uh its kind of dialed in now dozen first half points for Hunter Tyson lead is 11 Mike James swatted by shefflin who stays with it and Tyson comes up with a rebound shuffling really nice help from the weak side Chase Hunter well I did every defensive stop Clemson seems to be turning into points down the other end of the four whether its a steal or a blocked shot largest lead again Tigers Advantage swells to 13 Applause and what Clemsons defense has done this to other teams in the leagues too in the league as well Ellis with a clock winding down nope and a strong rebound Hunter Tyson with five boards to go theres 12 points but I mean thats the way its going to be for him this year theres just so many white jerseys when he has the ball and it is so tough for him to get a clean look at his shot talking about Ellis yeah that pass deflected by Louisvilles Zan Payne Lance Company Hatfield are coming back in the game began five nothing Louisville and then they were up 167 but since then the pendulum has swung considerably 319 th Louisville led by nine shefflin rebound pulled down by hunting Hatfield transfer from Tennessee against the volunteers coached by former Clemson Coach Rick Barnes who led the Tigers the last time they were in first place at 50 1996 1997 they really had this program rolling and then Texas entered the picture and now coach Barnes at Tennessee its like the color orange Middlebrooks puts it in and meanwhile the Texas Longhorns might be looking for a new head coach again yeah unfortunately sad circumstance down there yes indeed final minute of this first half middle Brooks getting tangled with Huntley Hadfield really solid half of basketball at both ends of the floor you put up 40 points thats about what theyre averaging in League Play and then holding this team to 25 and started over five from three they made five of their last seven meanwhile Ellis knocks down his first three of the night hes got seven first half points Applause Louisville could get a stop here that could be a big shot to give them a little momentum headed in the halftime locker room little momentum a little more you know for them its going to be incremental tigers have won 11 straight home games 80 at home this year Applause Chase Hunter to the corner Ian shefflin will try it and the rebound tips around controlled by Louisville as the buzzer sounds and the first place Clemson Tigers led by their fifth year senior Hunter Tyson another strong 20minute segment for Brad brownells team ACC tournament Championship is out there for them though and this with this team the depth that they have uh this may be the year tigers in 69 years before this one have been regular season Champs in the league one time that was the 198990 season going 104 behind Eldon Campbell Dale Davis and others Hunter Tyson Begins the second half with a three right theyve got they made a little adjustment going with Withers to start the second half out there and same result though for number five yeah its its way early Evan but uh thats the first team all ACC guy right there wow wow shot clock was winding down and James off the Ellis creation has a chance for a threepoint play you know talked about his size that was a really nice find in uh 65 hes going to do a lot of that as he starts to feel more comfortable coming off of that injury number three on PJ who has had a quiet night no points no rebounds in the first half for Hall only played six minutes 46 seconds in the first half due to the two fouls so you say hunter Tyson First Team all ACC you know theres almost a presumption that Armando baycaught if he stays healthy as the ACC player of the year if he stays healthy the key phrase after what we saw last night in Charlottesville could Hunter Tyson rise into that conversation yeah I mean you know I dont like making predictions like that this early still alive as they say in Louisville just getting past the quarter Pole right now but um you know Tyson theres no reason to think why he wont continue to play this way and thats even with right now I mean by now the scouting reports have caught up with you theyre you know teams are ready for him but they caught the thing you know with his ankles just worry about a chronic thing like that and then how he is able to come back from it steps out of bounds I believe all the folks reported from Charlottesville yesterday it was not the same ankle that he heard at the final four last year it was the other ankle I dont know if thats good news or bad news I dont think thats you know well it you know if youre favoring if youre coming off of that one injury and put stress on the other one either way not good news Applause around and out for Huntley Hatfield Louisville team will head back home to take on the Tar Heels this weekend only Hatfield had a he would look like he was going to break out have a big game he knocked a three down early in the first half hasnt scored since then knocked down a three 10 seconds into the game and there was that shock block issue that we just played through but hes only taken one shot since shefflin finds himself open knocks down the three his third triple of the Season Im gonna say thats a part of his game that again youre not game planning for Ellis driving kick Withers caught it by the Paw and then runs over Tyson clear offensive foul Clemsons done a nice job of anticipating these drives and and its just good solid mantoman defense off the drive look at that I mean theyre just theyre baiting him into and why not youre two of nine before that on the season coming in Applause staff turnovers for Louisville theres the 10th of the night two minutes gone here in the second half Chase Hunter wide open shefflin unable to track it in the corner Ill tell you I like Im gonna say I like this Clemson bench and I know shefflins been starting but even without Hemingway theyve weathered that storm and you know guys like Beetle Godfrey Wiggins have all given Brad Brownell positive minutes and you know and coaches will do this in ingame action theyll tighten the bench up from the rotations up in the second half but the way those guys played they earned some minutes for themselves should have mentioned middle Brooks do who did pick up the foul little Brooks had a season best 10 points in the win here against NC State right before the new year you should at some point during the second half we will surprise you with a Ford fast break presented by your local Ford dealer so stick around for that and before that feature itll itll probably happen off of Clemson turnover and drive out front I dont know if all fast breaks for the Tigers will be sponsored by Ford but they might as well be foreign thats the fifth of the night for Brad Brownells bunch Brad turned 54 November Kenny Payne is about two years older than Brad Brown now also a November birthday Corner jumper would not fall for Huntley Hatfield Music saw Chapman do it on the perimeter now hes going to work on the blocks the do it all and the finishing the foul too really nice recognition I mean he caught the ball was not in a hurry to get into his move saw there was no double team look at it theres nobody around him just a couple dribbles into the paint area and get that spin back PJ hallesque I was gonna go Kevin McHale on that Mike Jones they got tense when I put the ball on the floor more than him once or twice his game has really expanded offensively I mean its a guy averaged three points last year I mean its only six now but just where he can score out on the floor has really improved eight points tonight could be his third double figure scoring game of the season Applause Mike James they got Chase Hunter will foul normally when the ball goes straight down it means youve got mostly ball right here I think youre part obviously Galloway yeah and uh thats a tough call there but I tell you what for this Louisville team and Kenny Payne going forward Mike James in the low post is a good option offensively its just so big and strong inside what he did a lot of in high school Kenny Payne compared him to a high school Draymond Green across you mentioned earlier tonight you played with Kenny Payne for the Philadelphia 76ers you were a eight nine year NBA NBA when the Sixers drafted Kenny what was your first impression of him when he came in the pros really talented could score the basketball didnt get a lot of minutes with us it was just our rotation was you know pretty well set even though it was a 19th pick in the first round yeah Music when you were playing did you follow the draft only if they drafted centers the crafted guards I really didnt care one way or the other Katies got some size but his players are three no he was a three small forward 40 career threepoint shooter in college his easiest games were in practice when he had a guard Parkway he didnt show up for practice you know a whole lot telling a story earlier today when Charles was just riding the bike he didnt want to practice reading the newspaper a newspaper that Kenny or probably had to go get for him Court violation call Clemsons sixth turnover Brad Brownell if he can get a win tonight Ill have an opportunity on Saturday against Duke to earn his 400th career Lynn is a head coach UNC Wilmington Wright State and now

Syracuse wins but Mr Oglesby protective are on that was a Clemson blue jacket that he had on and it was a Clemson orange tie as opposed to a Syracuse Orange tie I noticed that as well reaching foul

our special edition of Saturday night in smashville starts at 7 36 30 Central on Valley Sports South it is time for tonights Fresh Market discover the best hunter Tyson leading the way again for the Clemson Tigers pretty good balance though but you know again the the one that jumps out of me is shuffling with the eight points right there in Middle Brooks too off of the bench with five PJ Halls absent from the graphic we can talk about that in a second but first lets check out what Hunters done tonight yeah hes got I got off to a good start and a couple drives inside and then uh getting some work done early and then he just built his way back out behind the threepoint line three of five from there just really efficient 15 points on only eight field goals attempts and then doing it on the other end of the floor too a couple of block Shots by Clemson but theyre going to more theyre going to get underneath you and take charges what do you think about hunters potential moving to the next stage of his career hes shooting 44 from three this year hes six eight what do you think yeah no I I mean certainly the the range is going to get peoples attention his athleticism is good he runs the floor very well Applause you know hes gonna hell probably be a small forward in the in the league at the next level but I think he can definitely handle that the way teams play small and spread it out these days certainly could Envision him guarding and attacking off the dribble yeah I mean a lot of its dictated on where you can defend um but hes shown he can do that and uh you know I really what sets up everything for him is what he can now do off the drive fact that is rebounding numbers have almost doubled from last year what does that say to you you know maybe a function of the way the game is played now its its more spread out Applause you know but but certainly you know thats a rebounding usually Transitions and usually follows you sure does a couple free throws for James just a 13point game I mean this is far from over Chase Hunter unable to convert Ellis seven points so far tonight somehow got to the rim there trainer on the stick back going to the line to try and get it to be a 10point game three white jerseys there middlebrooks never able to get control of the ball that was more of a gift than anything they force a tough shot here by Ellis look at his two guys fighting for it and Mr trainer in the right place foreign Applause just like that 10point game this is Lee was as large as 17 its a seven nothing Run for the visiting Cardinals and off of the free throws Louisville now extending their defense out a little bit running some time off the clock entry pass deflected by trainer stolen by Ellis waits for some help pretty nice transmission defense by Clemson Ellis looking for some daylight somehow Lance comes up with a loose ball this time Applause Music again the clock winding down and L Ellis create for himself Hunter well and a nice job bad time by Tyson he got off from the switch cant see case Hunter missed that badly on a 15footer that often now theyre going on against lands thats his third to stay with Clemson ball 20 on the shot clock Music at least for Louisville now that was seven foul you know Clemson is Louisvilles going to be in the bonus going forward Music Applause like how good do you think this Clemson team is in the grand scheme of college basketball right now I mean very good I I dont think theres a great team in the league right now Applause that time by Hunter Tyson yeah you know I think there are some really good teams in the league but uh you know just I dont think theres a great team of standout teams the Despicable 50 record an opportunity for the Clemson Tigers to perhaps win their second ever ACC regular season title you know just taking advantage I mean one game at a time but four or five right now in their schedules perfect timing Hatfield comes up short and I got defense too with this club theyre not going to be looking ahead in most games Godfrey sticks it back up and in at six for RJ hes now 13 for 16 from the floor and while Kenny Payne was calling a timeout El Nicholas sticks a three and theyre going to Grant him the timeout and Kenny Payne actually wanted that time out before Ellis took the shot hell take the three points Cardinals trying to hang around here at Clemson at Hardees no

Cardinals are the last remaining team looking to get their first win of the Year our bottom side Im Im surprised at Notre Dame one and five I I thought theyd be better than that Im surprised Virginia Tech that one win was against Carolina earlier in the year and then pit Clemson up front pit started the year one and three so theyve really clawed back into it and uh Syracuse they got drilled early by Colgate at home and then have rebounded nicely I think as long as Jesse Edwards stays healthy theyre going to be theyre going to have a chance they got a couple guards that can score Judy talented freshman garageman when he has a big game they usually play well all right you know if Im if Im Brad Brownell Im a little uneasy right now how this game is unfolding it looked like Clemson was going to really grab this game by the throat and theyve let Louisville and credit Louisville they fought back in it Tigers entered the day number 54 in the net rankings they moved up over 20 spots last week due to the road winds at Virginia Tech and at Pittsburgh and thats thats not an easy thing to do though and its uh trying to figure out how that net has scored is true but you know theres usually not a lot of movement and once you get into January February but thats a big jump last week was also the first time in a long time since 9697 that the Clemson Tigers won two ACC Road games back to back well I got to think you know now early on Virginia Tech was a solid NCAA looking team and I you know I think Clemson has replaced them in that category Huntley Hatfield hooks at home you know state has risen to the conversation their top 30 and then after they won in Blacksburg and demolish Duke last week as he stayed off in the midweek theyre getting ready for the rematch Miami Hurricanes at PNC Saturday at noon Corner three wouldnt go stuck back up and in what a move Hunter Tyson goodness gracious well instead of getting bodies on people Louisville got caught looking at the shot and Tyson just goes right in and makes a nice play and Beetle tripped Ellis making his cut heres the look you see everybody locked in on youve got to identify where people are especially on the weak side and thats just great hustle a lot of black jerseys in there and he comes away with two points hes got 19 tonight on how quiet and how efficient has that 19 been seven of ten nine nine rebounds so hes closing in on another double double have he is fifth straight feels inevitable now Applause Music one and one here for Louisville and its fun to watch guys progress I mean this is old school college basketball seeing guys come in get a little bit more playing time their sophomore year than their freshman year and early in his career if you watch them you could see kind of the kernels of his potential well the thing too that I like and you know the portal is a way of life in in college basketball right now and but Clemson only has one guy and you know hes made a seamless entry in Brevin Galloway but I think its easier to assimilate one guy in that position when youve got a core group thats been here that one guy happens to be a South Carolina kid yeah right down the road Music Tyson tough shot he can make that itll be Louisville ball Applause and we will get another time out speaking of Reverend Galloways old team Charleston cougars won their 16th in a row tonight Music Wendys

at 6 30 on Valley Sports South ACC basketball is brought to you by your local Ford dealers by The Fresh Market voted number one best supermarket in America and by Coyote Tractor we dig dirt Music Clemson by 11 with just a shade Under 12 minutes left Louisville still looking for its first ACC win but theyve got a coaching staff that won a lot of games his college basketball players all those guys cut down the Nets at the final four as national champions obviously great teams pick an era that uh 86 team coach Ks first final four uh never nervous Purvis Ellison on that team and then Danny Manning and Danny in the Miracles with Larry Brown in Kansas in 88 and Nolan Smith Maybe the more the national title of Coach case that was the least expected the bracket opening up for them but the nice run and then losing to Butler or when beating Butler in the final but uh yeah I mean Nolan Smith is dead Derek was in that team with uh you know a teammate of mine in Philly on that crew remember exactly where I was watching Gordon haywards shot sail through the air and that and Derek was a member of that 80 team that Denny crumbs thats right first national championship Daryl Griffith its been fun listening to Kenny Kane talk about those teams and how coach Crum influenced him you get to know Denny pretty well um not real well not as well as I would have liked but certainly knew of him case Hunter nine points now for Chase leads up to 13 he really didnt get dunked on much by Daryl because he was out of Utah on the Western Conference for a foot for his career lucky for you Applause thank you Jalen Withers short Applause at least the thing with Louisville and uh quick early three but they havent been turning the ball over and theyve been giving at least the Larry Brown used to talk about making your mistakes up on the rim meaning a shot is better than a turnover looking lingering right around this 1311 point mark Music deep three Ellis trainer got away with a little push off on shefflin and I think that just the way the defense is in the way theyre playing him off of the pick and roll with Ellis hes going to have to have some deep freeze Applause Mike James whats the call blocker charge its a block count the basket for James this is the thing that scares you with Alice he gets hung up in the air with you know and if it makes the play and nobody else going left finishing right I talked about his ability with his size what you think Mike yeah I thought that was a good call I thought he went laterally and uh you know that was more taken on the shoulder than on the chest gotta get that sternum in front all about sternum placement back to a 10point game with 1017 to play Applause 14 now for Mike James double figures for the fourth time in his last five games just his fifth time all season the reigning ACC freshman of the week on Middlebrooks had a mismatch didnt realize it kicked it out Corner jumper wont go for beetle and Louisville has a chance to further chip away here and its been one shot and out for Clemson James big Miss meanwhile Hunter Tyson at the other end steps back missed the three you know the way that their offense has been going even though its him that may have been an early shot Hunter Tyson Off to the Races Showtime Applause just when you think theyre taking care of the basketball the Cardinals give that gift to the Clemson Tigers well it was that early shot before but he makes up for it right now and its a little hand in there and then off the races but nobodys gonna catch him very fast in the open floor a strong finish and you know all things considered I think it a good time out by Kenny Payne right there to calm things down see if uh Louisville can answer with a good possession coming out of the timeout well Clemson after their twoin week over the Hokies and Panthers last week got a lot of votes in the AP Top 25 they were number two amongst teams receiving votes de facto number 27 in the top 25 but its a Clemson team that they can hang on tonight well I got yeah I got to thank Evan they take care of business here and a win against Duke on Saturday no questions theyve got to be in the in the top 25 the next week thank you meanwhile shout out to the student section and the fans here at Littlejohn they were lined up a good hour 45 minutes before tipoff tonight ready to enter and make noise grit after Dark Clemson Grit Curry to the wing three is down for Jalen Withers we got a ninepoint game he talked about it hes capable seems very comfortable coming off of the bench a threepoint shot you have to pay attention to that entry pass by Hall and Louisvilles going to shoot one and one at the other way the fouls on Chaplin shes gonna be two shots actually Cardinals into the double bonus out of my adopted home City in Charlotte North Carolina you know and talking to Kenny today and you know there were guys who left this program there was so much hanging over the head of the program that he you know he said I cant blame the guys you know nobody knew which way uh you know NCAA sanctions were to come down Applause Music Applause Ill tell you what this uh this young man at the freethrow line right now is kind of a really nice building block for the future yeah hes just three for nine from the field but hes nine for ten from the free throw line six five sturdy still hoping to shed a few pounds splits the free throws ever since the Tigers trailed by nine early and seized control its felt like this game was in Clemsons grass but its an eightpoint game with eight and a half to play and PJ Hall is still scoreless and uh and the thing too that last uh Hunter Tyson run out was the only open floor basket theyve gotten in the second half theyve been much more in the half court for Clemson and it has not been as easy Applause Alice to trainer Curry thats high low Applause pretty good defense by Hall Tigers numbers Galloway way off rebound all the way out for Chase Hunter and Kenny Payne the FED they got the good the you know the first Miss but the recycle and the long rebound the perimeter guys have to hang in there PJ Hall finally the thing I like about their front line Clemson those guys can run the floor well and there are not many guys who are slow in transition Applause do you see signs of fatigue late in games from a guy like Ellis Withers will take it make it yeah two threes for him but you know to answer your question no um and uh you know he is so active in the half court and hes hitting the lane in every possession off the dribble but hes not been scoring but finding people third straight game of double figures Off the Bench for Jalen Withers hes got three threes and three attempts and the Cardinals are hanging around its a seven point game Music Applause its time now for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer with the Tigers leading 6255 we welcome you back to our Courtside perch Mike jaminski Im Evan Lefler the Louisville Cardinals are 2 and 14 the Clemson Tigers are 133 and yet this has been a very competitive game and I think Louisville is going to have a chance to win some games down the stretch or they play like this well second half has been a different story for them and like I said theyve kept Clemson in the half court why did some things down and you know the last thing you want to give a team like this is Hope and Im sure that thats what Brad Brownell is talking about right now it follows you know weve got to put together a little 6080 run and take care of business here see if the Tigers can do it lets go around the ACC in a fivegame Wednesday night Miami after a week off following their loss in Atlanta bounces back against BC how about the Hurricanes tonight shooting from three 12 of 18 Isaiah Wong a nice game there how about uh Kyle phillipowski its due 28 and 15 in the win carrying on that Polish tradition Im sure youre very proud of that Wake Forest rolling over the Seminoles and Winston youve been watching The Fast Break presented by your local Ford dealer in America the future belongs to everyone in America the future belongs to everyone so we built the new Ford Bronco sport for everyone with seven available goat modes and a camera with offroad views its built for America Music Saturday its a rematch with everything on the line the hurricanes look to light it up when a physical Wolfpack hungry to abandon lost from last time they met Saturday on Valley Sports South presented by your local Ford dealer 6 57 ago here in Clemson Hunter Tysons got a game best 21 points with 10 rebounds his fifth straight double double however we got a seven point game because Mike James L Ellis and Jalen Withers all are in double figures for Louisville well and the thing thats trending too is the freethrow line and thats where Louisville has a big Advantage now the one thing you look on the year at their point distribution is and its 22 of their offense is generated thats a free throw line which is top 50 in the nation so thats a positive for them and theyve used it well in this game Music their early nine point lead matched their largest lead theyve had an ACC play they had an early ninepoint lead against Syracuse Cardinals have trailed by as many as 17 but they have hung around onto the break Reverend Galloway try to become his second tiger and other figures tonight that free throw gives him nine Galloway most recently at Boston College but before that at College of Charleston and how about the Cougars winning at UNC Wilmington tonight but Kelsey going on there 171 on the year their only loss was uh Bradwell game that you and I called in the dean Dome they gave North Carolina all they wanted in that game for about 30 minutes yes they did Ellis oh Clemson cant believe the call and Im gonna make an analogy talked about him showing some fatigue and uh you know I think it was it might have been Hall coming in we got that foul but the way he plays reminds me Allen Iverson and kind of similar size but always getting into the lane area taking a lot of contact thats something that may take its toll over the course of the season but thats kind of where his game a high volume shooter same number yeah did you get to know the answer at all during his NBA days when you were broadcasting uh not not a lot no no George Chan could certainly use a guy like him right now Music maybe hes the next coach who knows shefflin just picked up his third foul past the hall was poked away Withers just lost it out of bounds why this is with the penny Payne right in front of those and because Ive talked about the unforced errors before the game and thats just you know youre rolling chance to pick up a big basket right there in an unforced error could have been a sixpoint game maybe even closer DJ doubled by trainer hell bring it back outside six minutes to play Clemson get to 60 and ACC play for the first time ever shot clock is a factor Galloway fires 30second violation yeah that was just a disjointing possession in the half court they really had nothing going that time and this uh this crowd a little bit back on its heels too this way you know for a visiting team last five minutes of the game get come in and get some things quieted down here yeah Louisville came very close to knocking off Syracuse last week they were within three against Wake Forest in the final minutes on Saturday Galloway defensive foul well because he lowered the shoulder that time good defense watch right here right there just that just that little bit is enough to get the call Applause Galloway has a chat L Ellis has played every minute tonight 12 points three rebounds three assists only two turnovers looking for this big bucket Mike James thought he saved it got hit on the on the air ball it hit the end line and again where where is fatigue going to manifest itself on the threepoint shot especially as deep as hes been shooting and had taken a lot of Threes tonight its just two for four for 14 overall hasnt been PJs night can he get going in the last five minutes last five Saturday a pit along the Hunter and hell get free throws here late whistle could have just one on Curry Music first on Sydney you know any player gets through us get to that right hand and hes got a verse to drawing contact inside as well foreign Music Applause from the freethrow line tonight we mentioned north of 78 from the line as a team this season well you talk about progression um how about a guy here first three years five average Five Points three points and seven points in case Hunter and where he is right now 21 years old will be 22 in April averaging 14 and a half points per game hes got 11 tonight one of three tigers and double figures 10point game four and change left and a battle on the Block its gonna be a foul on Josh Beadle number three on beetle double bonus for Louisville look Louisville has had a tough season but theres still a scary team to go against and theyre going to give a lot of ACC coaches that facial expression that Brad Brownells just showed right there and I believe Louisvilles going to get somebody at some point yeah I dont think theres any doubt about that and its just I think its a great sign that this this game could have teetered either way about the 15 16 minute mark but these guys have battled back in it theyre giving their theyre giving Clemson all they want right now also be two free throws for the Tigers hes had team foul on Louisville Music a giveaway funnel right there with 22 seconds on the clock almost had a violation Kenny said the other day Louisvilles a proud tradition I dont want to say weve lost it but somethings on so weve got to get it back I play I said earlier in the broadcast its its been a tough 10 years and thats and thats having won a national championship in 2014 that got vacated but still I mean this you know I dont know all the things with with Coach patino and you know in the last four or five years where this program has been its not been easy Chase Hunter getting taped Kenny Payne tries to get a little extra stealing a timeout right there Applause hes just the fourth Louisville head coach since 1971 now that excludes the interim coaches theyve had and there have been a couple geese Applause going back youre talking about going back through their years in the Metro conference thats right Applause Ellis nice dish and Curry handles the contact and scores hes a load I mean hes a guy hes hes going to get a lot of hand ones uh if he just if you just stay ready with this guy to catch passes nice Punk fake and he is going to finish through most contact number three on Hunter Elliss fourth assist of the night Ls at 36 minutes on the stat tracker and we got four minutes to go so that tells you the story Pharrell minutes wise this evening inside the hall going to work on Curry yes yes and the foul its been a quiet night by PJs lofty standards but hes trying to finish off Louisville up by 104 to play how do you enjoy a delicious homecooked meal without the prep you could get a meal kit shipped in a cardboard box or take a

say is empowerment through horses I love what I do Im just happy to be a part of it Music trying to put little the Cardinals have been pesky but PJ Halls late surge has been effective for the Tigers Applause its our Coyote Tractor Turning Point yeah guys you know again hes so hes so good when he gets to that right hand nice base good finish for contact as well and that was with a big double team coming in late Music Applause I mean PJ almost only played 13 minutes and I played six minutes in the first half seven so far here in the second half the most jarring thing about his stats line besides the minute is just one Rebound in 13 minutes Hunter Tysons got 10 boards Clemson has more rebounds than Louisville does plus three team standpoint well that that would be a stat line that last year this team couldnt overcome and good point you know and I mean you know when shefflins play and you know last year could have been I think a special one for Clemson but Tyson getting hurt they never really recovered from that yeah injuries are often a factor and BJs trades coming back from that dislocated kneecap because its been a struggle with him physically oh big shock from the corner for JJ Trainor trainers got seven and its still very much within Striking Distance eightpoint game good answer and only five turnovers this half for Louisville progress indeed Tyson was fouled Mike James knew it and this thing I mean you youve got Hunter Tyson in a bad way right there you just bail him out with a free with a foul in that situation Tyson two for three at the line tonight like the last time Clemson was 50 in ACC play it was one of the games of the year in college basketball here at Littlejohn January 23rd 1997 number two Clemson and number four Wake Forest a guy named Tim Duncan who went to 16 points 15 rebounds and five blocks and a threepoint win to spoil Clemsons perfect early season record and that was uh that was kind of a pedestrian effort by Mr Duncan too his standards 26 years ago heres a three for Kamari lands his second of the night Cardinals have made nine threes and its a sixpoint game not just nine threes but 50 percent from behind the arc is that in the freethrow line have been very kind to them in this game hunter Tyson answers wow that was a perfect Parabola it barely grazed the net and thats just that hes only hes very much the leader of this team and its a great Cross Court find it was a long closeout and he gives him a little pat on the behind after that one but hell with this but Louisvilles getting some nice looks from three as well Kamari lands we talk about uh Mike James as a redshirt freshman lands a freshman as well so getting this year and playing against guys like Tyson are going to benefit him in his sophomore year Hunter Tysons second highest scoring game of the season had the careerhigh 31 along with 15 rebounds against NC State on December 30th Music a lot of close games between these two by the way Louisville has not won at Clemson since 1973 Kenny Payne was seven years old when the yeah last one of Clemson I got to get you out of the 70s youve been coming up with a lot of stats from my thats my year what grade were you in in 1973 to give you a flashback and my duke team came in here ranked number one in 1980 and left with an overtime loss that was the way the league was back then well a guy named Larry Nance was uh playing number 22 for Clemson back then pretty good player in his own right hes got another son in the NBA whos playing pretty well so that gene pool is strong Applause lets see if Clemson could get a stop and a turnover here loosen things up a little bit Ellis hangs in the air James attacks and scores well I see you know when the whole thing with an injury is getting past it and not you know mentally Crossing that hurdle and I think that uh Mike James is in that spot right now and look he was nine for his last 15 from three the past couple games hes over two from three to nine hes still got 17 points PJ Hall no Applause basket here for Louisville would make things Mighty tense here at Clemson oh great dumb ball Arrow will keep it with Louisville you think they were going to get PJ for the fouling I thought he was going to get called for a foul looks like he Applause on a ball yeah a lot of ball a lot of body 5050 call well give him that no harm no foul they retain possession 18 to shoot Alice picked first step unable to bank it in and Hunter Tyson gets poked in the face after his 11th rebound of the night thank you number two in the foul department on Albert Ellis III Applause Music Applause you see this is you know especially for for Hunter Tyson remember he was out for a decent stretch in that first half when the bench came in gave them good minutes they built up the lead right now is when those minutes on the bench are paying dividends for him despite that missed free throw strange night for Hunter its a line he just is for as good as shooter he is hes got a little bit of a little disjointed motion at the freethrow line 81 of the season but hes three for six tonight four for seven oh better finish all right 93 seconds to go Applause first pressure weve seen up the floor by Clemson slows him down a little bit but its hard to slow Ellis down Corner three wont go for lands but the stick back makes it a sixpoint game 75 seconds left trainer getting inside theyve got a lot of length Applause Paul attacks and scores Applause PJ had no points for a long time tonight but hes a free throw away from double figures well heres the thing and this is why theyre a tough team to attack off the press good handle and their big guys can put the ball on the floor both Tyson and PJ Hall pretty good with the ball turn off multiple offseason surgeries on an off Night Team man hes still got 10 points perfect four for four from the line nine point game with a minute left and that last turnover might be the nail on the coffin for Louisville on this particular January night Clemson spreads him out thank you case Hunter fakes it takes it free throws coming he was looking for the exclamation point Applause heres the look and they you know thats the thing you go flying out at him to cover up the three and hes so good at putting the ball on the floor just really impressed with his game foreign Music Applause with a chance to add to it smooth three shy of his career high Applause and the Clemson Tigers are on the verge of making history and their seventh decade in the ACC Carter uh Hunter the rebound and hes fouled with 139 to go there was an uneasy feeling in this building tonight but the Clemson faithful will breed the sigh of relief and get ready for John Shire Kyle filipowski and the Duke Blue Devils theyll be here Saturday I agree with you I think this Louisville team is gonna theyre gonna Nick some people down the down the stretch you could see theyre right you know theyre right there and I know that this coaching staff you know you get tired of talking about moral victories but uh you know right now this backcourt is really good and theyre theyve got too many athletes up front to not give people problems Curtain Call time for the starters Brad Brownell continues to coach Applause Ellis blocks theres only one team in the ACC thats undefeated and its the Clemson Tigers 60 for the first time in program history and how about three of their next four are here in Little John things looking very bright to this team thats 12 straight home wins and Brad Brownell will look for a milestone moment on
