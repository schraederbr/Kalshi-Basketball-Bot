tip off Tony Padilla comes in and says lets rejump it bur Smith Matt Potter Tony Padilla are officiating crew and that is won by Maxim Music Applause Music Reno there is Applause jayen Jaylen Blakes the Duke transfer thatll be an interesting match up to watch tonight against the smaller Marcus Burton well we talked about it in shootaround earlier is is Marcus Burton with his size is that hurting him defensively and you see early on jayen Blakes going right to the post up against him but Burton do a good job doing a good job of holding his own seven different starting lineup this year for Notre Dame they have dealt with a plethora of injuries as Tay Davis draws a foul of the shooting variety look at that match up right there Matt with Cam camon against Davis and you give the advantage of Notre Dame right there Davis is one of the best at penetrating getting to the rim and getting to the free throw line you see him they got to make these two guys Davis and Burton jump Shooters and even then its going to be tough for the Stanford team mik Shrewsberry struggles in your two have been well chronicled and frankly theyve been SN snake bitten by injuries all year long theyre without his son Braden Shrewsberry for the rest of the year their third leading score matako again tonight is a game time decision dealing with injury and yet theyve been in just about every game in League Play that goes to show you man how good Burton and Davis has been for this Notre Dame team but without their best shooter without one of their best ball handlers and aako best decision makers puts a lot of the load on those two guys who are the other guys that can step up for Notre Dame tribute on the offensive side of the ball Burton Off the Mark rebound r no meanwhile for Stanford they returned just one starter from a year ago thats Maxim Reno they were picked to finish second to last in the conference and yet were talking about them possibly having an opportunity to finish top four what a year for Kyle Smith and the Cardinal and a foul on the floor on the rebound attempt goes against Notre Dame I think that just goes to show you what type of Coach Kyle Smith is hes a guy Who develops his players you talk about Jaylen Blakes and oiah sers two guys who have increased their scoring average by 11 points and by eight points respectively and Kyle Smith just gets his guys to buy in and gets his guys better each and every Applause season oh great feed by Burton inside the ji and a whistle comes in Irish are headed back to the foul line mat I think ji is one of those guys who obviously hes just known as around the rim guy but hes gotten better at shooting the basketball he likes the corner three but Burns going to have to get in that lane and hes going to be crowded hes going to have to look to be able to make plays for others and Ja is a guy who could be around the rim he has to be ready to catch and ready to finish and if he gets foued knock down these free throws Applause Mah Shrewsberry has had to mix in match lineups pretty much all season long you go back to December when they lost Marcus Burton for seven games during arguably their toughest stretch of the Year certainly during the nonconference played Houston they played kraton they played Georgia all without Marcus Burton who missed the majority of that ruter game as well Music Applause under 10 to shoot for Stanford agar wall tries a three and puts it down first point of the night for Stanford after missing their first four shots but agarwall is a guy whos continued to get better shooting and known as a threepoint shooter struggled early on shooting at three but hes a guy whos progressed getting better also making plays with the ball in his hands last touched by Stanford itll stay Music here its just one of these plays where you got to make a play by yourself Notre Dame did a good job early on keeping guys in front but agar wall you go in there a screen against him hes going to take advantage and knock it down great shot right there by Ryan agell jumped into the starting lineup in DEC and never look back for Kyle Smith after red shirting a season Applause ago Burton still scoreless in the game five to shoot for Davis what an athletic move and Davis is headed to the free throw line thats the third consecutive trip to the line for Notre Dame look Matt this is one of the keys for Stanford they have to be able to limit Notre Dame and pain touches they know Bergen they know Davis are going to try to put their head down and get into the lane draw files create for their teammates they got to do a better job of putting bodies in front of them making them kick the ball out before they touch the paint well theres a couple of guys in this game tonight that are legitimate most improved player in the conference candidates Tay Davis is one of those the other Jaylen Blakes who was buried on the bench at Duke and has become the second leading scorer this year for St Applause those are the two guys man Im with you its either going to be Blakes or its either going to be Davis so were watching the two guys that are in the running for most improved player are the two guys that should win it do you have a sense if you were given a vote is there a guy that has Den nod in your opinion well we me and you were talking about this earlier before I think you got to give the nod right now to jayen Blakes just because of where Stanford is at in the conference standings theyve been winning games this could be their 20th win of the season and look he was at Duke last year and he averaged one point you know and and now hes averaging almost 14 points a game and besides that hes bringing defense hes averaging almost two steals a game and look either of these guys whoever the Win It are both of them are uh deserving deserving excuse me yeah deserving of the award so um but yeah I just think Jaylen Blakes would with how Stanfords playing Reno at the line for two shots and knocks them both down 21 double doubles this year for Reno tied for the lead in the country he too has improved substantially since last season well every single year since his freshman year his scoring average went up his rebounding average went up but one thing that Ive noticed about him this year is hes more of a vocal leader hes turned into a really a team leader getting his guys organized and being a leader more vocally on the floor reing most improved player in the Pack 12 from a season Applause Music ago and right now they have to get in the ball thats right there he had position three times in a row you have to be able to see him ear Stanford has to go into him early on look to be aggressive at The Rim well this is what Kyle Smith talked to us about and that is what he called a growth mindset with Maxim R Music now last year was a stud for Stanford new coaching staff comes in and has ideas about how he can improve as he takes that with authority to the rim and rather than just brushing off the new staff dug in and wanted to learn which is rare these days right I mean loyalty is rare these days in college basketball with the transfer portal in the nil guys are looking to see can they get more money but hes stuck with it and now hes a potential NBA draft no Applause Music Applause Music doubt Chism on par trying to threat it down to Sellers and here comes Tay Applause Davis mat kesn is a guy for Notre Dame who last game he had 27 minutes and only scored one bucket right on Q hes a guy who can shoot the three he can put it on the ground a little bit but out of the other guys I think JR kesi is a guy who really needs to step up in the scoring column for Notre Day first made field goal of the night for the Fighting Irish five minutes gone in the first half and here comes Burton still looking for his first field Applause Music goal Davis catch and Applause Sho its one thing for Tay Davis is he if hes able to shoot the ball at a consistent level he has NBA written all over him as far as his body type how he can get to the basket but he has to be able to be consistent with that jump shot Applause Music kesn tries another three and last Touch by Notre Dame itll be Stanford ball when we come back an early twopoint lead for the Cardinal integral parts of the Stanford team well a big thing is about opportunity I mean the school that they were at last year doesnt mean theyre not good players they just had other guys in front and the coach felt like those guys were better fit for the team Kyle Smith does a great job of bringing guys in and having them buy into to their roles right hes hes got a great group right here and I think hes done a great job of developing guys and Stanford is uh looking for their 20th win of the Year well hes a program Builder this is the fourth different program he has taken over and been tasked with rebooting as chisam monar the Harvard transfer was whistled for the travel and he has a track record of success 3 21 Seasons at San Francisco as we just mentioned brought Washington State to their first NCAA tournament in over a decade last year Stanfords knocking on the door in year one one thing that really stands out to me about Coach myth is his energy its infectious his personality he just seems like a great guy to be around and I think his players feed off that energy and off the personality that he has first points of the night for the ACC leading score Marcus Burton and its a three Applause stf for just one for four from downtown to start and Davis Chucks that into second row of seats and back to the Cardinal one thing I know is youre not going to keep Marcus Burton down for too long they say try to make him a jump shooter but hes shooting almost 40 from three the little jab get me off and knock it down reing Rookie of the Year in the ACC and has somehow been even better this year I mean hes unbelievable just at his size I mean to be able to get in the lane and finish like he does amongst the trees hes an incredible Talent Stanford approaching a threeminute scoring trout Reno had it jred Loose three to shoot raino left hand w go and the drop continues for Stanford and heres my thing Matt I understand Reno is he he can be effective out in the perimeter but when you have a guy like rooper and Davis with theyre switching get him down where he can be most effective in the low post have the defense collapse and then create opportunities for your guards off the long close outs but they have to find a way to get Maxi and rode into the low post and then work his way out on the room coming off his 17th 20 point performance in the win against SMU on senior day for Stanford over the weekend but spent a lot of time on the perimeter against the two3 zone of SMU Burton creating space rims out the pull up and honestly he can shoot to three right now but teams would prefer to him being out on the perimeter youre 72 right now you got rer on you you got to see that well a good sight for Notre Dame fans mat alako onto the floor after missing six of the last seven games with a wrist injury he is wearing a wrap on that right wrist his shooting hand here he is with the basketball T to shoot and cans his first jumper look this is his last year he only has a few games left Irish are still fighting to get into the ACC tournament you cant hold a guy like that back hes too tough of a guard and he wants to get out there and play and help his team extends the Notre Dame run to 80 meanwhile a 4 and 12 minute scoring job for Stanford again I I just think that shot will be there all night for raino if you want and Notre Dame prefers for him to shoot that shot get him down low try to draw some fouls get to the free throw line get some opportunities on the perimeter for your guards Benny k Off the Bench for Stanford now running the point Cardinal desperate for some offense Applause Music here Tate Davis is an underrated Defender moving his feet keeping guys in front Reno on the smaller Roper left hand short and its going back to Notre Dame Irish on an 80 run frustrating Stanford card opportunity to move up and they can better their chances of moving into the top four with a win tonight here is Matt alako again missing six of his last seven games we saw him shooting with some extra shots this afternoon and then icing the wrist afterward gutting it out through pain in his final two regular season games of his collegiate career oh its an interesting lineup right now for Notre Dame Davis or Burton not in the game so where does the scoring come from gayer tries a Applause three Thompson the rebound going into the paint kick out agar wall no and Stanford has missed their last 10 field goals matter if you if you look at Stanford and the shots that theyre getting theres not really enough ball movement to get open looks since Stanford doesnt have a lot of guys who are just going to go oneonone ice so they need that ball move it side to side they need to send Cutters through the lane to find open opportunities righto not on the floor either for Stanford so two of the top three scores in the ACC on the bench at the moment meanwhile its a foul on Notre Dame you you talked at length about getting Reno the ball in the paint now where do you go if youre stand well you just got to get ball mov from side to side you got to try to create angles to drive into the lane if you get that angle you got to take it the defense collapse you have to make a decision whether its a drive and kick or a drive and drop its a Stanford team thats in the midst of a threegame win streak coming off one of their two best wins of the season in the words of Kyle Smith a 7368 win over SMU the other was a upset of UNC and gayer ends a 6 minute 30 seconds scoring job for the Cardinal we talked about where the offense is come giler had 17 points last game coming off the bench former Wan only one year though he earned a scholarship after that first year and hes a guy thats been providing scoring for Stanford Off the Bench that was his best shooting performance of the ACC slate here he is running the break Music Applause Applause Here Comes sir Mohamed one of three freshman getting additional minutes late in the year due to all the injuries and he has headed to the free throw line Benny geler the former walk on it and only for one year he earned himself a scholarship after that one year but coming off a hot performer 17 points off the bench last game at SMU hes continuing knocking down the corner three meanwhile the foul situation is becoming interesting for both teams two more fouls on Stanford Notre Dame shooting free throws the rest of the way in the first half three more on Notre Dame similar situation for the Cardinal but Notre Dames got to knock these down just going to say man theyre two for eight now from the free throw sign so theyre get into the basket creating opportunities and not knocking down their free Music throws this is a different game entirely if they make those free throws earlier and its going back to Stanford well theyre doing their job right you want to be able to get downhill get opportunities at The Rim theyre being aggressive and when youre aggressive youre going to get foul calls get opportunities to go to the free throw line you have to knock them down two fouls on oiah sers he heads to the bench two fouls on Kevin ji for Notre Dame he hasnt been on the floor in the last five or six minutes picked up two quick ones to start the game and another whistle the six team foul on Stanford it goes against Benny geler and I was talking to coach Shrewsberry at practice yesterday and hes really high on this young guy sir Mohammad Nazi Muhammads son so he its in his blood already but you see a guy right here whos just able to get into the lane and he has good size doesnt look like a Goen looks like a Applause Laughter foul all right Maxim REO is going to come back on the floor for Stanford he has had a bit of a struggle to start this game one for six his long made field goal was a dunk after he put it on the deck and went straight to the cup Tay Davis comes back on for the Irish maybe its just me mat but if Im 72 to start the game Im working myself inside and then as it progresses I can work myself out but Stanford has to find a way to get him into that low block area especially with guys like Tay Davis on him you got to take advantage of that size Applause it stand for two for 10 from downtown to start BT Up and Under goes right past Taylor off the window great move right there by Burt I dont know if he got away with a little travel right there but as quick as he is you probably didnt see it so good finish at The Rim Thompson again in and out REO offensive board missing from Point Blank Range and its Davis with for the basketball and this is what Notre Dame has to try to do you dont always want to have to play against a set defense in the half court if you can get out and transition get some early opportunities thatd be ideal for both teams that is really well defended by REO and Stanford will slow the pace those are the shots that youre going to have to go the defense youre going to have to go against every single time in half court if if youre not able to create turnovers in the half court and get out of its really tough to to play against a half cour defense every single possession down the floor Thompson cutting off the back iron and a whistle on the rebound effort goes against Notre Dame to the ACC tournament this year bottom three teams in the league do not make it Applause in and NC State man upsetting pitch tonight I dont know about you but I did not see that coming from the wolf pack well shout out to my guy Kevin Keats I I mean Ive had some great conversations with Kevin and and texting him back and forth great guy but Matt for Notre Dame you want to get this win tonight you dont want to have the pressure going into your last regular season game having to win that game take some pressure off yourself tonight get this Victory vers Stanford look like like its going to be one of those grinded out games but both teams like you said not shooting the ball very well at all heres Cole Serta who has shot it well getting more minutes due to the injuries that Notre Dame has sustained and they will not get the shot off a violation well give it back to Stanford and you got to give Stanford Credit the first guy Marcus Burt is going to get by its hard to keep him in front theyre doing a great job of sing bodies in that second line of defense making it hard for him kicking it out making decisions other guys guys have to be able to step up and you have to make quicker decisions if youre Marcus Applause Burton and Matt on this end Stanford has to see the mismatches when Notre Dame is switching especially with r right now you got a smaller T Davis on you and youre not even looking at it more than half of Stanford shots have come from Beyond The Arc they are shooting 133 from the FL three for 23 and a nice job there by Tay Davis getting to the cup and if Im Tay Davis and I have Max REO guard me I see blood every single time down the floor Im going right at him one because I know I can get by him and two Im going to put him in foul trouble he scored 15 points or more in three the last four Reno tough shot somehow finds the bottom of the cup hes now two for eight great players are going to make tough shots can you you sustain a whole game getting those type of shots I dont think so if youre Stanford you got to find a way to get him closer to the rim kesn no tapped into the hands of agaro come on you didnt have a game where youre just chucking up tough stuff to found the bottom of the cup every time absolutely yeah thats what I thought heres raino off the heel geler the rebound tries a three and puts it in and a timeout taken by Notre dve well see was six seven five ass six 17 points three assists thats a big statement right there by coach Smith I I I think Benny gerer has it in him the work ethic hes going to have to have a really good summer to be able to get to that Applause level Stanford has shot 19 and yet they lead by one in this game what is happening right now at pel Pavilion defensively theyre doing a great job of just putting bodies in front of Marcus buron and they know theres not a lot of Shooters on the outside for the Irish thats why its so missing Shrewsberry it changes the whole dynamic of this Irish team and they know again Stanford doesnt Notre Dame doesnt have a lot of Shooters out there and even with matako returning from injury tonight were not sure how much hes going to play again he was a game time decision and hes back on the bench now Burton short rebound Davis and looked like he might have been caught on the arm by Reno no call and Stanford with the basketball you see Stanford on that possession switched it up a little bit with 131 defense just giving donor Dame a different Music Applause look and right now you have to see that thats a pass you have to make right there if you o power you have to see that oh Benny giler in his bag in the first half has three triples Benny geler my Im sorry all right my fault on that I didnt know your G he heard you Eric it wasnt to I didnt know your game like that but now I do youve been playing out of your mind in this first half keeping Stanford in it kzne with five driving on Thompson tough Fade Away jumper no and Reno snatches it off the rim man thats just not his game hes not a ISO player hes not a oneonone guy Notre Dame has to get some ball movement side to side try to create some advantages that way and if not if youre going to go oneonone give it to Applause Marburg Reno catch and Sho chokar fighting for the rebound wins a foul and that would probably be enough to get them in to the ACC tournament and we also have Kansas and Arizona that day as well as Kentucky keep Missouri Thompson a three what do you think UNC has a chance or no theyve been playing great bate you know when those two teams play Duke and UNC you really throw the records out its so big of a rivalry that you never know what could happen so I think Duke wins but you never know the way unccs been playing and just how intense it could get well see what happens tar Hills have won six in a row doing their best to play themselves into the NCAA tournament meanwhile rer with two to Applause shoot now Notre Dame in the midst of a three and 1 half minute scoring drought Stanford went over six minutes without a point in this half they lead by four Reno into the teeth of kevi thats now the third foul on the Penn State transfer well its funny what happens when you get the ball in effective spots if youre 72 you can turn you can face up he gives you a little space he closes out on it and then you attack it he didnt make the shot but you got an opportunity at the free throw line J literally just came back into the game after returning from the commercial break now you got to think hell head back to the bench for the rest of the first half Stanford in the bonus the rest of the way Music well this is what were talking about right now North Carolina the last team in but we know how that goes last year NC State was one of those bit Stealers and if you were a last team in you hated seeing NC State win the ACC tournament stealing a bid if youre North Carolina Eric youd love to get that win against Duke and solidify your resume as a tournament team if you beat Duke youre in I mean thats just what it is you I mean thats a high quality win I think Duke wins the ACC tournament I mean they just been playing at a high high level the whole season defensively everybodys locked in offensively they have a superstar and they got other guys fitting into their roles and then one of the best players or excuse me one of the best coaches in the country in John shy oh Cole CA from the logo stops at 10 Stanford run Ser is a guy who hasnt really get been getting any time this year injuries happen opportunities come about and hes done a good job stepping in and shooting the ball at a high level Oar called for the travel looked like he was on ice skates and now a couple of managers are going to come out and wipe the Applause floor you know like injuries happen but it does create opportunities for other guys and Cole Ser to taking advantage of the time hes getting on the floor hes been shooting the ball extremely well in the time that hes got at a couple of threes in the most recent heartbreaking loss to Wake Forest over the weekend for Notre Dame had a couple of looks at the buzzer to tie it and send it to overtime could not Notre Dame has a a few young guys that could really develop into some good players Cole Ser you got Garrett sundra whos a 611 big who could shoot the ball and stretch the floor a little bit as well 70 seconds to play in the opening half Stanford by Applause Music three R knowa deep too splashes from the Baseline youre kesi right there you got to get up and crowd rod and make him put it on the floor you know he can knock down that jump shot and a whistle against jayen Blakes his first and the seventh on the Cardinal right here your Jr K you just got to get up and crowd not even let him have an opportunity to shoot that and face up and just a little bit of space Maxine Reno needs to be able to knock it down he is approaching a double double and were not even at the end of the first half 10 points eight boards despite starting excruciatingly slow from the flooran youre going through and Matt really despite his teammates missing him a lot on the mismatches and the high lows I just think for maxing right now and Ive been redundant in saying this but you have to start low he has the advantage especially with Tay Davis on him and JR kesn you have to look for him right now Tay Davis giving up four or five inches on righto and a whistle makes the fifth turnover for Stanford giving it back to Notre Dame now the next thing for Stanford when they see the double team cut they have to send cutter Cutters through they have to have guys come up and Music lift right here good job of getting to the Elbow now when the double team does come you have to lift on the threepoint line or send CS through the middle and rno has to be more decisive and make a quicker decision how about the six foot Bert sticking his chest into the 71 senior well thats just all heart right there I mean hes one of the toughest point guards in the country holding for what will effectively be the final shot 1 second differential between game and shot clock Burton bouncing off the side of the rim Blakes from half courts and Stanford despite shooting 23 from the floor takes a threepoint lead in the halftime well take a quick break and then hand it over to Zubin mahen four k j start starts the second half with three fouls heres Burton with three to shoot kick out Davis to beat the horn and righto the rebound look M Stanfords doing a great job of just crowding Burton hes getting by the first guy but hes seeing two or three bodies and those are the type of shots that theyre going to have the way Stanfords playing that defense Tay Davis has to be able to knock him down that is the second foul on Sir muhamd both teams ended the first half in the bonus and the foul trouble starting to stack up for Notre Dame now multiple players with at least two fouls raino Baseline jumper buries it and he leads all scores with 12 now look he he he gets it in a more effective spot short Corner are you turn face up knock down the jumper over a shorter Applause Davis Notre Dame has been in so many tight games this year 10 losses by single digits seven of those in League Play Here comes agarwall off the turnover Blakes takes flight and draws a foul and that might be number three on sir mohamd it is so now he and kevi with three fouls both teams been struggling to half court Stanford got an opportunity to get a semi transition and jayen Blakes doing a great job of just getting down downhill being aggressive at The Rim an opportunity to knock down two free Applause Music throws now meanwhile Stanford unlike Notre Dame has been able to win so many close games theyve now won three in a row including a 7368 win over SMU over the weekend Kyle Smith was hes not an emotional guy but he was almost emotional in the postgame press conference a senior day for Stanford theyve completely outpaced expectations externally and maybe even some internally this year one win shy of 20 as Burton as his first bucket of the second half I I think one thing that people have to understand is these guys are spending so much time together during the year on the court off the court obviously they want to win basetball games but theyre molding these guys into men right and and you can see with Coach Smith hes passionate about not only making them better basketball players but growing in growing them into better men now hes standing in a defensive stance at Mid Court his team with their largest lead of the game at seven Davis no Second Chance draws a foul on r no and two shots coming for the Indianapolis native just the first foul on Reno and the First on Stanford in the half and look right now Co Serta is really the only guy whos a pure shooter out on the floor yes Marcus buron can knock it down but hes more effective getting to the rim Notre Dame is going to be infective when they can get into the paint and create opportunities draw fouls but again they have to be able to knock down their free throws you wonder how much well see Matt alako in the second half his head coach just put him back into the game we saw him for eight or nine minutes in the first frame and again if you havent been following Notre Dame closely this year one of a handful of players whos missed significant time with injury six of the last seven games playing with a wrap on his shooting wrist tonight I think one thing about alako too hes more than just a shooter hes a leader you see him right now hes communicating on the court hes a great defender hes also a great decision maker just him being on the floor makes Notre Dame a better team and it goes beyond this too but this is your big three right Burton leading scorer Alo forth leading scorer Shrewsberry out for the year hes been their third leading scorer and at the time he went out he was in the midst of a heater three straight games in double figures for the head coachs sun and I think the big one obviously right now is Shrewsberry hes one of the best Shooters in the ACC he spaces the floor he makes those driving Lanes a little bit bigger for Davis and Burton and right now its been really hard for Notre Dame well if youre going to hit shots like that okay but its been really hard for Notre Dame drive and get in the lane but if youre Marcus Burton one of the best guards in the country youre able to knock down tough shots like that leads the ACC and scoring coming into the night turn around jumper and a friendly bounce for maxim REO weve been saying it all night Matt get him the ball where he can be most effective and thats round the room just make a quick decision turn around go up to the Applause rim and great players make tough shots like this Marcus Burton nothing surprises you with him and Maxine REO get him the ball where he can be effective turn around your 7 foot2 go up finish at The Rim somebody needs to cut off the ball then yeah great job right Applause there almost picked by Burton and he secures it two onone transition three back and its back to a onepoint game timeout Applause Stanford second half from Marcus Burton here as we welcome you back to pcel Pavilion he can make it from anywhere man I mean hes Relentless I mean hes going to miss a couple shots hes just going to keep going one of the most explosive guards in in the country just love to watch him play meanwhile R nos just been short around the rim a handful of times tonight good defense there on tay Davis behind the play as geler pushes and right now if you good you have to see him you have to get him the ball right now with matako guard Applause him oh what a take by Jaylen Blakes counted in the Music foul its tough when youre banking on other teams just take care of your business and then where everything else Falls thats just what it is but take care of business tonight then look forward to Louisville on Saturday which you know if Stanford wins this game theyre one of the hottest teams in the conference just by the nature of winning four in a row and who theyve beaten right including SMU over the weekend who for a long time was in the NCAA tournament now theyre sort of on the outside looking in sets up a really interesting matchup for Stanford against Louisville if they win here tonight like you said Matt they were picked 17th in the conference they they already won no doubt I mean just the season that theyre having and the job that coach Smith has done I mean theyre bringing the Stanford program back to life a win tonight would give them 20 for the first time since the 2019 2020 season it would also give them 12 Conference wins for the first time since 08 pretty remarkable for this first year staff that replaced six of the top seven scorers from a year ago Burton from way downtown Applause Blake step back got it a good job by Blakes right there just recognizing the switch with ji and just being aggressive off the dribble creating space knocking it Music down Burton spinning Applause great defense by Stanford they really make you work less than Tend to shoot Davis off the bounce tried to posterize camon and draws a foul well he cocked that back from about the free throw line and it is the second foul on Aiden camt so back to the line goes Tay Davis fourth trip to the strike tonight for the second year SE in Hall transfer makes the first well our NBA Friday Western Conference double header features the Grizzlies taking on the Kyrie lless ms tough stuff for Dallas meanwhile the suns currently 11th in the west they will take on Nia yic and the Nuggets coverage begins at 7 Eastern yes you did just see Brad Stevens in attendance his son is a walk on for Micah Shrewsberry but

GMS in the NBA is in the Music Applause stands threepoint lead for Stanford Applause who has shot better in the second half 66 again Davis trying to poster and could not I like the aggression right there by Davis you got to keep being aggressive towards the rim but Matt Stanfords done a great job this half of getting the ball in spots where they can be effective Cardinal now four for 20 from downtown third a five of 15 heres a loo Applause kesn we talked about the other guys we know Burton we know Davis but kesn is a guy who whos a capable shooter under that threepoint line when you get opportunities like that you have to be able to knock him down Blakes Applause Burton sitting on 17 10 of those in the second half already for the accs leading Applause Music Applause scorer Gaylor into the front court and quickly pays it off for Stanford if Im if Im Stanford I want to try to get more of those type of opportunities unforced air right there by J but turns into offense on the other end for Stanford dont have to play against a set defense easy layup and Applause transition foul on Stanford which will take us to a wood and the first as inter conference foes yes Stanford is part of the the Atlantic Coast Conference now 100 years ago Im still trying Im still trying to get that in my head 100 100 years Chang that was great video for 100 years AG yeah I wonder who took that and got that to us shout out to them fadeaway jumper muhamed Rams it down playing with three fouls another guy that has missed many games this year in fact 10 while undergoing a minor knee Music surgery man I like sir muhamad though I I think he has good size he can handle the ball hes a good Defender he can shoot the ball well he has a bright future here at Notre day Jaylen Blakes has eight points in this game all in the second half and Stanford maintains a fivepoint lead Stanford going to a little were in the zone for a second looks like they went back to the switching man Burton thought about it eyes the shot clock five to go well on that possession either they were in zone or they were just confused one of the two but seemed to work out well I heard a coach say once if my defense doesnt know what defense were in the offense sure as heck doesnt either first foul on kzne Fourth already on Notre Dame halfway through the second Applause frame well a big Saturday to cap off the regular season Alabama Auburn followed by Arizona and Kansas and then another Sonic Blockbuster in the ACC Duke and North Carolina in an all important rematch for the tar Hills all on ESPN Saturday afternoon Matt I think Stanford figured it out this half 4 for 20 from the threepoint line got 14 points in the paint be aggressive put your head down try to get opportunities at The Rim if you dont finish get to the free throw line Michel Shrewsberry didnt like this he thought it should have been a foul instead a jump ball and its back to Stanford your thoughts Im playing no Big East play ball play ball man good defense right there clock issue pointed out by Tony Padilla one of our three officials tonight who was the grittiest grimiest most physical player you played against in the big that comes to mind immediately Pittsburgh as a team as a the whole team the the whole team I mean yeah Carl krower Aaron gray I mean Chevy trumman look every time I went into the it was the zoo it was the real zoo back then its not the zoo anymore its its the I dont know what what youre going to call it but every time you went to the zoo that environment right there it was just they made it tough to play in Matt Schumacher Eric dindorf the Syracuse star also played in a six overtime game at the Garden that had to be a thrill well Im I guess Im biased but it was the greatest college basketball game of all time wow yeah Im putting it out there how many did you have in that game over 20 I want to say 22 the fact that you dont know the exact number all right it was 22 okay I didnt want to be that guy okay but it was 22 6 for 10 four for 6 for three hey look if you play in a six overtime game of the garden and its literally one of the best college basketball games that we will ever remember youre allowed to remember the exact score you had in that game and in Madison Square right now they have a shrine for of not not for me that would be awesome though but of a shrine for that game in particular and look you dont want to be a Yukon fan talking about that 6ot game so Im glad that we won they got some Revenge later some years with an older kembell Walker they did went on to win the national title against Brad Stevens and Micah shrewsburys coached Butler Bulldogs in the 2011 NCAA National Championship Game and look all respect to Yukon but Im just telling you right now Matt we dont spend a lot of time talking about Yukon over here all right well rightfully so rightfully so largest lead of the night for Stanford comes with eight theyre shooting four for 20 from three the first half they were more perimeter oriented the second half coach Smith made the adjustment attack the rim get the ball into Reno in effective spots by the rim and it seems to be working for it 60 Stanford run over the last two minutes Burton sitting on 17 Applause Music hako got his own Miss and put down the reload there a great foul by alako and knocking it down but thats what Im talking about with Tate Davis good job by Burton getting in the paint kicking it out if he was a confident shooter hes shooting that right away instead of hesitating and knocking it down Music Applause Benny geler eyeing the shot clock five to go geler trying to shake loose from Davis one to shoot he will not get it off great defense by the 69 Jr from Indianapolis but Dame hanging around at the under eight timeout here in South B All American candidate reigning most improved Player of the Year in the Pack 12 certainly will be an allconference player in the ACC worthy of AllAmerican status this year and it was just announced yesterday he is the scholar athlete of the year in the ACC and I look I was a Communications major hes talk he he he has e economics and math hes hes way above me computer science yeah its and hes French but speaks English fluently and he said when he came to Stanford 4 years ago he didnt speak English fluently didnt understand the language all that well a lot of growth for maxim right now over the last four years no whistle lot of contact shot clock did not reset and its a violation on Applause Stanford and if Im Notre Dame right now Matt thats what I need to get defensively I need to create turnovers try to get out and transition and get easy opportuni Stanfords done a good job of just keeping bodies in front of Burton yes hes going to make tough shots but you cant sustain a whole game playing that Applause way Notre Dame shooting 29 in this game and yet theyre within Striking Distance Burton foul called on geler that is number two and now the sixth on Stanford one more and Notre Dame is at the line for the rest of the game Burton is one of the best in the country at making you foul him great job keeping geler on his hip on his hip ball fakes pump fakes good footwork getting them up in the air creating the foul just does a great job getting to the rim getting to the paint and drawing fouls again though the free throw woes continue for Notre Dame in this game theyre now 10 for 17 from the line and you do all that work trying to get into the paint create an opportunity at the foul line you have to be able to knock those Applause down Burton top 10 in the conference in free throw attempts this year could be a factor down the stretch with Stanford hovering at six fouls Thompson was way off the mark aaral fighting for it and last touched by the red shirt freshman back to Notre Dame man they always told me if youre open theres a reason while youre wide open Jaylen Thompson take the ball get strong go to the bucket create an opportunity at The Rim Notre Dames going to take those all day Applause Music Applause Davis taking contact to foul on agall thats number two and Notre Dame into the bonus the rest of the way what I really like about Davis is he was just decisive right there he got the ball he ripped it and he attacked I think Notre Dame theyre playing too slow they have to be quicker in their decision makers one of the strongest guard forward hybrids in the conference he just puts his head down get to the rim puts that shoulder in your chest you just said the word that I think so perfectly encapsulates his game hybrid and I feel like talking to you and others thats why there is upside for him at the next level well he hes versatile on the defensive side of the floor you saw the possession where he guard giler for 8 seconds straight caused a shot clock violation the one thing that he has to have is a consistent jump shot if he gets that I think he definitely has a opportunity at the next level in the NBA MA seem righto a little bit shaken up cripping his lower back after h the deck on that rebound attempt foul on Notre Dame the teams Applause Fifth and the Third on Julian Roper so now three Notre Dame Fighting Irish players with three fouls rer mahamed and ji was barely played in this game but hes back on the floor now with those three fouls and here you see Stanford going back to perimeter or and shooting threes get the ball back in side go to what was working for you heres JY with a twoand jam and the foul grown man stuff by the Applause Junior and just a miscommunication defensively right here you see camman should have been in right there trying to get in front of ji good recognition right there by Burton finding ji and he knows what to do with it and now camon is fouled out and the foul situation becoming increasingly more dire for Stanford who again tonight is without Donovan Applause young injured his hip early in the SMU game he has been in and out of their lineup and Im not sure Stanford realizes that camon has fouled out they have not put a sub at the scores table just yet but that was the fifth on camon unless they Chang who the foul was on and right now Bert Smith is at the monitor perhaps checking to see who that foul was on initially called on camon it would be his fifth Matt this is really where it hurts not having Donovan young he was a guy that just brings versatility athleticism you can play a little bit faster with him in a lineup well now theyre going to change the foul and say it was on Ray no his second so camman remains in the game with four fouls and were being told that is the right call Benny geler pops up off the bench for Kyle Smith hes going to check back in at some point Davis the offensive rebound catch and shoot to loo Bang from downtown tied at 46 best time to get an open threepoint shot off the offensive rebound Stanford needs to go back to what was working for them get the ball inside to your best player 90 Notre Dame run and an offensive foul on Applause Music Applause Music Reno the best time to get a threepoint opportunity off Austin good job by David recognizing alako knocking it down and then alako coming down on the defensive side of the ball Reno he knows hes going to be out of control great awareness by alako dry on the Applause charge Burton trying to threat it to ji last Touch by Stanford Base Line out of bounds with six to shoot now you see ji hes in that deep corner on that last possession and REO is all the way off J can hit that corner three Burton has to recognize that and see him open in that corner into Burton with five to go defended by Blakes Burton Rams out of Jumper jaai fighting for it and a tie up its going to be Notre Dame basket ball per the possession arrow that is great effort by Kevin ji who again has not played much tonight because of the early foul trouble but you just said it right there effort thats what thats what his role is energy effort being physical being active Burton and Davis are your scores how can I make an impact on this team effort and energy and just being active AO the inbounder of fresh 20 for Notre Dame who is not LED in this Applause Music half and that is number four on Maxim Reno one of the Leagues leading scores and rebounders is now in major foul trouble with still 442 to play and again it goes back to that review of the monitor instead of the fifth foul on cam and the third foul on know which was the right call he had the charge up here and now the foul underneath and if youre Kyle Smith is it a simple decision you have to leave him in well you probably want to take him out and just leave him on the bench for at least until under the 4minute time out and and decide what youre going to do right there give him a little breather but it it was really the charge call right there yeah 72 starting from the top of the key trying to get downhill against the guard not a great decision hes picked up three fouls in the last 3 minutes and now a timeout by are you in shock that theyre leaving him on the floor with 436 to play well Im in shock that he wouldnt be have the awareness to know that he has four fouls but if Im Notre Dame right away when I get the ball on this end Im going to attack him 24 seconds away from being in that break Zone righto turn around Jay wont go and Burton the rebound not a good shot at all they missed a cutting Blakes who was wide open at the front of the rim motre Dame on an 110 run over the last four minutes to regain the lead first time theyve had it since it was 1614 and Burton adds to it give him 22 and now Matt with raino playing with four fouls hes going to be a little bit less aggressive defensively now that opens the floor up for Burton really to be aggressive in attack downhill Ager wall cant stop the bleeding theres a whistle underneath and it will go against Notre Dame that on the wrong side of in conference Play Seven single digit losses including four in the last nine and a turnover will give it back to the Irish just unforced errors right there in these last three possessions for for Stanford all perimeter oriented you see yeah just a really bad pass right there by geler and thats out of a timeout 10th turnover for Kyle Smiths team and now they need to buckle down here and get a stop youre Notre Dame youre just going back into the pick and roll every time and letting your best player make a decision he has 24 in the game 17 in the second half off the pick and roll he does such a good job job of keeping that first defender on his hip on his hip now that big fella has to make a decision do I want to come up hes going to blow by if I stay back he has a jump shot way to knock it down Marcus B way to go inside to Maxim REO that stops a 5 and 1 half minute scoring drought and now his 18th 20po performance this year every time they go inside Reno it seems like they get a bucket or they create an opportunity for the for another teammate Burton trying to draw contact wont get it fourpoint game less than three minutes to go ACC tournament seating on the line tonight for both teams and right now has matak on him he has to be able to seal and or knock it down right Ryan a but my point is if you have a Locker on you and youre 72 Center get down there Seal Get positioned so you can can get the ball back to a onepoint game 215 to play in Music regulation Davis threw it away Blakes bumping into Burton and there is no foul called and neither player frankly can believe there wasnt a foul called on the other basketball will stay here for Stanford with 20 on the timer heres another look at it you see Burton just slipped right I mean you could honestly I like it its a no call both players are going after the ball like I said Im Im old Big East guy mat so Play on Play Applause On I like that right there I I like that my man had 22 in the garden in a six overtime game lets go come on man greatest college game of all time and Im not being biased anymore less than two minutes to go here in Sou Ben final two regular season games for both teams Alo with five to shoot Gaylor heding two to shoot Alo heaving a prayer theyre going to count the basket no shot clock violation Tony Padia says that was a wild sequence not even close to the rim and it was almost tipped in by a Stanford player that would have been tragic right there for Stanford so a chance to take the lead for the Music Cardinal and right now Tay David well now you have rer guard okay jayen Blakes Ryan angerall knock it down be quiet D nor 13 for Jaylen Blakes all of those in the second half and a Time out taken by Micah Shrewsberry it has been a game of runs in the second half Stanford answering Notre Dames 130 run with an 80 run of their own ever coached and he did tell us hes a future coach he just doesnt know it yet he still has a lot of playing to go for him and but Im sure after hes all done he hell definitely have a a career of coaching its been the Marcus Burton show in the second half for Notre Dame 17 of his 24 coming in the second 20 minut and its in a foul is that the fifth on Reno no it is on Benny geler his third and two shots coming for Tay Davis who has taken 10 of Notre Dames 23 foul Shots tonight I like how Tay Davis is just being assertive and just going but he really got bailed out right there he went behind his back and just a lucky foul call right there he has to knock down these two these two free throws well Davis 6 for 10 at the line tonight Notre Dame shooting just above 60 from the stripe as a Applause team well Saturday UFC 313 is highlighted by the light heavyweight title featuring Justin gais return after his epic KO loss to Max Holloway if you like battles in the middle of the Ring make sure you tune in to UFC 313 on Saturday night those gu those guys are different they are different Im I dont want anything to do with that no I want no part Im going to watch it from my couch thats it from the safety of my own home its a different mindset right Applause there onepoint Stanford lead less than 50 seconds to go in South B Cardinal trying to win their fourth straight Applause Music Applause Blakes to sers tough turnaround jumper wont go Alo the rebound less than a second differential between game and shot clock and Micah Shrewsberry Lo uses shot clock Julian roer will inbound to Applause alako Davis corner three oh yeah Cole Serta from distance Notre Dame leads one time out for Stanford not going to use it Blakes picked CTA knocks it out of bounds and there are 42 remaining and now Kyle Smith will use his final timeout biggest shot of Cole certa young career The Freshman from LeRoy Illinois gives Notre Dame a twopoint lead just like we said M give coer to the ball how about the other guys stepping up wow Tay Davis we knew he was going to be aggressive D drew the double team and I dont know if Maxi Ray knew knew or not but Co C is probably one of the best Shooters on the floor what a big shot for the Freshman stepping up hasnt really been playing at all this year getting the opportunity because of injuries and a shot like that what it does for your confidence going forward incredible back to back games with multiple threes now for the Freshman if youre Stanford down two where are you looking with 42 to play well you obviously you have to be decisive Im giving the ball to Jaylen Blakes you want to try to get downhill if you collapse the defense get a kick out to agar wall or sers but just crash and get on the rim try to get a tip if you miss from Ray no jayen Blakes put the ball in his hands no timeouts for either team a foul by Notre aame put Stanford at the line for a one and one Blakes has 13 points in the game all of those coming in the second half Music and Cole Serta has put everybody in this building on their Music feet Benny Giller the inbounder for Stanford here we go final 42 from South B no timeouts in agar wall 3 seconds agar wall cannot do it and Notre dve survives on the threepoint shot from kerta Music
