only a program record three turnovers if they can control the basketball with their allconference level guard jayen low back at the point they should be in business Panthers going to win the opening tap low with it Panthers in their home whites and Syracuse in the road orange they come out in mantoman defense on Pits first possession of the night theyre going to attack Eddie lampin as well his size on the offensive end theyre going to have trouble guarding him on the off defensive end they want to make him guard on a defensive end of the floor spend as much energy as possible maybe even get him in foul trouble if they can yo Diaz Graham ran into that brick wall Eddie Lin missed the shot and Syracuse has its ninth different starting lineup of the Season that is the most for this program since at least 197576 oh by the way that was the first year Jim beheim was the head coach jier Davis misses in close here come the Panthers with number Zack Austin off the shot fake tried to find the rolling cam Corin but he stopped rolling yeah good look by Zach Austin thats on cam corn hes got a hes made up for it with the steal here but hes got to roll there Corin stole it from Starling who stole it right back Lucas Taylor gives it back to Starling jquan Carlos back into the starting lineup for Syracuse with Elijah Moore out with a foot injury and Syracuse is on the board first on the corner three by Starling I wonder if the adjustment your game plan not knowing that jquan Carlos is starting I think you set your ball screen defense thinking thats going to be JJ starting at the top and its not got to make sure you get out to him in a close out you dont want to get him going hes on a heater scoring over 20 a game in the last three games no Rand Pittsburgh had just the three turnovers when they met three weeks ago theyve already got two here tonight Ste by yeah just unforced no reason to force some of these turnovers here and as you saw Pittsburgh has gone back to its more customary starting lineup with Brandon Cummings coming off the bench Eddie lampin gets the roll late in the shot clock its 5 nothing or didnt want to double I I just think theyre going to have to hes patient inside hes going to back you down until you decide show your hand the guards got to dig someone has to come over and rotate they got to help on the front line thats huge mismatch for Eddie Lin inside Starling goes for the steel and forces another Applause turnover and know ones coming hes looking and reading it youve got a fake if you come too late hes already into his move there well Pittsburghs coaches spent an awful lot of time at shootaround today in how they are going to defend this man yes and again hes going to force you to help hes going to continue to dribble and attack they decided they want to go manto man and start and they repeatedly said hes going to try to get to his left shoulder which he did there and he also loves to pass out of the post and I think its a smart move for to make him a score in lock down on everyone else if you double he is a big time passer of the basketball jayen inv excuse me Im sorry Jaylen low took a shot to the face and play continued he went from our side of the court to the other side and I dont know maybe its a contact lens or something yeah so he was was trying to gather himself and finally the whistle came I think they had to get the officials attention and so jaylens going to get that contact lens fixed and in the meantime into the game young man who filled in admirably in the win over Miami Brandon Cummings Bieber Cummings was amazing I thought in the last game Saturday against Miami scoring double figures 11 points didnt force anything got pit Panthers in their offense kicked out of bounds off Syracuse pit will keep you see the numbers on Saturday and the win over the Hurricanes by Cummings and you know you look at his efficiency on the offensive end he has had a solid freshman year hes had some highs and lows hes had times where hes not been able to get off the bench but all things considered I think its been a good freshman year for cumings he has hes when called upon pun he started two games hes been very efficient in those games youve got to feel great about his future if youre Jeff capable and the highs and lows are going to come with your a freshman and hes playing behind two big time two big time guards here at pit his parents ryell and Brandy often at the games hes from nearby Midland Pennsylvania ish Leed leaves the runner short theres a rebound for big number 44 well Adrien ay has known JJ Starling since he was in elementary school coached against him when he was at Notre Dame and not until he transferred to Syracuse did Red ay realize just how fast he is with the basketball and you better Corral him in transition at his size of physicality you can do nothing but foul him if you dont off another pit turnover Carloss pass off the mark and into the Pittsburgh bench the Panthers get it back and we mention Adrien red ay year number two is head coach at his Alma moer 52yearold Harlem native he was recruited by Wayne Morgan longtime assistant under Jim baheim think R was born in North Carolina did you know that I did not raised in New York hes born in North Carolina were accustomed to hearing people like Michael Jordan and carelo Anthony born in Brooklyn but raised down south but youre saying red was the opposite was the oppos how about Applause that Starling is fouled by leet its been all orange to get things started as Pittsburgh has already committed four turnovers they have its been a defense of been the flow for the orangs to get them going here sluggish start for the pit Music Panthers four out the Panthers desperately need a winning streak that was what Joey brackets said today in our buildup to this ball game Jer Davis backing down the much smaller comings able to get to his spot and then finish on the follow you can see pit made a conscious effort theyre not doubling in a post but when Davis is on any of their guard on a switch they going to have to come and help Davis is Jer Davis is a big physical forward Pittsburgh remains scoreless jayen low remains on the pit bench after what appears to be a contact lens issue Cummings stays in the ball game on the point we also see omsa delich who also was very very good in the win over Miami and right on Q he takes it to the bucket but missed it he goes down in a heap and weve got a whistle and a foul on the rebound its going to go against Eddie lamins so impressive Saturday against Miami with his 14 points as you talked about From the Bench I mean he came in the game and was just confident from the very very beginning of the game you can see that spilling over here soon as he touches just drives it low will inbound back into the lineup so Pittsburgh will go with the twopoint guards dis legged is out of the game this is Zack Austin with the basketball as the Panthers now 0 for six from the floor and four turnovers Austin cant leave him open from there hes going to Knocked Down that shot one of the better threepoint Shooters in the ACC at Just a Touch under 40 one of the best three in defense guys that youre going to find shooting 39 on the Year got to make a decision when hes involved in the ball screen if you switch or to hedging recover if you hedge and recover you got to get home Davis now working on delich turns into the double team and the foul is called against horin I wonder Randolph at this point Pittsburgh falls behind 9 nothing as we take a look at these Zach Austin three can you see that ball screen as a hedge hes trying to recover Carlos does a good job of showing Jer Davis just late on the close out and youve got to get the Zach off again thats that overpowering a guard play and if you can pourn you got to be careful because if you rotate over theres no one on that weak side to blocks out Eddie lamin so one thing this Pittsburgh team is lacking is that true Alpha on the roster Jeff cable is talking talked about it you know last year that was Blake Hinson he actually addressed the team by Zoom a couple of weeks ago trying to get them going and you know if you dont have that where do you turn if your coach capable because you do have to self police you do have to have it from at least one of your players well its he has guys who do the work physically its just a vocal leadership that youre looking for and you know no matter what you have you cant force guys to be more vocal when you want them to be leaders that way its just guys lead in different ways but obviously having someone that kind of combines it all is ideal Chris belt Peter movich into the game for Syracuse Corin sets the screen Cummings knocks down the shot je C told us he wanted their reward these guys Cummings and delich for the Freshman for their energy and great play in Saturdays win over Miami they showing him that they theyve starting to earn the trust of their head coach Carlos Works into the corner and hes foued by Corin and so now hes got some foul difficulty not a fan of the call that was made by Teddy Valentine one of our three officials tonight Doug shs and ber Smith the others thats a big foul because hes been playing well offensively we talked about the win over Miami he had 17 points himself in a double figure game score so not only that he need him just for defense and defending Eddie lanin they need his offensive production and so he sits down with two fouls nahim McLoud has replaced lampin papa amadu kti is into the game for Pittsburgh Chris Bell from the corner for three now thats a freshman Mistake by Cummings McLoud is rolling hes not an offensive option for this team so unless hes open for an uncontested layup thats twice Panthers are late on that close out here as we have the fifth turnover here in the first half second steal for Jaquan Carlos and the senior from Brooklyn makes it a 10point orange lead and one of the things we heard during shoot around earlier today from Tim oou Pittsburgh assistant coach was when Chris bell comes into the game your antenna needs to go up Cummings didnt get the message on that last trip delich no and McLoud at 74 four with his first Music rebound Starling head up lob it toward the rim not sure if McLoud didnt see it coming or if it was just a bad pass well hes just not expecting it I dont know how you throw it over the head of a 74 Center probably JJ Starling is saying just put your hands up Bell grabs the low Miss and Starling brings it up and again the orange play without as weve got an offensive foul against movich the Orange playing without Elijah Moore who has had a nagging toe injury and so the orange bench a little bit shorter Pittsburgh also without Damian dun whose season has been put to a rest there as Mos got a walking boot they are hoping he just misses this one game done meanwhile with that elbow injury is done for the season when they got back here after their long road trip was evaluated and he will not play again for the Panthers this year Cummings a little short my stovic missed Bell who was up in the front Court by himself you talked about dami and Dunn I dont think the pit team has ever really recovered from his injury from the early part of the season when they struggled out the gate Austin blocks the shot out of bounds and so itll be Syracuse basketball we enjoy sports so much the first time they played just three week ago up in Syracuse Pittsburgh turned it over only three times theyve already got five turnovers and a Syracuse team that does not force turnovers they average fewer than five forced turnovers as Bell hits the three theyve already got four steals they have and just another basket there Baseline out of bounds execution and for Syracuse you see Chris Bale knocking down two threes for a guy thats struggled behind a threepoint line only shooting 33 after shooting over 40 a year ago great to see him knock down a couple although he has been trending in the right direction lately and again the antenna for the Defenders needs to go up when Bell is on the floor you got to know that and again great play coming out of Baseline out of bounds but You got to lock and Trail against him and force him to put it on the ground so they started the game with a 90 run this is now an 80 run as low crosses Kyle CU is just checked into the game mlau above the crowd for another rebound and thats a difficult matchup right now that y Modz Graham has to win that matchup knock down a shot get McLoud out of the pink lobin into movich hes got a huge size Advantage as well against this current pit lineup good ball movement to find Bell one more time and when hes rolling hes as good as anybody in this league shooting the basketball its a 16point Syracuse lead back to the pep in 30 seconds Music Music I expect to see pit make an adjustment with their defensive coverage right now theyre switching ball screens and Syracuse is attacking that switch here early The Bigs are getting it pitch just chasing and scrambling John qu John qu Carlos drives a close out there and finds Chris Bell for his third three here in the first half and just a stunning start here for the pit Panthers theres no answers defensively and offensively theyre theyre theyre just been really bad on the offensive end of the Florida has been contributing to this one a 90 run to start an 110 run right now for Syracuse Bells going to be called for the forearm that pushed Cummings out of bounds well Pittsburgh has lost four of five eight of its last 11 this is a team that was 12 two at one point ranked 18th in the nation and it cant be as simple as the Damen Dunn injury right no its a big part of it early on I think he was in the starter lineup he was a double digit scorer and it it made everyone elses job easier it put so much pressure now when him being out on Jaylen loan its leged him being that third guy just created opportunities for everyone else Jaylen low has his first three points for a Pittsburgh team that has not scored 80 or more since the first week of January the offense just hasnt been the same Lo its really good scored over 22 points in the first match up with these two teams and his ability to get in the pain hes got to turn it up be really aggressive here on the offensive end of the floor and create opportunities for himself and his teammates y Mo Diaz Graham gets it back right place right time for Zack Austin great pass its a Derrik witberg good alley you pass there by G Diaz Graham and P pitch is is capable of being really good defensive team and the orang has had their scoring laws as well so theyre not out of this by any stretch of the imagination Carlos has it poked away shot clock down to three cus going to have to fire no Tracked Down by Bell in side to McLoud and he has it blocked Applause away Austin thought about it now goes right to the rim draws the foul and hell have a chance for three thats a big swing there McLoud catches that at The Rim hes got to find a way to power through and finish pit defense with the block and then he come down and Zack auson splits the double team and drives takes the contact with tance in an and one here with the best saying in basketball after you get hit and finish and one and one and so Zach Austin who spent three years at High Point University who earlier in his career joined the great Shane Shane Bader as the only players with multiple seasons of at least 60 blocks and 60 made threes he was the Big South Conference rookie of the year and has been a really nice addition the last couple of years for Coach cable and his staff I I think hes a guy that youll see PL on someones roster next year one because he knows what he is 67 guy physical athletic defend every position on the floor and improved his threepoint shot so much WoW Chris Bell trying to dunk over the Defenders that goes against guo Diaz Graham and that is the teams Chris Bell known as a threepoint shoot it turns the corner and to put Diaz Graham on a poster well he has shown flashes of his athletic ability over the course of the last three years when he went for a careerhigh 30 against Louisville last year he had a chase down block that shows you he can do that he has dunked on people before it just goes away for games at a time well I I think some of the issues was just where his role was a year ago having multiple attackers a year ago that could score off off the bounce well he has certainly come with a purpose tonight here at the Peterson Event Center 11 points for Chris Bell made three threes and then those two free throws to get the lead back to 11 as you know he had Jud a year ago and he was such an offensive Force you combine him with JJ Starling that back court Drew so much attention and focus Chris bar was a recipient with a lot of Threes And like we talked about he shot over 40 off to a hot start here this first half pdy lanin back on the floor for the orange as is jier Davis working along the Baseline up and over the sevenfooter lampin on the offensive glass has it poked Away by Austin and here come the Panthers lampin gives up the foul at midcourt in an effort to stop the break other peoples hands and you want to control your own destiny this team had control now theyre outside looking in they have got to take care of business with their remaining schedule and more importantly youve got to take care of business here tonight I mean this has just been a really slow start sloppy with turnovers and theyre starting to pick things up here on the defensive end of the floor and its carrying over to the offensive Applause end well tell you what Randolph this is Saturdays mens basketball triple header on acc Network Georgia Tech and VC start the day at two Eastern followed by Chase Hunter at number 18 CL in Dallas taking on SMU and Virginia Tech Miami cap off what should be a tremendous day of ACC basketball with Randolph chis Im Doug Sherman glad youre with us here at the Peterson Event Center in Pittsburgh the orange have been in control right from the start they scored the first nine points of the game the Panthers have made a little bit of a push but Syracuse with the basketball comfortably up by nine movich will give it a shot from three and bury it and a foul on the rebound and now Teddy Valentine I believe is waving off the Applause foul hes waving off the basket no foul no foul the guys just got tangled up he tells us pits got to be more aggressive and decide how they want to defend they were originally switching the ball screens and the Syracuse were taking advantage inside that time they hedged it but let the defender get too be too deep you cant get back out to a shooter you Hing you got to get up to the threepoint line right now theyre kind of caught in between almost a slep slow a step slow and its just slugish so that movich three stands just as Ford fourth made triple of the Season Cummings with a block shot Here Comes Leed at the other end Starling got a piece of it Pittsburgh keeps control Cummings low legged around the perimeter with Austin and guo Diaz Applause grah blow the step back three youre shaking your head Rand I think he settles hes got to get in the paint create opportunities for himself hes got my storage on him get in the paint Force rotation now M storage did the right thing coming out to try and force him to his right hand cuz he always goes left and that led to the settle you think yeah hes just on the side of the floor so you keeping him out of the middle y mod Diaz Graham with another Applause rejection your pitch stop settling and get to the paint that leg it with the midrange game theyre trying to extend their pressure defensively here after made field goal just to get them going a little bit token one two two they going to fall back to their manto man and just guard a guy and defend Starin lines it up little Movic after it rips it away from Leed after glancing at Bell in the corner Starling brings it back out just under 10 on the shot clock now he finds Bell hes shot ready off the front rim Leed with Applause it itsit got to go just everybodys just kind of standing around here Leed with his second consecutive 15t jumper and the Panthers are back within eight that draws a timeout from the orange and their head coach Adrien ay who has seen a 16point lead trimmed in half Music is leged out of St Johns College High School in Washington DC going into his bag showing the uh the midrange game Randolph is not dead at all no hes just comfortable and hes just a winner I mean whatever you it takes to win thats what this leg it is and his team is flat hes missed his first four shots there gets away with a little push off going left knocks down to 17t MIDI you hes having a really nice season hes trying to join Ricardo Greer back in 2000 is the only Panthers ever in a season to average 16 points 5 and a half rebounds two and a half assists and one and a half steals per game he has gone from Sixth Man of the Year last season in the ACC to truly one of the star players he is and like I said just a really good twoway guard Davis blocked again that is Jorge Diaz Graham Syracuse has only three seconds to get a shot up Carlos puts it up Nick the iron movich comes up with it finds Bell on the perimeter he gets his shot blocked by guier mod Diaz gr delich hammered on his way to the basket a frenetic possession for the orange and Pittsburgh just piling up the block shots the activities picked up on the defensive end of the floor for the Panthers here and I think Chris Bale thought he got fouled there and just was trying to get a shot official starting let him play a little bit and delich just drives it gets the contact and gets himself to the line for two so delich the Freshman from Bosnian Herz gavina makes the front end well the number nine Tar Heels highlight our Thursday night ACC Network womens basketball double header Carolina faces Georgia wooly and Syracuse at 6 Eastern and then Carly wsel in Virginia Techo Stanford should be another great night of Hoops uncs Alysa usby injured her niece Sunday against North Carolina State dont know her status for that game but uh they would certainly love to have their top scorer top rebounder back for that game coming up on Thursday six block shots already ready for Pittsburgh at this end of the floor helping them get back into the ball game down by six much better job by pit Panthers theyre more decisive in their ball screen coverage theyre up showing at the attack point of the attack and it does not matter JJ Starling raises up and knocks knocks it down when youre struggling its great to have a guy like that you can just give the ball to get your basket around and in and a glance to the heavens by gu mod Diaz Graham thanking the man above for that bounce 3024 Applause Syracuse Starling movich gives it back to Starling frees himself for a three and hes got another one so the man who comes in averaging 25 a game over the last three is starting to heat up here late in the first when hes knocking down step back threes look out because hes big hes physical draws a lot of contact when he drives the basketball here another turnover by the pit panther yeah bad pass by low and once again a line ball turnover turned into points at the other end by the orange this time its Kyle cuff lead right back up to 11 points and thats just an unforced turnover there just sloppy ball handling by the Panthers early Applause Bell and Starling both with 11 points to lead the orange as we head not he former wake for is Peterson Event Center where Pittsburgh has been playing from behind the entire night comeback time still early here you want to close out make a run here you got 3 minutes 25 seconds left expect them to extend pressure after the free throw here after making two free throws the sophomore from Missouri City Texas takes a seat and there is some pressure here ball comes into the hands of Kyle cuff Jr back to JJ Starling dangerous pass knocked Away by Austin here come the Panthers Austin goes to the reverse you called it Randolph the pressure forcing the turnover and the Panthers are back within seven the closest they have been since 7 nothing pit just been better when theyve been active energy flying around blocking shots making deflections Applause I think they just flat on their heels early on but good opportunity there just to Ste a bucket Syracuse turnover starting to pile up after it was Pittsburgh that couldnt hold on to the basketball early two to shoot Bell takes a look at the clock and fires it up and Applause inell Chris Bell with his 43 here in the first half freshman mistake there by Del Del you got to know guys knocked down three threes VCH is yelling at you to get out in front of them contest a shot late shot clock in your late Cummings wide open missed it to the right the ball pinballs around about eight different guys touched it and weve got a foul on the floor foul got to know you got to run him off the line thats what he does is what Chris Bells known for that foul was called on Kyle cuff and now Pittsburghs in the double bonus so ish leit another one of the things he does very well 82 at the free throw line for the former Rhode Island Ram spent three years in Kingston Rhode Island where he scored nearly a th000 points cuff sits with the foul trouble between lampin and Carlos as leg puts up another perfect swish thats one of the great sounds in the world to hear a basketball go through the net like that you know it I love it got to be a basketball junk and he appreciate that another dangerous Syracuse Pass Austin was playing defensive back and they forced the turnover pit full court pressure again creating Havoc Lucas Taylor may have gotten away with a walk but he didnt get away with that 10 second call M Austin in the back line looking like a safety eight Syracuse turnover delich goes down the lane puts up a wild shot and movich clears the rebound thats a aggressive play by delich but you got to drive to pass the basketball dont always look to score Taylor slammed on the brakes and buries another three wow the orange are knocked down nine threes here in the first Music half pick you got to make aggressive mistakes on the defensive end its a lot easier for these guys to play with the lead youre going under these screens they making your pay cing under control into the lane against the big guys good move there by cumies getting in getting deep dribble penetration playing off two feet there goes Taylor after making the three drives and dishes out to Starling good box out by delich who dribbles up Music himself leg gets to the basket left it short delich for three and a foul on the rebound as Starling is hacked good possession there by pit got dribble penetration good unselfish play good look there just unable to knock it down you need more offensive possessions like that but their issues right now was guarding the basketball too much dribble penetration and rotation in their defense right now and theyre late getting Closeouts and the Orange is just hot from behind the threepoint line now delich had given Pittsburgh quite a boost in the win over the weekend against Miami 0 for four so far in this one just the two points from the free throw line seven on the timer Starling trying to go to work uses the screen from Davis missed the three myovich to Bell oh and here comes Pittsburgh with time on the clock 3 seconds two low pulls up from the free throw line a huge closing sequence to the half for the pit panthers big opportunity there for the Y you get an offensive rebound you dont hold it you shoot so do you play the numbers do you adjust your defense were going to find out or do you play the percentages saying hey we dont expect them to have another half of shooting the basketball this well but make no mistake Syracuse wants to control the paint chier Davis after a solid first half now has six points and six rebounds and the lead is nine the scary part for the Panthers is Eddie lanin hasnt been involved yet and the offense been the floor yeah had two points one rebound after having 23 rebounds just three weeks ago up at the Dome against these same pit Panthers you can saw that in the first possession there they gave the Jer Davis the 15footer because theyre worried about Eddie lamp presence inside and you can see Syracuse making a concerted effort to start on the offensive end floor going into him well Syracuse has some potential foul trouble lampin has two jquan Carlos has two fouls Kyle cuff has three fouls and theres the difference between the first game in this one so far for lamin who again was a big time focal point of Jeff capable and his staff during shoot around has Pittsburgh done a good job on him or is it the foul trouble or something Eddies not been doing its a foul trouble earlier and and the basketballs moving pitch doing a really good job of trying to the game plan was around Eddie lampin and guarding the paint and then Syracuse comes out and laces you for threes and look at what youre giving up now count the basket cam Corin called for goal tending yeah you saw the uh statistic there lamin has 11 double doubles only Cooper flag has more but Eddies got nine double doubles in Syracuses last 12 games and here just the ball coming out of the double team easy and someones got to help cam corn rotate back hes hedging the ball screen someone has to help Applause him lamin was so good the other day against Carolina ish legot with a chance for three is leged again hes knocked down a couple midrange hesitation there gets in Jer Daviss body in the fous line and one get to Y gives you a chance to communicate with coaches you get to the line and foul number two on Davis he stays on the floor and the and one is the completion of a threepoint play for Leed Pittsburgh is not handle his full court pressure well Lucas Taylor from the Corner hes one of the four Syracuse players with a threepoint make in that first half now you dont force a turnover off the pressure but you force a quick shot great reversal here Le it makes some pay the Panthers back to within five Syracuse you got a decision to make you struggled against this pressure you attack you get an open look if not run your offense Carlos with a rhythm three from the head of the key that snaps a 60 Pittsburgh run love the aggressive his body orange you dont let up teams press break the pressure get an open look you take Applause it the senior from Winston Salem North Carolina has three more Zack Austin with a dozen the offense is picking up for both teams well Jeff capable told us earlier today that Blake Griffin when he was the head coach at Oklahoma is easily the best athlete hes ever coached but he said in his seven years at Pittsburgh Zack Austin is the best athlete the Panthers have had if he can combine that with the shooting skills that weve seen he can be Dynamite Starling a around it out lucky there about a pan there too much dribble penetration low wraparound Pass Austin off the shot Ventures into the paint up and over Taylor but it rims out here come the orange back the other way Carlos with it the big fella clears some space for him now lamin takes the pass and he is fouled and if you are guo Diaz Graham youre 7 feet tall but youre only and I say that in quotes 225 what on Earth are you supposed to do to try to keep Eddie lamin from getting where he wants to go nothing he can do there just buried you can see Eddie Lin Lin Rose to row him to the rim and just posted up but again you see there the ball is just getting too deep and this is what Syracuse wants to do now Corin is going to be called for the foul thats his third and really Corin is the only guy in this Pittsburgh roster who has a fighting chance sizewise to hang with Eddie Lany you want to have Cam kin out there because if not the alternative is is Papa con hes not the offensive threat C corn is and he hasnt foul trouble has limited him tonight just cant find the Rhythm on the offensive end because hes foul trouble and that one hes frustrated but Eddie Lin is going to try to get to that left shoulder hes trying to take it away but he will spin Baseline now piit goes small with Cummings replacing Cory out of the double team ball Finds Its way to Carlos great shot fake finds Starling floating to the corner line dve three is grabbed by lanin who smartly saves it off the backside of ish leget so itll be Syracuse basketball underneath youre watching this is I I think I always say when a guy does something really well theyre superpowered Eddie Lins hands and vision is his best asset hes just so comfortable in how he needs to play uses his body really well just Shields off The Defender as he will here to get the inbound pass he was a fourstar recruit coming out of Morton Ranch High School in Houston who played for former Pittsburgh head coach for Jamie Dixon 3 years at TCU before heading to Colorado and now at Syracuse here goes lampin with five on the timer got himself under the Applause basket Starling beat the buzzer low has it poked away to Davis he attacks and misses and again Syracuse continues to impose its will inside but back the other way comes pit Cummings dump it off like it out to low yo Diaz Graham able to tap it out to Austin four minutes gone in the second Pittsburgh down by five with a basketball both teams are fighting hard giving themselves extra possessions leg it no and itll be pit basketball when we come back the panther he played here a couple of times back in uh what was it 19 19 28 and 1930 before they built what was then the brand new stateoftheart Fitzgerald Fieldhouse here come the Panthers down by two they trailed in the blink of an eye N9 nothing and theyve almost come all the way back look at the difference in their defensive pressure now a one possession game Applause Taylor quiets the zoo for now and snaps another mini run it hasnt been pretty but again the orangs arent going anywhere if you pit just continue now stay aggressive both ends of the floor theyre going to attack Eddie Lin in ball screens Applause here it is so big because again Eddie lanin is going to be in drop coverage and G OD Graham is going to have that shot all game long he needs to knock that down and again a dribble penetration and ball movement Lucas terer the number three with the three ball in the corner pocket Syracuse is already matched his season high for made threes with 11 on 22 attempts bad pass into the third row five different orange have made threes let by Chris Bell who remains on the bench he came off in the first half with a huge spark as the orange opened up what was a 16point lead at some point we talked about defensive pit did you change if theyre going to continue to shoot like this with the season on the line expecting adjustment being made maybe they got to switch five Cummings picks the pocket of lamin and then throws it Applause away sometimes in the course of a season when youre playing like this youre playing hard but theres so much on the line just want to make a play that time just a little bit too much just out the reach of low and I saw on the replay actually guo Diaz Graham was the one who poked it away from behind Starling drives on the bigger Defender Wide Open Taylor one more time strong off the back iron Pittsburgh with a basketball down by Applause five and Chris Bell has come to the scores table to check in at the next stoppage for Applause Syracuse this is where if you pit continue to move the basketball you dont have to force anything Austin able to shoot right over the top of JJ Starling who was closing out in the corner this is a great lineup for pit youre going to get a chance to put Eddie lanin in the ball screen and they got multiple guys you got a shooter in Zack Austin but the three guard lineup all can attack off the bouns to create opportunities Austin six of seven from the floor 15 points to lead pit Starling has it taken away off the steel jayen low end to end and we are tied at 51 Carl krower and the zoo love it doing it on a defensive end of the floor jayen low picking the pocket going down laying it up we have ourselves a tie ball game here in the zoo so much a game you need to win as much as you cant afford to lose it right and doesnt care how it happens just got to find a way to get a win its one point 10 points dug yourself out of a 16point ho hold here and but six weeks ago Pittsburgh was ranked in the top 20 and since that time theyve lost four of five and now eight of 11 but the season is not all lost that personal foul on guo Diaz Graham he is the second Panther to get himself into foul trouble now that is his third and the other man in foul trouble will replace him cam Corin what Edy lamin out of the game gives cam Corin a chance to play the game and not f a phys physical overmatch Eddie lamin in the post movich sets the screen for Carlos Chris Bell had the big first half now into the game and he throws it away giving Pittsburgh a chance for its first lead of the night thats a great possession there in particular The Freshman Bieber Cummings closes out forces Chris Bell the shot run him off the line a shot fake there and make a decision off the bounds which is not his strength and creates a turnover leg it to the rim Corin has to come down with it and has to throw it to Carlos jquan Carlos absorbs the contact and the foul is going to go against Zack Austin who is pleading his case to no avail to Bert Smith Austin gets the foul his second second foul on Austin A lot of times you courting in between do you keep it go out of bounds so you can set your defense hes decides to throw it in bounds andan Carlos drives it takes the contact and a chance to go to the line for two Applause Music here this is Saturdays mens basketball triple header on acc Network Georgia Tech and BC start the day at 2 Eastern followed by Chase and the 18th R Clemson Tigers in Dallas to take on the Mustangs and Virginia Tech against Miami will cap off what should be a fun day on Saturday Carlos puts Syracuse back in front with a pair of free throws you tigers with Mustangs with Clemson Tigers coming into town its a big win for them opportunity creas their resume low tough shot were tied once again at 53 three theyve done a really good job of keeping jayen low out of the paint which sometimes seems impossible not that time Carlos leaves his feet Bells open in the corner my stovich after the offensive rebound out of bounds Syracuse will keep it press the issue a little bit creating opportunities for himself and his teammates by getting in the paint doing he does m no JJ Starling on the floor for Syracuse as Carlos attacks missed the lefthanded layup Here Comes Cummings as Pittsburgh tries to take its first lead of the ball game good decision by The Freshman drive it dont force anything Cummings cant convert on the scoop shot Here Comes Syracuse quickly the other way during that last time out Pittsburgh assistant coach coach Milan Brown challenged cam Corin got right in his face I think hes trying to tell him hes got to get back and rebound of basketball hes got to get inside hes the only one that can physically match up with Eddie lamin and hes got to try to track down a couple of loose balls there theres Milan Brown the former Howard bisen and like everybody else seemingly on this staff former head coach at the division one level great staff great experience Eddie lamin with a big and one got a play through him I think if youre the orange youve done a great job you shooting the three but if you want to close this one out you got to find number 44 he just scores in a variety of ways sets the ball screen great hands great vision we know its just not much Eddie is Ley can do there being buried under the rim B number two on Le yeah the guy who sets a good screen is usually the guy gets open right and with him if you you got to help well thats their best play I think with having any guard particularly if JJ starlings whos not in the game when hes in that middle ball screen with Eddie lanin forces you to rotate low defended by Taylor now picked up by movich on the switch low wants a clear out step back with a long two that rattles out Syracuse gets the stop theyre conceding jump shots to jayen low its because hes so effective at getting in the pain and creating opportunities for others this team the other guys usually need his penetration theyve doing a really good job of conceding jump shots to him and making him beat them from three now Los only a 29 shooter from three on the season Applause Cummings gives it back to low its got to go its got to go there nothing theres no resistance there no hesitation if youre low theres zero chance of Eddie Lin stopping you off the dribble there 10 minutes to go here in the second half theres the double team pass knocked Away by Cummings Carlos Retreats and has it now Syracuse has to hurry a bit 11 on the timer movich from the top of the key Pittsburgh gets the Stop and has a chance to take the lead thats the rebound they want from cam cor just go traffic two hand Applause strong Le it and Pittsburgh has its first lead of the Applause night if you P you got to just keep back Movic coughs it Applause up Leed lobs it to the ren Corin comes down with it goes strong plus the foul cam Corin accepts The Challenge and gives Pittsburgh a fourpoint lead and this is why hes so important as you see his legged going under the ball screen you cant do that throw the numbers away when a game is on the line hes a money player but cam corn is struggled all game long foul trouble but hes a lob threat and hes his activity on the glass and around the paint creates problems for opponent hes just been slow to get in this one foul trouble hes been challenged here last TV time out and hes come out hes answering the Bell here the 610 Junior from Allen Texas spent couple of years at Florida State for Coach Hamilton was hampered last year by a broken toe but he has been really solid this year for pit his father Richard Korn was a 66 forward back in the day twoyear starter for the Georgia Bulldogs offensive rebound for pit if leot can come up with it but he cant to like the effort Balls on the floor go down get dirty dont come up with it but theyre competing over the last minute 15 Pittsburgh is outscored Syracuse 70 there the double team as they worked on it earlier today to get the ball out of the hands of the big fella inside Davis Deni at The Rim by Austin with another block shot youre going to have to give multiple efforts because youre going to have to double double Eddie lamin danger zone for Syracuse as Pittsburgh in the blank of an eye has taken a sevenpoint lead pit starting to figure things out here here in the second half theyre getting stopped the activity on the defensive end of the floor is turning in the offense pitch trying to pull away Music here is Graham I mean hes not known for a shot blocking ability Zach Austin is just doing what hes always done from that small forward position but thats what you want you dont have to be your best but they got to compete going see them try to run that middle ball screen catch Eddie Lin on that slip in the middle if youre Syracuse where does it have to come from Starling Bell somebody else on Q Bell was wide open and that snaps the 10 pit run great job by Davis attacking the switch Betty Lany trying to roll inside and you got to tag on the help leaving a weak side Defender got to figure out a way to keep the ball out on the middle of the floor basket interference coring Up Above the Rim takes away two points from low you dont mind the activity you want him active Applause Music too deep getting the ball there lampin left it short and Lin you could tell he sped up that possession because hes anticipating the double team coming theyve switched their defensive coverages all game long that time he sped up trying to beat the double team because he got it so deep the Syracuse now back in the often imitated never duplicated Syracuse two3 Zone oh Corin took quite a shot to the shoulder or neck or head inadvertent but the personal foul is indeed against Eddy lampin just catches it deep there and Lin sees jayen low coming down to help and tries to get it off quickly and fourth personal foul on Eddie lampin for the moment he stays on the floor but now nahim McLoud will take his spot with 705 on the clock big difference in lanins production three weeks later up at the Dome when Pittsburgh beat Syracuse he had 23 rebounds just a different angle tonight but the game plan was to attack him and put him in foul trouble and its work and I think its just been pit Panthers have been slowly just chopping away with this cmings driving on Bell able to finish through the contact and McLoud at 74 you want him in Stand between a ball and a basket hes weak side there and cummings The Freshman quick you see mlau coming over late hes got to get over if youre going to be late as a big man you got to block that but big time play by The Freshman draw a foul and a chance for getting the n one yes well he got the matchup he was looking for you could see licking his chops and he gets three points for his trouble are you saying you dont think he felt comfortable that Chris Bell could stand in front him I think youre on to something its a sevenpoint Pittsburgh lead and now got to be JJ starting in ball screen actions here it comes long two high up to the rim for the rebound Zach Austin whos been so good on both ends of the floor four lot of time on the clock Syracuse doesnt have to go to the manto man yet but they got to find these guards on the perimeter for pit like it penetrates Bullet Pass Austin couldnt handle it perhaps a little too hot and Syracuse gets it back great job of Pittsburgh getting the ball in the free throw line area you got to know when that ball comes that that cutter at The Rim the forwards are going to drop Applause down Carlos tried to use a second ball screen and now throws it out of bounds Jer Davis was his intended target but the pass was nowhere near got to be patient there by Carlos Ty Davis with a mismatch inside just be patient smaller defender on Applause Music Applause him you see the Pittsburg run to take its first lead of the night they were down by as many as 16 early on behind a barrage of Syracuse threepoint shots the orange has now gone more than 10 minutes since their last made three and Austin just keeps building on that lead he has hes been so good again hes just been consistent on both ends of the floor impacting the game with steals block shots and scoring Starling Bell got Music Applause it Bells been hot from behind a threepoint line all game long knocks down his 63 Applause Leed calls for the screen low penetrates still plenty of time on the timer from the logo leg it with a long threepoint Miss and Bell is going to be called for the foul great job by gam odz Graham tipping it back Cummings chasing it down just winning plays when you need it youre playing your seasons on the line you dont get the ball you dont stand and watch you chase it down good tip cming runs it Downs draws the foul on Applause Bell so its a one and one McLoud out and lampin who uh Drew quite a reaction from the zoo just now when he got off the bench will come in and play with the four fouls theres big Eddie as you can see pit counters that by bringing cam corn and smart move my alra because it affects the Ben the rotation of Panthers and here Modz Graham goes to the bench those guys both with four fouls calmly The Freshman from Lincoln Park High School with a couple of free throws he has now put together backto back really nice Games Starting against Miami coming off the bench here tonight against Syracuse Starling uses the screen from lampin an empty trip for the orange and now Pittsburgh can take its time up by eight hit lucky that time both Defenders went with my storage inside left JJ starting wide open coming off the pin down unable to knock it down and take advantage of it Austin why not a rare Miss for number 55 in white he has been so good tonight Applause Movic to lampin and hes fouled looked like it was before the shot Austin got him up top as they sort it out well take a break with 345 on the clock Pittsburgh i said before cam corn has four hes only got three guo Diaz Graham Zack Austin they all are playing with three fouls here in the final 3 40 of Applause Regulation Starling spins leg it recovers makes it a tough shot great possession there Chris Leed keeping JJ Starling out of the paint its a big time its a must if you want to beat Syracuse and he did a really good job there he rejected the ball screen keeping the ball in front more importantly securing the rebound B finishing possession how do you attack the Zone CC Zone you want to get it to that free throw line bell with a basketball orange down by eight you dont have to have a three but you got to do something basketball get it inside to Eddie lamin he starts from 15 ft away from the basket starling Tri to force that pass in and Movic could not handle it this is where Syracuse gets into trouble because theyre so relying on JJ Starling to create everything thats a play youd like to see Eddie Lampton try to finish turnover number 14 committed by the Applause orange Cummings a clean look from the left side off the back iron long rebound comes out to and they reset the shot clock to 20 Adrien ay calling for his team to come out defensively low just goes right to the bucket drops a dime from behind his back and Corin able to lay it in custom to see it from jayen low just getting in the paint creating Havoc forcing rotation dropping dimes or scoring and wont find one any prettier than this split to help Laser It Off nothing cam Cory can do but finish that great find great pass and even better finish we were talking earlier today Randolph is jayen low going to find his way onto the all ACC first team second team hes fifth in the conference in assist per game averages 16 and 12 points per game thats ninth best in the league hes number seven in steals per game do you think he makes his way onto one of those teams I I I dont I think that league is I think the easiest year to vote for All Conference I dont know how its its I think its Cooper flag Player of the Year you wont get much arguing from that Maxim Marinos first team I think Chase Hunter Chucky hurn and Hunter Silas in any particular order you want to put him I think those five guys are all conference players and so I dont know how you take them off youve got low and Leed yes do either of them make the second team I think they do I think one of those guys will make second team I mean Lowes deserving of hes been hard and soul to this and where would this team be without is leage leadership and I know for sure one of them if not both of these guys will find themselves on second team pit with still a lot to play for and theyre playing like it here in the second half Austin the assist from guo Diaz Graham and Austin showing off the Hops we talked about how how athletic he is and he showed you right there break the pressure there help break it to give and go great job kicking it in the stands giving us a chance for the replay to talk about it now he commits the foul hes been a defensive Menace three block shots three steals to go along with the 19 points look at him look at this showing you why Jeff Cel said hes the most athletic player that hes had here for the pit Panthers he just made himself a player really improved his jump shot shooting just under 40 oh no and now for tonights player of the game brought to you by Continental Tire and indeed its the young man from your neck of the woods out of Winston Salem prep he Applause is didnt shoot the ball as well as he did year year ago hes always been a great athlete really good Defender his improved jump shot and and a true knowledge of understanding who he is and how he needs to play a Young Man will earn himself a lot of money playing this game hes the definition of a three and D guy right he is he is his versatility on the defensive end of the floor is why hell make a lot of money play low breaks the pressure a minute 30 to go yeah good luck trying to press him movich whistled for the blocking foul now the folks here at the peak can exhale they start to sense this is going to be a Pittsburgh win that is for their hope gets things trending back in the right direction on Saturday pit snapped its fourgame losing streak with a win here over Miami they did that without jayen low who was in concussion protocol but they have now put themselves in position to stay in position if you know what I mean and great gamble by Jeff cable I mean jayen low had participated in shoot around that day and was close to coming back but had he pushed the needle and had any setbacks he would have automatically missed this game they came out and those guys played really well I thought it was probably their best allaround team effort missing their leader mhm they were able to get that win against Miami and now slugish first half to come out second half and take care of business at home and keep their post postseason hopes aive well they have shot much better this year at home that did not look to be the case early tonight but it has borne itself out in the second half and that combined with a really good defense that has put the brakes on a Syracuse offense that was flying high and the Panthers looking to run some clock timeout called by coach capable as as Austin was bottled up along the sideline and the Panthers is not the team you want to fou shooting 79 so a lot of guys that can make free throws yeah thats 10th best in the country tops in the ACC as you mentioned Randolph at 79 once again our Continental Tire player of the game Zach Austin doing it at both ends for Pittsburgh he has here running the floor finishing theyre driving with the n one but its just into the floor hes just been great all year defensively and his improved jump shot made him such a valuable player for the Panthers and running the lane finishing and kicking it up in his stands giving us a chance to show the replay as why hes the player of the game and want your best players playing the best basketball late in the season and hes been really consistent I thought he played well earlier particularly in the first half when Pitch struggled out of the gate and with his performance tonight Zack Austin certainly has done his late mother Cynthia proud he wears the number 55 to honor her memory she died back in 2017 at the age of 55 her son has done good again here tonight for the Panthers low is fouled hes a big reason why shooting percentage for the Panthers is so high hes shooting 86 hovered around 90 for most of the year its not the guy you want to put at the line yeah fourth in the league currently coming into the Knight and its been an adjustment for him this year not having bub Carrington the back court he has so much more responsibility that at times at least early in the season perhaps it was too much for him well I think he made too much of it I think trying to fill those shoes and they compliment Each Other Well he was a big part of that turnaround buff struggled as well and then he came into the lineup and then they both just flourished and then thats where the daming and done injury is hurt Pit because he was a guy that took some pressure added responsibilities from low and when he went down I think lean and low felt as though they had to do too much and I think it hurt the Panthers at Music times off the F Miss Syracuse will keep underneath 44 seconds remaining in regulation we will get you to Virginia Tech Boston College just as soon as we wrap things up here in Applause Music Pittsburgh Bell leads Syracuse with 23 points leads all scores but the Panthers have had multiple weapons here in the second half low Leed Austin all in the high teams legats got 18 Lowes got 17 Austin 19 Cummings as well Has Come Off the Bench with 10 points this team is starting to figure things out because again we talked about Dela Lon coming coming from the bench cable didnt hesitate to put those guys in early Austins been consistent all game long and held it down until Leed and low started to figure things Applause out Jeff Cables team about to improve to seven and eight in the ACC and 16 and 10 overall with what will be a quad three win so it wont enhance their net which was 51 at the start of the night but theyve done no damage no theyve got to get ready to take this show on the road after backto back home wins they go to South Bend play Fighting Irish next and I tell you what of those double figure scores theyve all delivered in the second half since the break leg at 12 Austin 10 low 10 and thats the way pit has to play share the basketball move the basketball and its helped Leed getting low because they dont have to feel as though they got to carry this team on the offensive end they dont have to take four shots cam kin struggled early with foul trouble but Cummings for this freshman this back toback double figure game for him with 11 against Miami and 10 here tonight well a typically Pittsburgh struggling here late at the line fortunately for them the outcome of the game is not in doubt at this point legot gets one out of two he and Austin both with 19 Applause points Starling back to Carlos around it out Le it with the rebound and that will do it valid effort from the orange unable to continue the hot shooting streak behind the threepoint line but youre p
