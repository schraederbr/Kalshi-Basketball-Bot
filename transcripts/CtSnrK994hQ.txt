CC but theyve got a veteran team Couture mutts feels like they played a lot of basketball for the Hokies theyve got five scores on the floor Virginia Tech is a rhythm offensive team Duke has to get tips deflections and be disruptive and dictate with their defense tonight Applause white the Hokies in the orange back door Lively gets us started well you cant draw it up any better than that to start the game nope twonothing Duke and the emergence of Derrick Lively felt on the opening basket the matchup to keep your eye on early as Tyrese Proctor right here on Hunter couture couture has made 12 triples the last two times theyve played Duke John Shire doesnt want that to happen tonight shot clock inside a 103 ball away and good for Edmond Oklahoma sophomore Sean Padula and I will say duke will switch one through five with Derek Lively playing the five position medulla had been just five of his last 20 from behind the line but puts the Hokies in front on the first swing Duke is so good with their spacing and they are really starting to play like a connected team bazilly hand up but philipowski rims out a three Virginia Tech took a sixpoint loss to Miami on Tuesday night hits a seven of 22 from behind the line and only 42 percent from the floor MJ Collins The Freshman follow away on Mitchell Virginia Tech doesnt go to the glass and they usually send one and a half theyre more worried about getting back and setting their defense and trying to get an old board you see that Virginia Techs looking for their first winning cameras and so seven Duke trying to stay unbeaten at home and the followed by roach puts him on the board the matchups here tonight Debbie especially at distance seem to be really fascinating yeah I think theres so much scoring on both sides of the ball here and for Justin mutts hes got to be aggressive tonight Lively is going to sit and drop coverage hes going to stay back and protect the rim they want to pull him out of the paint if they can here the Doula kind of backing down roads and a Fall Away Applause roach and philipowski are so good in that drag action Proctor has really emerged you know John Shire told us 70 percent of their uh sex from the point guard are run by him now roaches more playing on the wing Mitchell draws the foul with the pump fake in traffic a couple of free throws coming for the Freshman from Kansas City Kansas and thats one of the things West that has changed about Dukes team is that Proctor on the top of the floor roach more on the wing as Proctor got more comfortable running the offense Jeremy roach is really good playing on either side and hes very good at attacking Closeouts on skip passes and plays that he can get to the paint foul on mutts Mitchell knocks the free throw down and there is the fourth year head coach 58 year old Mike Young who grew up in Radford about 15 minutes away from Blacksburg his dad Bob was a Music very popular figure in his life and a guy who is familiar and of course he came back home in essence to coach Virginia Tech after an incredible run at Wofford he wore number five at Emory and Henry there we go a couple of free throws for Mitchell Applause medulla thought about it now cuts it Loose Padula usually does not hesitate on that but that was philipowski lurking with that seven foot frame on the switch Proctor trying to beat Collins Couture right now gotta find him dont you Debbie number one the guy 71 thats why hes shooting better than 60 from the floor a lot of plays like that fivepoint lead for Duke look at Mitchell he can dig and help because hes got the Collins match up much turns over Lively rebound phillipowski attack getting nothing no thats a really tough contested shot Mitchell left hand I mean Mike young doesnt typically call timeouts in this situation early in the game because he trusts his veteran guys Applause the silly has been very quiet early must spinning against Proctor Collins sets fires its partially blocked Mitchell 80 run by the Blue Devils roach on the drive scoop wouldnt go Dola trying to race to the rim against Lively misses how about kicking on the best shot Blocker in the ACC philipowski an offensive foul see and thats why Mike young doesnt call timeout Dukes got a seven point lead hes waiting for the under 16 timeout Applause Music presented for you by Wendys first half in Cameron and watch this play by Lively okay hold it right here hes going to set the screen and then hes going to slip watch what happens to basily he doesnt stay attached so that it leaves the space wide open for lively to get to the bucket and everyones cleared over its a twoman game on a two side and it is an easy Deuce for the Blue Devils Debbie we saw John Shire in their walk through this morning do a lot on the ball screen action if not adjusted the wing but also at the top two as part of what their normal offensive package looks like 100 and the Duke spacing is getting better their cuts are getting sharper the timing and rhythm is good and thats what Virginia Tech has always been good at theyre a very good Rhythm offensive team no changes for the Hokies so Couture and heres Collins again with Billy and mutts Dukes still on that 80 run Padula tries to snap it cannot Mitchell had a hand on it but silly touched it last since John Padula is fearless when it comes to attacking on the offensive end and a couple of times hes gotten that switch with philipowski Music hes got to be able to make a really good decision with that switch Oak is missed their last seven shots from the floor heres roach a little step back too strong and Padula the rebound for the Hokies Duke was nine of 23 and the Blacksburg meeting between the two schools from behind the line meanwhile mutts and the Hokies were 10 of 19 as Justin muskets on the board snaps snaps the Blue Devil streak of eight in a row thats a really great adjustment by Mike Youngs Club see Justin mutts that time is so much more aggressive look where Lively is under the basket when mutts catches it pull Lively away and the only way youre going to do that is to get him to get much to be able to be aggressive whats a 63 free throw shooter hes the third best field goal shooter in conference play in the ACC but he can only get the two points on the threepoint try roach against Couture theres Lively again trying to help see look where basily is this time right this time he stays more attached he doesnt let him slip four to shoot Mitchell strong move couldnt finish Proctor follows Tyrese Proctor has been plus nine assists the turnover ratio last four games well he and Rose did not turn it over at all in the Louisville game and now philipowski is steel and the big fella finishes It Off Music has a little rumbling stumbling on that steel Applause I dont know I thought he moved pretty good for seven feet and 2 30 and theres an offensive foul on the screen and its against Couture Applause Music this is a flat lateral pass with nothing on it philipowski great anticipation Music thatll be the easiest bucket hell see in a long time Applause roaring because the legendary Blue Devil Grant Hill whos in attendance here tonight theres Ryan Young who came into the ball game during the pinball along with Jacob grandison Dukes bench Wes best in the league 205 points a game so productive like the rest of the team feels like theyre getting better Baseline Collins into the corner and this is rice Rodney Rice playing in just his third game of the year injuries have sidetracked the DeMatha freshman and theres a three ball from grandison timeout Mike Young yep Grant even nods his approval Applause heck of a run nine nothing run by the Blue Devils earlier look how wide grandison runs the floor he gets to the break at the three he looks for rebounders why not and Grant Hill says pretty good thats terrific that is terrific Blake Couture sneaks Baseline first casket for Hunter Couture really good look good back door thats what you want to do against the Duke pressure theyre playing up the line theyre overplaying hooks had an eightnothing run a nine nothing run theyve hit their last four shots heres young working inside on Lynn Kidd and that one rolled off the front rim I mean Ryan Youngs only shooting 72 percent from the floor and ACC play he usually doesnt miss those Collins now heres rice long three from the front good Rodney Rices first three of the year he was coming back from injury Debbie then missed 10 games with a finger came back the other night played 11 minutes against Miami and now a three ball Off the Bench got 11 minutes in the Miami game hes just gonna work himself into game reps Proctor gets the friendly bounce Music Debbie why is Dukes Improvement almost Tethered to Tyrese Proctors Improvement you think just because of the way he handles the ball I think confidence I think he can guard multiple positions hes got Couture last game they played roach had Couture I think his defense has gotten better his understanding of playing the American game right its a little bit different a little bit more physical a little faster he certainly has made the adjustment basket for facility hell shoot free throws when we come back Rodney rice a three off of Mike Youngs bench and then Tyrese Proctor answers at the other end for the Blue Devils Duke by 10 at Cameron advice for it shes got logo range she leads the nation in assists she averaged 27 points a game she is must see TV she is an exciting player with a high IQ who loves playing with her teammates should be a great game tomorrow me all that in the Big Ten huh and the ACC Showdown with Louisville and Notre Dame yeah I mean that game went to overtime the first time and Olivia miles hit up shot to win the game at the buzzer I think Louisville will be ready to go at home in the Yum Center thats a tough place to win Duke said five of their last six on the floor theyve got a nine point lead pair of runs here in the first nearly nine minutes of spark John shires Club roach trying to get some help from Young philipowski splits a double team tough shot off the glass rice ultimately Corrals really good defensive effort by Mike Youngs team coming off the timeout High hands closing out keeping the ball out of the paint Youngs gotta hope his teams calm down there for their last five from the floor after a one of eight start here tonight thus the nonpoint deficit you remember one of the things coach young told us before the game the more sides they get wow Rodney rice and one goodness how about Rodney rice the more sides they get the better their opportunity and percentage of scoring this is on the filipowski switch the concentration to finish now hes going to the line for a potential fourpoint play second on philipowski by the way and here is rice and these are his first free throw attempts of the year his second and third field goals of the year have come in this first half with a pair of threes and Virginia Tech just Trails two possessions here roach trying to create some distance and it rattles in second field goal for roach and Jeremy roach now running the point with Proctor on the bench this is part of the versatility and the emerging Trend about why Duke is getting better and Lynn Kidd had to dunk rattle out eightpoint lead for the Blue Devils Whiteheads been quiet from a scoring perspective Tariq averaging almost 10 against the league Music roach lobs and loudly dunks so smart he reads that second level so well with the ball in his hands ten point lead again on four in a row by the Blue Devils thats three dunks for lively good sets the screen rice on the pocket pass and now Couture or Padula inside kid recovers and scores second and third effort pays off for Virginia Tech Applause Music heres Whitehead and now rice in Virginia Tech trying to go the other way mutts oh rice is going to be feeling pretty confident here now David yeah and I like him with a ball in his hands he gets Padula off the ball hes a terrific shooter goes away maybe feeling a little too confident hes changed kind of the temperament of what theyre doing it looks like offensively and roach will be fouled by kid on the drive itll be the third on Virginia Tech and the first on the Clemson transfer from Gainesville Florida draw help leave it at The Rim really good read by Jeremy roach and a great finish by Lively Music well go to the line to both their free throws earlier with Mark Mitchell the Blue Devils 75 and a half percent in conference play theyre just seventh in the ACC five down for Roach Music seven double figure games in the last eight for the Junior from Leesburg Virginia hes had 20 or more four times and the second one bounds away heres Padula in the Hokies rice came out of the lineup by the way Couture has come back onto the floor with Collins kid and mutts and Proctor stole it from Couture three on one Proctor the layup anytime you put the ball through your legs from Back to Front you bring it right to the defense and thats exactly what Couture did there it was an easy pick for Proctor what a great defensive play freshmans got seven Applause now we got a foul off the ball and Couture is down were gonna have to look at this and theyre sending the teams to their respective benches here Music and its an 11 point lead the foul is on grandison itll be his second its the fifth on Duke here in this first half but the details are at the monitor with Clarence Armstrong and Ted Valentine having a look Debbie foreign thats what you call uh bumping the cutter but its a displacement of the cutter so Ted Valentine and Clarence Armstrong now in conversation with Jeff pond and well step aside at Cameron Duke by 11 when we come back Debbie this has been upgraded to a flagrant one on Jacob grandison I I think if you look out of the corner of your eye Granderson sees him come in and it gets upgraded because its excessive or unnecessary and avoidable that would be the language that the officials would use on whether they upgraded to an F1 or not so well have free throws with 802 here to go for Virginia Tech and there is the most outstanding player of the ACC tournament a year ago in Brooklyn Hunter Couture he had 31 points including seven of nine threes in the ball game at Barclays Center to beat Duke by 13 and win Virginia Techs first ACC Championship and Couture is a 72 frequency thats his third point he is uh Applause as the second one goes down quick reminder to you Saturday Primetime presented by John Deere is in Spokane number 15 Saint Marys and number 12 Gonzaga tonight Bella Sean Farnham at the kennel to see if the zags can claim the West Coast Conference I will say Marys won the first one and everybody knows about Drew Timmy but I want you to keep your eye on Logan Johnson the point guard for Randy Bennetts Club Music second on lively on the drive by basily Aidan mahaney was the star for Randy Bennetts team in the first one but Johnson in The gales are more than welcome to the kennel tonight Donalds our coverage here from Cameron basily from Cameron to the kennel you cant get much better in college than that in college basketball yeah terrific game out there tonight with Dan Jay and Sean on the call for you at halftime well see Reese Davis Seth Greenberg and Sean Farnam are Jeep halftime report you know Reese and I were talking about the Davenport I wonder if he got the Sean Farnham Brad Music with that that means great yeah the ball got knocked away Proctor controls it for the Blue Devils with 15 to shoot here into the corner Roach nice drive but silly went down under the basket but I think roach would have been um scums to his third field goal seven points for Jeremy roach thats what Im talking about with him on the side of the floor attacking the closeout medulla fighting for space scores on a soft turnaround five for Sean Padula feels like Virginia Tech in order to get any closer Debbies going to have to attack somewhere from long range s tomb and Padulas one thats it thats it right facility hasnt gotten been able to get going yet either yep hes been their best player in the last nine games hes been averaging 22 points Proctor a three box out clean from basili pokies Trails seven under seven to go mutts on the perimeter a little crossover in traffic and couldnt finish it ever since that timeout Mike young called Justin mutz has been looking to put it on the deck and get to the hoop Music a little mouse in the house action turn cant finish over the top of Padula who had fallen feels like the Hokies might be given a window here but see if they can take advantage of it now Collins mutts tees up a three Applause Virginia Tech is fighting it on the perimeter not many attempts they do have the three hits Music Young trying to square bazilly heres Mitchell for three seven and a half for Mark Mitchell just his 16th three of the Year Debbie I was here when Mark Mitchell hit V3 to beat Notre Dame and I learned that that week he spent countless hours of the gym making 100 Corner threes on both sides leading into the Notre Dame game wow if he can add that consistently to his game thats another weapon and mutts off the nice bounce pass four points for Justin mutts Music eight point Duke Lee coming up on five to go in this first half foreign traffic Mitchell Jeff Pond will say before the shot Hal on the deck will be the fourth on Virginia Tech and itll be on MJ Collins its a really good cut young going oneonone inside mutts over helps but the analytics would tell you pitch on Mitchell until he consistently hits the three and then a nice drop down pass by Vasily to mutts Blue Devils turn it over on The Possession out of the foul Music philipowski playing with two fouls Padula deep three yeah each time hes got that matchup hes trying to shoot over the top of philipowski right yeah I dont think you want to dribble into a ball screen or a dribble handoff to get the switch back you want to take him off the bounce heres Whitehead setting and scoring 33rd three for Tariq Whitehead is his first point of the game Debbie when hes 100 and healthy yes I think hes a handful I think thats why he is the disrupter he can Elevate their play to the next level butts inside will score cleanly again great screen by Couture inside Music still a nine point game under four to go Music here is Proctor trying to reroute lost his balance now Philip powski on the hard drive Music seven to shoot for Proctor Padula and young was bumped out of there by basily and that will be his first five on Virginia Tech pokies are rolling the ball around the perimeter and getting some baskets out of it Debbie you love the ball movement you love the switching of the sides of floor Music great screen by Couture frees up butts inside Music ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Wendys two for six dollars the best deal in fast food Justin Hardy was a division three basketball player at Washington University in St Louis and he and John Shire became connected and as did the Duke staff with Justin Hardy and you saw the note at the bottom in late May Justin Hardy lost his battle with stomach cancer and passed away well in kind of an enduring connection Debbie that is Justin Hardys family and friends today and they were at the shoot around this morning and those are Duke jerseys with the number 12 on them to honor their late son and God what an unbelievable commitment by johnshire and his team to maintain that connection in such a tough time for their family and that program I guess well Duke is a special place and John understands that and he and his wife like coach shishevsky and Mickey have and their families have embraced the Duke childrens hospital and I think he understands his power and his gift and he shares it sure does and Bob and Karen Hardy his sister Jackie brother Nathan our thoughts and prayers continue to be with you in the memory of Justin there is a foul on Ryan Young Music man thats seven on Duke so 11 in the final 308 Music all right John Shire and 35 years of age from Northbrook Illinois you were talking we were talking about this this afternoon hes done a phenomenal job in just the way he sets up and calls the game for his team better especially in the second half of his offense is in front of him but he invited me to practice yesterday so I got to come over here and spend some time and uh I mean its its quite a clinic you know for a basketball Junkie like me and to be in here and to listen to coach Shire and his staff go through Scout and areas of improvement that theyre working on well you dont have Derek Lively I heard his voice on the back row calling out defense I mean John said hes the got the best freshman voice that that he has had here uh just the the different schematic ways they go about thinking about how to guard ball screen defense its really amazing and Im really grateful that I got invited he uh hes done a really really nice job in the stair steps of the Improvement this basketball team has seen as it works its way into late February for sure Whitehead hard drive to the basket Mitchell will follow a Miss look at that sequence right there freshman freshman freshman Lee has nine and Mitchells got nine and unselfish yep turned down a good shot for a better shot they go with the Iverson action here and they love this pin down for Couture hes not been able to get that play yet coming off that curl off that pin down nice bounce pass belliger Poteet had it blocked by Young three on the shot clock right back to Poteet again he couldnt finish hit the rim bounces away so the young man playing close to his home in Reidsville North Carolina the transfer from Rice had two good looks couldnt crack it and roach answers at the other end well youre feeling confident if youre going to pull the trigger on that wow 11 point lead now for Duke back into double figures creating separation off the bounce Music trying to find a crease as they roll off the iron final 90 of this first half at Cameron Music heres Proctor Victoria does such a good job guarding young out of a double team in the corner Whitehead squares but Doula now with just better than a minute to go feels like Virginia Tech trailing 11 needs something to take to the locker room I mean Dukes defense has been terrific right has been disruptive it has kept them out of rhythm theyve been physical on cuts that that messes up your timing 37 in the first half theres mutts on the drive and a blue devil timeout Justin mutz has eight but John Shire wants to talk to his team and Florida State Devin Cambridge and Matthew Cleveland I offer you the Jeep halftime report Debbie oh yeah the guys are gonna have fun breaking that down holy smokes how about this right here good time out by John Shire I think you can get a two for one here so lets see if they can score quickly since theres 43 on the game clock 30 on the shot Music roll thats what theyre trying to do a quick hitter right here Roach good help Papa silly heres Mitchell into traffic scores with 34 seconds left and so what Grandpa silly does is he takes his time inbounding it so that they dont get a chance for a two for one nice smart medulla and the Hokies try to get something going to the locker room here para threes its basily for a triple roach will heave it from threequarter court and the Blue Devils take an 11 point lead to the locker room they are guarding and Cameron tonight but theyre scoring it as well Blue Devils by 11 its the way they delivered in the first half Ill tell you what the blue Devils impressive too they held Virginia Tech Debbie to 379 percent the Hokies got three threes of their 11day field goals and theyll have the ball here to start second half Justin mutz was very aggressive in the first half I think he needs to continue to look to get to the pain and see Mike Youngs going to isolate him on a first play in the second half down on lively and one for mutts wow lets take a look at the game time moment brought to you by Guinness see the first half of the January 23rd ball game and the results tonight in the first half for mutts and the Hokies the threes the seven threes in the first half in Blacksburg only three here tonight but they do get a threepoint trip to start half too dude trying to get a split in the regular season did he attack won that game in Blacksburg philipowski picked up two fouls and only had one field goal remember that was that link to the floor dunk for his only points in the opening 20 and now here is Collins scooping up a deflected ball in the backcourt with 15 to shoot all a part of the defensive game plan tips deflections disruption breaking the Virginia Tech rhythm Padula and it wouldnt go down for him not many easy buckets for Virginia Tech right everything contested roach kind of winding through the lane and then nearly turned it over somehow saved him maybe twice Music Proctor back for roach tend to shoot heres philipowski look at the quick double and theres Lively wow thats a part of the game plan to bring the double like that facility left Lively wide open under the basket I mean you may want to you know change how you bring the double if you bring it but that left Lively wide open even though if Mike young wanted to do that that was not a good play drive for Collins is MJ Collins first point of the game yeah I think coach young is waving off the double right now telling everybody uh stay with your guy Music the roach over the top of the phillipowski screen Jeremy roachs first triple of the night hes got a dozen Debbie Music 11 point lead where it stood at the break for the Blue Devils basilia spin heres Proctor Music Mitchell hard drive against basilian scores 13 for Mitchell hes LED Duke and scoring twice this year its been scoring tonight hes been aggressive off the bounce John Shire told us the last time we were here he just wants him to play Dont think just play use your instincts as a basketball player hes doing that tonight absolutely 13point advantage Music foreign ago they spread the floor so well heres philipowski on the drive and mutz will pick up the foul looked like Virginia Tech did call off that double that cost him a moment ago yeah now watch basily right here hes going to come and double look what happens to Lively he is wide open he goes right to the bucket are all his baskets dunks tonight pretty much Music Im not sure uh facility was supposed to double then Collins was supposed to drop down and take care of lively on that play at The Rim foul was on mutts it was his second free throw by philipowski rolls away and you know what Wes this is what Im talking about with Coach Shire being a really good play caller he was trying to get philipowski going right to your point about only having one basket right hes their leading scorer hes been their leading scorer most of the season Music its the quality of the catch fulfilled housing because you can put him anywhere he can score down on the Block he can score from three hes a really good picking pop guy he does a really good job with his footwork and getting his hips around physical seven foot 230 pound guy theres Padula trying to hit the tour and Proctor got a hand in the passing Lane itll stay with Virginia Tech with 15 to shoot on The Possession the Hokies are the second best field goal shooting team and ACC played almost 47 percent its not going that way tonight with as well as duke has played defensively oh and Hunter Couture has not even been able to attempt to three yet which would be part of the Duke game plan run him off the threepoint line and theyve done that very well Applause was at the top of the scouting report for sure Music under roachs delivery so it will go back to Virginia Tech on the Duke turnover third Turner with a knight for Coach shires play Debbie its the one thing youve talked about with Duke the Improvement coincides with this so when they played on the road at Virginia and at Miami they turned the ball over a combined 43 times in the last three games Duke is averaging nine turnovers a game the other thing is the Virginia game 24 personal fouls Virginia shot 22 free throws in the last three games theyre averaging 10 pounds and 10 free throws for the opponent oh facility caught filipowski Music so the foul on the silly his second its the second of Virginia Tech and our officiating crew Clarence Armstrong and Jeff pond have gone to the monitor phillipowski up and talking to long time Duke trainer Jose Fonseca we step aside at Cameron blew it up well return that if you want yes theyre gonna overturn it that is exactly the right call because watch right here philipowski is in basilis cylinder so you can go to the Monitor and reverse this call its a good job by the officials its unfortunate that philipowski got hit in the face but this is the officials adjudicating the rule the way it was written so its the third on philipowski and its the first on Duke so Debbie lets kind of outline it used to be called the principle of verticality right and typically it was used in you know goaltending baskets going to the ceiling Arenas and things like that right and now were talking about players defending other players yeah its an off its a rule put in to protect the offense right I mean he didnt have room to Pivot right I like the rule I like the call tried to dump it inside out heres philipowski and thatll be a block on Rodney rice first on the Freshman from Clinton Maryland third on Virginia Tech and Chris Carroll and Clarence Armstrong our nose to nose at the Duke bench after this moment or two what about Philip house gets seven foot with a little spin move in the middle of the floor I love it roach a triple Applause team for Roach Virginia Techs got a lock in on the defensive end right now they got to see if they can get Couture going absolutely hes got a field goal and two free throws and there goes mutts to the basket a Blue Devil foul on Mark Mitchell one of the things that Hunter Couture does so well is move without the ball John Shire told us today he thought he might be the best in the league and he changes the space on the floor whether he scores or not because you have to guard him and Duke is elected to face guard him look at Lively switch off to Couture hell take it on the drive had it knocked away well by Design heres Rodney rice Debbie out of time out front basily with the shot clock going to zero a rebound and a foul will be tagged to mutts itll be his third and the fourth of the half on the Hokies by Design without Sean Padula on the floor Hunter Couture is getting in that switch with Derek Lively see that time he tried to take him to the basket where Padula was setting settling for jump shots right Music Blue Devil lead is seven almost five minutes into the second hand Music deflected by rice heres Proctor with 10 to shoot left corner another three from Rhodes that did that get touched I dont think so it hits side of the glass heres Proctor with the clock winding down double figures for Proctor on his second three of the night and its a 20point Blue Devil lead theyve had an 80 run a 90 run and now a 120 run look at this how do you know its your night when you save it from going out of bounds and knock down a triple blue Devils a big leaded camera institution they ended up playing a secret game and NC Central won the game and it just shows you just how much basketball and how much impact John McClendon had I believe it was a Sunday morning when everyone was at church right yeah was that here over here at Durham it was in Durham the game was played in Durham yeah and the medical school students were all former highlevel college basketball players its just an amazing piece of black history involving basketball in the state of North Carolina and of course the Legacy that John McClendon left in basketball in this state is remarkable we got to meet him once what a gentleman Nate Smith Hall of Famer amazing amazing contributor and Coach to the game whose influences are still filmed by the way 20point lead for the Blue Devils roach on the drive rejects the screen straight line drive to the basket Applause Grant Hill likes it even like that grandison three he saw in the when he first got comfortable tonight on the bleachers here at Cameron 22point leader hes been great trying to take Couture and draws the foul Music I mean that is really good defense to get that steal by Mitchell hes going on Couture fifth on the hookers both sides of the basketball right yeah turnover by Couture and Mitchell draws a foul start to maybe and use hit on this at the top about the characteristics of each of these young guys and heres the way the standings look Pit by the way beats Syracuse Miami lost on the Cleveland heave you see Virginia who preceded our coverage here tonight lost in Chapel Hill what a final week of the regular season its going to be in the ACC ENT mind you that Miami and Pitt play next Saturday night six oclock on acc Network in Coral Gables their first meeting was terrific the Panthers edging the canes at the Peterson Events Center theres all kinds of styles of play in this league and It prepares you for postseason I remember last year before today the league was down right West and then Miamis in the elite eight and Duke and North Carolina are in the final four and Carolinas playing for the title we were here 51 coach Ks last game and Duke was kind of the given in the tournament and they made it all the way to New Orleans as did Carolina but so there were three teams in the elite eight theres Padula a little Lefty scoop third field goal for Sean Purdue that was an incredible night being here on Coach Ks last night North Carolina fans remember it well yeah Music dude goes to their horns theyve got so many options out of this set roach kind of take it over tried to feed Lively deflected away heres rice what weve seen from Rodney rice tonights been impressive now basily on the drive thats an offensive foul philipowski terrific job to step in front of Grant facility to draw his second and the sixth on the Hokies roach on one hand over penetrates needs to take that shot right here phillipowski can have a cup of coffee waiting on this one Music five fouls on Virginia Tech Music the thing I was we were talking about a moment ago each of these young guys and the way that its developed for Duke Debbie yes phillipowski going to the basket the the idea that it might have been phillipowski from the start Whitehead as he got healthy then Lively now you see Proctors emergence now Mitchell having a you know in the end game tonight the confidence level they must have as they wind down this regular season what a huge benefit it is for John Shaw going to postseason I think its the details of March its the move to March its when you elevate your team when you start to see how they start to flow and connect together you see it on the defensive end theyre loud in practice Lively has a great voice on the backside of their d right on the offensive end their spacing is outstanding one of the things I learned yesterday watching practices its not always the Deep basket cut that John shower wants his team to take sometimes its the shallow cut which quickly gets you into your spacing and opens up the floor faster Lively and one Applause I think Dereks first question was did it go in yes it did yes it did 22point lead for the Blue Devils foul was on Lynn Kidd ing dropoffs put backs Rim runs you dont even have to run a play for him he is all over the rim on both sides of the ball Derek Lively a great shot blocker and a great finisher inside attraction youre watching the ACC on ESPN Tonight with Debbie Antonelli West Durham and of course looking ahead Virginia Tech is going to be part of our ACC Network double header on Tuesday night the Corey cast is in Charlottesville Corey Alexander Dan Bonner a big game with Clemson at number six Virginia and of course Virginia Tech is at the Yum Center nine oclock to see the Louisville Cardinals of Kenny Payne available on acc Network and always on the ESPN app I like that you coined it the Corey cast I had a chance to participate yeah you were in Atlanta right that was fun yeah and rice fouled on The Drive By Design switched the shoe drive it hard against the big good play call by Mike young coming out of the timeout Kyle filipowski called for the foul it is his fourth with 11 37 to go and theres Mike Young and as Rodney rice will go to the line hes missed his only freethrow attempt of the night and of the year but hes changed that with the conversion there were really counting on Rodney rice at the beginning of the year yep I was in Blacksburg for practice in October and you know he didnt get a preseason with a team they had that put in green before you can see what he could become well he plays at Syracuse and then the next day in practice has the finger such bad luck oh unbelievable and I think they probably had some discussion about whether or not youre gonna Redshirt the year you know right right give him credit for coming back off the injury he went through some shooting drills last Saturday night prior to the pit game and then you saw him Tuesday night against Miami hes been much better here tonight Music spot up by Roach I mean look at Mitchell in a crowd get his hands on that basketball yep you hit it right disrupter basily left the 12footer a foot short trying again A Mitchell heres miligel Poteet strong to the basket and he cant buy one hes had a couple right at The Rim that hes not been able to finish yeah when he gets to that midline and he has a chance for that half hook he just needs to go to that and under 37 tonight from the floor and Couture reaches in and Japan I think is whistled the foul Music Applause and its on Padula Music there is Al phillipowski night at the office from a scoring perspective hey what called an elbow in the nose I mean hes a competitor and hes tough responded after the Virginia loss where you didnt score lets get right and then hes played well since scoreless in Charlottesville Music three games this year with 20 or more he had 29 a career high the first time these two squared off theres a turnover rice tried to dump it in traffic Applause Music way through the second half and Whitehead missing theres Mitchell again Debbie hes got a very high motor hes long and athletic hes got a quick jump crowd counts down the shot clock Proctor to Ryan young couldnt finish and young commits the foul chasing down the loose ball itll be the second on Young and a quick check of tonights Wendys wooden watch and well Chris Murray went for 268 in that wild game at Carver Hawkeye today Oscars Sheboygan Kentucky pound it over Debbie yeah without severe wheeler still not playing yeah and Mike miles Jr is 100 for Jamie Dixon in the horns and the frogs rather on Thrones Music door basket Couture Applause and now for Hunter Couture Music grandison a deep three John China likes a lot of that ghost screen action or that passthrough screen where you cool the defender because theyre switching theres Padula a layup in transition Sean Padulas got nine Couture the field goal the moment ago has six so 15 from a pair of guys who on average pick up about 2526 points a ball game and with 8 46 to go a timeout by the Blue Devils well Virginia Tech trying to win for the second time tonight in their history at Cameron Indoor and Debbie into getting a win a handful of years later but thats the only time Dukes won nine straight here in this building against Virginia Tech Hokies came in and won two straight and three of the last four in a series that dates back to 1912 Music heres Roach still been 16 years since Virginia Tech has beaten Duke in this building 2007 was the Lone year of the Hokey win what a night for roach see how roach gets to the logo pulls up he can get there all day its turned over but silly Music point lead look how hard Hunter guitar is moving without the ball Proctor is right on his hip and basily finally you see that Movement by Couture because you got to help on his cut a little bit so you got to guard him with one person that everyone else has to have half their attention on him and theyve done an excellent job tonight really limited limiting him he hasnt even taken the three yeah 13 straight double figures now for basily and theres Mitchell on a dump hes got six and a half and 17 in the game coutures missed 13 tonight Debbie but youre right Duke has put him at the top of the card and defended him accordingly one of the problems that Virginia Tech has had tonight with their defense is keeping Duke out of the paint Music goes back to what you said at the Top If Dukes improved in areas spacing may be one of the biggest right no question about it on the offensive end their spacing has been outstanding and its the way they move without the ball Mitchell its the way they cut two Wes philipowski had it taken away this is rice got Padula and tried to go to mutts and the Blue Devil forced to turn over there thats the game reps that Im talking about doing things at game speed Rodney rice would complete that play if he had been 100 healthy with the team all season but hes just getting back oh good slice cut and phillipowski an easy bucket second field goal for the Freshman from West Town New York that action is so hard to guard because of the threepoint shooting on the weak side Dukes got 13 points off the eighth Virginia Tech turnovers tonight Music Proctor is locking Trail on Couture we rounded in the three bounced away and so when you havent made one and now were late in the game and now youre coming off that curl and youre working off that pin down it might accelerate your Rhythm a little bit offensively if youre Hunter Couture good slip and phillipowski will get the basket in one Dukes got you all spaced out the paint is wide open John Shire is dialing it up right now on the strong side the two side the slip they clear out the back side no help filipowski at The Rim point lead John Shire got his team executing and dicing up Virginia Techs defense now watch Proctor right here hes going to make a great basket cut okay hes selling this cut like theres a pass coming look at the hand called for the ball okay now hold it right here now hes going to set the up screen right here and its a great slice cut by philipowski kadula tries to bump him off his rhythm a little bit look at the spacing by Duke the lane is wide open very good execution great timing by the Blue Devils philipowski on the free throw and its now a 23point lead for the Blue Devils as we go inside of six minutes to play here Duke trying to get to 126 in the ACC and 218 overall Music kid is back in the ball game and a foul on Mitchell two hands in the back in John shires first year has the blue double head coach and pardon me for backing up into the fall where we talk football about play callers offensive defense court news right right were finding out John charm may be a really really talented play caller as a head basketball coach think he is I mean I I think based on my experience calling the game and watching what hes done and how they space the floor and the way they share the ball the multiple weapons that they have and theres no selfishness on this team at all so we take advantage of what they have and they do a good job of playing off each other playing off each others face another foul on kid will be his third they want all 14 of their regular season games so far home and apparently theyre ready to change the toke board tonight well done sir on your part they are 80 in the ACC trying to go 90 tonight and boy talk about a big game Tuesday night the wolf pack will come over from Rolling boy they ought to be steaming a little bit huh well they put it put it on him well how about Duke also the last time they saw NC State over at PNC in early January you know one of the conversations we have with John Shire yesterday was you know they believed but when did they Trust he told us they played at NC State they lost they didnt compete they lost at Miami he didnt feel like they competed when they got ready to play Virginia up in Charlottesville he felt like they were locked in thats when he knew that they trusted greater than believing two totally different concepts in basketball yeah hes got him playing at a high level right now sure does I mean theyre looking at four straight seven of their last nine with a win tonight wolf pack here on Tuesday and then I dont have to tell you where next Saturday night ends Music going over there Chapel Hill you gonna be over there West okay the final game of the ACC season next Saturday night Ill be uh at the ACC womens tournament after the semis watching that game thatll be a pretty nice night good basketball all the way around inside months had it blocked by Lively now back at him again and last touched by mutts it will go to Duke dont forget our next stop on this Saturday night full of college basketball Saturday Primetime presented by John Deere we will take you to Spokane there is Drew Timmy and the 12th ranked zags welcoming The gales of Saint Marys tonight 10 oclock Eastern with Dan Jay and Sean Farnam on the call one of these one of the Buys in the country yep and if St Marys is gonna get the sweep because theyve won four of the last five Logan Johnsons gonna have to play really well controlling the tempo of the game for St Marys as we go inside of four minutes Ive got a job just Randy Bennett thats terrific hes a great teacher of the game and I think he and Mike Young have a lot of similarities in the way they approach the game well hes done an unbelievable job at Moraga with just Player Development the international flavor to his roster and the kind of guys he gets to come to that program Music there is a off the ball foul on the Blue Devils thatll get us to a timeout three and a half to go and a 22point lead Music ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Wendys two for six dollars the best name with HBO and the cards at the Yum Center thatll be a terrific environment as well great postmatchup in the Indiana Iowa game not just Caitlyn Clark but McKenzie Holmes for Indiana and Monica sanano for the Hawkeyes and Lively the rebound of the Hokey Miss I was going to ask you tonight in your Pantheon of players Caitlin Clark who is in the discussion oh man shes you know theres a twoplayer race I think for player of the year on the womens side of Leo Boston from South Carolina who is the number one team in the country and undefeated yep Don Stanleys done another terrific job with her team those two are the player of the year I believe thats a twoplayer race Brazilian a nice take and uh Boston swept all the awards last year I dont think that will happen this year I think there could be a split I think some will vote for Boston I think some will vote for Clark yeah Virginia Tech of their 12 losses none had been by more than 10 points theyd had two of those the loss at Syracuse and the other one in Charlottesville against Virginia but this was his double that with less than two and a half to go roach and another Lively dunk was around the rim on one field goal that could have been a dunk but was technically a layup everything else is hes had two hands on the rim what a great weapon I mean this is just great action right here look at how many jerseys are around the ball for Virginia Tech and hes wide open and Duke just overloads Music and allows Lively to have the Grim to himself yep John Shire puts Jalen Blakes and also Jaden shoot in the lineup hes a freshman from Yorkville Illinois first time we have seen shoot hes played three minutes last Saturday night at Syracuse wearing number 14 for the Blue Devils and as we grow closer to March right and I know theres a big week coming up but this is where Duke is getting better right their depths better theyre taking care of the basketball regarding documented how good their spacing is now Virginia Tech we told you got to turn around and play Tuesday night against Louisville and Dukes got all Five Guys in double figures tonight back to back he had all five starters and double figures against Louisville in their last game yep Music all those all those examples illustrate the kind of connectivity theyre playing with on both ends of the of the floor dont forget big Mundy starts in Tallahassee at seven oclock Florida State off the dramatic win in Miami well welcome Carolina and then off to the big 12 Baylor is in Stillwater to see Oklahoma State Ed Gallagher eyeball Arena both games on ESPN always available for you on the app rice dials up another three thats three of them in the ball game for Rodney rice but clearly you can see what he could be unfortunately for him the the injury bug has got him all season just his third game Applause Blakes with 80 seconds left to go but Debbie is a foul of Poteet it begs though there may be a window for Rice before this season is gone for Virginia Tech and heres Joe Leonardis afternoon run by the way of the Bracketology Joes a man of the people now Debbie hes delivering Goods about every six hours and Virginias a four now Miami a five Duke seven State and eight hit a 10 in North Carolina first four out so this is after these teams have played today right so that is correct so after Virginia lost and Miami lost and NC State lost very little movement there very little at this point Clemson is in that next four where Carolinas listed in the first four Clemson should be in the conversation well see any reason why they shouldnt they had a couple of bad losses but how about this guy so huh PJ Hall played really well today Hunter Tyson continues to lead I think Brad brownells done a terrific job I mean coach of the year Brad Brownell Jeff Capron Jeff Capel youre the one in conversation right both those guys absolutely one pick 10th in the preseason one pick 14 and the guy who won today against uh I guess Syracuse was picked 14th and he won his 14th conference game today terrific year for Pittsburgh and there is Collins and Pitts gonna go the final week of the regular season with the lead in the ACC now they got customers behind them Miami Virginia and Clemson all with five losses Duke is on the way to being 126 in the league with a win here tonight and then NC State at 127 and ironically Tuesday night yeah Tuesday nights a big night here and Cameron NC State comes in here and I know Kevin Keets will get this group reconnected I think turquavion Smith is overdue for a big game yep John Camden a redshirt freshman who transferred from Memphis to just knock down his sixth three of the year for his first basket and the Blue Devils with a 17point lead they wind out the final half minute and Blakes missed on the three and Camden Johnson battled shoot for the loose ball and Ted Valentine is going to tag the rookie shoot with a foul Music Applause Duke going to 150 at home had a nice visit with John Shire about he got a freshman shooter from Illinois on the roster yeah yeah thats kind of the way we work around here I said yes it is of course John was a terrific player American Music 2K yep Camden Johnson Applause appearing in his seventh Game of the Year misses his first freethrow attempt of the season Music and the Blue Devils can bring this across the timeline and dribble it out and thats what Max Johns Applause in charge to do and with eight seconds left its just a matter of Duke winding this out thatll do it Duke was impressive Debbie big run 8090 and then 100 in the second half to post this win tonight they moved the ball they played great D very connected on both ends of the floor big win at home to protect their Court Blue Devils will stay in the race
