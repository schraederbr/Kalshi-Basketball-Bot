Brad Ronell is looking to get a a tough road sweep of the West Coast here tonight at Hos Pavilion The purple for the Tigers as the opening tip controlled by Cal The Golden Bears will be without Lee Dort again their starting center whos now missed the last four games because of a quad injury And Cals not a very big team And that hurts going up against a physical Clemson Tigers team today Shot clock down to 10 Back door for Justin Pippen who glides in And great opening offensive possession for the Bears Just great patient there Great back door pass Justin Pippen Theyre going to make Clemson guard a lot of movement away from the ball today And a great first possession there for the Golden Bears cheering Carter Welling Jake Wallen moves in cheering the Utah transfer Utah Valley transfer Welling up and under in the key Tough shot and a foul and Milos Elich will put Carter Welling at the line for Clemson That is something that Cal cannot afford here today You mentioned it with Lee Dort out because of injury Their front court is very thin So Cal can certainly not afford to get Elich John Camden those guys in foul trouble early on But Clemsons going to pound the basketball inside That is what they do Throw the ball inside to Carter Welling there on that first play Welling a 70 foul shooter cheering had just four points at Stamford on Wednesday as Welling who started now the last 12 games for Clemson cheering Welling hits both and were tied at two cheering Starting five for Mark Madson Minus lead door with Milos Elich making his fourth consecutive start Heres Justin Pippen Feeds Elich inside and a foul on Dylan Hunter of Clemson Cals going to make Clemson guard a lot of ball screens and good pass there by Justin Pippen laughter that time I wasnt quite sure if Elich was ready for it but nonetheless drew the foul and now keeps it underneath out of bounds on their own basket Chris Bell relocates three Well as soon as Chris Bell caught that basketball on the initial I thought he should have shot the first one but decided that he didnt like it and probably made the tougher of the two cheering Clemson so good at defending the three and Bell knocks that one down though cheering Dylan Hunter here is Justin Per rattles one in for the Tigers Well great job there by Clemson not panicking off the double team in the post RJ Godfrey took his time dribbled out of the dub but found a wide open Justin Porter there Knocked down the three Good offense here both ways by both teams so far Heres Day Ames gets inside Tries the reverse and its knocked free and Clemson controls Here comes Justin Porter in transition cheering Carter Welling from the top and the rebound Justin Pippen pulls it down Day Ames deep corner two and the rebound Jake Wallen for Clemson Well you can see why Clemson has won 113 in the row on the road in the ACC Just great half court defense there That possession forcing the tough midrange jumper from Ames cheering The numbers defensively are so impressive across the board for Clemson Step through the layup missed by Carter Welling And even though Carter Welling missed that Brad Brownell is going to take that look every single time down And Pippen is fouled on his way to the basket Off the underneath out of bounds play You see Chris Bell here Thought maybe he was going to take that one but settles for the tougher step back going to his right And just a great job passing out of the double team on the post Justin Porter stepping in knocking it down Second foul on Dylan Hunter and Justin Pippen 81 foul shooter leads Calan assist and steals on the year at the line And Hunter will sit now with the two early fouls An early appearance for Ace Buckner the red shirt freshman off the Clemson bench And Ace Buckner played well the other day at Stanford Had some big minutes down the stretch But Dylan Hunter not a guy that Brad Brenell wants to see pick up his second foul here just 3 minutes into the game cheering Hes when talking to Brownell hes the glue that holds everything together He wont wow you but he just does all the little things for Clemson Powering his way inside And a finish from RJ Godfrey Well that is just a big time strength move there by RJ Godfrey Just decided he was going to get to the rim and finish Going back to Dylan Hunter youre right He kind of epitomizes what this Clemson team is all about The team is the strength of the team You know they dont have a ton of guys that are going to wow you but they all just know their role and they do it to perfection Chris Bell three Thats a great sign early from Mark Matson One guy you want to get going from behind the threepoint line Chris Bell a terrific threepoint shooter knocking down two here early on so far Syracuse transfer Heres Godfrey in the lane spins off balance and a tough finish by RJ Godfrey whos looking back for a call Yeah just a great finish there through a lot of contact and its going to be hard for Cal to double team if Godfrey catches the ball that deep in the paint Bell the pullup and the rebound A good box out by Jake Wallen Ace Buckner spins Buckner has it stripped and John Camden comes away with it for Cal Theres a mismatch if Cal can find it Justin Pippen on a step back Three Third three for Cal That was pretty good half court defense there by Clemson but Justin Pippen just saying laughter sometimes good offense beats good defense A tough step back Cal off to a great start here at home Three for three from three for Cal against a Clemson team cheering That is 17th best in the country defending the three holding opponents below 30 Justin Porter step through RJ Godfrey traveled team by Brad Brownells Tigers If Clemson could win on the road today I dont care what level what conference youre playing in what sport it is that is a ridiculous statistic to win 13 straight games on the road Just an incredible stat So basically the moral of your story right there is you think Clemsons gonna win a national championship because North Carolina State did it back in the 70s Theyre in good company as Nolan Dorsy is had his pocket picked and Clemson takes it away Here is Buckner Three from the corner short from Justin Porter and the rebound grabbed by Montis Coinis the sophomore from Lithuania RJ Gthrey on the bench for Clemson So where are they going to turn for offense Nick Davidson coming off a great game the other day against Stanford pick and pop can really shoot it from the outside but not much of an interior threat on the floor right now for the Tigers Here is Pippen Johnson guarding him Five to shoot Justin Pippen in desperation mode and theyre going to say a shot clock violation did not get it off in time and that is a Cal turnover It goes to Clemson Speaking of Clemson Wednesday nights ACC Network basketball double header as the Tigers hosting Virginia Tech at 7 Eastern and then Wake Forest squares off against Georgia Tech Like everything both are available on the ESPN app So the turnaround for Clemson heading home after the West Coast swing and theyll get Virginia Tech Wednesday night Ace Buckner and hes clobbered will get to the line The first on Justin Pippen with this Clemson lineup Cals got to respect the threepoint line a little bit more than they do when Carter Welling and RJ Godfrey are in there And that time Ace Buckner saw a lane and just took advantage of no rim protection because the defense was so stretched out trying to take away the three Buckner a strong game Wednesday at Stanford had 11 points off the bench Hes been in double figures three of the last four games for the Tigers as an 81 foul shooter and a legacy Tiger with his dad Tremendous player back in the mid to late 90s for the Tigers Of course a long NBA career now an assistant Greg Buckner cheering And its interesting in that win at Stanford Clemson had three players in double figures all coming off the bench led by Nick Davidson 16 Well Nick Davidson the second leading scoreer on their team has come off the bench in every game in ACC play so far this year So little bit of a errant pass there by Justin Pippen A little high on that one But Brad Rondo very comfortable putting his bench in And with that early foul trouble to Dylan Hunter hes going to have to rely on it a little bit more than he probably would like to Slicing to the basket The ball poked away from Nick Davidson and it stays with Clemson and 14 on the timer Symmetry TT Carr checks in The freshman for Cal as Justin Pippen will get a breather Here is Davidson but a Johnson trapped Davidson and a shot clock violation committed by the Tigers Good half court defense there by Cal that time especially on the underneath that bounce play Nick Davidson just didnt realize that the clock was that low was open for a three but just too late at that point Tried to put it on the floor Shot clock violation Day Ames weaves his way inside screaming Ames drives Shot blocked by Chase Thompson Buckner drives and Buckner will get to the line Clemson looking to push there in transition A great job by Nick Davidson posting up Kind of occupied the defense a little bit Ace Buckner able to get to the line But on the other end what makes Clemson so good defensively is they dont have to help each other very much because theyre all very good oneonone defenders That last possession Day Ames tried to go nobody had to help Chase Thompson played great defense Was able to block the shot One more for Ace Buckner First appearance for Dallas Thomas for Clemson A Clemson team that has depth And most teams go down a notch when they go to the bench Not the Tigers Right now have five guys coming off the bench So not one starter on the floor right now for the Tigers cheering Cals been scoreless for about 3 minutes cheering 10 to shoot for Cal on the drive TT Carr cheering John Camden steps in Too strong in the deep two Kept alive by Dewan Campbell cheering deflected and a steal the hands of Ace Buckner cheering cheering Chase Thompson after he thought about it spins out in the rebound Dewan Campbell and the Bears Youre exactly right He shouldnt have thought about it He should have just caught it and shot it right away The hesitation I think threw his rhythm off a little bit and flying over Ace Buckner spikes it into the crowd How about the recovery by Butner right there but we talked about it in the open Just a huge opportunity here tonight You know they dont have a lot of chances left with those quad one wins throughout the rest of the regular season Got to take advantage of them when you get them TT Carr drives and that ones swatted away by Carter Welling Picked up and thatll be a shot clock violation on Cal Yeah clock reset for some reason even though possession never changed But a ridiculous block by Carter Welling just going up and getting it And before the break we saw the block from Ace Buckner on the threepoint attempt So Clemson defensively just dialed in early Cals second shot clock viol violation the last couple of minutes and Clemson with another block shot They are active defensively Here is Welling Carter Welling with a left hand and it gives Clemson their first lead And thats a tough shot right there going to your left about a sixfoot jump hook with the left hand Carter Welling who transferred from Utah Valley to Clemson where Mark Madson coached prior to Cal Utah Valley And a steal to hands Dylan Hunter ahead to the basket The layin Dallas Thomas turning defense into offense Just great hands there by Dylan Hunter whos back on the floor with two fouls Brad Brownell trusting him Got the deflection Got the steal Advanced pass to Dallas Thomas Seven straight for the Tigers Back door for John Camden Poked away by RJ Godfrey who hits the deck And here comes Dylan Hunter Pass deflected Loose ball picked up and Justin Pippen has it for Cal Elo that time just getting his hands up Little bit of a careless pass there by Carter Welling One thing Clemsons not going to do is hang their laughter head Theyre going to try to get it back on the defensive end Just suffocating so far in the first 10 minutes of this game Heres Justin Pippen on the drive And Pippen way off balance Throws up a wild shot Racing back the other way Dylan Hunter cheering Deep three Dallas Thomas The stroke Theres that bench again for Bradell contributing Thson just makes they make the right play every time They dont rush anything They didnt have the break They kicked it out Took their time They get an offensive foul here by Elich Theyre going to take a look at that one Contact to the face there And offensive foul And the foul Offensive foul away from Milos Preview of the previous play It was deemed that there was not contact So the ball the foul is being taken off California They will resume with the ball on the side with 21 seconds on the shot clock No no no timeout wasted or anything like that So got the call right at the at the end of the day Thats the most important thing Good job there by the officiating crew Justin Pippen deep two pullup jumper gets his own miss Finds Chris Bell and blocking the shot RJ Godfrey out of nowhere and saved it on top of that The second time weve seen a recovery block on a threepoint shot And Godfrey able to keep it in bounds and save it An incredibly athletic play And then Godfrey at the other end gets the roll He has six to lead the Tigers And its 12 straight for Clemson If RJ Godfrey is going to catch the ball with two feet in the paint that deep he is pretty much unstoppable Getting back to that right hand Little baby jump hook Just an incredible twoplay stretch there for RJ Godfrey Day Ames and its deflected It was touched by Dallas Thomas Seven on the shot clock but the Tigers are everywhere defensively Well suffocating is the word that comes to mind so far for Elevate block to shot They just have not allowed Cal to get anything easy whatsoever Every shot has been contested Five to shoot for Cal coming out of the timeout John Camden needs to go and a contested two and the rebound A good box out Ace Buckner Here come the Tigers again Racing up the floor Buckner Anyone tumbling out of bounds Cal counters back the other way with Pippen Chris Bell runs the floor Bell was fouled Well when youre in a scoring drought thats exactly what you have to do You got to get out on the break and try to beat the defense before it can set up If youre going to play a half court game against Clemson where youre going against their said defense every time it is going to be a long night So one of the few times Cals been able to get out on the break Chris Bell getting to the free throw line First on Jake Wallen Chris Bell 88 foul shooter And that one rattles out Pippen has seven Bell has six Theyre the only scorers for Mark Madson in California Chris Bell hit those two early threes and just has not gotten a clean look You saw that last possession almost a shot clock John Camden just forced to take a tough step back fade away too as the shot clock was expiring So Clemson just after those first couple of minutes just turned it up a notch on on defense That ends the run of 12 straight by the Tigers Fullourt pressure Justin Porter will bring it into the front court Jake Wallen cheering cheering Knocked away from Buckner Here comes Chris Bell for California And Clemson does a great job getting back Yeah they sure did Thought that would be an easy advantage for Cal cheering Pippen before the shot Bird Smith says it was on the drive and the foul committed by Chase Thompson Give Cal credit Dug in there defensively on that last possession Got the steal got out on the break and Justin Pippen thought that was on the shot but Bert Smith very clear early on that it was on the ground Thats the thing about Clemson is they they play such great defense without fouling You just dont see them foul very much For as physical as they are you think they get called for more fouls but they just dont Theyre just their position is so good and their length at each position Yep Exactly right Great oneonone defenders Pippen had a good look at a three and the rebound grab by Chase Thompson for the Tigers cheering Jake Wallin fires an open three and the rebound Milos El leads for Cal Cal attacks with Dayday Ames Tries a wild reverse layin and its now Clemson coming away with it Four on three for the Tigers to the bucket and the spin and it goes in The first points for Chase Thompson Great take there by Chase Thompson Didnt really look like he had much Cal tried to push on that last possession but data Ames just never got a handle on the ball Again only about one point in the last 11 or so minutes for Cal Cals missed their last 10 from the field Heres Ames cheering Milos Elich goes inside trying to use the window and Jake Wallen claims the rebound for Clemson and 11 missed field goals in a row now for Cal Not many offensive rebounds to show for it Clemson doing a good job of limiting them to one every time Buckner too strong on the three and the rebound run down by Dewan Campbell for the Golden Bears Chris Bell missing on the baseline Ace Buckner the rebound for the Tigers Thats a frustration shot there by Chris Bell almost just desperate to try to will the ball to go in the basket cheering Here is Buckner driving Jake Wallen three Timeout California and Clemson shooting the ball well on offense Big reason why they have won 13 in a row on the road in the ACC TT Carr forced way out by Budda Johnson When you see how high Clemson has Cal initiating their offense here in the half court Its five six seven feet behind the threepoint line Pippen forced to take a tough three and the rebound falls to Nick Davidson for the Tigers Again one and done No offensive rebounding for Cal Youre having this bad of a shooting Now you got to try to create a couple extra ones but nobody going to the glass cheering Nick Davidson spots up in the corner and the rebound Justin Pippen and Cal looking to run Yeah look how well Clemson does getting back in transition and matching up Just stopping the ball All five guys below the ball stays with Cal on Coachinus checks in for the Golden Bears And just to rehash the call from earlier that call that was changed on the review It was a cylinder violation which gave the officials the opportunity to go to the monitor They deemed there was no contact Therefore they removed the foul and they went back to the point of interruption and they removed the foul for Milos Elich And Chris Bell throws it away Eighth California turnover And Clemson all the credit in the world I mean they just they have absolutely been impressive on defense Just not allowing anything easy whatsoever Even the two threes Two of the three threes that Cal hit early on were tough contested step back threes Cal was just able to knock him down Nick Davidson straight on three You know thats what makes this Clemson team so dynamic on offense Theyre not a highscoring team not a not a up and down pace kind of team but they can throw the ball inside to RJ Godfrey but then you bring Nick Davidson off the bench and he does that right there Pick and pop knocks it down So you almost got to pick your poison How do you guard them And you got to prepare for two different styles based on whos on the floor 20 to one run Day Ames the kick out John Camden missed a three Rebound Jake Wallen for the Tigers A decent look there but again Nick Davidson did a great job challenging They just rotate so well when you get into those scramble situations Jake Wallen another three for Clemson It is all Tigers Been really difficult for a lot of teams from the East Coast to come out here and get the sweep but Clemson is putting up a heck of an effort to do that so far And finally Cal gets in the scoring column Little bit of a sarcastic slash relief cheer there from this Cal Bear crowd First points for Dayday Ames And theres a foul as Ace Buckner going into the lane Not only has Clemson been great defensively but shooting the ball well from behind the arc You see Nick Davidson setting the pick and pop just popping back behind the offense And Jake Wen next time down pick and pop his second three from that side Packers is really not doing a whole lot wrong right now in the first half of this one Five for 11 from three and a balanced attack by the Tigers as Ace Buckner already three for four at the line and now four for five Buckner had a strong game at Stanford on Wednesday cheering as they held on and beat the Cardinal by two at Maples Pavilion And Buckner now with five off the bench in this one This is what the Tigers have done defensively Cal who got off to a good start but now just five for 22 from the floor You just see the hand activity even right there Ace Buckner got a deflection on Justin Pippen out here by midcourt Back door for John Camden Missed the reverse laying Its been one of those Tigers Been one of those halves You get a good look and then that time just cant get it to convert Just very frustrating half offensively for Mark Madsons team In and out for Justin Porter Cal even when they get the rebound they cant get out and run because Clemson does a great job transition defense rattles in for Dayday Ames And thats the guy they they got to get going there One of the few times hes been able to get in the lane get a paint touch get his feet set His midrange game is as good as anybody in ACC He was on display the other night in that careerhigh game Nick Davidson down the lane Tell you what Ace Buckner has played extremely well for the Tigers last couple of games Just a great pass there on the middle pick and roll That time Davidson rolling instead of popping but a great pass by Ace Buckner and an errant pass by Milos Elich who forced it inside Again you see the hand activity from Clemson Jake Wallen tracks it down Pass deflected knocked away picked up by John Camden And here comes Cal Justin Pippen And hes fouled Well get to the line Well weve talked about Nick Davidsons ability to step out and shoot the three This time decides to roll Just a little breakdown there defensively by the Bears And a great pass by Ace Buckner Justin Pippen getting out on the break and getting fouled getting to the free throw line We talked about the bench strength for Clemson and how it came through against Stanford and its the same here in Berkeley this afternoon or early evening now as Justin Pippen will shoot two for two from the line for the son of the Hall of Famer And Justin Pippen leads Cal with eight Its just such a luxury to have for Brad Brownell Dylan Hunter we talked about it Picked up his second foul 3 minutes into the game Hes got to go to the bench but it doesnt matter Theres no drop off And thats why theyre going to be such a dangerous team throughout the rest of the regular season come tournament time because theyre able to overcome foul trouble and those types of things Green cheering but a Johnson launching a three cheering What has Clemson done wrong so far in this half Nothing Everything has gone Clemsons way Largest lead nine different scorers for the Tigers Day Ames trying to beat the horn And thatll take us to halftime and Clemson forcing Cal to go just two for their last 18 and closing the half on an impressive run And theyre up on offense You got nine guys in the scoring column Just an incredibly balanced attack You car see what Mark Madsons going to try to change here offensively to try to get a little bit of a rhythm going because they just could not find it there in that first half Nine different Tigers scored in the first half and going inside And RJ Godfrey will get to the free throw line RJ Godfrey just caught that one spun away from the double team going baseline But you see the balance there in the first half Mentioned it Nine guys in the scoring column for Clemson Just didnt matter who they played who they brought off the bench Guys were getting But that thats how they play I mentioned it in the first half Again the strength of their team is their team Just overall its going to be a different guy every night Its just going to be a balanced attack Its not going to be one guy getting 25 cheering Second foul in Milos Elich who gets the start again in the place of the injured Lee Dort Cals regular starting center One more for Godfrey Played two years at Clemson went to Georgia last year and transferred back to Clemson this year He missed both and the rebound grabbed by Milos Elich for the Golden Bears Well with Lee Dort out because of injury Cal just doesnt have much of an interior presence offensively Just not a guy who can really get a bucket on the block Clemson has put the handcuffs on defensively And see right away the officials two quick fouls here early in this second half Maybe try to tighten this up a little bit That first half was very physical Its going to be the third there on Dylan Hunter So quick entry for Ace Buckner as Hunter goes to the bench with the three fouls just 30 seconds into the second half Justin Pippen tries to turn the corner off balance draws the foul gets the roll and one I think needed that as a mild understatement Yeah to put it mildly but you see here just a little dribble handoff Justin Pippen does a good job there of initiating the contact Ace Buckner just a little bump there Gets the friendly roll here at home Cal just desperately trying to find some type of rhythm but a good sign there for Justin Pippen getting to the free throw line Chance for the threepoint play Second foul on Ace Buckner and Pippen now with 12 to lead all scorers in the game cheering The Tigers 13 consecutive road conference wins tied for the third longest streak in ACC history and trying to keep that going cheering Buckner three Even though Dylan Hunter picked up his third foul there is just no drop off with Ace Buckner coming into the game He has played lights out the last couple of games especially here tonight Just effortlessly knocking that one down Buckner leads Clemson with eight points as Day Ames slits slips to the bucket Cals going to continue to run that dribble handoff and that time Day Ames read the overplay Just a good back door cut Carter Welling the jump hook Thats his second time hes hit about an 8 foot jump hook with the left hand That is not an easy shot How doing well offensively here but Clemson with the answer each time down Weaving his way down the lane Pippen tries the high arcer and Clemson comes away with a rebound cheering and a block The third on Milos Elich Simpsons have been making it a priority to throw the ball inside to RJ Godfrey That time handled the double on the reversal Ace Buckner knocking down the three You see Carter Welling with a nice touch with the left hand on the jump hook And he is righthanded which makes it even more impressive Very much so If you didnt know any better you would think he is lefthanded based on how easy that looked And that trickles into the Tigers bench It belongs to Cal and the first appearance today of Dia Manuel Dut the sevenfooter from the South Sudan Tigers who have won 12 of their last 13 overall nine and one in ACC play Their only loss in ACC play was an overtime setback to NC State at home Back door for Bell Tried to reverse Challenged by Welling And then Jake Wallen dives for the loose ball And Im not sure Chris Bell should have tried to reverse that I think he had it on the left side Tried to go underneath and got it blocked almost by the rim And theres a push off the ball Thats on Daquelu And the first foul on the sevenfooter Wednesday night Clemson will get back at it Theyll be at home as the Tigers will entertain Virginia Tech at 7 Eastern And then game two of our ACC Network basketball double header features Wake Forest and Georgia Tech Thats at nine Like everything both also available on the ESPN app Stepping through the double team Welling recovers and gets the roll off the heel of the rim You know Clemson knows that theyre going to get double teamed but they continue to throw the ball inside in order to get the defense to collapse That time Carter Welling just did a great job of maintaining his composure through the double team and able to finish with the right hand that time and a foul as Dak Manuel D was knocked down Third team foul on Clemson here in the second half And thats the third on Buckner Ace Buckner has three Dylan Hunter has three And now Buckner will check out and Budda Johnson comes in the transfer from UAB And a much tighter whistle both ways Already six fouls called where in the first half we only had nine total So Whistles trying to tighten this one up a little bit Day Ames missing the pull up and Carter Welling gets the rebound inside for Clemson Clemson just continues to do a great job of not allowing Cal any offensive rebounds Pretty good look that time by Day Ames on the midrange just didnt get the roll Welling is mugged Will get to the line Pound the ball inside Pretty simple philosophy When you got good players who can score inside you got to get him the ball Carter Welling one time RJ Godfrey the next Last year Welling at Utah Valley was second team all whack and also the WAC defensive player of the year Played his freshman year cheering at UC Irvine for Russell Turner One more for Welling Montas Coachinus comes in for Cal cheering Welling from Draper Utah splits the pair Welling has about 10 friends and family here today as does Jake Wall who also hails from Utah And then Nick Davidson whos from Southern California has about 15 family and friends that are here Made the trek up to the Bay Area and then John Camden throws it away RJ Godfrey looks like he took a finger in the eye and the loose ball taken back by Chris Bell Bell leans in banks it in and Godfrey is still in some discomfort and it appears to be his left eye thats the problem And I think it may have been a little friendly fire there He got the rebound inadvertent contact See here great steal Yeah his own teammate there Jake Wolen just inadvertently caught him And Justin Porter tried to save it Chris Bell in the right spot at the right time able to knock it down But Godfrey going to stay in the game Appears to be okay cheering And a foul a reach in cheering and its on California 20point lead for number 20 Clemson trying to get pavilion today and trying to decorate the Crocs for people I Ive never been a big Crocs guy either but you your kids are older so you wouldnt know this Do you know what those little things are called No Chibbits Chibbits Yes My kids went through a Croc phase which is funny cuz they dont wear them at all anymore Oh yeah that was the only reason they wanted the Crocs Three missed by Jake Wallen and the rebound Monts coaching is for Kell May have to get you a pair of Crocs or some jibbits H Im Im all right I appreciate the offer David Really I do Did your grandfather do anything like that when he was coaching here at Cal No I dont believe so I think uh I dont think he would have been big into the whole uh Crocs scene Brad Brownell thought Chris Bell traveled and the hoop for Bell who now is 11 He did travel There was no question about that He slid that foot but if youre a cow right now youll take points any way you can get them The lead has been as large as 22 for the Tigers And Nick Davidson almost wasnt ready for the pass then had it stripped but a foul on Cal on the step through And its on TT Carr Second on Carr Baseline throw in for the Tigers whove been out in the Bay Area since Monday They flew out played Stanford Wednesday stayed over on the Peninsula until yesterday Practiced at the Warriors facility in downtown San Francisco yesterday as Jake Wallen nails his third three of the game Yeah its a great pass there by Nick Davidson with the shot clock getting low Just a little out of control on the spin move but was able to find Wallen whos had a great night shooting the ball you know But its interesting talking to the Clemson staff before the game Yeah youre on the road for six five six days but you only have to do it once every two years Think about how much of an advantage that is or a disadvantage I should say for Cal and Stanford having to do it every other week We see there the great pass by Nick Davidson and Jake Wen with the hot hand here in the second half Just a long way to go Play a couple of basketball games but thats the new college athletics for you Slipping to the bucket off the inbound Mont coaching is the throw down Good execution there by Cal underneath that bounce play A little breakdown defensively by Clemson but Jonas with the slip and the easy two It was about as easy of a basket as H Cals had tonight One of the very few breakdowns Clemsons had defensively You know Cals playing much better this half offensively but the problem is is theyre just trading baskets They havent been able to put together enough stops to try to chip into this lead Clemson over 60 from the field as Godfrey left it short falling down Montes coaching has had it poked away the hands of Jake Wallen Threeon two for the Tigers and the layup falls off from Justin Porter but run down by Clemson but a Johnson three It has just been one of those games for Clemson Just everything going in their direction Thought Cal was going to be able to shoot the gap for a steal right there But Johnson gets a wideopen three and knocks it down Just Cal cannot find a way to get any stops here the start of this second half Day Ames missing the layup and the rebound grab by Godfrey for the Tigers as Clemson is 9 for8 from three not a high volume shooting team from behind the arc on the season but when you shoot that percentage youre more than willing to take a little bit more than normal And Cal has defended a three really well this year Three rattles out for Nick Davidson but Cal limiting opponents to below 30 from three And the Golden Bears thats 30th or rather 28th in the country defending the three See Chris Bell I thought almost had that steal Read that play perfectly doesnt get it and theres just no rotation and Budda Johnson knocks it down But whats made Clemson so efficient tonight has been numerous guys You got Justin Porter knocking them down Nick Davidson knocking them down Jake Wallen knocking a couple down That time Buddy Johnson just shooting the lights out all the way across the board And the interesting thing is you saw the numbers Cals three of eight from three Cal normally shoots a lot of threes Clemson is clearly taking that away from them today Theyre pretty much just taking everything away Okay now Cals done a better job in this second half trying to drive the ball a little bit more and get in the paint and has had some success but Clemson just theyre so fundamental on defense with everything that they do Their stance their positioning just make it really really tough Pippen one foot step back and gets the roll 14 for Justin Pippen And even right there give Justin Pippen a lot of credit Good patience good footwork there knocking that down but good defense I mean not a whole lot you can do right there Just a good offensive move Justin Porter had a good look and the offensive rebound and the kick out by Chase Thompson and a foul on California A big opportunity for them on the road where theyve had so much success Well opportunity is the key word there This obviously is a big one but Cal based on the remaining schedule is going to run out of good opportunities I mean you got SMU coming in here in a couple of weeks but youre going on the road for four more games against not great competition almost bottom feeders of the ACC So you you you have to win those games I mean you you cant afford a bad loss right now almost more than you really need a good win at this point in the year So they just cannot afford any more slip ups Shot clock down to seven Justin Pippen cheering pull up jumper And Pippen has 16 of Cals 35 Cal starting to have a little bit of success with that little midrange dribble a handoff get the defense on their back But again they just they keep they cannot find a way to get enough stops here to just chip into this lead Clemson has just been terrific offensively in this second half Underneath and the drop in Carter Welling Youre not going to get much easier of a look than that if youre Carter Welling Just right in front of the rim A great pass It seems here in the second half you talked about Cals offensive improvement Daily they were executing and beginning their offense from way too far out in the first half It seems theyre initiating it closer to the hoop here in the second half Yeah they are which has allowed them to to score with more ease here in the second half But again it just comes down to this end of the floor And when youre playing against a team like Clemson because of their pace theyre going to use 25 26 seconds of the shot clock every time down So this game is going to get a lot shorter in a hurry cheering Number possession is going to start to run low Is the shot clock running low here But at Johnson thats a long two And the rebound Theres Justin Pippen claiming it for Cal Cals going to have to look to push the pace a little bit here Pippen trying to do so Chris Bell And its fumbled away and Cal turns it over What seemed to be an opportunity to get a hoop in transition Well I think Chris Bell and or TT Carr they need to shoot one of those Youre not going to get a better look than that I understand trying to get a great shot but when youve got a pretty good one you cant give it up Carter Welling and the rebound Here comes Justin Pippen The lob for Chris Bell who banks it in One of the few transition baskets in this basketball game for Cal That was a point of emphasis for Clemson is to make sure they got back in transition And also Cal looks to hunt threes in transition but Clemson has not let them And Milos El just called for his fourth foul off the ball And you were talking about the schedule coming up for Cal Theyre hitting the road Theyre going to be at Syracuse on Wednesday then at Boston College next Saturday home for Stanford and then that SMU game which you pointed out The the challenge for them though is only two of those games SMU and Virginia Tech Virginia Tech is a bubble team right now even behind Cal SMU pretty solidly in the field as of today but you know you just youre going to run out of good opportunities So you got to do two things You got to make sure you take care of the games that you cant have a slip up Thats first and foremost A bad loss right now will absolutely kill their resume And then you just got to try to win those good opportunities and maybe even get into the ACC tournament and win a game or two there Not sure how much emphasis the committee has put on conference tournament games over the last couple of years but nonetheless if you get to that 2122 win area I think you got to like your chances Deflected out by Clemson And for Cal look they have 17 wins Its the most wins for a Cal team since they won 21 nine years ago 2016 2017 And some big wins beat Notre Dame here beat North Carolina beat UCLA at Miami winning on the road at Stanford And they got off to a 121 start Rough beginning to ACC play but then theyve won four out of five coming into today for running into a team executing at a high level in Clemson Well lets give Mark Madson a lot of credit Obviously talking about theyre up against it a little bit on the bubble there but he has done a phenomenal job here just a year and a half for this program getting them to the point where they are I mean starting the season 12 and one just a really really good job And a foul going for the rebound is RJ Godfrey shoving down Day Ames and the first on Godfrey And the other good thing that Cal has as far as their resume they dont have a bad loss on their schedule Thats why its so important here over the next couple of weeks to not get one because they do have some opportunities to do that I know a lot of those games are on the road but you just cannot afford to add another one to the loss column against a team thats not going to make the tournament Day Ames gets in the key Pull up jumper Little momentum here for Cal One of the few times in this game the crowd trying to get into it here cheering Theyve cut it to 15 745 to go Clemson is led by as many as 22 cheering RJ Godfrey fouled and one for Godfrey cheering The end one free throw for RJ Godfrey is now one for three at the line Yeah I think there was another national championship team on that graphic We just saw that Virginia team 2019 and Clemson streak They were tied with Virginia going into the Stanford game Pippen three Good set there coming out of the timeout by Cal to get Justin Pippen going again cheering Really been the lone bright spot for Cal here offensively in this game but trying somehow to get him back into it But again seems like every time theyre on the verge of making a little bit of a run Clemson just has the answer and is able to match him offensively If youre Cal right now you just got to get stops on the defensive end of the court Double figures now for Wallin And even though Cals found a way to score but Clemson is scoring themselves at the other end as Pippen rims out a three and the rebound grabbed by Jake Wallen cheering and going right back inside Ace Buckner for the Tigers How great has he been today off of the bench And Cal back the other way And Mark Madson screaming for a goend call Thats not reviewable because there was no call made on the floor RJ Godfrey is HAMMERED AND HE MUSCLES THROUGH IT PLUS ONE And in real time couldnt quite tell It was definitely close I think thats a good block I mean he he got it before it touched the backboard Still was on its way up Not sure that was going to go in anyway but nonetheless Clemson again showing their athleticism with a chase down block And on the other end RJ Godfrey going back to the free throw line for another chance at a threepoint play Just so strong Godfrey even with the contact its almost like he just shrugs it off and it doesnt bother him You know youre youre taught as a player to make sure he doesnt finish if youre going to foul him But RJ Godfrey is just so strong Was just able to play through the contact and finish it And Clemson missing the free throw but getting it back Chance to run some more time off of this clock Buckner fires Three for Ace Buckner He has been phenomenal tonight Just doing it all offensively Showing the range right there Dylan Hunter with a pretty quiet game by his standards But when you got Ace Buckner coming off the bench it doesnt matter Nine straight for Clemson John Camden and he remains scoreless Came in averaging 14 and a half a game And stepping on the sideline it goes over to Cal and a turnover by Clemson Coming up next the Nothing But Net Crew will break down the day in the ACC Highlights and analysis of every mens hoops game and look ahead to the best matchups on the schedule coming up this week Nothing but net coming up next And I have good feeling theres going to be a lot of Carolina Duke conversation Just a hunch That was a wild ending I saw the score at halftime right when we went on the air and we saw the ending of it I mean just a crazy finish But what do you expect in that game I mean its always something 16 foul on Clemson And thats the fourth on Ace Buckner not just had a great game tonight He played tremendously I thought at Stanford Wednesday night and hes really coming on for Brownell Double figures in four the last five games after he had double digits in just five of the first 19 So hes emerging here for the Tigers and a foul will get Day Day Ames to the line The second on Justin Porter and that puts Cal into the bonus A one and one for Ames Ace Buckner coming to the school where his dad was a star Buckner has been terrific today Took the red shirt season last year when Clemson won 27 games a year ago and you dont see that very often David that players are willing to red shirt willing to bite their time And hes not alone in that regard at Clemson Well Clemson has had so much success and a big reason why theyve been so great over the last five or so years in the ACC they they they have veteran players You know obviously nowadays with the transfer portal youre going to get guys from different schools all the time but the job that Brad Brownell and his staff have done this year with a completely new roster I mean you look back at their team last year its completely new GODFREY DOWN THE LANE That pretty much puts a nail on the coffin here for this one But this Clemson team is just to to this day and age with new rosters every year to be able to implement your system so quickly is not an easy thing to do And this Clemson team just you would think these guys have played together for three and four years Just how connected and cohesive they are on the court See RJ Godfrey here just taking it Nick Davidson with a little block out there and as easy of a basket as youre going to get Its been that kind of night for the Tigers and Godfrey unique story where he played at Clemson for two years last year went to Georgia then comes back which you dont see that very often where a player returns to where they transferred out of Can you imagine 10 years ago telling somebody that a kids going to transfer to a school and then transfer back to the school they came from Well if you brought up the transfer portal 10 years ago I would have looked at you with disdain What portal Wheres it located Is it a room you go sit in What is that Yeah it just spins around and wherever you laughter end up thats where youre going to school Both free throws hit by Milo Elich And somehow there was no call either way Whether it was a foul or a travel it was a play on or a jump ball something and it missed everything cheering Meanwhile we just got hit in the back of the head by some balloons over here but kids had a little fun with the cow pair of balloons I didnt know what that was It startled me a little bit It started in the gym pageant era actually and theyre just trying to make you feel welcome Well Clemson is the epitome of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts I mean they just they get contributions from everybody And in that first half if they play like that defensively throughout the rest of the season cheering its going to take a heck of a night to beat them And you see a uncharacteristic like turnover there against the pressure by Nick Davidson Brad Brownell not happy with that one But they are a team you and I were talking about it before the game They are just not theyre not going to beat themselves You have to beat them I mean theyre just that was one of the few mistakes theyve made all game was so fundamental that youre just going to have to have a heck of a night to take him out Dwan Campbell goes flying and draws the foul And Clemson trying to do something thats impressive to come fly across the country and sweep two good basketball teams in Stanford and Cal Only Duke has done it this season I mean its a long way to go Youre out here for five six days just got to get your bodies acclimated timewise Now obviously the travel and everything chartered flights and all that kind of stuff makes it a little bit easier but a pretty pretty remarkable stat that Duke has been the only team so far this year to be able to do it but no surprise really with the way this Clemson team has played tonight Looks like theyre going to pull off the 2 and0 West Coast road swing One more for Dewan Campbell and the rebound grabbed by Budda Johnson for the Tigers But a superb road performance in a game plan well executed by Brad Brownells team But as we keep talking about we keep beating it into the ground about their defense The foundation of Brad Brownells defense David what do you see as far as what makes them so successful as a team It doesnt matter what five guys are on the court It could be the five starters It could be five guys off the bench Theyre all connected and they know exactly what theyre supposed to be doing from a scouting standpoint from a positioning standpoint Theyre just always in the right spot Justin Porter knocks down the corner three but they just they cover so well for each other Its never four guys are on the same page and one guys not All five guys are always on the same page And now an offensive foul The illegal screen on John Camden Clemson was matched their largest lead 235 to play holding Cal to under 38 shooting Theyve made just four threes and a team that thrives on threepoint shooting and the balance that they have offensively with four guys that can really hurt you from the perimeter and then offensively the way theyve executed at the other end because theyve done it in the half court for the most part Its not like Clemson is forcing Temple and running and getting easy looks Theyre executing offensively in the half court even though they missed it right That right there was a prime example Theyre just taking what the defense gives them They just make the right basketball play every time down And another great example of transition defense John Camden and his first points of the game and it took him about 38 minutes Yeah very quiet night there by his standards and he is vital to what Cal does offensively And again we should point out Cal playing without their starting center Lee Dort who is a massive loss for Mark Madson Four Clemson Tigers in double figures 13 each for Ace Buckner and RJ Godfrey to lead the way and a shot clock violation Clemson turns it over But if youre Cal you got to put this one out of sight out of mind pretty quickly cuz you got couple huge weeks coming up here going on the road next week at Syracuse at Boston College So this is one of those maybe you burn the tape and dont even watch it and just get ready for the next one and the quick turnaround because theyll leave on Monday to go back east and play Syracuse on Wednesday John Camden goes back door and a foul and its on Jake Wallen of Clemson Play Syracuse Wednesday in BC next Saturday While Clemson will head home and theyll get Virginia Tech Wednesday night at Little John And a little bit of a sneaky trap game there potentially with Clemson going on the road next Saturday going to Cameron to face Duke But this Clemson team just seeing him in person for the first time this year Really really impressed cheering just in so many areas Just not a whole lot of weaknesses as a team collectively Going to be a very very difficult outcome come March First appearance for Trent Steinhower the freshman for Clemson as John Camden hits both free throws and a foul Its on Chris Bell and Clemson will go back to the line This will give Clemson 20 or more wins fourth straight year and 13 out of 14 overall in terms of wins cheering heading into that match up with Virginia Tech on Wednesday And one more coming up for Justin Porter But 14 straight road wins now which is tied for the second longest streak in ACC history Incredible Absolutely incredible mentioned it numerous times Defense travels basketball no matter what no matter what level and you always know youre going to be in the game You look at their three losses this year by five at Georgetown or excuse me their four losses by six at Alabama lose to BYU by three and then to North Carolina State in overtime by four Theyre always going to be in the game just because the way they defend Three rattles out for Day Ames Even though Brad Brown Ls up 21 with less than a minute to go still coaching and wants this team to execute and get his bench guys some minutes and a three the second three for Dallas Thomas who has a careerhigh eight 12 threes now for the Tigers Well this will certainly make that cross country trip home tonight a lot easier for the Tigers cheering stays with Cal So Clemson will go to 20 and four 101 in the ACC As you alluded to the only ACC loss was at home in overtime to NC State Cal will fall to 5 and six in the conference And the Golden Bears will be 177 getting ready to head to the Northeast to deal with Syracuse and Boston College as Day Ames cuts to the bucket And Clemson doesnt have to shoot it They can run out the clock But certainly an impressive road performance by the Clemson Tigers Brad Brownells team came in here and they played at such a high level here today Its an incredible performance on the road to get that 2 and 0 West Coast sweep But the Tigers are a dangerous team here in the next couple of months
