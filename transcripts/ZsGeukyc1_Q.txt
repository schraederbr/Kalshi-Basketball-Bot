game so quite a battle on our hands and we are set for basketball feder Rico feder Rico loses the tip as its gained by the Missouri Tigers in there black uniforms and at the point sha East wearing number 55 when was the last time you saw a point guard wearing 55 its been a while I like it Noah Carter is the other captain on this Missouri team number 35 in the starting lineup there goes honor swinging the ball around seven to Applause shoot Carter puts it up nice job defensively by Pittsburgh and here comes ishmail leet the transfer from Rhode Island Blake Hinson picks up the dribble brings it back out we could have also highlighted Blake Hinson as well coming off a marvelous All Conference year he is now the third leading scorer this year in the ACC at over 19 points per game I think hes going to have a heck of a year and being the ACC player toe candidate and Pits going to need him to play that level if they want to get to postseason BL and I even thought last year with demarius Burton he and Blake Hinson kind of canceled each other out in that ACC player of the year vote they both played so well helping this Pittsburgh team get to the big dance for the first time in years and it and you wondered that and even with Miami and getting it finally getting two players I thought they had two players that was fighting for it that happens at times you get two two great players they take vots from one another as you look at Jeff Gaper there he doesnt mind having that problem at all no its a good problem to have after four tough years trying to rebuild this Pittsburgh program into what it was in its Heyday in the Big East years with Ben Howland and Jamie Dixon and they certainly seem to have the building blocks in place now but hes responded it takes some time when youre building it your way and you rewarded everyone with a coach of the year Noah Carter the grad student from debuk Iowa Banks one Applause in good job posting up there is really streaky from behind the arc so getting the ball inside and getting early post up is not a bad idea at all yeah streakiness is kind of the name of the game for this Missouri team so far this season Blake Henson hes a wide body 68 230 he can knock down shots and he can do that well hes not known for putting it on the floor getting to the rim but the way he shoots it you got to close out hard you got to go for that shot fake and does a great great job there getting to the rim there you see 17 points last time out in a route of Oregon State that was at the Barkley Center in Brooklyn the second game of their nit season tip off nice bounce back from their loss to Florida that was Shawn East II misfiring heres Carlton Carrington again a freshman out of St Francis Academy in Baltimore who has NBA Scouts coming to Pittsburgh now in big numbers well half the league is here I think I think the last number I heard was 14 to 15 teams here today tonight oh here to see this young man good fake by Lean Shots a little long track down by Shawn Applause East here goes onor spins into the lane picks up the dribble Aiden Shaw with his first two points Tigers off to a two out of four start from the floor they take onepoint lead go see why young for Missouri was just raving about Shaw saying how much potential he is thingss hes a little raw but his skill skill level is increasing clean look Off the Mark feder Rico thought better of going over the back of Noah Carter I think one of the bigger adjustments you see from both teams early is Missouri goes to the bench theyll play their entire roster theyll play 13 guys well see how many guys pick pit plays tonight they try to match that Carter gets double team feder Rico came over and is going to be called for the blocking foul I just didnt think he saw him coming there and tried to spin Baseline and ran into feder Rico came over put his chest on Applause him well the Ascension of Noah Carter started the end of last year with missou his first after transferring from Northern Iowa he really according to his coach was the best player on this team the last six games last year and he has just built on that through the first seven plus games of this season Nick honor no its a war under the glass tonight who wins the battle with the on the glass well Pittsburghs been winning them virtually every night so far this year Mar bits Deni Zack Austin with the rejection we talked about it two of the top 10 two teams in the country at shot blocking so I expect many more tonight boy this feels like an old school rock fight my goodness fergen we eluded off the top to the turnaround both of these teams enjoyed last year for Jeff Capel and pit they went 24 and 12 finished in a third place tie in the ACC had their first winning season since Jamie Dixons final go round to pit seven years prior and at the same time in Columbia Missouri Dennis gates in his first year brought that Leonard Hamilton style from his days at Florida State and made a quick turnaround they went 25 10 and reached the second round of the NCA tournament both of those guys just turned those program Brown took capable a little longer but got into the tournament won two games coach Gates got in won a game himself and just set the bar High what you expect for these guys and here is Ish leot a 63 junor from Prince Georges County Maryland thats just outside of Washington DC who spent three years at the University of Rhode Island last year scored over 16 points about five rebounds a game and he was part of the story of Pittsburgh trying to build this year hes come in and again Hes only 63 but he averages eight rebounds a game part of setting that new tone this year for Coach Cs team I recruited him in high school just loved him hes a winner out of St John High School in DC and hes just been a winner one of those guys High major schools werent on them early but everyone loves him now and C Raves about him because he always takes the defensive assignment he Prides himself on the defensive end the floor heres Nick honor trying to work on the Freshman bring it back out Tamar Bates and the former Indiana Hooser has three off to a hot start behind the arc right now the team overall is struggling but Mar bat isnt shooting 46 from the three and right now that just looking to go up yeah I can do the math hes now 50 cuz hes seven for 14 the numbers arent so big yet that I cant figure that out were run out of time we got a couple more days before that happen terrific ball fake by Austin off the back iron one and done for pit one thing is happening right now is Missouri doing a better job of attacking the paint they put more pressure on the rim and its opening up the perimeter theres East Music Carrington quickly up ahead trying to find feder Rico and for some reason missed him by a mile I dont think feder Rico knew anybody was behind him had he ran to the rim he didnt see with his point guard saw his point guard saw no one there and just tried to lead him and had a careless turnover there heres honor who started his college career year years ago at forom was a 15point per game score in the Atlantic 10 Conference Bates creates some space puts up an a ball like it tell you what the foul is called against Noah Carter and hes still trying to plead his case Ive been impressed by his physicality in the first five minutes here he came up super aggressive on both end of the floor as ish Leed here gets to the rim I think Noah thought he absorbed the contact with his body and probably trying to question now was that he came in to me Ruff last year at Missouri Carter averaged Just a Touch under 10 points per game this year up to 13 a game as leot made the front end theres big number 35 now dont get it twisted he can go for a lot of points at Val perzo a couple of years ago he went for 33 so he brings a lot to the table for Dennis Gates now hes going to come out of the game and be replaced by Aiden Shaw hes also leading this group in rebounding right now which is which is key for this team because theyre actually losing the rebound margin so far this year when they play and thats something that coach Gates wants to he knows he needs to do a better job of they want to win this game here at pit Carter sits down that 64 rebound average there you see the numbers way down in the SEC in the early going Missouri 52 on the year Pittsburgh 5 one heres the cutter Caleb Grill hangs in the air and Banks it home off a nice feed from Shawn East great job of cutting there off the penetration when youre struggling from the perimeter you want to get yourself going with a layup like that gr shooting only 24 from behind a yard so great great job by him carington trying to initiate offense field goals have been tough to come by so far for Pittsburgh they have been getting to the free throw line that personal against Anthony Robinson the second just great Baseline Drive there Grill sees it cuts takes the contact there great Music finish look at that just hangs in the air he almost hangs in ear as long as you do when you jump only if Im jumping from the fourth story Music guo Diaz Graham with a basketball one of the twin brothers on this team who have become so much better now as sophomores coming off the bench they continue to grow their games Henson for three thats his specialty you got to get out there to him they working on that penetration kicking out to the wings theres no middle Zone theres no middl man defense for Missouri is vulnerable to Corner threes well Missouri will go 10 11 12 deep most nights they get a lot of scoring from a lot of guys so far four different tigers have scored in this one East picks up his dribble hes in trouble he still trying to work and he almost got the friendly roll Robinson cleans it up Anthony Robinson a freshman from Tallahassee has had a really good start to his college career really high on him and not just because he scores Off the Bench hes got double figure points the last couple of games is because he just gets AED on the defensive end after the fly by Carrington little strong on that three gets his own miss little Bub again showing off the midrange I like the confidence missed the three doesnt Flinch gets the offensive rebound dribbles into a midrange shots hes so confident as he should be when you just downed well yeah hes third in the ACC and threepoint ACC accuracy better than 50 in the home game so far this year here inside the peak so one miss is not going to deter him 8 minutes in now East will reset with five on the shot fly uses the screen puts it up and in nice looking stroke for the grad student from Louisville he is a career 31 threepoint shooter you will not know that by his start to this year so much confident coaches said he spent all summer working to improve that shot hes its paying off here early he becomes the six different tiger to score tonight Pier mod Diaz nice drive and finish takes the contact and the 7 foot sophomore from the Canary Islands ties the score at 14 a piece great star here catches it looks to reverse fakes the hand off goes gets the n one got a tie game Who expect anything less than him Peters he Center called me a diaper Dandy well theres a look at the Diaz Graham Twins and to the uninitiated I cant tell them apart one is an inch taller than the other they have different mannerisms so the folks around them can tell them apart but Im telling you Ive been around him now two years a handful of games I come to practice come to shoot around brand I have no idea I I dont even try I I it wasnt for the numbers on Jersey I would have no idea either and there is Jorge Diaz Graham by the way guo just made that free throw is the older and taller twin and in his words the wiser twin probably say the better looking as well well as we anticipated off the top this is a competitive ball game weve already had 10 lead changes in less than nine minutes well we can keep adding to that total as Caleb Grill drains the three great shot there coming out great kick great find and he is a floor spacer hes had long road in college basketball at Iowa State one year at Iowa or at UNLV but hes only shooting 24 so far in the young season but he certainly put that one up with confidence but hes streaking and when he sees the first one go you best believe hell shoot the next Applause one Ill tell you what the Diaz Graham is every bit a sevenfooter hes coming out strong here hes pushing for more playing time Ill tell you that well he put 23 points on Jacksonville earlier this month thats a career high saying to coach cable put me in I need more minutes hes hes taking that jump which you want to see from you know from one you know early in your career to the next and that sophomore year jump when you get a full off season just more confident here thats where that strengths helping him on the offensive glass Applause doesnt have to jump very high when you when your s putter no well he is just the fourth SF footer in Pittsburgh program history the most noteworthy so far I say is Steven Adams first round pick in 2013 11year NBA veteran unfortunately out for the year with the Grizzlies but both these Diaz Graham twins have upside whether they get to the NBA or that well find out but they are good building blocks for Pittsburgh shot clock under so wer just has to heave it up missed the iron and its a shot clock violation just two tough defensive teams you just not get to the rim easily against either one like we talked about in the opening they just their identity is on that end of the floor got a look there at Dennis Gates the 43yearold Chicago native Who start at Whitney Young High School of course the alma moer of our former First Lady Michelle Obama if theres a concern you have for pit is this right here having enough handlers to handle the pressure pressure from a Robinson sets up Grill who misses honor goes to the corner for three and Nick honor still scoreless here tonight Tay lows the Freshman Applause here as he drives there gets the foul hes got to be the guy to handle this pressure get the ball get his team set in the offense and giving up a lot of experience but hes skilled enough to do so six te foul against Missouri in the First on Jordan Butler after just having come into the Music game so this is low The Freshman Guard from Missouri City Texas ESPN 100 recruit last year tomorrow its two more featured matchups in the ACC SEC challenge for mens college basketball on ESPN number 10 Tennessee is in Chapel Hill to go against number 17 North Carolina 715 eastern time followed at 915 by Duke and Arkansas the seventh ranked Blue Devils taking on the Razer backs low makes the second this is year number one of this new challenge between these two conferences and while maybe it doesnt have the fire that we have seen over the years from some of the others I have a sense that this is going to build and these games will be important starting this year and starting tonight well they matter because come March these are the teams youre fighting against to get into the NCAA tournament when youre pitting your Missouri youre going to be right there trying to get it at L big is it too early to talk Bracketology yeah its way too early these guys have no idea but thats the a great thing about these early games is that they matter come March Joel lardy set us missives today saying both these team teams are just on the outside of the bubble yes in the 80s and 90s but to your point it is important 3 months from now we will be talking about this game if these two teams are on the bubble East able to work around the defender got it up on the rim couple of attempts Grill rips it away and then a reaching foul goes against Pittsburgh Pittsburghs not used to giving up offensive rebounds but they hadnt played against many 75 guys there so ball gets up in the glass and Van overs there tipping it back and forth to himself until Grill comes in gets his hand on it and draws the foul yeah you cant miss number 75 in Black thats 75 is for being 7 5 in tall from Little Rock Arkansas playing his graduate years Co year if you will with the tigers not his first go round of the SEC having played at Arkansas previously whereas mom played back in the day again shot clock at five heres Pierce Off the Bench way too strong ball on the floor weve got another whistle and a foul this time it goes against the Tigers got to expect that that ball goes on the ground both of these teams are going to be diving all over it files are starting to mount up for Missouri here in the first half seventh foul and so they walk to the other end of the floor and Pittsburgh will shoot a one and one its big to see here early Pitts already shot nine free throws Missouris yet to attempt one fits in a Applause bonus Dennis Gates just had a question for Clarence Armstrong one of our three officials Clarence went over to the scores table not sure what they were clearing out but now at the line is Leed on the year an 87 foul shooter thats kind of a chra Chris stroke at the free throw line hes improved his shot from distance and thats just to added bonus with this guy I mean hes just such a winner and a competitor on the defensive end and everyone wants a God and Embraces defensive assignments and expect him to follow any either one of the back Court may see the east of Honor when theyre in the game baits back in honor goes out when you were recruiting legot trying to get him to go to Wake Forest from that point to now how has he grown and evolved his game well I think his offensive identity and into the floor hes improved hes already up to 15 points a 16 points a game Id say hes his rebound is an increased hes done at all hes come off the bench hes led a team even though they did work great on the offensive end last year so hes had so many different roles so its a great train transition into a team like this and hes able to help a guy like Bud grow because he got so much experience yeah and hes out of the wcac thats one of the best if not the best the best I think its the the best league in high school basketball school conferences thats uh in Washington DC along with the Matha Gonzaga PV of course he went to St Johns now Im a little biased I must say because Im a Washingtonian so throw that in there no and I I fully respect that but I also understand theres the folks around the country saying hey wait a second but he comes out of that like you said had a terrific run at Rhode Island and he has a lot of experience he can share with his younger teammates and thats part of the building process with Coach capable layering veterans with new blood coming out of high school theres a deep three from Hinson fto Rico tracks it down able to save it back to Zack Austin shot clock reset to 20 and then a foul committed by Tamar Bates some 40 ft from the basket thatll take us to our next media timeout with the Panthers on top by four of the Tigers but he seems to have gotten over the hump now only you take over a job like this and you you you start to build it and then Co happens and its just it was just really really tough for him and he was able to get a group of Veteran guys in here last year to help him flip the program around and now theres a standard here recruiting is going well and I I expect Jeff to continue to build this thing well his team now 12 of 13 from the line to take a sixpoint lead another part of the Pittsburgh equation boy it doesnt take much to dunk when youre 75 Conor vanover got a beautiful feed from Carter and just laid it over the rim the funny thing is is Ley comes over there hes standing right there but he just cant get up he cant do anything about it not without a step ladder no thats one of those ones on film you just look at the coach like what do you want me to do Misss in a 131 now trying to get back in a game they were in a little bit of a score drop they were over seven PRI to that last field goal and is that defensive change in part because van overs on the floor or is it just to change up the look I think com combination of both well Pittsburgh handled it beautifully the uh pass from feder Rico got a good look at The Rim just couldnt finish at this end you see the Tigers have missed seven of their last eight East created the separation and buried the midrange shot thats it he is a big time midrange shooter there he just got to a spot G ELO shot his midrange up hes shooting great from behind the ark but he is really comfortable shooting his midrange JS that man is hard to speed up with the basketball just waits for you to fly by and Hinson says okay now Ill shoot he shoots it for such range and shoots it so well when he shot fakes you have to go for it quick and answer at the other end by the Tigers to draw back to within three seven points for Shawn East Leed into the corner and it looks like he stepped out of Applause bounds heast is just playing with so much confidence right now I mean its its you know shot field goal percentage is is indicative of your shot selection and he just gets comfortable gets to his spots there and knock down that midrange shot and here continues it uses the rim protection so Blake Hinton cant block it and he playing really well right now early in the year great defense by legot just to cut off sha E from getting to that pass Big Time Defender I I I just I cant tell you enough he just Embraces that into the floor really disciplined in that knows didnt overextend there just the third turnover of the ball game for the Tigers good ball movement somebodys got to be open tell you what if pit keeps getting shots that open theyre going to win Zach Austin no trouble burying that Applause three Noah Carter able to bank it in over feder Rico Jeff Cape was really upset with his guys because they dominate The Glass usually theyve given up a couple of offensive rebounds here and they paid for it and with that great job there just attacking the pressure and again we talked about Blake Henson shot fake ball movement just unselfish play and Zach Austin just knocking down letting you know Im just more than a defensive guy Im a three and D guy as he knocked down the top of the key threepointed there good look at the Highpoint transfer a red Shir junor from Winston Salem North Carol Carolina wears that number 55 to honor the memory of his late mother Cynthia Austin who passed away in 2017 at the age of 55 being a winst Salem native as I am Ive had the privilege of watching that young man in high school and Im very Music Applause impressed under five minutes remaining here in the half fto Rico feder Rico says you know what Im going to go right to the hole but he missed it perhaps the 75 Defender by bothered him van over was blocking hes blocking lights when he stands up so you can believe it that pass goes untouched out of Applause bounds and so the Panthers get the ball back leot goes out and Grill goes out gets a handshake and a pat on the backside from his coach Dennis Gates Pig going now with both point guards on the floor you know moving Bob Carrington off the ball having jayen low low hes handling the ball Music now I think this is an attempt to get Bud going and get him Applause Music Applause downhill Austin sizing up the defender shot it over Lewis but missed to the right Carter kicks to the corner East Curt Lewis has coming into the game from maou back to Carter for three Noah Clarks upside is just amazing hes got it going earlier tacking inside on early postups getting to the rim that time stepping out showing you his range missu up draw back to within a point Applause Missi switches everything and they try to pin you on one side Carrington hanging in the air for two more just getting to his spots there hes three level scorer again he splits it get downhill get to that elbow and steps right into his jumper again lets see if they look for Carter hes had the hot hand through out cter looking for help under 10 to shoot base long twopoint shot banged in for the guards on both ends of the floor youre going to be able to put these big men in ball screens and because vanor was in the game feder Rico wont leave him so attacking him and forces feder Rico to roll with vanover you can turn the corner like that pull up will get to the rim like you just saw can you imagine a being 61 and be then being a half foot shorter than the guy standing next to you I cant imagine being 61 Applause let alone 75 man first two points for low The Freshman from Missouri City Texas for Ben Marshall High School so dont be confused the 75 guy can really shoot the three yes den his Gates actually wants him to shoot it Applause more PTO Rico could not handle that pass yes to Mar Fates is feeling it give him three from the corner its 33 AP piece with under two minutes to go in the half this is something that pit has to watch there both freshman tried to make plays without passes in the offense and a quick shot like that is just like the turnover in the previous possession got to settle down and get into your offense a little bit east whips it to the corner how about another from bits Hinson hell pull from there you got to get out on him and now he steps around the big man and misss the layout just van overa presence there in the middle made him hesitate thought he had to pull up vanova looks a little Gass right now East finds a gap in the defense missed it and weve got a foul on the rebound weve got our third tie of the ball game between Pittsburgh and Music Applause Missouri in here and I asked him as a guy from Chicago and then you went to school out west had you ever been to Pittsburgh and hes like you know what my career ended here yeah he recalled that quickly you could tell a little added motivation there he remembers it well well they were good Cal was good of course he went there out of Whitney Young High School in Chicago challenged himself academically at an excellent school there in the Bay Area but he remember the guys on Ben howlands roster the Big East Champs course would then get upset their next time out by the Kent State golden flashes led by Antonio Gates wow and so both of these programs have a lot to look back for their history and that young man a former Cal golden bar of course he famously Jeff Cel did played at Duke he was a league rival of yours as a matter of fact Mr childr he was he was D people in I had many battles in our day now hes got one of the most iconic shots in Duke basketball history yes he does when you do anything big in that rivalry with Carolina its going to be remembered and it should just over a minute to go here in the half BB Carrington Carlton Carrington Applause trying to shake Aiden Shaw able to put the shot up and over the much longer Defender Shaw is 68 and long and it still didnt deter Carrington its not hes 65 I think hes a little taller than look like hes growing by the day East with a triple dont think East isnt taking this personal he sees his Scouts and know theyre here watching Bud Jr there hes like wait a minute dont forget about me Im leading his missou team in scoring yeah more than a dozen NBA Scouts in the building primarily to see Carlton Carrington but that allows the other nine players on the court to show out and say hey what about us shot clock game clock just about identical Lowes pass deflected out of bounds he was trying to find William jeffris whos just come into the ball game and he will stay in it looks like for the final 9 seconds of the half although now Pittsburghs going to use that timeout and talk things over well take a break as well and come back to the conclusion of half number one here at the Music peep a US Cellular anyone can get any phone free so give yourself one then give yourself the gift of not checking Music it tomorrow at 915 Eastern its another ACC SEC challenge matchup for mens college basketball featuring The George Bulldogs and the Florida state seals catch it on acc Network and the ESPN app and Im guessing members of this Missouri Tigers coaching staff will be tuning in of course they keep in close contact with Leonard Hamilton inbound comes Hinson 5 Seconds to go hes got two Defenders on gets away puts it up no and that will do it for the first 20 minutes we expected a close harport physical game Pittsburgh starts the second half with the basketball in their home white uniforms here at the peak Zack Austin hanging in the air one and done for pit nothing doing on the offensive glass great job there showing you the verticality going straight up putting your chest on was not a foul difficult shot to finish over that contact good job by feder Rico to get a hand on that pass we talk about the rebounding efforts feder Rico is in the middle of it all hes number two behind Armando Bott in the ACC an offensive rebounds per game hes not as prolific on the defensive end but hes a big piece of the puzzle inside for the Panthers usually in that dunker spot and last year their guard play was so strong they played with four guards he was able to get a lot of drop off and offensive rebounds last year we see the block shots per game so far this year nearly three per night Noah Carter boy hes got some nice moves in and around the basket open up the second half just like he started the game getting in the post scoring inside early opening up opportunities later to face up and knock down shots on the perimeter well he was AJ Greens running mate for a couple of years in Northern Iowa spent three years there averaged 15 points per game a couple of years ago and then transferred into the SEC to join the Missouri Tigers and again he he really began his Ascension for Dennis Gates last year late in the season and you know how that goes as you get more comfortable in a new environment start to feel your way around and uh he is much more of a force this year Leed is fouled by Honor to your point this an adjustment when you get into this Missouri system its like Florida State because what theyre asking you to do is just play as hard as you can for as long as you can and well sub you out now if you go out there and make mistakes then well take you out but playing you playing as hard as you can most people dont you know Its just tough to get people to do that and buy into that yeah player efficiency rating is the number one analytic for Coach Gates get in Play Hard Play efficiently get out then let a teammate come in and do the same because if you do that then youll get back in if you stay in and start making mistakes then thats when you dont control when you get back in the game that foul on honor was his third he will stay in the game hes got the basketball in his hands now a coachs kid a military brat grew up in Orlando Florida now hes got the ball back working on the Freshman Carrington hes the one guy for the Missouri Tigers that actually has played against pit for everyone else this is the first time spent three years at Clemson after a red shirt year remember with those used to be red sh ear you transfer back the last one yeah how about that and he played a couple of years for Brad Brown now young Mr Bates has really shown a nice form with a jump shot tonight he has been so fun to watch Hes shot the ball extremely well and got to start tonight and he doesnt plan on relinquishing it well he was a top 25 recruit coming out of high school so its no surprise the young man can play some ball East again fends off the defender this time hes called for the offensive foul but hes got a knack for creating space he does I think hes got away with it a couple of times in the first half and I guarantee you coach C must have mentioned it and he drives left he extends that right arm a little bit there I think he did it got away with it in the first half and that time Teddy Valentine was like no no no sir were going the other way if they dont call it its not a foul that time he called it its always a foul as Teddy works right in front of us terrific officiating through tonight along with Bert Smith and Clarence Armstrong look at what a pressure Missouri has Pittsburgh starting offense from Carrington PTO Rico there he is on the offensive glass and it gets a fresh 20 on the shot clock for Pittsburgh thats the look you got to knock down the drive to the rim down the middle and the corner threes are there Carrington with little step back three he says I dont need your help just give me the ball and get out of the way Ill do it myself I dont I dont need you creating for me sounds like Rand childrens back in the day oh I can relate to that some guys are just better with the ball in their hand and and the adjustment is learning how to play without the ball in your hand and takes time for that honor lost his footing looks like hes okay five in the shot CL hes tried to wrap around but read beautifully by legot hes got Austin with him legot wraps it around Austin tried to dunk it but he was fouled great job of a defensive there by Leed car and just rocks his man to sleep and side steps create space and hes been so impressive and fun to watch oh yeah no freshman in the history of this Pittsburgh program has started his career better than that young man he won the first two ACC rookie of the week Awards he had a triple double in his very first game against North Carolina AT Carrington is the eighth all time in conference history eighth freshman to have a triple double and the only other accer to do it in his very first game none other than Dennis Scott hey I mean the company that this young man is keeping is really something its just unbelievable I mean is his Poise his IQ talked to his dad earlier his dads here I call him bub junr called Dad bub talk got a chance to talk to him before the game and he hes just been blown away and and amazed at how mature his son has handled everything and I told him its credited him just a reflection of his dad Pittsburgh has tied the game at 42 Carter trying to work Baseline he gets to the spot he wants to just cant finish quickly up ahead for the flush by Henson great job of Henson running a floor Rim running there known for spotting up running to the threepoint line that time got him an easy Deuce great F by Music Ley crowd starts to come to life here inside the peak the Oakland Zoo is certainly getting back to the way it used to be Ben Rico Applause blocked Robinson feder Rico there has to do a better job of getting to the other side of the rim it would have gave him a better angle to finish that Applause shot our first media timeout of the second half has Pittsburgh riding a 70 run leer just pushing it there great pass great find there hinston showing you the UPS that us a twopoint game here in Peterson Event Center one pther come out of the locker room with a little offensive Firepower between Little Bub Carrington and Blake Hinson now both into double figures and they are in the midst of a 70 run as a team and a twopoint lead for the home team in this inaugural ACC SEC challenge game its a busy game between or night between the two conferences tonight and tomorrow so far the early games everythings pretty even in the other four games and ACC up two SEC up to and we started a little bit later at 730 than some of them so well get some final scores before we get off the air yeah I dont mind what I see is going on at the JMA Wireless St I bet you I bet you Laughter dont whos Anthony Robinson who weve not talked a lot about tonight the Freshman out of FSU High School in Tallahassee he draws the foul count the basket in one and now we can sing the Praises of the 62 in 175 pounder who played four years of varsity basketball for former Florida state two sports star Charlie Ward great job just getting to a spot Bob Carron great defense but then he left his feet on the shot fake and hell learn you want to stay down but great job by Robinson theyre just so high on this young man so Charlie Ward the Florida state connection was part of the connection to Dennis Gates and his staff but then also assistant coach c y Youngs daughters went to high school in Tallahassee at Florida High with Anthony and then if that wasnt enough connection Anthony is the nephew of Byron Rim who was the head coach at IUPUI and talked up his nephew to then Horizon League rival Dennis when he was in Cleveland State and then all of a sudden you get a new job in the SEC hey I know you Ive been hearing about you for a couple of years you want to come to Columbia hey it sounds like he was only going to go one or two places Missouri or Florida State thats what it sounds like well another one of the wins for Dennis Gates and his staff theyve done a marvelous job recruiting got another terrific class scheduled to come in next year and the building blocks are there to try and climb in the highly competitive sec I mean its hes come through hes kicked the door in at his start you cant ask for a better start to a career in that conference well in the preseason poll this year in spite of making it to the tournament last year Missouri was slotted number nine it was Tennessee 1 Texas AM 2 Arkansas 3 Kentucky 4 and the climb from nine up and through those is going to be a long one but again in just 18 months or so he has done everything you could hope for well he was preseason picked 11th last year and finished tied for fourth so I think he has him right where he wants him right now well he says hes in yeah he says hes in contact daily with Leonard Hamilton in fact he calls him at 1 in the morning if he has to and Coach I didnt wake you did I and Coach ham waiting for your call there are some of the names coach Gates has himself with in SEC history youve heard of some of those guys yeah just a few national champs all over the place yes indeed its a shot clock violation as the shot missed the iron and so its Pittsburgh basketball well Gates got his first opportunity to be a head coach in the Horizon spent three years at Cleveland State won a couple of Coach of the Year Awards took the Vikings to an NCAA tournament and to an nit Here Comes his team the other way Grill had to track down the pass a little long gets it back to Robinson and that gentleman is not shot Noah Carter with two more points the ball just finds him right now hes catching and finishing everything around the rim another unforced turnover there and well Carrington has done a great job of taking care of the basketball but thats his third turn over there hes got to know when he beats the defender full court theyre coming from behind and you know mous done a good job against the Pittsburgh team that came in averaging 88 points per game second only to Miami in the ACC and theyve not been involved in a close game yet this year through their first first six games Pittsburgh blew out five of their opponents and that were handled pretty easily in their one loss by Florida in Brooklyn last week its a great job here by East and gets the angle to hesitation in the angle on Leed and he has no choice but to come over the top and drawing a foul he just put so much pressure on you and now that hes comfortable knocking down that three hes going to be a Applause handful Sha at the line the Louisville native makes the first tonight its another featured college basketball matchup in the ACC SEC mens challenge as the Clemson Tigers take on number 23 Alabama at 930 eastern time thats a big match up there I I am very high on the Clemson Tigers I I think theyre going to be a surprise team in the ACC you were singing the Praises of Brad Brown L during one of the shoot around today and the job that he continues to do there in Clemson South Carolina and I have to agree low turns down the three probably because he had a 75 Defender closing out on him now the shot clock at eight leget challenges the big man and gets denied and thatll be a shot clock violation as the second attempt did not hit the rim either rebound grab by Missouri though before the horn and so play continues watch the effect that Conor vanova has on his game East just really has a silky smooth stroke in that midrange hes a midrange King hes so comfortable there great job catching that ball of penetration hes used to creating now hes receiving into that catches it finishes at The Rim great game here in the ACC SEC Challenge and after a 70 Pittsburgh run maou has answered back with eight straight points of its own everybodys getting involved in I mean so many different ways theres so many different guys they hurt you because everyones involved in capable score so theyre not relying on any one guy Its just tough to deal with theyre playing 12 guys and any one of those 12 guys is just when its their night its their night Missouri is dominated in the lane 20 to 10 in paint points enjoy their largest lead of the night right now as Pittsburgh has gone into a 3 and 12 minute scoring drought and sha East leads his team back onto the floor he leads all scores with 13 Carrington has 11 to lead Pittsburgh right now and I tell you what it does a uh a basketball fan so good to come back into the Peterson Event Center and have the kind of energy in vibe that Jeff CES Club has reinvigorated its not back to the way it was at the height but they are certainly heading in the right direction the zoo is up and jumping right now though they got those fans they got those student back involved y students are engaged fully 1245 remaining in regulation Henson wants to go oneonone both he and the defender go down Legette or rather Leed driving and laying it in give the assist to Henson from the seat of his pants great assist great F leg it gets his first field goal he was struggling from the field prior to that 0 for five and so again maybe that layup get him going Conor vanover slips the screen back out to East with 10 on the timer whips it to the Music corner Carter blocked from behind but a foul is called against guo Diaz Applause Music Graham not often you find assist like that from a seat of your pants but great find great job not not not to panic there and H is leg it on the cut there I mentioned in the first half you just cant speed him up and theres a perfect illustration that he does not panic just the experience hes been there hes done Patel by his body to he slimm down a a bit trimmed himself up and knows hes an offensive weapon he knows you have to buy you know you have to go after a shot when he shot fakes hes just playing at his own pace and thats thats difficult to go with it because he just uses your energy against you when you try to speed him up leg it out the Freshman low comes back in for Pittsburgh Carter made the first privot the point of the game right here pits with their freshman freshman backward in theyve had a couple of turnovers these freshman guards are seven out eight turnovers for pit right now got to handle this pressure get them in offense to get a good shot Carrington finds Hinson who puts it up and in nothing but net for number two for pck thats the thats what you do against this defense get an opportunity you drive The Bigs on the switches Corner threes is where Missouris vulnerable and you can see those guys theyve drilled it its great to see you put it into action to get it yeah when little Bub drove into the paint he wasnt looking to shoot at all he wasnt looking at all you see him driving down there hitting the G you see Henson Sprint to that corner hand down man down knock it down to three got a close one here Music guys you know the fabric of him and just to see his growth and he and his brother there fortunate enough to be coaching at this level with with this brother you you couldnt be happier for him Caleb Grill gets the roll a Shooters roll to make it a sixpoint Missouri lead Big Shot coming out of timeout there coming off the hand off and gr struggled early on and we just just talked about this with the Freshman guards just they got to take care of the basketball a couple of careless turnovers there between low and Carrington Applause and just catches that shot fake and Zack Austin overruns the play and gets the friendly bounce like like hes at home here as Grill goes out Missouri with the basketball on top by six Nick honor playing with three fouls still looking for his first points on the night here is honor Robinson conovers pass batted into the back court and its a shot clock violation nicely done defensively by guo Diaz Graham yeah GMO there used his length he was laying off he and hinen AR playing off this front line of Missouri I dont think the play was there either way but just a great job not too many times youre going to deflect a pass from a 75 guy a couple of precocious freshman getting to know each other at Applause midcourt its not a foul because hes using his low body I think there to separated and I dont think coach Gates agree with with Co and so here is that match up well Caren to learn there too when a guys pressing you this far just beat him dont play with the ball just put him on your hip and go the defense left him all alone and then he missed the shot a rebounding foul that goes against the Panthers hes got to stay aggressive just too passive wasnt even looking to score they left him open and he find himself there alone and you is shot it hes got to say shot ready just get into Attack Mode the rest take care of your hes so unselfish he penetrates the pass he just needs to stay in attack mode another aspect of this game thats been really good before tonight is assisted turnover ratio 37 to1 among the best of the ACC but as youve alluded to the two freshman guards for pit have turned it over a little more than they would like this year uh tonight and thats what the pressure of Missouri does you know they they want to speed the young guys up Robinson had to put it up Jorge Diaz Graham had position and the ball knocked out of bounds no foul that the pit fans clearly wanted call I dont think its I think its the right call let him play yeah no harm no foul there if Bates made any contact to me it was incidental yeah winding down to the midp point of the second half pit down six with a basketball against a Missouri team thats had wonderful depth and balance here Music tonight a little more assertive Blake Hinson will earn a trip to the free throw line but when they need a basket put your two best players in a pick and roll theyre going to switch and you attack the matchup time the guard Grill switches on to Henson and feet get tangled up and he trips on a spin move I love the personality Blake Hinson showed last year as the Panthers got into January and February they were in the midst of you know being a legit team a contender in the ACC and they had a sense they were going to go to the NCA tournament this is a young man whos from a football family in Deltona Florida he told the coaches last year Randolph if we make sweet 16 can I play Spring football of course the answer was no and then he said Elite 8 he said well we get to the Elite 8 the coaches said then we can talk about it and unfortunately for them they did win a couple of games but uh did not make it to that second weekend to have a further conversation about saying Hey I want to go play tight end again for the pit Panthers yeah he plays with a level of physicality like a football Applause Music player Missi just goes on runs they they score a bunches but then theyre also they give it up easily and then last game against lyola opened up with a 31 to9 run with 180 run and they gave up a 170 run so thats just been indicative of how their season has gone they theyre accustomed to going through scoring droughts like theyre in one right now when you ask coach Gates about that very thing as honor hoists it Applause Up Grill and Carrington go to the floor lets see if its a hell ball appears that it is no foul call but when you ask coach Gates about their streaky nature this year what was his explanation he he wants those guys to shoot he wants no hesitation is just part of it they a large percentage of their shots are from behind the ark long shots long rebounds and you know the analytics today they want you to continue to shoot him and he has so many guys that are taking him so theyre just theyre hang they hang their hat on the defensive end he isnt worried about points their number for him is they get to 75 points theyre 27 and0 so he wants the tempo and wants those shots he knows the more they score the more likely they are to win just like anyone else great block there Carter took the feed coming down the lane like a freight train and he was met on his way to the rim great cut there now the two twins whos going to get that block shot theyre going to argue over that was mine no that was mine thats true cuz both of them had their hand on the ball yeah and you its not like football where you can get half a sack shot clock down to three boy talk about somebody who you cant speed up we have seen East time and time again just take his time and score its a great drop there get the anger on us on the footer and finish foul comes and if its on honor that is his Applause fourth Diaz there the twins are there look at the angle there get the angle to scoop and finish against guo and then look at thats a difficult shot getting the angle you try to rush it up because of the length thats there that bothers you but like we talked about earlier he hes very capable of scoring on threepoint line but he loves to get to the rim and shoot his midrange shots so that foul was not on honor its against Carter so that is his third now Federico Federico returns and guo Diaz Graham takes a seat while his younger brother by just a matter of minutes Jorge Diaz Graham gets ready for a second foul shot Jason Caper calls him Rudy calls Jorge Rudy because Rudy Fernandez guard Spanish national team Indi player interesting Grill got a good look gets his own Miss he says that because he wants him to play with that level of confidence as a shooter interesting vanover Miss has Pittsburgh out running good job by Grill to recognize Hansen had the ball Carrington and grill with a defensive rebound under 8 minutes to go Missouri with a basketball leading by five and in this inaugural ACC SEC challenge watching van over in a pain is its they not a comparison is the same on the offensive end but with a 75 guy in the paint people understand how it is playing against Purdue honor with the wrap around to con great find there just getting to the rim saw the help coming and vanover wont get it easier deed than that vanover put up big number numers last year as the summit Leagues Defensive Player of the Year and also first team All Conference he was of course with Max ASI Asus transferred to Texas with the coaching change this young man has come to Missouri but he was suspended for the first three games of the Season sitting out a silly NCAA mandated suspension for having played in PSI they say his game is still coming as as we find out the four teams thatll play for the national championship so much uncertainty going into this game Georgia Alabama and Florida State wins out if Texas win out its Ohio State out of it its just a lot going on there sure is with Randolph chis Im Doug Sherman glad youre with us for this inaugural ACC SEC Challenge and what we thought was going to be a competitive game has been such Missouri has done a better job scoring the basketball but Jeff Cables team has got to the free throw line better done better and feder Rico feder Rico is somebody who had struggled this year until their last game hes put in extensive work with assistant coach Tim oul they were doing it again today after their shooter round and has shown a decent stroke and of course he hits the backb on that one you jinxed him as soon as you complimented him on his shot yep but hes put in a lot of work and hes well as a big guy hes got to get better you know for him to be on the floor in certain situations hes got to be better than hes been he knows that and he has to finish the free throw line you know you cant be a liability as a being late in games because its hard to give you the ball when it matters because if you cant knock down free throws cant put it in your hands late game theres what he does best rebound and defend another rebound for number 33 in white Federico feder Rico 611 from Helsinki Finland and by the way I saw him today as we were coming in for shoot around jge Diaz Graham no I felt bad for feder Rico feder Rico cuz we were caught in a snow squall he was walking with his hood up and Im like man these guys who are not from this part of the country or this part of the world it must be quite a shock I also understand that uh Jaylen low up until today the Pittsburgh freshman had not seen snow but he did see snow today here in Pittsburgh it did snow and and its cold here I dont care coming from North Carolina this is freezing right now let me let me tell you that Im not from upstate New York like you uhhuh it is cold here well Lo is from Missouri City Texas we just saw him sitting on the bench probably thinking about man its going to be cold when we leave the Arena tonight back to back free throws there and this is what we just talked about is you dont want to have empty possessions in the game like that and feder Rico feder Rico missed the last two free throws that was the fourth foul on Noah Carter who stays in the game for Missouri as honor penetrates to the left hand still cant buy a bucket Missouri with another offensive Music rebound has he hit anything but net tonight it looks like he hadnt missed at all and theyre punishing pit when they get second opportunities theyre making the best of them East with 18 points to lead all scores its a 10point Missouri lead pit cannot afford another empty trip and feder Rico gets the offensive rebound and is Music foul just a great job there and feder Rico hading onor sha much and he just stepped back and he has a going hes in an early season groove right now well feder Rico was born in Egypt but as mentioned raised in Helsinki Finland and last season coach Cel said he was as good a Defender as anybody in our leag he was he hes a versatile Defender and when you get in games like this hes able to switch but when a guy like vanover comes in he cant switch and you need to keep him home and keep him in the paint now theyre substituting because they need more offensive F power now they need defensive stops but they need to get more scoring and couple big free throws by the big man with 537 remaining draws Pittsburgh back to within eight crowd wanted to travel on grill lob it and the reverse Aiden Shaw wow he going to catch it and try to dunk it frontwards and the pass was short when you jump that high it doesnt matter he just quot it and banged it backwards coach Gates says hes one of the best athletes in the country and we just got a glimpse of that right there my Music goodness heres the no travel even though there might have been an extra step there for Grill and then look at this wow just floating yeah just Glide just whatever hovering in the air he catches and finishes Im good just throw it within 4T of the rim in any direction Ill get it dont worry Ill wait on it dont mind me I Ill be here when he gets here wow foul on Sha East is fourth and the 10th against Missouri so its a couple of free throws for Carlton Carrington he wont be on a bench long pick and muster a little bit of offense here hell get back in quickly with those four fouls you just got to try to rotate him off carrying to to one of the Applause guards pitch looking to extend pressure here and a one two2 lets see if they fall back to man of Applause Zone Honors pass knocked Away by Henson he gets it back under 10 to shoot now double team and the foul is called against the man who stayed with him defensively Blake Hinson Henson did a great job of moving his feet Arna picked up his dribble there and no need to foul just be solid there and force him into a tough Applause shot Conor vanover will check back back in and allow Carter to take a seat with those four fouls the trigger man will be Caleb Grill from wit talk Kansas pit needs a stop here on the defensive end theyre down eight bover kicks it out real great pass to the corner legs pass to too far out in front he was leading Carrington more to the corner and Carrington had cut off his route yeah thats just thats a bad turnover there by Leed he got to give up a little earlier there had numbers 10th turnover committed by coach Cables Panthers and thats not a high number particularly against the pressure of Missouri and theyre just struggling right now were getting into the guts of the game and timing of that turnover was more of the problem than the volume of them Grill Corner three short Austin may have gotten a piece on his way by drag this screen and attack the big here bub just needs to get downhill Carlton Carrington finds leg It Wide Open that would have been big for the Panthers instead a defensive rebound for missou holding on to an eightpoint lead got the shot you want middle penetration kicking it to the wings in the corner and honor calls a Applause timeout well take it with him the Tigers looking for a big road win here in the steel city tonight quieted a bit here in the second half as Jeff cels team has not shot it well particularly in the second half got a nice cold from in from the field I I think theyve setled a little bit too much for jump shots and what they figuring out too you cant simulate the size of teams and I I thought van overs presence inside kind of controled the paint in the rim and guys would penetrate and kick outside and just unable to get to their midrange and and and at The Rim to finish they made them one dimensional and they struggled and again Dennis Gates told us earlier today or last night rather theres a lot more this young man can give this team as he further rounds into shape and gets used to the way Missouri does things I think thats key for him he has the skill youll see him knocking down threes and be a lot more involved on his team on the offensive end of the floor and youre right as soon as he came on the floor in the first half things change things change that size just neutralizes things five on the shot clock hes lost it on the way up Hensons got the basketball Panthers on an extended drought as you see having missed their last eight from the floor and if not for their free throw shooting tonight they would be way behind Catch and Release pure Stroke by Blake Henson they were trying to get Henson on the switch so he tried to switch on honor and take him inside honor switched out and he end up popping out getting a three anyway a blocking foul against the Panthers guer mod Diaz grah you can tell Teddy Valentine didnt want to call it but when he lost it and went out of bounds couldnt let that contact go and he tried to switch and roll inside then he tears G Mo go inside and pops out and Honors late hes too high on the switch and you dont want to leave that guy open Pitts seventh team foul in the second half has Nick honor going to the free throw line six of seven on the year his father Al honor was uh or is a tremendous girls basketball coach in Florida having won six state titles he was the national girls Coach of the Year couple of years back his son just cant buy a point tonight he struggling from the field and cant get that one to go from the line hon is just going to play oh no not bully ball just oh logo Music Applause ring just give me the ball and get out of the way is what hes saying right now only PJ Hall at Clemson and Quinton post did Boston College score more per game in the ACC then Blake Henson does and he has pulled the Panthers back to within Applause two all right if your Blake Henson your options are put it on the floor pass it or just shoot from the logo yeah just shoot it from the parking lot I mean look at that look good from the second hand this is the match up you go to hes your guy and and he attacks the match up his size Advantage hes going to elevate and shoot over smaller guards if he decides he wants to go inside he can play bully ball so expect him just to go right into a ball screen here and let him decide what he wants to do hes a closer yeah his storys been told many times but its a good one couple of years at Old Miss for Kermit Davis was a good player went for as much as 26 in Mississippi State been a couple of years at Iowa State where he did didnt play at all and it wasnt certain he would play basketball again but he found a home in Pittsburgh last year Blossom for Coach Cel and he has picked up and even gotten better this year from where he left off a year ago I think when its all said done in the ACC this year hell be in a play of year conversation I really believe that and if bit wants to gets the postseason theyre going to need him to be that player no question about it Missouri basketball got to be something for East I would imagine coming out of the timeout hes been hot Carter back on the floor with the basketball finds Grill cutting to the basket and he lays it Applause in couple of graduate students just playing ball there its back to a four point lead great call there coming out of the timeout by Gates Set the F screen and then slipped it C Grill back to the same play again H is fouled by Applause Honor I think if you pick thats the matchup you want you find a matchup whoevers guarding one of your guards with the size Advantage put them in a ball screen Missouri is going to switch lets see if they make an adjustment on the defensive end and decide not to switch and now Nick honor becomes the third player with four fouls sending hinston back to the free throw line out of there there we go thank still needs this one just to make it a one possession game honor Carter and East each with four fouls all valuable pieces that Dennis Gates cannot afford to lose yes back court guys definitely dont want to lose your experience you need those guys to close out games full court pressure here by pit Applause Carters bottled up able to find honor lob it to the ring and rim and the big man throws it down Conor vanover now with six and its back to a fiveo missou lead you dont need a three here but with Caravan over the in the rim he just protects the paint so well he forces guys to settle Hinson going oneonone and the secondary Defender blocks the shot but I believe the foul was called by the primary Defender Caleb Grill got him on the arm on the way up yeah great job there just getting to a Spot Shot faking again has been going forward and forc the issue there but theres nothing you can do there just a l there to van over just standing in the paint by the way I approve of Coach Gates and his staff going with the suit and tie I think it looks pretty sharp hey looks good but I can tell you from a coach I hated it I was so happy I was so happy as a coach to get to the three4 zipups your silence spoke volumes right there yeah yeah yeah yeah he looks great to your point he looks great but I can assure you I appreciate when we went to the three quarter Zips like coach kort thats yep so much more relaxing less stressful what you going to wear your tie all that kind of stuff oh come on its that would you stop it Id call a game in a 34 zip if they let me one Applause minute here comes the scen East dangerous pass to the corner taken away by Pittsburgh 47 seconds remaining in regulation Carrington attachs to the corner why wide open leg it and it goes out of bounds no it doesnt saved by East Missouri with it another big opportunity for Pittsburgh Miss right there they had their opportunities another open look there by Leed and hes upset with himself hes had a couple Point Blank open looks tonight and just didnt knock him down great shots great opportunities you cant be upset about that just didnt go down 25 for yo Diaz Graham in for feder Rico you need his threepoint shooting there on the other end so expect another spacing and pick and pop situation here big free throws here East is very good at the Applause line its just another midrange shot for him course hes going to Swit it he had missed him all night so why start now if youre pit you dont need to force up a three still plenty of time left drive to the basket Music Applause Tamar Bates comes back in or no now he heads back he was at the scores table and then rather than coming in they called him back 35 seconds left in the second half leget left his feet had nowhere to go Missouri takes it away and then leget has to commit the foul yeah Leed left his feet there and drove in the lane with the trees and got a deflection there costly turn over there driving by vanover Carter comes over and just throwing through that length is difficult they got a deflection in a Music turnover just one too many turnovers here for Pittsburgh guards well Missouri has a couple of losses on the season to Memphis and then the surprising one to Jackson State but they are closing in on a third straight win and a big one in this ACC SEC challenge yeah thats a big road win anytime you can get a road win its always big and its always bigger when youre planing as a team that youll be fighting for a spot come March but knew this is going to be a tough hard foro game still time though Carrington no Pittsburgh is going to call off the dogs and so that will do Applause it the Missouri Tigers seized control late in the first half and kept Pittsburgh at arms length the entire second half and theyll head back to Columbia Missouri following an impressive 7164 Victory this a hard for game by both teams
