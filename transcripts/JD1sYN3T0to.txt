tournament Will they be the team that takes a magic carpet ride much like NC State did last year Well find out Were underway as North Carolina wins the opening tip North Carolina Joe Lonardi projecting them among the first four outs right now in the NCAA tournament Gdau to Davis Theyll swing it RJ Davis 41 beyond the threepoint line Pals going to lift that one and swish it in Drake Pal gets him started And Drake Pal has been different But look at this OB Drake Pal at 67 guarding Marcus Burton ACCs leading scoreer after knocking down the three picking him up 94 ft Hubert Davis wants to put size on the score that Burton is Constantinowski had trouble getting up Back to Davis Tay Davis who gets him 15 points about five rebounds again Shot clock to seven Roer on the move into the paint Little bump there and takes the foul and hell be headed to the line That was with three on the shot clock And thats been an issue for for the Tar Hills throughout the year A lot of it has to do with Elliot Kadau getting early foul trouble But look at Burton on the move Drake Pal chasing him everywhere he goes But even when he goes down in denial not allowing Burton to catch the ball easy trying to take away his space Boy talk about shadowing him Bank there for Roer I was going to say are you going to mention that he just banked in a free throw 56 foul shooter He will take what he gets I agree I agree And a rebound hauled in by Jaylen Withers North Carolina the staggering number on Carolina as we look at their starting five just 1 and 11 against quad ones this year Thats unheard of for the Tar Hills as Davis misses his first win Yeah the Tar Hills schedule correctly But they just didnt win any of those games So thats the reason why I think they actually have to win this tournament in order to find themselves in the NCAA field Laco double figure guy along with Burton and Davis And for Notre Dame a pretty average team statistically if not below And a quick strike on the other end for Van Allen Nice find by Elliot Kado pushing the pace and Valen Luben running the floor recognizing that Kado will get him the basketball All he has to do is run to put himself in great position Burton will launch that glances away Good threepoint shooter 39 but not that time And Cadau will call it out A sophomore from West Orange New Jersey Back out for Powell Kado headset Boy if he does a little bit of that today that could be a huge difference Great sign for Kado early Already dropping a dime and knocking down a three ball And if he gets confident this North Carolina team is dangerous Davis harassed by Van Allen Luben who stuck right with him Davis into the offensive zone Open shooter withers to Strong This a homecoming for the 69 grad from Charlotte Im sure hes got quite a few family members and friends in the arena today There is a lot of Carolina blue as you would expect AO will bounce it out Then 610 grab from Ukraine gives it up Davis hits it And Tay Davis can have an advantage throughout this game Playing really more at the four spot but difficult to be able to keep him out of the painted area Very good with the basketball in his hands and showing off his midrange touch Hes one of the most improved players in the conference Hes up from nine points to 15 this year Alo went for the ball and now Luben with a miss in tight And here comes Burton named to the all ACC second team whos the ACC player of the week The final week of the season Little leaner here but short 83 lead here for North Carolina The opening moments of their first game of the tournament Withers got a good look Absolutely nails it And he has given North Carolina You talk about the six of seven that theyve won down the stretch A lot of its had to do with Jaylen Withers coming in knocking down threes and importantly helping the Tar Hills on the glass Carolina opening up 113 early Burton couldnt find a seam Gdau runs into the pick Constantinowski in close for two and Nikita does the majority of his helping this team out on the defensive glass Had 16 off 16 defensive rebounds in the overtime four overtime win against Cal much of a guy that you feature on offense But nice bucket on that end as Withers knocks down his second consecutive three Look out Jaylen Withers and Pal going into that lineup down the stretch Really boosted the Tar Hills and they got hot right about that same time and won six straight The swing for Roer Little contact Cant finish that with the left hand Tried to interrupt Kado but he got free of it Davis will swing Guess whos open again Withers and hits another one Im not sure why he hesitated why he waited However its still exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Troll Price Invest with confidence and Bill Burr Drop deads The hilarious stand of special premiering March 14th streaming on Hulu Cory and David Lets toss it to Angel Gray Well guys just a reminder a good way to describe this Notre Dame team is battle tested As we mentioned now four consecutive games that have come down to the last possession for them But Coach Rubberry told me sometimes you just need the luck of the Irish but he knows that its a little bit more than that He showed them the film after their loss to Wake Forest He said We grow in these moments We battle for winning plays So a stat that may not show up in the box score but to keep your eyes on are the second chance opportunities The 5050 balls that he has challenged his team to create throughout games Theyre actually going to have to guard the three a little bit better too Cory they absolutely will Angel And when you consider the match up between these two teams the first time was a 17 lead change game Came down to the wire and the Fighting Irish had that game one They felt like they had it in the bag but gave up a three at the end and fouled Elliot on the three Made the free throw and North Carolina ends up walking away with a onepoint victory on the Fighting Irish floor Wild one there as he pulled it out by one point Notre Dame from the baseline and looking for a cutter back up top for Garrett Sundra Hes Music 611 Penzi working on Jackson Davis Shot clock a factor now at six Tay Davis kicks it back out Kineszis open Got a great look that wouldnt drop for him And thats been a struggle for the Fighting Irish Everyone outside of Matalo not really getting it going from beyond the arc yesterday Washington tough catch gets it up there in a misfire North Carolina by the way getting off to the quick start Especially Withers RJ Davis far and away their leading scoreer 17 a game Hes their only starter who has not scored yet Yeah theyve gotten great production from Jaylen Withers The three threes for him early running the floor getting the layup and Kado getting involved in the scoring mix But now youve got a completely different unit on the floor When you go to the bench for Carolina they still have a tremendous amount of depth Davis tip in went for the scoop on the reverse that wouldnt fall Carolinas early defense very strong Trimble tried to shovel that pass on a bounce Oh what a great play by Burton Yes hitting the deck but make sure he gets it to a teammate before he falls down to maintain maintain possession Davis zips the pass and Kzis the open man to drill it Dares whos been getting more minutes as of late without Braden Shrewberry for the Fighting Irish Michael Shrewsbury had to get more guys minutes Trible over the top Second effort and the foul And that will send North Carolina and Jaylen Washington to the line The 610 junior Jaylen Washington of course from the state of Indiana So going up against the Fighting Irish Hubert Davis in his fourth season now with the Tar Hills His team settled for a lot of one and done shots against Duke They managed only eight assists in that game That did not make him very happy That was one more than their season low seven against Auburn back in Maui in November And the great Roy Williams looking on with his wife Wanda on his left Also Buzz Peterson North Carolina legend on his right hand Buzz of course the great Mitch Cupchek beside him who Mitch Cupchek and Buzz both operated in this building for a very long time when the administration of the Charlotte Hornets So find themselves right at home here at the Spectrum Center Its the legend section there That is it 188 North Carolina taking on the 12 seed Notre Dame North Carolina the five seed B breaking free for the pullup jumper This is where North Carolina is dangerous Off of miss shots you get him out in transition Great job by Sunder coming in there denying Ian Jackson opportunity at the rift Jackson just named to the ACC all freshman team Sir Mohamd handing off for Burton Burton trying to carry it all the way through but cant make that one go Gau on the run Jackson will drive and kick outside Trembles open straight on Thats just stuck there Carolinas had an opportunity to really break away They missed a couple of good looking shots Mohhamd on the dribble on the bounce speed Kzi outside Alo No Alaco does hit 46 beyond the threepoint line but not that one Yeah he was really the only one they could get going from beyond the arc in yesterdays win over Pittsburgh Jackson for Washington Boy the big guys are making them Yeah Washington can shoot the basketball and thats one of the things that Hubert Davis has been stressing to him throughout his entire career to take those shots confidently Forces him to make take a bunch of them in practice And now you see that work starting to take over playing in the game North Carolina six out of nine beyond the threepoint line Mohamad wants to take it strong Shovel it up there but a miss One and done And trouble will continue to attack Hes not going to wait on his teammates If hes going to the rim and youre backpedaling you are at his mercy And he can make it hurt too 1046 to go here in the first half North Carolina a hot start 218 on Notre Dame ever since they got and youve got to look at RJ Davis a season to go the ACC player of the year but you look at the overall numbers 2640 points second all time at the University of North Carolina third in ACC history and the leading scoring guard surpassing this gentleman Phil Ford one of the best to ever do it at the University of North Carolina the first freshman to ever be named most valuable player in the ACC tournament Could we see another one this year OB could certainly could In fact I might bet the mortgage on it At this point well get a look at Cooper Flag and Duke tomorrow Theyll take on Georgia Tech Duke the number one seed number one team in the country Treble at the line 82 and a junior from Wisconsin In and out with a second There were stretches of this season where Seth Trimble was the best player for the North Carolina Tar Hill especially early when they were in Maui He was the guy that they relied on the most and hes actually that leading rebounder even though hes 6 three and which is rare to find that with a North Carolina team because all of the great rebounders theyve had throughout their tradition way downtown but the freshman cant cash in Carolina hitting all the threes that one came free and its going to be over to Notre Dame sa did a great job there getting the basketball getting a hand on it forcing it off of the knee of Ian Jackson going at full speed kicking it out of bounds Well for Notre Dame and Micah Shrewsbury a pair of ACC tournament wins could lessen the sting of a season like this one 15 and 17 at the moment but theyre down 228 Shot clock to 10 Burton on the drive through the contact and he made it And thats what he does OB He challenges the trees goes in amongst the bigger players and is still able to finish as tough as they get When you think about Marcus Burton getting downhill and does a great job launching into the defenders watch him jump into Washington to be able to use his momentum against him Knocks him backwards and still has the concentration to be able to finish off the glass number four scorer in division one at about 22 points a game at 43 in that four overtime victory against Cal That was the most for an Irish player since the great Adrien Dantley at 49 against Air Force in 1975 A youre talking about one of the best of all time Poul shot air it didnt touch anything Under 10 minutes to go first half in Charlotte second round of the ACC tournament Marcus Burton one of the best players in the conference on the move again Boy uses his body so well He really does He jumps in the defenders not allowing them to jump and block his shot So by the time they do take off theyre actually lifting him even further into the air Irish coming to life and Alan Luben not there And Alan Luben wanting this game badly started his college career at Notre Dame So going up against some guys that maybe were teammates a couple of seasons ago maybe feeling a little bit too much Not one threepointer all season Yeah a little uncharacteristic Yes Davis inside Went for the slam draws the whistle Meanwhile RJ Davis ready to check back in along with Jaylen Withers for North Carolina But watch Burton as he gets downhill does a great job getting past Seth Trimble a tough defender but jumps into Treble direction So now as Trimble jumps all he can do is boost Burton into the air allowing him to be the only one in his face to finish Tay Davis at the line Big Junior from Indianapolis at 69 and hell have another one coming 854 to go in the half Notre Dame won the ACC tournament in 2015 Mike Bray at the helm of the time Twice theyve actually grown to the championship game Finishes a runner up Now a 70 run for the Fighting Irish to try to get back in this one Answered by the first bucket from RJ Davis RJ against Duke on Saturday played in his 170th game He broke the ACC and Carolina alltime records previously held by his teammate Armando Bacott Thats a lot of games That is a lot of games 170 games He is actually neck andneck with Dewan Harris of Kansas right now Both guys will play their 171st game today I believe tomorrow for Harris in the Big 12 camp Constantinowski with the basket and a big guy from Ukraine makes it a 2517 game Davis again tried to make it two straight Rebound picked off Carolina with another opportunity Cado who has hit a three in this one Powell on the attack and drops it in Smart play by Drake Powell recognizing defender closing out on him Quickness showing off his ability to get to the basket Then looking at picking up 94 ft Third and bump before the shot He draws another foul Tough to stick with him And a very good foul shooter too 85 Well take a timeout Weve got 734 to go in Charlotte Our second game made seven in the first 12 and a half minutes of this game And multiple guys getting involved in the mix When you think about Jaylen Withers knocking down three of his own five different players including RJ Davis knocking down a three for the heel Man that keeps up That is straight uphill for Notre Dame When you get that kind of balance it really is And when you get North Carolina shooting the basketball this well they are pretty much unguardable because you have so many guards that can get to the rim and make plays It only opens up space for Kado and RJ Davis to be able to attack downhill Burton on the drive Cant finish that one And a foul against Notre Dame And a great job defensively once again by Drake Powell as RJ Davis and Jaylen Withers both go over and congratulate him on a tremendous effort Gets to the spot and then stays in legal guarding position to contest the shot Great job by Drake Pal moving his feet Constantinowski just picked up his first and a foul Another whistle here against Notre Dame Thats Burton with a personal his first And Elliot Kado slow to rise recent games RJ Davis has taken over more of a floor general responsibility for North Carolina and at times Carolinas played cleaner They have had issues with turnovers and hes a dynamic passer as hes look away to find Taylor Withers for his fourth threepoint field goal in this first half in the corner But GDO often times prone to turnovers as well Huber Davis trying to cut down on some of those get him to make a couple safer plays But when Cado is in a rhythm offensively hes dangerous Speaking of rhythm I mean Withers cant miss beyond the threepoint line he has been devastating Theres got to be something to that coming home back to your home city Well and also theres the finale I mean because if you look at the University of North Carolina if they lose this game they will not qu qualify for the NCAA tournament Two seasons ago when they didnt qualify for the NCAA tournament they declined the invitation to the NIT I dont know that Huber Davis would take his team to the NIT this year or not but I know they have their eyes set on getting to the NCAA tournament and the best way for them to make sure they ensure that is with the automatic bid of winning the ACC tournament As mentioned Joey Brackett say theyre on the list for the first four out leaving the ACC with but three bids come selection Sunday if they dont make it Duke Clemson and Louisville Heres another one way by Jaylen Withers They cant stop him and he cant stop laughing Well hes got his own celebration which each and every one of his teammates get involved in as he knocks down a three and theyve been able to do it to the tune of five times already here this afternoon already with 15 He averages six points a game So hes been the early story Py got in the way of that pass and deflected it out with 551 to go before the break Well theres no place like home Dorothy to taught us that in the Whiz I know it was the Wizards but I go to the Whiz OB Thats my goto And when you think about Jaylen Withers he is finding home to be a very comfortable place here this fall You should say so And thatll go the other way with 551 left in the half and a timeout 3317 North Carolina loading up from threepoint distance behind Jaylen Withers And look at his reaction and also that of Micah Shrewsbury the Notre Dame Fighting Irish head coach Lets calm down and maybe put someone on that guy Man 44 but today hes great Hes been phenomenal far OB five of six from beyond the arc but more importantly the confidence that hes bringing to this ACC tournament and again it was a setback for the Tar Hills They were truly expecting to win the game at home against the Blue Devils on Jaylen Withers RJ Daviss senior night but they did not get that win and they understand whats in front of them right now and when that finality starts to set in recognizing that the sense of urgency of winning each and every game is the only way you can continue your season You often get performances as such And defensively another shot clock violation is our guy Roger Thats his least favorite call for me Why is that Because he does not like to touch the top of his hair I mean hes got it perfectly placed each and every strand And you you can you can attest to that Yeah I dont know if Im in his league though in terms of the the qua being absolutely perfect I mean mine doesnt move very much Rogers does not move at all So North Carolina really trying to put the hammer down and doing it beyond the threepoint line Great fake by Davis Withers Oh its a three He says no matter Davis on the drive and its stuck But remember we talked about with knocking down the threes how it opens up the interior Not so fearful of the Tar Hills shooting a three at this point It makes those driving lanes easy for guys like RJ Davis to be able to go in and just drop it off for a dunk A 10 nothing run to open it up 357 Mohamd with a long distance shot that clangs away North Carolina looking very sharp in their opener in the ACC tournament Ben Allen Luben powers his way in for a bucket is just a mismatch Youve got Matalo for all intents and purposes as a point guard trying to guard the fiveman for the Tar Hills Thats a mismatch but you cant help off of anyone on the perimeter Davis a swing for Burton back from Mohamad Wants that baseline and the long one Yes on target Alco at 46 beyond that three Yeah just didnt have enough attempts or makes to be able to qualify Davis on the drive draws the foul RJ Davis took a tough hit after the foul on that one However hell be back to shoot his free throws when we return As we look game in the SEC tournament South Carolina Arkansas the Hogs have to win Theyre on the right side of the bubble Now theyre up 21 Coach it was a twopoint game Well the Colin Murray Boil said You know what I want to win and I want to go into the lottery He has been dominant in this second half on this comeback Now Arkansas still up two with two seconds to go If they salt this away obviously very important to those watching North Carolina as they would secure themselves a spot in the tournament says Joe Lardi Obach thank you very much Four minutes to go North Carolina really sharp and really moving the ball They are OB All five guys touch the basketball starts with the trim feed into the post as he cuts away The double team allows different guys to attack drive and kick Jaylen Withers turns down the three as they continue to move the basketball and get the easy dunk off of RJ Davis penetration Both RJ Davis and Elliot with four assists but more importantly zero turnovers in this game Only thing thats gone wrong for RJ is he took a shot to the nose That was after he got fouled So thats an old NBA trick Once you hear the whistle the second guy can hit you as hard as they want because he wont get a foul called on him And RJ took a little friendly fire afterwards You sound like youre speaking from experience Thats my guy Oak would hear the whistle Someone else you go in and try to lay it up he would clean your clock rookies early You hear a whistle stop playing on the floor Professional basketball Under four minutes to go in the first half in Charlotte 19point lead for Carolina their biggest reversing field blocked away and what a half Withers is having offensively and defensively And thats one of the things that hes brought who brought size to the front line of the Tar Davis this year and then once they returned from Maui started coming off the bench made the change to get him back in the starting lineup after the Clemson He has paid dividends for the target Gives it off for Mohamd That shot barely gets to the iron and out it goes And coming up tonight ACC network 1130 Eastern after the final second round Nothing but Ned Crew will have complete breakdowns of the whole day highlights analysis and more interviews when they look at tomorrows quarterfinals 1130 pm That must be Luke and Booze coming in because I can tell you right now my guy Beham is not going to make it to 1130 Davis looking in 310 to go up top for Jackson but once again attacking the basket getting it on the glass opens up that opportunity for Vinnuben to get the offensive rebound because twoame defenders had to step over and try to take away the easy layup and two left it in the corner Davis Hell launch it Second effort here on the offensive glass for North Carolina But look at the effort youre getting from And this is really what Davis to make the change to go with Luben at the start in comparison to Jaylen Washington Step back Jackson cant hit it So two minutes before the break the defense has just been tremendous for Carolina Thats three blocks for Jackson Great job getting to the other end by the mistake there was not throwing it up Zap Trimble you can throw it up anywhere He can go get it Ian Jackson with the bounce pass Kind of threw the offon to get off a shot for the Irish The number 12 seed threading his way through Blocked again I think thats four consecutive block shots by the Davis right now Mohamd attacking with that left hand gets it back Panzi into traffic Alco got it Good shooter And now puts his hands out telling everyone to settle down Just give me the basketball Let me make a shot He had 24 points in that four overtime thriller against Cal Davis crossing over weaving inside Hell be headed to the line And it has not been RJ Davis here in the first half Its been Jaylen Withers who has really put on the show for North Carolina from threepoint land North Carolina with a healthy lead here Withers with 15 Five out of six I always wonder about that Ive seen four at least like in rapid fire and I think weve called out all four and yet they dont get credit for it They dont get credit for it but I can tell you right now Hub Davis has to be happy about the effort that his team has given on the defensive end of the floor The problem for coach Davis throughout this year is often times their defensive effort is relative to what theyve been doing offensively When theyre making shots theyre defending this way but when theyre not making shots that times they may hang their head on defense and not paying the attention to detail thats necessary North Carolina really firing on all their AC tournament opener Davis will Tay Davis is tough to handle for a man and you got to imagine the fact that the Fighting Irish are playing who is in concussion protocol Youre going to play smaller lineup which gives a guy like Tay Davis an advantage going up against Jaylen Washington Now Davis the man who left in a tie game against yesterday He missed the second and they held on for the victory after that foul that everybody was talking about Were under 30 seconds to go and a timeout here by Hubert Davis 288 in the first half Well take the break as well Hubert with a lot of good things so far 26 have been a struggle for the Tar Hills throughout this year the 10 games about one possession six and four in those games the most in program history since 5354 Thats going back to I believe Larry Brown might have been the point guard back in the ultimately frustrating Tarheel fans Yeah they got the six wins but they lost four of those games Shot clock to seven with a blow by but not there for him and a foul with 65 showing and thatll be on Withers but the only thing hes done in the first half had a great half 4326 and Burton back on now for first halfberry telling his team and trying to convey relax And that was the continued message at halftime He said Right now if youre looking at the numbers and where were shooting from two were shooting too fast Were hyper He were making sure that we have to be there for one another And right now hes he feels as though as theyre playing sped up and having to take control of what theyre doing on the inside and stop trying to avoid the blocks at this point taking the reigns in the second half starting within the paint Yeah And Angel when you see that we watched a lot of that We counted four consecutive blocks even though they may not have counted on the stat sheet but the Tar Hills did a tremendous job of protecting the rim but a lot of those drives from Notre Dame as coach Rberry mentioned were rushed and maybe trying to do it against too many defenders in comparison to moving the basketball Davis will drive and score to get Notre Dame going No the big thing for Notre Dame the most important thing was in a positive column they only had one turnover Well they only had one turnover but North Carolina didnt put a lot of pressure on them defensively All the pressure was on the offensive end and trying to find a way to stop the Tar Hills But when you switch thats an opportunity have to take advantage of gets the rebound puts it back But when teams are going to switch against you defensively youre going to have that mismatch in the post Carolina by the way they put up their eighth consecutive first half of scoring at least 42 points on the run out pow to lay it in and thats a North Carolina fast break It really is and give Elliot Cado a tremendous amount of credit That king ahead pass his fifth assist of the game but putting it right in the spot where allows Drake Powell to be successful We only saw that best break several decades North Carolina put the fear of God into everybody with those fast Music breaks Up top here for Burton Hell drive on Powell Roer No Gdau The pass and a foul as Roer reached in to commit the personal North Carolina Nine threepointers in the first half and opened up the lead as far as 21 Luben Ben Allen Luben at the line where he makes 67 had some nice games Had 19 against Miami 17 against Pit Yeah Ven Alumin has been a nice injection of energy and more importantly rebounding into the lineup for Huber Davis late in the season This starting lineup is what theyve won the six out of the last seven games with and allows them to be better on the glass and limiting other teams second chance opportunities which they had struggled with early in the year Bird doing a great job getting that contact as he got Powell airborne Pow picks up his third Just getting started here in the second half Great to have you with us in the ACC tournament here in the Queen City Charlotte North Carolina Burton to the line 85 Out to Mishuaka Indiana Misfires on the first one And Burton with that pump fake picks up the third foul on Drake Pal But Pals done a tremendous job defensively using his size to discourage Burton But now your reward for putting that third foul on Drake Powell is getting the best defender for the Tar Hills and Seth Trimble who will absolutely get after it as the Fighting Irish go to a little half court pressure Got it deep there for Ben Alumin knows exactly what to do with 13 points and the target just taking advantage of the switching If youre going to put a smaller player on Vin Alen hes going to pick you apart But what one thing I do love about what North Carolina is doing right now especially on the offensive end theyre not falling in love with the three Even though they had so much success in the first half theyre not just looking for threes up top Serta on the spin Roer thats a pretty play for the basket Nice drive by Roer getting downhill using the spin move to get the easy layup But you see right now immediately theyre switching defensively Youve put Burton guarding V Allen Thats going to be tough Right back to him from Kado and a misfire downstairs But youll take that when you get Vin Alan that close to the basket Youll take his chances against Marcus Burton to be able to get you a bucket more time Notre Dame one and done 5034 North Carolina Ben Allen Luben backing in and hell draw the foul and hes been the centerpiece these last several possessions for North Carolina He really has and its its very simple action All theyre doing is bringing the ball down the right side of the court going screen to roll action And the guards know that theyre going to switch and as soon as they switch theyre not even bringing it to the opposite side to simply just throw the basketball inside the Ben Allen move and allow him to go to work against a smaller defender The graduate with the foul for Notre Dame RJ Davis on the drive and kick Theyve done this so well all day and another one for Withers to drain it But I love the play by Elliot Cado making that one more extra pass to the corner finding the hot hand of Jaylen Withers And thats the penetration that Huba Davis was talking about Attack the paint drive and kick Another assist for the Heels Burton A shove there by Treble No basket with 1616 to go And another three by Jaylen Withers who has been the story today for North Carolina So has their passing been a big narrative They did not do a good job in the assist column against Duke and only came up with a handful of assists in that game Just eight assists Much much better today But the difference is when Duke switches a lot defensive but when you switch when the Blue Devils switch theyre switching a 66 guard and Seion James onto Vin Allen Luben Seion James can hold his own against anyone Then when Notre Dame switches youre putting a generously 510 511 Marcus Burton having to guard Bid Allen Luben and Luben is going to win that battle the majority of the time So Dukes size the tallest team in America makes it difficult for the opponents when they play their switching defense to be able to take advantage of the mismatch Plus they have so many dudes on defense guys that just dog you Flips it up there wanted then Allan Luben to dunk that one but an errant pass and Burton tried to get that one up quickly No theyre one and done again Gdau on the break Trimble interrupted by Roer Roer missed Burton Burton had an opportunity out in front of the traffic Davis nice move but he air mailed a short one Tay Davis with the miss North Carolina in command They really have been from the opening jump Yeah they started off to a huge lead behind Jaylen Withers knocking down threes CDO back out Trible Thought about it off the fake Roer keeps it alive Nicely done Thats three consecutive turnovers for the Tar Hills on the offensive end Theyve done a great job of taking care of the basketball thus far Gets it free for Burton Reversing field Theyll get a corner jumper around and out Elco a little unlucky 1439 to go And all Carolina The Tar Hills operating on all cylinders offensively The drive the kick the one more and the follow through as the bench loves it Celebrating with Wizard at home Team Raino of Stanford a big guy had an outstanding year and Cal and Stanford all California coming up at 700 tonight here in the ACC tournament The big game eastern version The big game is what is known when those two teams get together This time itll be the first time this played on actually the Atlantic Coast part of this conference what is now the All Coast Conference but the first time well be playing in the Eastern time zone So for folks in California and Northern California a little bit of an earlier start than youre used to but certainly hope youll tune that in I know you will Withers will launch it Why not Hes already hit six of them today But not just the threepoint shooting OB you mentioned that Eight rebounds already on the way to what could be his fourth double double of the season But believe it or not two of his three double doubles this year have come within the last four games And the first one game one of the season against Elon at 10 and 10 The long Clean double doubles for Jaylen Wither Davis will draw the foul in the paint and thatll go against Kate Tyson Were talking about the California schools and all the miles that they traveled the ACC going back to Cali So for Cal over 60000 Stanford nearly 27000 miles You know Cal will play possibly without stiff in starting back court Javon Blackar injured making a great play to send his team to overtime yesterday and then Jeremiah Wilkinson injured in the second overtime So itll be interesting to see if those guys are able to go less than 24 hours later But when you look at it from the standpoint of travel I wanted to see I mean if theyre healthy you get a chance to see Stanford went back home after their Saturday game against Cal State after their Saturday game against Notre Dame They came directly to Charlotte So I wanted to see if that travel would play a part in the matchup between the two teams Davis with a nice give Washington with the stop And thats what you want to see from JW You want to see him dunking those not laying them up not going with finesse but simply going with power every time he has an opportunity in the paint RJ Davis starting to pile up the assists again He has six Look at RJ RJ Davis did not guard like this when he came to North Carolina And he has steadily improved his defensive ability sliding his feet This is tough to do Youre talking about one of the toughest guards to defend in the ACC and Marcus Burton and RJ Davis doing a tremendous job I believe they caught Drake Powell for the foul on that Thatd be number four Yeah thats going to be four on Drake Pal And now theyre going to change it to RJ So they have changed that back 1246 to go And so Notre Dame will be at the line In RJs case hes like I played great defense What are you talking about Right And it was a great effort defensively There was contact there I mean I have no problem with the foul but I just love the effort that RJs given defensively but you know and one of the things we talked about the finale This you know this could be his final game every time he steps on the floor here in Charlotte at the AC tournament it could be the end to what has been an illustrious career for RJ Davis I mean youre talking about hell go down to history as one of the best to ever do it in ACC history No doubt Carolinas number two alltime scorer He is number one all time and made threepointers player of the year won a Jerry West award Hes won a slew of honors First team AllAmerican a season to go And first team allAmerican and knocking down another three Also the alltime threepoint field goal leader in North Carolina history His jersey will go in the Raptors And again theyre the criteria because Carolinas had so many different guys but by being ACC player of the year and the first team allAmerican his number four will absolutely hang in the rap Benzi gets a good look knocks that one down Can we pause for a second about Tyler Hansro though talking about almost 3000 points with that career Thats every time we see him up there in four years In four years he did not play 171 games Even more amazing to do it in that period of time Yes Just a shout out there Thats incredible Well I mean you think about Tyler Hansro Theres no one in ACC history that has the resume that he has You think about the fact that he was four times first team all ACC He was four times all American And so when you consider that no one in ACC history has ever done that Kyler Hensro stands alone up top That wont drop for Washington Certainly one of the greatest college players ever Agree Notre Dame trying to creep a little bit closer down by 18 but they have been chasing North Carolina all day here in the second game of our ACC tournament on this particular day Tournament started yesterday Gives it up for Davis Shot clock at three on the spin move He lost the handle on it and it never touched the iron So that is a shot clock violation And we will take the break Moving on here deep into the second half 5840 in this Wednesday round Do we have any upsets in the in the latter part tonight You got the big game and then of course you also have the Syracuse Orange your alma moater coming in off of a win over Florida State yesterday So again it could get interesting tonight Right now its looking like Chalk will go through the bracket as Notre Dame comes out defensively in a zone So back for triple gets a good open look cant stick that Loving another rebound And thats the problem when you play zone is finding those boxing out rebounding responsibilities And it goes right back inside the movement who takes advantage of Sunder the freshman Even though Suns taller Lubmans stronger Hes able to get the finish Lubman 15 and seven Came in eight points five rebounds a game So a very strong day Burton with a blow by Lays it in How about the front line though You think about Withers with 18 points Ben Allen Luben with 15 points Juber Davis was wondering where this production has been from his front court all season long Passed it so well today and they continue to do that as Pow finishes And great recognition by Drake Pal not standing and waiting for the three in the corner but cutting as soon as Luba catches the basketball 16 North Carolina assists and four for the Irish The Irish mascot continues a very enthusiastic day as Burton went inside and hell draw the foul But I mean the Irish mascot is a show onto himself And this is artwork here He is here alone right now He is not concerned about anyone else in this building It is all about the leprechaun Thats a fact He is in his own green world as Burton goes to the line 85 and another one coming and back onto the floor Jaylen Withers Yeah And now see this move by the leprechaun He does he realize that his guy shooting Is is this I mean are you trying to distract your own player Im not sure Well maybe it worked on the first one because Burton missed the first free throw Im not sure that thats the responsibility He should be on the other end doing that when the targets are shooting free throws right Youve got to respect the enthusiasm That right there is March Madness in a nutshell CDO pass is interrupted GDOs first turnover of the game six assists but handling the basketball extremely well Part of the reason why North Carolinas been able to operate so cleanly on the offensive end Rebound tapped around North Carolina cant save it As we take a look at what you need to know presented by Inuit Turboax threepoint shooting last seven games Look at North Carolina a difference maker because you know they won six of those Yeah it really has been a difference maker for them and in large part has been Jaylen Withers Now this performance tonight has been extra special but hes really been a reliable threepoint threat for them over those past seven games Tough drive No cleaned up by Carolina Not a big scoring day for RJ Davis At least not yet But a really good passing day But hell turn it over Yeah for the first time So he and Elliot Gdau both were perfect six assists and zero turnovers until the last two possession each turning it over Yuber Davis slowing down his team which is a rarity for the Tar Hills but one specific action on the offensive end Didnt shoot the three Treble turns around Cant nail it And out of the corner The three is in and out by STO and a whistle as Mohamad hits the floor Just under eight minutes to go and we will take a timeout A break here in round two North Carolina with a big day They were the only team to knock off the Duke Blue Devils this season in the ACC He and Ian Shifflin together can be a powerhouse And you know theyre always going to play tight defense as well under Bradell And this ones 6243 North Carolina Clemson still to hit the floor here in Charlotte as Mohamds at the line to shoot a one and one 0 for six from the field and Visfires at the line So the winner taking on the four seed Wake Forest in the quarterfinals tomorrow Duke is on the floor at 12 noon tomorrow and their first action in the ACC tournament Davis trying to make a move to get free of Trimble Cant do it Withers picking up Burton and denies him at the 10 right back up Thatll roll home as Mohamd gets the basket The first made field goal for Sir Mohamd in this game now one for seven And Michael Shrewsbury has inserted him into the lineup much more so without his son Braden Shrewsbury being available to help them on the offensive end but its been a struggle Davis good look for the triple Speaking of struggle how do you play drop coverage on RJ Davis and give him that much space Did they not recognize that hes well over 300point field goals made throughout his career 41 this year Overall 33 from three They get it inside to the bigs The 610 grad drops in two He has eight Another six and a half left here in Charlotte At this point North Carolina is really working more so on their offensive sets and the stuff that theyre going to need to run later in the tournament Nice drop time once again by Elliot Kado because they can continue to go back to the switching screen and roll and go inside to Vid Allen Luben But Huba Davis right now preparing himself for the remainder of this tournament Youve talked about they would have to win four games in four days So its going to be interesting to see how long he sticks with this group and this lineup recognizing that theyre going to have to get right back to it tomorrow afternoon Speaking of tomorrow afternoon as we get back into the mix with an ACC tournament youll see the top four seeds coming in OB So interesting stat for you Okay we talked about the top three teams Duke Louisville Clemson Each one of those teams has beaten each other right Those are three losses Louisville beat Clemson Clemson beat Duke Duke beat Those three teams only combined to lose five games the entire ACC conference play Who is the team that is responsible for those other two losses Oh you know it That be Georgia Tech It would be Georgia Tech Georgia Tech knocked off Clemson and Louisville But they didnt beat Duke They didnt beat Duke And theyll have an opportunity tomorrow to be able to take down the number one seed if they can make that happen GDO up high He finds Trimble wide open but cant knock that down But they havent missed many of those today North Carolina by 20 Davis drives it on the spin No Rebound pops free to Withers Jaylen Withers the first half was his He was absolutely in fuego beyond the threepoint line It really has been And again its not just been about his threepoint shooting although thats been the difference maker for the Tar Hills throughout this game A nice find from Kado to find the hot hand and that one did everything but go down for Wither So the loss Notre Dame would drop to 15 and 18 of course would be eliminated from the ACC tournament North Carolina looking to pick up win number 21 Remember they won six consecutive games before they fell on Saturday to the Duke Blue Devils at Chapel Hill And they have really been drilling teams in the first half Slithering inside Jackson with a bucket and nice find from Ben Allen who has really given Yuber Davis tremendous production at that five spot today Not only with the scoring and rebounding but also distributing finding Ian Jackson for the easy threw it right to Withers Dumps it off for Trimble on the run Jackson the block and a foul and 359 remaining 69 47 Its 76 for right now One team behind UNCord for two Well great play by Jordan Pope 16 of their 21 points are in the paint Theres a couple of them right there They kind of count that at the paint at the foul line dont they Kind of I count it at the paint They need to win this game Theyre up eight on Vanderbilt whos already in the field Joe Lardi will join West Coach and JB after the game to give you all the bubble implications from around the country Back to OBn Thank you very much guys Great to have you here at the best time of the year I need them to get back on the line You mean to tell me that Joe Manardi and Jim Beheim are going to be on the same show That is must see TV I need to make sure I am buying television when that happens I want to hear a couple of those exchanges About three and a half to go Roer will lift from the corner and knock it down Threepointer for Julian Roer out of Detroit He filled in when Burton missed about half a dozen games with a knee injury back in December Roker played a significant role for the Fighting Irish last years first year as Jay Withers is playing a significant role in trying to get a win here in this second round of the ACC tournament Thats a new career high 21 points for him It really has been sitting pretty About three minutes into the game on the drive had to adjust and got it to go Yuba Davis recognizing now with this game pretty much at hand Hes going to get his off the floor Withers who will go out to innovation by the Carolina who showed up to see a what should be a win here that one of the top four seeds in the Big 12 tournament We got to go back and remember that Kansas won the Big 12 I believe it was 12 consecutive years So the number one seed is where Bill spent the majority of his time at Kansas when it came tournament time 222 to go Old Kansas guy Yeah First time I met Roy many many years ago was on a trip to do a game at Kansas and had a one of the better dinners Ive ever had as Roy with Wanda and my date Oh wow And was that a fun night I can imagine Great stories from Roy Not as much fun when I met Roy for the first time He was my coach on the under 22 national team And I met him in Lawrence Kansas where he proceeded to make me run a lot in practice Oddly enough he didnt make me run at all So Im a big fan to this day Always have Im a big fan as well Kelly with a misfire Brown picks up the rebound North Carolina getting the extras into reserves at this point after a gigantic day out of a couple of Tar Hills Jaylen Withers with 21 points but also Luben today with 17 points and 10 rebounds and Davis and the back court have been outstanding too Our dynamic play of the game brought to you by Troia pushing it in transition and finding Vin Allen moving for the first slam and it was almost like instant replay Drake Pow getting an opportunity in the second half but Elliot RJ Davis both those guys doing a tremendous job handling the basketball dishing out assist without turning the basketball over much throughout this game 10 assists and two turnovers Davis with six assists and just the one turnover And Notre Dame only five assists as a team So you can imagine not necessarily happy with the way his team has shared the basketball throughout this day More importantly the fact that they havent made many shots to help their teammates rack up some assists Well this was not in doubt at any point in the game really North Carolina shot out very quickly and dominated early with a slew of threepointers and they had the lead a healthy lead at halftime and have just added on to that Carolina was up by 14 at the break in the game will drive it and racing to block it with a minute 11 to go So North Carolina about to improve to 21 and 12 Still firmly on the wrong side of the bubble at this point among the first four out Our bracketist Joel Lonardi says but theyre about to pick up their first win in this ACC tournament and looking for some magic carpet ride like we saw from NC State last year They really are But you know when you look at this Tar Hill team especially if they shoot the basketball they were able to today theyve got a chance to beat anyone and they have the opportunity to go up against Wake Forest who beat them earlier this year And the reason that because Wake is the reason why Wake was able to get the double in the Tar Deacons tomorrow Jumping inside for the baskets will fall away That wont fall And Brown races for the rebound Notre Dame with a win in this ACC tournament They knocked off Pit 554 yesterday but North Carolina hammers them on day two And the Tar Hills much to the delight of their fans in Carolina Blue are about to celebrate the win 76 56 They win this one going away in the second day of the ACC tournament and about to take on Wake Forest in the quarterfinals
