theyve won seven of eight three and one at ACC play and a great opportunity to pick up a quad one road win today Syracuse in all orange Virginia in the Home White Music and we are underway at John Paul Jones Arena and its Syracuse it starts with the basketball Applause worth mentioning Danny Williams is out today a noncoveted illness and Steve hey Clark swipes it away hes fouled so in place of Williams its John bowler making his first Collegiate start he commits the foul there yeah thats huge obviously not having his production in the lineup so now its next man up and starting off turnover uh for Syracuse oh they go and for Virginia trying to bounce back from that loss of Pittsburgh on Tuesday after they LED that game by 13 very rarely you see a Tony Bennett Virginia Cavaliers team lose a doubledigit lead Music Applause Music Armond Franklin starts the scoring with a three as we welcome those who just watched Wake Forest in Louisville our ACC triple header continues here in Charlottesville Malcolm Huckabee Jay alter with you whats going to be the key for Syracuse today Malcolm uh I think it starts uh defensively uh can they keep Virginia off the offensive glass and keep them out of the paint thats a good sign though for Virginia start off with a deep three on the other side for Virginia uh guarding Joseph Gerard hes averaging 22 points per game through four ACC games thats key number one for them carries that bucket of five nothing Virginia start take a look at the Syracuse starting fine if you for watching Wake Forest in Louisville and missed it Benny Williams out with a noncoveted illness its John bolajak making his Collegiate first Collegiate start in place so two big men one of them Jesse Edwards Hes got it here Edward trying to muscle his way to the rim crafty move for the first basket of the day for Syracuse and great Patience by Syracuse and footwork by Jesse Edwards speaking with red Autry assistant coach for Syracuse his Improvement the job that they have done with them one of the most complete players Arbon second triple in the first two minutes of this game Tony Bennett told us he likes to put Kihei cars inside that 23 Zone such a great facilitator for this Virginia team and thats different most teams will put a three or four man at that pinch post area high post area Virginia attacks the Syracuse Zone a little different they put Kihei Clark there and I think its brilliant because hes able to either shoot a little floater or you see right there kick the ball out to wide open Shooters Edwards passing out of the double team mints wide open and hes rejected at The Rim Shedrick did well to recover get a piece of it and its Virginia basketball thats great team defense looked like Syracuse was going to get a freebie there and Cedric stepping over and back to how they attacked that zone Tony Bennett said look we do it a little different well try to give them different looks in terms of how we attack it but I think the key thing is look Kihei Park is getting to that foul line area Music Applause Franklin hes got the hot hand early in it continues nothing but the bottom of the net for Armon Franklin hes got nine of Virginias 11 Applause three for three from three to start this game all in the opening three minutes and Syracuse responds The Freshman Chris Bell answers right back with a three of his own and thats great reverso by Joseph Gerard not holding on to the ball he draws so much attention theyre shaded over kick it out and Bell gets a clean look I post with Kihei Clark dumps it down low Gardner misses the layup but Kate and Shedrick cleans up The Spill and thats why Kihei Clark is at that foul line hes able to drive and then if the big step up thats a nice little dump off pass but what that does is it removes of The Bigs for Syracuse gets him out of position and thats why youre vulnerable to offensive rebounds Virginia red hot to start this game five of six for the floor built an eightpoint lead out on the floor and Jesse Edwards has been a handful all season for opposing pigment in Allen Griffin uh deserves a lot of credit I saw him working with these guys this morning during Syracuse shoot around but you know hes been really responsible for the bigs and they just do a phenomenal job the Player Development again Jesse Edwards one of the most improved players Ive seen year in and year out right on cue grabs an offensive rebound Gerard pull up pop too much on it Music squeeze it into Gardner Gerard all out now tangled up with Clark stay with Virginia oh Virginia uncharacteristically and it wasnt a high number of turnovers they had 11 turnovers verse pit but Pitt converted and had 20 points off of turnovers I think thats something that again youre just not used to this Virginia team turning the ball over thats something Tony Bennett was concerned about he said look this home they will press you and then they also are very active in the passing Lanes out of the zone Music nearly into the game he hits big two of them two big threes on Tuesday night at Pittsburgh Music off the Ben Vander blast cant connect from three Applause Music made so quick to initiate and he knocks down the jumper he is playing at a high level one of the best freshmen not just in the ACC but in the country and thats a big time pullup great body control gather yourself and then the little short jumper Applause Music star playing the full 40 minutes in the win against Louisville on Tuesday night Syracuse is going to keep up the winning ways theyve won seven of their last eight itll feature those two guys the backboard great ball movement Malik Brown camping out for the easy two and Coach behind clapping loving that ball movement all set up though by Judah mentz and then Jesse Edwards showing some nice interior passing excellent offensive possession for Syracuse Music Applause the basketball after Virginia jumped out to an early lead theyre in a scoring drown of two minutes fourpoint game early Music ball is presented by Subway Subways upping their game with the AllStar Subway series menu just order by name or number Music theres Terry Holland and Ralph Sampson Holland a legendary whos head coach for the 1974 to 1990 brought Virginia the two final four appearances amassed 326 wins during that time and now currently tied with Tony Bennett at 3 26 the most ever in Virginia basketball history so with a win today it would be Bennett passing Holland as the alltime Virginia wins leader what a ride its been both guys Staples in this program certainly Tony Bennett what hes done here at Virginia National Title consistently winning a missed lamp and a missed dunk for Syracuse Virginia got up by eight early that lead now down to four they led by as many as 13 Tuesday night against Pittsburgh and lost that lead to the Panthers hes been left open for three and he hits it Virginia is four for four from Beyond The Arc to start this game and thats why attacking it with the guard at the foul line area is so key of four Virginia that gives them the ability for them to catch and drive or they can step out excellent zone offense of that time by Virginia Applause Shedrick on the end line they say no its Virginia basketball but it actually was Syracuse out of bounds Applause Music foreign heres Justin Taylor The Freshman checking in a homecoming for him grew up seven miles away from John Paul Jones Arena here at Charlottesville he provided some big minutes off the bench for Syracuse a great shooter Benny Williams out you expect Taylor to pick up even more minutes today McNeely getting it on the ACT Virginias made five threes in this first half well thats always a key when you play against this Syracuse Zone making outside shots and Virginia has come out on fire well in this first half from Beyond The Arc Edwards turns it over trying to pass out of the double team Applause great feed Shedrick fouled on his way to the rim its a Virginia team thats dialed in offensively to start seven of nine from the field shooting just under 80 percent and five of those seven makes her from three and this is all set up because you knocked down threes now you have Syracuse spaced out and again having a guard that time Beekman at that foul line area you have a better passer thats what Tony Bennett talked about but it all starts with Virginia making threes Now Syracuse has to extend out opens up more space in the middle of that zone Shedrick one of two from the line but Virginias already opened up a doubledigit lead seven nothing run over the last 90 seconds Syracuse in a scoring drown of two minutes and 30 seconds in the Charlottesville native end it loses it Taylor regathers under 10 seconds to shoot Syracuse has to hurry Virginia dials up the defense mince on the Move pull up pop no good Franklin from The Hot Spot battles in and out no good offensive rebound keeps it alive Franklin was a perfect three for three from three before that Miss down low Shadrick this is it you cant ask for a better execution everything except the finish at the end but again excellent passing by Virginia off of some really really a good spacing right to the rim Malik Brown freshman thats his second bucket it ends a threeminute scoring drown for Syracuse Applause Applause very patient approach from Virginia against the Syracuse 23 Zone McNeely from three too much on it thats a great Rock block out by Brown Steve Pass Franklins closing down on Mintz Gerard yet to score hes Beekman all over Joe Gerard pass was low Brown regathers for travels before he put it up Virginia up on Syracuse third game of our ACC triple header on behind the series that run with the champ was magical Applause on acc Network Sunday Music youre watching ACC Network basketball presented by Subway here in Charlottesville where Virginia Hawk has started red hot against the Syracuse 23s home Dan its how theyre attacking it you take a look its Unique right here in the middle of the floor typically thats a big Virginia has a guard in Beekman theyre getting the ball to the guard right here and then now theyre making good decisions kick it out but then now you have the ability to have that guard step out the rotations are not there and that is the key right now at how Virginia is attacking this Syracuse Zone theyre putting Beekman or Kihei Clark at the foul line yeah its been either Beekman or Clark like you said six of Virginias seven makes her assistant offensive foul against Shedrick thats his second how does Syracuse counterbalance now that you know its going to be dangerous with either Clark or Beekman in the middle of that zone well you have to adjust how your top or Wing players are playing you might almost have to have somebody stay with them and I think thats going to be the adjustment but well find out shortly how Jim behind decides to adjust to how Virginia is attacking their Zone Virginia Came Out Swinging seven of their first nine baskets made five of those from three since then theyve missed three in a row Gerard trains that one makes it a two possession game his first bucket comes 10 minutes in and its just amazing how effortless uh he shoots deep threes I mean hes almost shooting that like its a foul shot right there and thats a deep three by Joseph Gerard who continues to play well for Syracuse and they need him magic number is 15 Syracuse 10 wins one loss when Gerard is 15 or more McNeely pulls the trigger he answers with the three of his own Isaac McNeely The Freshman carries a second of the game and thats another way to attack his own ball fakes thats a great ball fake by The Freshman McNeely genius already made six threes thats what Syracuse averages per game on the season mans Tangled Up Here Comes Beekman to Gardner who lays it up and in Jay thats all set up uh Reese Beekman Tony Bennett talks about his hand says hes got some of the best hands to make skills in college basketball and then an unselfish play on the back end of that Applause really does a good job being active when guys are trying to get by him off the bounce Music checks into the game for Syracuse at the top of that orange 23 Zone and Virginia has come out with a point to prove after that disappointing loss to pit on the road led by 13 in that game theyve come back at home theyve commanded this game since the beginning Clark pump fake Tangled Up in a foul called now outside your door coach bayheim not happy with that call feels like same thing could be called down the other end is he ever happy actually yes we we see some Smiles about him like angelian certainly not happy with that one and how Virginia is shooting the ball from the threepoint line early on in the first half he was in great form in the press conference after the win against Louisville Tuesday night was joking he said were winning but Im still disappointed with how the team is playing so theyve won seven of eight three and one in ACC play and yet he wants more inconsistencies particularly rebounding finishing possessions they just said the team this year is really hard to figure out The Zone creates a turnover there fourth Virginia turnover of this first half Applause Syracuse looking for a spark on the offensive end theyve already had a scoring drought of more than three minutes nearing that Mark again on this dry spell Gerard contested look and he knocks it down Joe Gerard trying to take over this game himself right now and Jay thats a set play to try to get Joseph Gerard posted up on the opposite uh block against Kihei Clark and thats a beautiful turnaround jumper we talked about it at the tip uh two veteran guys two of the more experienced guards in college basketball going at it theres been dangerous in that high post called his own number and left it short foreign Applause ER dumps it down low to Edwards goes right up with it and misses and with that rebound Jaden Gardner becomes the only active division one player with more than 2 000 points and at least a thousand rebounds incredible and when we show the list of whos on that and what company he enjoys Music Applause yeah theres some pretty good lists and right now though Syracuse struggling to get a bucket some good looks from in Klaus but Virginia has made him pay Isaac McNeely thats how you work it in transition The Freshman with his third three of the ninth Virginias made Seven threes in this first half and its all Cavaliers a 12point lead Applause foreign and find some wow now for imprint for certain right before the break Virginias Jaden Gardner joined rarefied air becoming the only active division one player to have at least 2 000 points and one thousand rebounds in his college career look at some of those ACC legendary names I mean Hall of Famers I mean you got guys up there Tim Duncan Rick Barry Ralph Sampson hatner I mean my goodness the list goes on handsboro a really really good company and just shows the how efficient he has been but thats an awful lot of buckets and rebounds of course playing three of those seasons in East Carolina before transferring into the ACC with Virginia as the hometown hero Charlottesville native Justin Taylor buries that shot to bring Syracuse Within 10 and Taylor theyre really high on them speaking with assistant coach Jerry McNamara and Rhett archery Applause they think they found a really good one and hes got great size that time showing up great elevation off the nice little pullup jumper from the Baseline on his way to the rim by Malik Brown back to Taylor for a second hes played right down the road his high school ball at St Anns Bell field one of his high school teammates Eli Bennett the son of Tony Bennett so really cool for him to come back at his freshman seasoned here at charmsville playing in front of his friends and family Applause really cool opportunity for him you know I talked to him and shoot around this morning and said any consideration to going to Virginia obviously you had the relationship with the Bennett family and and he said absolutely but really loved his conversations with Jerry McNamara and felt like Syracuse was the better fit they found a good one great size a good looking stroke and certainly a guy theyre going to need a as they continue to get deeper into ACC play Applause and with Benny Williams out today for Syracuse with a noncoveted illness Taylor gets a big time minutes Applause 10 seconds to shoot for Virginia heres Kihei Clark over to Gardner who draws the foul with two seconds left on the shot clock Music this was Justin Taylor Tony Bennett pregame oh thats awesome it really is and back to though this Virginia team right now Music well theyre doing a really good job of attacking the Syracuse Zone it all starts though kieh Clark uh hes doing a good job finding those open spots either hitting the high post or the interior passing of The Bigs for Virginia really has been the difference in this game and why theyve had success early on in the first half against the Syracuse D is there a better team in college basketball late in the shot clock than Virginia I feel like under five seconds theyre so calm making the same passes they would whereas other teams get really sped up Copeland pocket picked up ahead heres Kihei Clark all the way to the rim lays it up and in thats Virginias 13th point off of turnovers and thats the other concern for Syracuse right now this Virginia D is creating offense with their deep and its the floater rims out no good Syracuse eight turnovers as Virginia starting to pull away great pass Gardner the Finish Virginia is rolling time out Jim behind Cavaliers on a seven nothing run well Kihei Clark the leader beautiful no look pass right now it is all Virginia Applause all right new customers get our best deals is off of turnovers right now they have 13 points off the turnovers uh their defense is grading offense right here no look pass a by Kihei Clark and theyre making it really difficult for Syracuse to run their offense Syracuse allowing Virginia seven of 11 from three against their 23 Zone its a Zone thats designed to make your opponent shoot threes and Virginias just buried them and then as you said Malcolm 13 points off turnovers for Virginia it helped shoot a high percentage when youre getting good looks and when youre running in transition like Virginia has yeah I think it started off they started hitting threes then it loosened that zone up now they have to stretch out I think the bigger issue offensively really no flow uh for Syracuse a credit of the backcourt play right here of Kihei Clark defending Joseph Gerard I think that was the key coming into this one Tony Bennett said look we must be connected with Joseph Gerard in particular in in the first half theyve done a nice job making it difficult for him Gerard only has five nice block by Monir Hema to deny Gardner trying to get going another one off the mark for Gerard and if you take ACC games only Gerard leading the conference at 22 points a game limited to just five in this first half Music Wednesday night college basketball doubleheader right here on acc Network Pittsburgh right now is leading the ACC taking on Duke at Cameron Indoor followed up by Florida State in Wake Forest Awesome double header right here on acc Network Wednesday Taylor on the Move contested shot and it rims in getting a HomeTown roll just to Taylor the Charlottesville native his second basket and thats twice now off the bounce one time on the Baseline that time not settling for a jumper nice little dribble drive and then showing off the midrange game youre talking about hes got great size six six a really strong build and hes a guy thats going to continue to get better and theres Justin Taylors family mom Carey dad Norman sister Ashley not a far commute for them seven miles from John Paul Jones Arena Syracuse desperate for a stop Gardner regathers rejected Again by hema his second Block in just a couple of minutes and what I like about that with Hema he kept it in play Keep The Possession alive great team defense by Syracuse offensive foul going the other way Malik Brown just trying to do a little too much there in transition yeah this right here lets see Applause now again we have the vantage point of being able to see it from this angle and then also slow it down and those calls can go either way those block charges really frustrating first half from Syracuse down by 15 Franklin from three he missed it after he started this game three for three from Deep Franklin has missed his last two and thats the third foul for cathero so he checks out for Vander plaz a Taylor tees up him on he missed it to the fourth layup Syracuse is missed through this first half theyre getting inside that Virginia Defense they just cant finish yeah thats a missed opportunity right there nice pass by Taylor Hema unable to finish Applause every Sunday afternoon womens basketball right here on acc Network top 25 matchup tomorrow at four Notre Dame taking on North Carolina Pittsburgh Louisville gets the double header started at two before it those were the first Syracuse foul shots of the first half just about a minute left in it Ball by Brown itll stay Virginia basketball 50 seconds left in this first half 20 on the shot clock whats impressed you most about the Cavaliers first half the points off the turnovers theyve done a nice job defensively making it difficult for Syracuse to run their offense and then theyve created offense off of turnovers and then obviously the threepoint shooting they came out really hot from Beyond The Arc seven threes maybe eight if this goes off the mark no good in attack mode he missed it shot clock is off Franklin rejected at the rim and now Syracuse will run in transition mitts goes through two and lays it in 10 seconds for Virginia brown lost his shoes so its five on four for the Cavaliers Beekman lost the handle heres Mintz right to the rim and hes tripped with under a second left in the half and Jay this is huge for Syracuse thats a really it could be a six point swing they were down 15 seemed like 30 seconds ago and now with a chance to cut this thing to single digits uh before the half Music Tony Bennetts team has missed their last five shots it is scoring drought of three minutes and 40 seconds to end his first half Applause for whats been a frustrating first half for Jim Boeheim as you said you could go into the locker room only down by nine if Mintz connects on this free throw I mean it feels like theyre down 20 and uh really right now nine single digit game and good job of them hanging around and certainly still have their work cut out for them but a good job by Syracuse getting this thing back down to single digits going into the half Virginias largest lead at one point was 17 but an eightnothing Syracuse run to end the first half will be an interesting second half between these two remember Syracuse 101 when Gerard scores 15 points or more its Virginia that starts with the ball Applause lets see the adjustment by Syracuse in that first half really start the game Beekman and also Kihei Clark were in the foul line at the foul line attacking the zone heres Jaden Gardner off the dribble rolls around doesnt drop Applause thats a missed opportunity for Virginia to start the second half Gardner pretty good look that time dribble Drive off of the pop foul line entry pass projected at The Rim Shedrick back into the game after he only played seven minutes of the first half due to foul trouble Music Virginias missed their last six shots going back to that first half eight seconds to shoot Gardner in trouble leaves it for Kihei Clark and now Armand Franklin step back three nothing but the bottom of the day for Armon Franklin Joseph Gerard just threw his arms up like Im not sure what else I can do not much reaction by Jim behind not bad defense thats just a tough deep contested step back three four threes for Franklin and now a steal on the defensive side he feels like The X Factor for Virginia this season when when hes dialed in making threes they just look like a different team yeah and obviously particular against this Syracuse team that plays Zone anytime you can knock down threes the way they have its going to loosen it up Gardner too much on it another offensive rebound for Virginia great pass and Shedrick hammers it home yeah timeout Jim behind hes been frustrated by failing to get rebounds to finish possessions two offensive rebounds they Kihei Clark makes Syracuse pay well just like that that nine point deficit goes to 14 Kihei Clark on the offensive glass and then with the dime Virginia back up double digits Im a screen Edition Applause Jim behind using an early timeout at the start of this second half Malcolm Huckabee Jay altar with you theres Tony Bennett a chance for the Virginia head coach to make some history today with a win he would pass legendary whos head coach Terry Holland for the alltime wins leader here at Virginia and then theres Terrys wife Ann sitting Courtside Terry unable to attend as he continues to battle Alzheimers Tony Bennett has so much respect for Coach Holland what he did in Virginia spoke with him before the Pittsburgh game on Tuesday and he said I wish coach Holland could just keep the record and what he did for this place and they had so many conversations when he took the job 14 years ago and I know coach Holland certainly is proud of the job that Tony Bennett has done you take a look at the final fours under coach Holland and obviously the legendary Ralph Sampson one of the alltime great not just Virginia players but college basketball players and what a time it was under coach Holland no doubt about it picked off heres Franklin with a burst of speed splits two Defenders and is fouled Harmon Franklin he just has that look in his eye he is turned on tonight this is the best he has looked this season and this has been the problem right here uh four Syracuse turnovers but right now theyre stuck at 26 in Virginia again you know that is the ammo of Virginia theyre going to play the defense theyre going to try to make it difficult for you to run your offense in Tony Bennett and must be pleased with how his team has come out in the second half and recaptured that doubledigit lead and its all starting uh defensively for Syracuse right now again they just come have to do a better job taking care of the ball too many really unforced turnovers so far an ACC play Armon Franklin only shooting 32 percent hes 50 from the floors Gerard continues the struggle two of nine that one felt like a force you know when you are the goto guy like Gerard is hes on the top of every single scouting report and you get the assignment of Reese Beekman its tough to get your average yeah I mean and The Beekman Clark uh both those guys as you take a look at more pinpoint passing by Virginia Applause over here uh you cant do it any better right here ball fake and then again uh how theyre attacking the zone so its different from other teams you have your point guard now at the foul line other teams do it reverse where they put a three or four men at that foul line area Applause Gardner misses the threepoint opportunity but still up to 10 points on the night Virginia on a nine nothing run over the last three minutes they create another turnover 12 turnovers for the orange now foreign Music Applause ER again misses the layup Applause its tangled up I think he was saying to that with his own guy I think he ran into Jesse Edwards a foul was called Tony Bennett certainly seems to think another look I think he ran into his own player yeah he did he did now I think what they can say they can make the argument that maybe Kihei Clark pushed him yeah oh no thats thats thats clearly a one of those where you need a redo if youre a referee and originally you might have been able to make the argument Applause so Clarence Armstrong explaining to Tony Bennett that it was an inadvertent whistle which is always a good way to say I might have missed one and both coaches are gonna give the refs an earful somebodys gonna come out of this deal unhappy so with an inadvert and whistle you go to The Possession which is with Syracuse itll stay Syracuse Ball but there wont be a foul called on Kihei Clark foreign Music Applause Music Applause still having a conversation for the SciFi about the change of whistle his team down 18 they cut it to nine by halftime in Virginia shot out of a candidate in the second half two seconds to shoot Franklin strips it away here comes the Cavaliers itll stay with Virginia underneath their own basket Applause that is now 13 turnovers for Syracuse already more than their season average for turnovers in a game this half alone theyve committed four turnovers oh for two shooting Vander plas lines up with three and rattles it home they just continue to pick apart this Zone theyre getting quality looks foul underneath Virginia red hot in this second half theyre up 21 foreign that performance was Virginia the whos on a 12nothing run and its been off of excellent ball movement Kia Clark has been the Catalyst for this at the foul line area hes been able to pick a part of this Syracuse defense again another wide open look theyre almost putting two guys at the byline area and a Syracuse unable uh to adjust to how Virginia is moving the ball and then I think also the turnovers have been a continued issue for Syracuse and for Virginia I mean this is Blackjack 21 point lead they are redhot both offensively and defensively and I think it gets loud too and Jay the big number on the bottom of that graphic Virginia now up to 20 points off of turnovers in this game a really hard to win on the road when youre giving up that many points off of turnovers our director just told us it gets so loud on the foul shots it gets out on made threes too but because they give out three bacon if an opponent misses two foul shots in a row they love bacon here in Charlottesville you learn something new every day listen anything free for a college student Applause I dont care how old you are free bacon I said yeah thats a good broadcasters that is a good point right there with that vanderplas 3 Virginia 10 made threes today sander plus he checked too much on that one fourth game this season that Virginias made 10 or more threes theyve won all of them last year they only had one game where they made 10 threes all season long this is Judah Mintz gets his way to the rim for two thats a tough floater but thats been the story of the game right here everything really difficult for Syracuse and on the other end Virginia continues to get high of quality looks from Beyond The Arc Clark tried another nolook pass that time deflected and intercepted Edwards running the floor hes got a size Advantage but doesnt use it opening up Jaden Gardner double team comes in Edwards finds Taylor steps in and knocks it down Music well Ive been impressed with his midrange game he hasnt taken a lot of shots three or four from the field but efficient six points in nice use of the head fake that time again Clark answers right back he has been so good stepping out to that foul line and making Syracuses Zone pay Tony Bennett takes a timeout after the Clark make well take it with him step aside for 30 seconds foreign get two months free offensive explosion for Virginia here in Charlottesville the who shot 50 percent from the field of the first half and theyre doing even better than that right now in the second six of 11 they have built a very comfortable lead in this second half Applause well Syracuse right now biggest thing uh take care of the ball its as simple as that you cant give up uh the points off of turnovers and then defensively theyre gonna have to do a better job of contesting again obviously you know Syracuse does not want to go man but I think theyre going to have to adjust uh at the foul line area right now Virginia has got two players in particular Clark and theyre putting another person on the elbow and Taylor the Charlottesville native not getting a HomeTown welcome they want bacon if he misses this second free throw everybody in the arena gets free bacon and you can join ACC Network hashtag all of the devotion posted on your social media and you may just wind up on acc Network that might be the best promotion drawing in the country I was getting ready to say uh theres probably going to be a lot more Arenas uh taking advantage of that to try to get some noise my goodness Shedrick cant give him space down low hell make you pay back to my earlier comment in terms of adjusting and again its just too easy right now for Virginia theyre getting the ball to the high post theyre either shooting passing getting looks at Cutters four guys getting some a wide open looks from three Applause Gerard contested and it rims in Joe Gerard he makes some shots that just make you go wow if youre not there that time nice little curl off the screen by Joseph Gerard and that is a tough Im not even sure he was looking at the rim on that one with CA Clark raped over him Clark with nine assists this time shoots it himself and cant connect foreign Clark continues to be the operator Virginia basketball Dante Harris who was tremendous for Patrick Ewing at Georgetown really talented point guard He is transferred into Virginia he will enroll in classes for the second semester his plan is to wretch her this year there he is Courtside hell have three years of Eligibility a DC kid who made 50 starts in two years at Georgetown thats a big time pickup for Tony Bennetts team yeah huge obviously with PA Clark obviously going to be departed after this year for Virginia Ill get a veteran guy from the area and certainly with some Big East conference experience Applause fourth triple of the night what a luxury now that he can join this team wont be able to play but in practice every day learn the system so when next season starts Harris will be right on schedule Applause Now Syracuse shows like they were going to do a little extended threequarter court pressure they drop back though into the zone really hot hand hes got range from there to miss that one Applause Joe Gerard not on the court for Syracuse you rarely see that for the orange nearly every minute of every game played 40 minutes on Tuesday night in the win against Louisville so much space at that high post Vander Bloss misses the jumper though Music Taylor contested shot no good head to Shadrick knocked away for underneath itll save Virginia basketball thats like a quarterback going to the wide receiver right there Shedrick a good Target to do it too its six foot eleven Applause but it all starts uh the defensive rebounding for Virginia uh in the second half really has been the outstanding theyve limited uh any offensive rebounds for Syracuse when theyve uh gotten into their half court Applause Nance counted plus the foul Judah Mintz trying to get Syracuse going with less than 10 minutes left to play with Syracuse assistant Jerry mcmah asking us with his Judah Mentor remind you anybody pause for a second so hes got a little bit of Johnny Flynn in him its high price I said the same exact thing and they are really high on uh his future at Syracuse they think hes got so much more room to grow and certainly theyre excited about seeing his progress Flynn obviously a great player for the orange was a lottery pick in the NBA draft a lot of contact on the rebound Franklin follows up his own Miss wave off the basket foul came before Applause Music goes against the Freshman mid so itll save Virginia ball Music oon Arman Franklin checks out of the game for Kihei Clark Applause foreign Applause missed it shooting a lot more first 10 games only 38 from the floor the last three red hot 64 percent 205 today they dont always need Clark to be a scorer obviously weve seen that hes got nine assists to his name today but when he does get scoring it just makes Virginia that much harder to guard it really is and I think obviously tonight uh his was more of a facilitator in particular from the high post area in the file line area I think the biggest contribution though his defense he made it really difficult in the first half for immense and also Gerard Corner three judamin starting to heat up and Syracuse goes full court press Applause foul called against Malik Brown Applause Music nice little change up though by Syracuse theyre fortunate to get the foul there but I like that theyre extending well 15point game again it still feels like its more they can make a little run Applause kick out Beekman in three can connect Syracuse on a seven nothing run they were looking for more but stolen away Applause Virginia no points the last three minutes and 40 seconds Gardner trying to end the drought that doesnt drop itll be Syracuse ball when we come back the orange have cut it to 15 under eight minutes to play next season on fansville presented by Dr Pepper a category 5 wave has broken

ball movement probably their best offensive possession of this second half dribble drive and then a kick out to Gerard now a 10nothing run for the orange after the Gerard three Virginia four minutes and 30 seconds without any points Applause Gardner fouled Hema left his feet the scoring droughts has been the Kryptonite all season for Virginia and the games theyve lost typically because they fall into a scoring drought of more than five minutes we saw it at Miami hit on Tuesday night Houston you know 24 droughts this season of three or more minutes including this one right now for the whos and I think really whats hurt them even more obviously the droughts are not good but their defense has not been able to hold them again its one thing to have to drive but your defense is holding you I think on the back end of that but their defense has not been able to hold them in some of those games Gerard fading away cant connect coach behind not happy with that shot selection by Joseph Gerard thats not a good look turn around jumper go down low to Shedrick keema got all of them but they say its on the floor Virginia fans thought that Shedrick should be shooting too yeah thats a break for Syracuse again excellent ball movement again Applause it looks like hes going up right there him takes Gerard out of this game Virginia has missed their last nine shots its allowed Syracuse to creep back in within 12 McNeely thats off the mark and the door is crept open for Syracuse with six minutes left in this game foul called against McNeely Music Beekman comes in for McNeely Applause Virginia LED this game by 23 now that lead down to 12 Applause foreign Applause tested and it rims in and Syracuse cuts it to 10 Great jump stop jumper dont settle for the three off the Cross Court pass and then thats beautiful cop body control by Bell just like that its a 10point game that Syracuse after a mate going full court press its taking Virginia out of their Rhythm and I think the big adjustment Now The Bigs are coming up on that foul line area defensively feet inside Brown misses it another opportunity and hes fouled and since Virginia had that 23point lead Syracuse on a 207 run including a 12nothing run over the last six minutes Applause another nice post entry past that time coming up next nothing but net crew will have you covered its a wild day in the ACC theyll give you all the highlights and Analysis of all six afternoon mens games and look ahead to the week to come its coming up right after this game goes Final on the ACC Network Applause Syracuse cuts it to nine 13nothing Run for the orange and with his full court pressure and Syracuse mounting a comeback Im sure theres some Cavaliers fans that are having bad flashbacks to the 2016 Elite eight game where the org stormed all the way back to win a trip to the Final Four that game changed when Jim Boeheim went to the full court pressure and somebody Bennett mentioned that when you spoke to him uh prior to this game it was a concern he said look theyre not just a Zone team when they extend their pressure they can definitely Force some turnovers and create some offense with their defense the Enterprise shot clock winding down way too much on it Joe Gerard back into the game rips down that rebound Virginia has now missed 11 in a row its gets Franklin in the air cant finish though Hema almost put it in

imagine if if they meet in the championship and and here we are itll be Monday night best time of the year you got so many options college football Hoops NBA NFL right here though that previous the legal screened before we went to break on Syracuse that was a huge break for Virginia as Joseph Gerard had a pretty cleave look negated though by the moving screen and that foul called again Shedrick his fourth lets take another look at the screen before the break now originally I didnt think it was but right here you see yeah he moved over I mean its yeah he got his leg out originally I was like yeah it looks like a pretty good pin down screen but then when you go back and review it you can tell he clearly moved his leg out certainly thats a tough break for Syracuse Eva misses the front end of a one and one foul called against Gerard Virginia only got to the foul line four times in that loss Tuesday night against Pittsburgh theyve been there 12 times tonight its a big part of their game Virginia one of the better teams and get to the free throw line Wednesday night double header right here on acc Network Pittsburgh and Cameron Indoor Jeff Capel returning to take on his alma mater Duke and then its Florida State taking on Tyree Appleby in Wake Forest thats Wednesday right here on acc Network Virginia has still missed 11 in a row no field goals in eight minutes but because theyve gotten to the foul line theyve extended this lead Big Time Jam Malik Brown and allows Syracuse to set up their full core pressure Applause CA Clark thank you for all stays with Virginia and no field goals and now eight minutes and 35 seconds and yet Syracuse cant seem to get within closer than nine foreign Applause looking to get deep in the shot clock run a little clock give and go Beekman five seconds to shoot its to heaven and he does and he connects Music thats a backbreaker right there for Syracuse they had Virginia deep in the shot clock Gerard answers Applause Tangled Up Taylor rips it away Gerard fires a three he hits it Gerard five points did six seconds timeout Jim Boeheim as the orange cut it to nine Jim behind he got the best look in the in the arena and they are changing it to a three so thats a good timeout by Jim Boeheim almost like a coachs challenge if you will while it was fresh in his head call the timeout getting the officials here they take a look at it and Syracuse gets a point back so this lead is down to eight Virginia once led by 23 and here come the orange down the stretch its Virginia ball Cavaliers twotimeout Syracuse have zero the rest of Regulation and the full court pressure now if your Syracuse look you have everybody up you just dont want to get beat long theres no and now looks like Jesse Edwards is going to come back and play safety uh for Syracuse Applause heres Beekman Virginia winding down this shot clock Beekman left open so shoots and connects ends a sixnothing Syracuse run thats just great patience Gerard from the logo misfires a Virginia Shadrick up ahead layup and in for two minutes its counted plus the foul count the basket for the Freshman Judah mints he could create his own shot almost better than anybody I mean that is a big time bucket against one of the better onball defenders in college right here just going right through Kihei Clark take the contact and then the soft touch and finish thats a big time bucket by The Freshman judamins Syracuses backcourt has delivered in this game Mintz with 18 Gerard 17 so those two combined for 35 you need to create a turnover tough to do against Beekman and Clark foul comes in Sophie been shooting Music third foul against mids Virginia shooting two the rest of the way Jay I think the big number the end of this game really has been points over turnovers both teams really turning it over Virginia 23 points off the turnovers Syracuse has 17 so offset plus six I think though it was the early hole if you go back and look at this game the early hole that Syracuse put themselves in uh with all the turnovers they had really just couldnt get close enough with those missed opportunities going off the bounce again Edwards cleans up the spill eightpoint game 65 seconds left Syracuse has to foul and they do Applause credit though Syracuse hanging around in this game good still far from over 57 seconds left but it just felt like Virginia was going to push this lead even further Syracuse continue though to hang around I think the change up that full court pressure Applause or really forced some turnovers late to end this second half and kept them right within Striking Distance yeah when UVA went up 23 in the second half youre thinking this game is over they credit Syracuse they punch back but really couldnt get closer than nine Gerard hard foul by Beekman and again this is an orange team playing without Benny Williams Applause teams down they just showed a replay of the foul on the video monitor here John Paul Jones Arena home fans not happy with the call Tony Bennett was telling the refs he felt like there was a hip check by Jesse Edwards and I dont think there was much there does it look as obvious right there Music credit to Virginia theyve somehow held on to this lead only scoring three field goals in the last 11 minutes theyve done a good job getting to the foul line and theyll head there again Beekman and Reese is three of four from the foul line today Applause Applause Applause well Virginia well over that four free throw attempts and theyre lost to pit theyve done the line 20 times today theyve made 15 of those free throws Bella three hits it a furious Syracuse Rally from down 23 now down seventh Syracuse letting a lot of time tick off the clock Applause 13 Seconds come off the clock before Syracuse finally fouls its a lot of time Applause thats the fifth foul against the Freshman Chris bow so hes fouled out of this game foreign Music four of five from the foul line in this game this is the first Applause okay for Virginia right now obviously you cannot foul but you have to have pretty good transition and then obviously threepoint a defense against Syracuse Franklin missed them both Gerard rejected painted Shadrick says get that out of here under 15 seconds left Gerard missed it bounces out Taylor goes up strong he cant connect in Virginia hangs on and with this win Tony Bennett passes legendary whos head coach Terry Holland and becomes the alltime wins leader at the University of Virginia hard fought win but it all came down to the staple of Tony Bennett their defense uh 23 points uh off of turnovers their defense held when they went through that scoring drought and oh what a career but now Tony Bennett is the
