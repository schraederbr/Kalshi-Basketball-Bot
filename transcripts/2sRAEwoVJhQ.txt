five Hokies and double figures and they will welcome Miami here on Tuesday night Pitt will host Georgia Tech at the Peterson Event Center for Dan Bonner West Durham thanks to our producer Daniel Gibbons our director Eric Bray now off to Louisville heres Joel Cadet and Malcolm Huckabee reach in there for Hunter Tyson and the leak out with the layin is good and Clemson is off and rolling tonight here in Louisville alongside Malcolm Huckabee Joel gaudette this is a game that Clemson has to have on the bubble right now Joe lunardi has this Clemson Tigers team outside the NCAA field of 68 huge Road matchup yeah this was one they have to have against the Louisville team that has been playing much better as of late anything for Louisville turnovers they must keep their turnovers down when we spoke with Kenny Payne he said we have to do a good job against this Clemson defense that wants to try to make it difficult for him now like I dont want to go on a sunnier for Kenny Payne if thats a turnover but at least it was a dead ball turnover Applause keeps Clemson from having the chance to run out and score in transition its been a turnover issue from Louisville this year no ifs ands or buts about it its been a tough season for Kenny Payne his Squad forces one just three and 22 a very young bunch strong drive to the bucket good pass inside and the layup is good for Sydney Curry calm confident interior passing though but thats great price a Patience by trainer though didnt settle for a jumper worked the ball into the paint and a nice little dump off fast and Currys got a great set of hands you cant lose those two guys that just touched the ball boss green defense Clemson does a lot of stuff out of their horns action and Hall is such a good screener if you do not communicate he is very good at slipping screens or rolling hard like he did that last time after screens you must communicate if youre movable its playing better you can see the wreck three and 23 have a chance to beat the team though on Wednesday in Uva shot clock at two could be another turnover no its a bucket El Ellis big reason why Louisvilles playing better right now hard to find somebody playing better his last two games you talked about it top ranked uh top 25 team in Virginia uh went off for 21 his last two hes averaging 27 points per game hes one of the better scoring guards not just in the ACC but in college basketball L Ellis first Miss for Clemson Tigers and started three for three theres the ball screen Korean Ellis Ellis Jitterbug guy Im gonna say it again and repeat myself he is one of the better scoring guards not just in the ACC but in college hes put up some really good numbers against a really good defensive teams turnover Louisville to the rack yes the reverse Jalen Withers they have come out tonight in Louisville theyve got something to cheer about early six nothing run deep three and Hall off kilter big rebound Tyson missed L Ellis good kick they are honoring the 2013 team that won the national championship game here at Louisville tonight so it is a massive crowd when you have that happen you have to get out to a big start take advantage of the home base and thats something Kenny Payne talked about this right here he said we must get off to a good start but we cannot have a flow start against the Clemson team where they know its at stake right now on the bubble this is an important game real chance to be spoiler here Louisville trying to keep Clemson out of the big dance heres Galloway back out to holes three and its dried up now for Clemson over the back called for the first foul on Hunter Tyson but it is Louisville the momentum the defense the Moxie Cardinals putting it together Music and he has been really playing some great ball for Louisville one of the most dynamic guards in college basketball can score on all three levels midrange game is Elite but when he starts knocking down jumpers really he is a matchup nightmare and a credit the work that the coaching staff in particular assistant coach Nolan Smith uh Danny Manning that theyve done with L Ellis they started watching video with him in terms of all of his turnovers earlier hunt in the season uh turnovers were an issue that has changed over really the last five or ten games hes been much better with the ball in credit these guys in particular Nolan Smith the job that he has done working with him playing that point guard position Nolan Smith phenomenal career for Mike krzyzewsky and Duke and it was funny talking to Kenny Payne not only did they show Ellis the video of the turnovers they only showed L Ellis video of turnovers back to back to back to drill the point home and then realize the consistent mistakes that you can fix theres Ellis missed it but a great rebound putback and Brandon Huntley Hatfield makes an impact Off the Bench Louisvilles rolling they are and I think the biggest thing their energy that has been the big thing for them as though got nailed with a screen working on the glass rising up hole hit from behind the second trip to the freethrow line here for PJ hole go back to that video point if if and you get sat down by your coach and they just show you look at what you have to fix whats that do to you well film doesnt lie again A lot of times as a player you may think youre doing something right and then you see the turnovers you see some of the bad decisions uh it just makes you see and slow down a little bit and get you thinking a little bit more about some of the reads that youre making and certainly its had a positive effect on El Ellis again the numbers that he has put up over the last uh two games against some really good teams anytime you can go 20 plus against Virginia you know youre pretty good at scoring foul was on Huntley Hatfield PJ Hall picks up one the other side of that is they also showed El Ellis video not of him but of the top five point guards that the coaching staff deemed were playing in the NBA right now and said look what they do look what you can do Triple Threat position off the ball screen well hes going to have a tough pass though this Clemson team very good defensively and they do a great job of that right there contesting BJ Hall getting out contesting the shot and then they do a good job defensive rebounding Applause quick switch in the screen Paul open gave it up plenty of time Tyson wants three and an easy rebound from Mike James early wave of emotion here for Louisville well the arena has calmed down a little bit now so you have to be able to play smart you cant play on the emotion Galloway wants three around and out offensive rebound Clemson not great on the o glass but where do the best threes come from then off of offense rebound the early end is game right now Clemson doing a great job getting Second Chance opportunities and PJ Hall benefiting from that right there again Louisvilles gonna have to do a good job cleaning up the defensive glass right now Clemson getting their way Paul has nine of his teams 11 Galloway now has his first two turnovers and that is again the theme thats been the Achilles heel for this Louisville team turnovers Applause Louisville has won the turnover battle twice this season in 25 games part of being a young team a little bit theres another turnover its Galloway again Applause Butterfingers collected by Hunter besides shefflin might have shuffled his feet again collected his Miss and then the whistle for a hell Pole well go the other direction Applause 13 years for Brad Brownell he would be the coach of the year in this league if there wasnt a guy named Jeff cable yeah were they doing an outstanding job and always enjoying all these boxes but enjoy speaking with Brad Brown now uh very Frank very straightforward and you look at what he has done hes put together a really nice resume you know again this team right here right now Joe linardi has them outside looking in he knows the importance of this game they have to take care of business on road on the road against this Louisville team cant lose quad four games not this late lands doesnt get the role first action for Kamari lands The Freshman Off the Bench starting the last couple games Applause and a block called on Louisville this is a sixnothing Clemson run they had missed six straight shots Prior first foul on L Ellis and thats a nice read by Galloway again hes a guy thats out there to space the floor so hes going to have guys running at him that time little head fake and it got into the lane looking to do a Euro but again hes a Scouting Report guy one of those guys where you have to stay connected Kenny Payne said look you have to be there on the catch if not thats too late hes going to get a three off able to pick up a couple of free throws it has been all two guys for Clemson PJ Hall has nine points Chaz Galloway has four there is a hunter Tyson bucket in there Music really true threepoint lead for the road team now how does Louisville deal with this so many times the Cardinals have had leads and not been able to hold on to them especially early in games well the biggest thing is ball movement Kenny Payne talked about this they cannot get stagnant in their ball movement where too much dribbling he said the ball must move we saw them and shoot around this afternoon moving the ball and then obviously turnovers you look at that Virginia game where they almost pulled off the upset but Virginia had 13 points off the turnovers in that game Applause shot clock is at 10 here Mike James they love what they see from the freshman trainer wants three and trainer has three and Louisville right back in it momentum is important and when youre a team like Louisville Malcolm you cant fall behind big yeah and thats their best offensive possession early in this game ball went left to right dribble drive and then kicked it back out Galloway ball dominant left hand and thats twice now Galloway putting it down on the floor playing off the bounce known as more of a catch and shoot guy but thats a nice move and finish with the left hand hes a Savvy guy is what he is played some good defense here in the first nine minutes my mans 25 years old Applause Brevin Galloways the oldest man in the ACC Ive five on the shot clock Hundley Hatfield gotta go and thats great d by Clemson and thats what they do of playing that Gap pack line defense theyre not going to give you many dribble drives of where you dont have bodies in front of you and theyre going to force you to shoot some contested shots a good pick and roll early in the possession with middle books Hunter settles for the long run and the rebound help me Hatfield Applause Ellis has been quiet here in this second four minute War well thats an assist JJ trainer eight points couple of Threes he shoots 27 its a great sign by L Ellis again not holding on the ball too long defensive missed assignment and then the Brevin Galloway just broke the ankles of like James hes gonna go to the free throw line the foul is the second on Huntley Hatfield let us donations interesting peace let me bring in my expert Music so many scratches those are from my car keys such a rich history this wont do well at auction but at A T its worth a brand new Samsung Galaxy s23 wait really what about this at Ts deal is bad everyone gets a

week as part of the initiative members of Clemson and Louisvilles universities Join one another on the court to demonstrate their commitment to seeing each other as equals and treating each other with respect and dignity at all times recognizing that our differences do not divide us but instead make us stronger here in Louisville tonight it is a one point lead for Louisville that doesnt make a lot of sense theyre three and 23 Clemson is on the bubble right now 114 the standings also dont make a lot of sense Pitt was 14th preseason Clemson was 11th Malcolm I think that just means we should stop polls Ill tell you right now though its a big reason why Jeff Capel would fit and Brad Brown now two guys at the top of the list for Coach of the Year ndacc and uh you see though whats at stake as we get closer to March and Brad Brown now knows uh this is not going to be an easy test on the road against this Louisville team that when they make swings of the ball in terms of ball movement and dont turn it over they are not an easy out Brevin Galloway both free throws he now has eight straight points for Clemson he only needs what 31 more to equal Imani Bates from a couple of weeks ago wheeler stuffed there was no foul called thats a baseline call and the ball stays here good defense it is and thats just great team defense right there youll see this with Clinton a lot of that pack line defense when you drive on them youre going to be assured to have bodies rotating over thats a great job that time of blocking and then not fouling and two Young Guns RJ Godfrey is a freshman makes a play on the sophomore tough handle and a foul that time Percy Miller will head to the freethrow line Applause fouls on Josh Beetle thats his first just about a point and a half a game from the transfer from Xavier Hershey Miller the son of Percy Miller brother of Romeo reminder to fans to download the ACC threepoint challenge app presented by New York Life to help benefit the local Boys and Girls Clubs score points for your school and after the ACC tournament the local Boys and Girls Club will receive a donation from New York Life based on their Affiliated ACC teams final ranking now Louisville changes their defense up shows a little threequarter court press here and that looks like theyre going to drop back into man Applause Music Clemson hit its first three shots three for 12 cents inside the rookie stuffed Godfrey just ran into a man JJ Trainor both ends of the Court here early and thats a great recovery because it was a beautiful seal and post entry pass looked like he was going to get an easy dunk right there again thats a great seal but trainer with the long arms and thats where that length comes in you cant appreciate his link until youre right up on him seems like hes got a 72 wingspan very long and athletic shot clocks at six here on the inbounds the PJ hole most improved player this team has from a year ago and then rolls around and down matter of fact Coach K called him the most improved player on the planet last season and people dont appreciate how good he is hes played through injuries but he gives Clemson a true low post presence and also can step out on the threepoint line as well too he is really a matchup problem for opposing teams when he gets it going can you imagine what the season would be like for PJ Hall if he didnt have that black sleeve on his right leg there in the lane injured his kneecap in the summer coming back from a foot injury and a hell of ball in the lane with a shot clock at two so really has just started to hit his stride PJ Hall over the last six seven weeks getting healthy right at the right time but again back to that Clemson defense L Ellis is going to see a steady stream of bodies when he drives the ball its not going to be clear path theres going to be Clemson shirts in front of him two seconds gotta go to L Ellis and Applause he is so good but then you have to get down the court or that happens Alex Hemingway in with the air ball Clemson one of seven from three although its foursome turnovers on its defensive end and a kicked ball to also be possession to the Tigers foreign ER goes out we got Mike James back in Kenny Payne talking to him right now look theres going to be bodies so thats a good thing again now you got to make a read and find somebody open hes drawing two and three Defenders when hes getting dribble drives now its got to be a read either kick out to a shooter or dump off down low to a big but Clinton is not going to allow him to get straight line drives to the basket L Ellis checks out as well thats a development like LLS is a scoring first point guard how do you become a Distributing first point guard its a process and thats why we are the coaching staff were really working with him and hes made Improvement as this season has gone along in that area Clemsons now one of eight from three Applause Louisvilles played with the lead much of this first half Curry gets rattled then Curry stepped out of bounds Brad Brownell saw it right on the bench for Clemson Louisville leads it by one at home seven lead changes thats one of them Music Im a screen addicted here late in the first half against Clemson however Malcolm Huckabee Clemson defense has impressed you yeah and if this was key number one when we asked Brad Brown now stopping L Ellis he wanted to create a bodies in front of him thats their back line defense right there any time he drives he wants one or two Defenders there to cut it off and thats going to be key as we watch this game progress of the job that they do on L Ellis and as you take a look at Brad brownells Mantra doing the little things that add up to a lot and I think you you look at it the team goals the three straight stops seven times and then two shot clock violations theyre almost there they got the shot clock violation on the first possession just checking off boxes here tonight and that was a pass to nobody turnover by Brevin Galloway is the third by Clemson so much on the line for this Tigers team tonight they are outside looking in according to our bracketologist Joe lunardi tonight they were the last team in in Joes brackets on Wednesday so things have shifted a little bit the ACC currently ticketed for five teams in the field inside Mike James fouled and one Louisville throwing its lead Clemson has a couple of hurdles left theyve got this game which would be a quad 4 loss they have another at Notre Dame but two quad one opportunities still too yeah they do and theyre going to need the uh Louisville more of this right here again Clemsons a team that wants to take you out of your offensive flow youre gonna have to have guys go and make individual plays like that beautiful finish by James with the left hand all three points there with the foul on Galloway these are those moments Malcolm where Clemson just has to beat Clemson right like such a veteran team dont get rattled by this well I think the big thing for them theyve settled for some threes early theyre not shooting at a high clip try to get PJ Hall off of a roll and then let him get a paint touch when they settle for a three and finally it drops just two for ten thats Chase Hunter his first points when in doubt keep teeing it up that though a pretty clean look and Kenny Payne wants to limit of the open looks for Clemson from Beyond the yard Hunter has the assignment now on LLS into Curry down a foul on PJ Hull his first Applause lets talk about that veteran leadership for Clemson dumbfounded by the way the PJ Hall acted in shoot around today he stopped shoot around at one point and instructed his teammates in a drill first time Ive ever seen that in a shoot around where theyre going through the opposing teams plays and BJ Hall stop got on the second unit and thats actually explaining and said no this is how were supposed to be guarding this particular play that they were going over and then he gets set to take leadership in practice Applause I love what this young man brings to the table that is Big Time defensive stopping that chest might be short score tomorrow that is uh two big mountains going at it well and how hard is what just happened because Hall got beat he had to recover Applause now a foul on the region against Kamari lands when your legs get twisted up in the lane like that thats not an easy recovery now and again thats one of the things though that Clemson is very good at recovering anytime you think you have an open Lane they just shut it down right now though I think offensively yesterday hit a three trying to get a couple of paint touches like that inside ryzen Rock for PJ Hall he has 13 of his teams 26 thats just excellent ball movement all set up though by the spacing and then their ability to knock down threes you have to respect it wide open three thats the one guy you cant let have a wide open three as soon as he was open Brad prawnell turned around almost before the shot even hit the rim and the bottom of the net he just knew that was a mistake and breakdown in communication uh by the Clemson d Applause floor Mike James tried to sell that very hard but hes going to get about 13 000 people on his side okay Kenny Payne gave harappa air full and he thought he was there now again its all on where the angle is the rep and we have a veteran crew uh is in pretty good position again thats the key thing his angle a lot better than what were seeing but the Louisville fans certainly you want nothing of that whatsoever they felt there should have been a charge theres one job in America that everybody thinks they can do referee Roger Ayers and crew tonight theres another steal by Galloway good stutter in transition he knew where Mike James was the whole time and thats twice now hes just read the play uh hes got two steals just like that where uh hes anticipated the pass this is where Louisville ball fake and then youre going to have a back door cut hes just looking to shoot the gap no they did it again active hands Hunter with the dump off in the dunk boy we havent seen Hunter Tyson at all in this game hes Clemsons leading scorer and hes got the momentum for the Tigers on the league out if youre loud be louder if you stand out stand strong and if you got the devil on your shoulder take him for a ride Malcolm 9 turnover is leading to eight points here thats one of the big differences it is and you cant run transition offense any better right here finished off with the dunk and Rob ronnell new coming into this one on the road if they can get some points off of turnovers to loosen up this team Louisville that has been playing much better that they were going to have a pretty good chance on the road and thats what theyre doing right now theyre getting it done but with their offense above their defense offensively they have not really particularly shot the ball that well two of 10 from the threepoint line but defensively theyve been able to get 10 points off of turnovers and thats really been the difference right now Hammer meeting the nail uh incessantly here but turnovers for Louisville has been the problem this season on the whole exacerbated by the fact that the ACC is the third best conference in the country at valuing the bowl so you give yourself even fewer opportunities when your opponents dont turn it over inside here for Louisville out of the timeout Huntley Hatfield misses short and theres Hunter Tyson with the glass just his second bucket off that last turnover with that leak out dunk Applause cut and the whistle underneath goes against the Tigers RJ Godfreys second run off the bench The Freshman out of Georgia and that was a good job of Team defense that time by Louisville again when you play uh Clemson theyre going to set good screens theyre very physical so theyre going to set good screens and then they cut so hard so you have to have good communication and then when you get beat you have to recover your help side must be on point is there a more physical team in this league not many again you watch them and how they defend pin downs and ball screens and watch uh in the post I think thats going to be key how the officials officiate the post play and then dribble drives thats going to be really key in this one Clemson again one of the best most physical teams in the ACC fouls on Chase Hunter he goes out into the corner Nice Shot fake Withers missed that just to exacerbate the turnover Point prior to that Louisville had hit its first three or had hit its last three shots but it was a sixnothing Clemson run that doesnt make any sense well Im confused listening to that one but right now I think this is where Clemson needs to go back down uh get PJ Hall a paint touch es the paint turns around missed the button rebounding battle is in favor of Louisville after it wasnt early its kept them around Ellis three got it again El Ellis has 12 in the first half he had 12 in the last game against Clemson Tigers really did the job Brad Brownell did not hesitate when we asked what are the keys for this game he didnt go through anything else he said hell Ellis hes so good uh we must keep him under control heres home driving right past Huntley Hatfield just couldnt finish the darn thing and then a silly foul 80 feet from the bucket Clemson has the lead not a single one of these 13 000 people would believe it youre loud ly has done a nice job a defensively a reading the plays up Louisville right here though not settling for a jumper but this guy right here I think this is where they need to continue to go now hes missed the last couple but hes a pretty good looks in the paint that he normally finishes and that one off of excellent ball movement and those two guys really have set the tone defensively but then offensively on the other end theyve been able to get the ball into the paint and get some high percentage shots Chase Hunter has three points Hunter Tyson has four that makes up the rest of the team youd say two men cant do it all but at this point they can free throws here for Louisville the first one is good for JJ trainer Cardinals are four of four at the line tonight tell you Louisville is trying to be the absolute spoiler here and thats the thing Kenny Payne told his team after shoot around he said you have to understand what Clemson has on the line we have a golden opportunity to burst their bubble and right now I like what Kenny Paynes doing hes changing up the defenses giving Clinton a little bit of threequarter court pressure really just to try to get them deep into the shot clock inside 10 here dont have PJ Hall hes on the bench with two fouls so middle Brooks is in there shefflin Rising missed it rebound trainer these are pivotal minutes here about two and a half left to go in the first half Noel Hall Al Ellis around out and still out El Ellis is jumping up and down at Mid court that ball wouldnt drop and that one does Chase on her has two and that really tough swing for Louisville youre right that ball hung up there of llc at least five seconds rolled around but poor pick and roll defense on the other end did you take the guys lollipop like Im he looked like LeBron James after not getting the call against the Celtics Huntley Hatfield real physical against middle Brooks boy all the Louisville fans wanted to call two on the shot clock Huntley Hatfield weve got a bunch of whistles and the block is the one called boy Ben Middlebrooks hes got the same hair as PJ Hall and hes got the same tenacity too and that one right there a veteran official uh because hes in the restricted area and then could have potentially gotten called for a flop on that one as well too but again a veteran officiating crew right on that and I think the biggest thing uh he was in the restricted area right there Conley Hatfield 73 free throw shooters ACC Unity week continues Wednesday our mens basketball matchup between Clemson and Syracuse coverage at seven Eastern right here on acc Network and ESPN app that is a quad 3 opportunity for the Crimson Tigers they have two more quad One games left on their schedule and they truly need to win I think Malcolm at least one of them both of them would almost assuredly get them into the field barring unforeseen losses as we get closer to March uh every game seems like its a must win the way this things coming down in the ACC for a lot of these teams inside here for shuffling shuffling with the right no hasnt been able to finish inside but he got him back and he swatted JJ trainers played a mans game James wants three this place would have erupted well Clemsons getting some good looks in terms of their bigs posted that last one though was all trainers length Hunter short eyes up here for LL is in transition hes been the dominant scoring force and hes fouled that far away and one and one coming for L Ellis its the second on Chase Hunter gonna put the fourth best free throw shooter release the fourth fourth most often free throw shooter in the ACC at the line LL is an 81 percent hes got another coming and Joel thats a big reason why hes at the free throw line so much he draws so much attention and then when he starts knocking down jumpers uh early hes almost impossible to keep in front of you that one though not a good foul though Mike Clemson putting him on the freethrow line 14 of his teams 37 Louisville has the lead and a timeout by Brad Brownell Clemson needs it Louisvilles winning Applause Music a season for Clemson that started they were 70 in conference historic beginning and yet the Tigers find themselves on the bubble and it might burst if they dont come out here with a win is Galloway fell down able to not travel but a throwaway Withers Withers no English and now Clemson can collect momentum shift for Galloway loose ball Louisville slow it down no youve got 12 seconds stepping lands give him two still time here for Hunter with one to go got it count that bucket and a frenetic shift Louisville leads at the break back and forth topsyturvy what a first half in the Bluegrass State well you cant be more happy if youre Kenny Payne the energy that they came out with over and they actually pour some of their own they were able to get out in transition and get some high percentage shots it seems hyperbolic to say if you lose this game youre in a lot of trouble and your hopes are over but that would be a third quad four loss for Louisville this year excuse me for Clemson this season and when youre outside the bubble right now according to Joe lunardi its a tough slip nice offensive rebound to start the second half PJ Hall played with two fouls at the very end of the half shefflin heres Hunter Tyson was very quiet in that first half and hell put Chaplin at the freethrow line you almost need a little more from him Hunter Tysons your leading scorer and I think that right there again paint touches whether its off the bounce like that right there Tyson or getting the BJ Hall uh posted up I think thats going to be the formula for them dont settle for jumpers first point for Ian shefflin sophomore out of Loganville in Georgia a little bit undersized but hes got that kind of rough and tumble rebound to him he was inserted into the lineup after one of those quad four losses the 18point loss to Loyola Chicago in the nonconference really kind of helped Clemson get set on the right path he does all the little things again not super athletic inside finish though Louisville theyre coming out ready to play and thats a beautiful set please thats something we saw Louisville working on uh LL as they knew he was going to get overplayed Paul Tippin Applause and back to that previous though possession uh for Louisville L Ellis faces a lot of face guards again teams trying to take the ball out of his hands that last back door was a set play thats something we saw them working on in shoot around when he gets overplayed winners boy Jaylen Withers is playing really well heres a bucket in each half now youre looking for compliments to L Ellis last seven games to see for Withers thats a compliment Applause Midway through the shot clock Applause PJ Hall hes giving up 30 pounds to Sydney Curry and he cant move him underneath the bucket Here Comes El Ellis little water polo pass for James and thats an air ball almost just barely caught iron Applause its a pretty good look though and good read by L Ellis to find James in the corner Galloway in the corner rebound Louisville this is a Cardinals team that just lost Wednesday against number seven Virginia and they had the ball with a chance to tie at the end of the game its got a foul on the floor you have to learn to win its one of the youngest teams Louisville in college basketball and it happens slowly Wednesday you start to learn maybe you start to put it together tonight to get over the Hop well I think its been the little things we talk a lot about the turnovers but its also some defensive breakdowns oh poor closeout uh a guy not hedging on the ball screen to rotation late on the back end uh you give up a lot or uncontested two its been a lot of little things and then that right there again although its not a live ball turnover but thats a lost possession a moving stream out of bounds underneath all those things add up at the end of the game second on Sydney Curry building a program and its different in this day and age but building a program can take time Malcolm you won one big East game your freshman year of Boston College you finished third in the league in your senior season how does it happen well I think its different now thats a completely different uh day and age right now uh the days of nil and also transfer portal I think its a little different I stayed all four years at Boston College unfortunately thats really not probably something thats going to happen teams are going to have to use the portal so I think its more about finding good transfers that are fit for your program to go along with some young talent that to bring in trying to stepped out of bounds I think thats kind of The Next Step Kenny Payne trying to put some pieces together maybe well play a little bit more in the transfer portal this next offseason he did get Brandon Huntley Hatfield out of the portal this past year from Tennessee you have to recruit your own guys Al Ellis has another year of Eligibility whether or not he will use it or not is an interesting question inside here rising up and Tyson hits the backboard for two beautiful back door cut that time and pass Applause Clemson back out in front with our 14th lead change neither teams led by more than five and theres your 15th lead change Brad Brown now not happy that time again the one guy you must identify if youre going any type of zone or in man uh you must not leave LL is open and give him clean looks seven of ten for LL thats good right way too deep and missed you cant ask for a better look if youre Brad Brown now uh PJ Hall basically caught that almost underneath the basket just missed the layup Ellis that guy is just knifing his way around the court Tyson screen for three rebound Louisville a bucket here is the largest lead for either team James inside and well try it at the freethrow line when we come back Louisville playing like its 20 30 NCAA but they went 35 and five mantras Harold Payton Siva Luke Hancock all in attendance deafening mouth that was a great scene good to have those guys back into the building and right now they must be pleased with how this team is playing right now probably their best performance thus far uh defensively theyve been sound I think offensively though LL is continues to play really well for Kenny Payne for 21 Point not too shabby for LLS tonight Mike James has been a good Supporting Cast internet freethrow line for another if he makes this free throw thats the largest lead for either team Applause for the redshirt freshman out of Orlando Florida and he has five points his team leads by six James checks out Clemsons had good looks again BJ Hall has had opportunities where hes been two feet in the paint they get him a paint touch just unable to finish Tyson thought he got hit on the three he doesnt get the call he is fed off the offensive rebound though second effort is collected by Louisville Applause Ill tell you what Cardinals dont look like a team thats won three times no and thats again though another missed opportunity for Clemson unable to convert and right now Louisville is capitalizing The Outfield has five and hes been productive again another nice postenchy pass belief is an incredible feeling this is a team that probably thinks it should have beaten Virginia Wednesday good filming bucket there by PJ Hall you go off of hey we should have beaten the top 10 team on Wednesday night and then you start doing this to a team thats been ranked this season the longer Louisville hangs around Ill tell you what Clemsons in trouble well theyve had opportunities uh Louisville and games in games pass whether its Miami uh theyre right there right at the end unable to put the clothes together got a whistle going against Louisville heres some of the opportunities that youre talking about and Bellarmine Wright State right off the top games early in the season one point losses doesnt see nine points had a lead against Virginia that was with 6 47 to go in the first half so can go on runs but the thing Mike James told us after shoot around today was can we step on the throat right can we put a team down when weve got them down can Louisville put Clemson down here Applause trainer to the rim tell you what if Louisville can beat Clemson down this is their absolute best effort at it right here dont settle for the jumper and then JJ trainer showing off the Hops beautifully designed out of bounds underneath and that right there is a big time finish adds the free throw on top of it speeding into the front corner I thought Brad Brownell might burn a time out there Galloway had a great first half settles his team down again 14 points for Brevin Galloway PJ Hall has 17 they have been the only two horses though for Clemson tonight and Galloway has done most of his damage either off of steals or off the bounce that time again knifing through the defense known as a threepoint shooter but hes done a really good job with dribble drives water polo pass out to lands shot clock down at five Huntley Hatfield not panicking in deep good defense there by middle Brooks transition 300 around and out Ill tell you its a good look but when it doesnt fall Clemson just keeps digging deeper yeah right now they are struggling from the threepoint line in the game and in the second half Clemsons two for 15 trainer rebound middle books Applause go back to that trainer dunk by the way at what point do you think he decided he was going to throw that down as soon as he hit me and he saw it opening shefflins double team five on the shot clock good find of Tyson thats great offense and its frustrating when the shots dont go and thats really something you can ill afford on the road especially how well Louisvilles playing again you cant fought or be mad if youre Brad Brown now with that look thats a pretty clean look off a pretty good ball movement Cali almost wound up with his third steal though he is hyper aggressive on defense 11 and orange trainer three and the rebound LLS for three trainer all over the glass all over the court hes all over the freethrow line now too well what were seeing right now is Elite athleticism and length uh previous play the dunk by JJ trainer and then off the offensive rebound and put back you didnt have to come back down with it Applause 15 points is a career high for JJ Trainor hes a junior from about a half hour outside here in Louisville Malcolm when he was a junior in high school he had basically no interest he had one offer from Georgetown College not Georgetown the university in DC Georgetown College in Kentucky boy he blossomed though as a senior now is in a similar growth process can he make that jump late in his college coming Louisville by 10 Galloway too strong and missed theres Hersey Miller eyes up in transition oh its trainer again this place wants to go bananas for JJ Trader because I tell you what Malcolm Mark could be hes given him reasons here in Louisville Light It Up smile direct Club is a great way well hes been impressive his length really pops out when youre right up next to him that right there the athletic system and the Finish are really uh he has shown that he can score on all three phases hes hit some threes hes been able to play out of the midrange but Ive been impressed when hes attacked the basket and have been able to use his athleticism and length tonight though really well above his season average talked about his growth spurt at the end of his high school career really jumped from his Junior to his senior season one of the things that helped him started playing pickup all that off season with DAngelo Russell and Rajon Rondo which you know sounds like a normal summer how does that like ever I feel like that story happens a lot it does though I think a lot of times guys develop and they run a race a little bit different uh than other guys some guys develop a little bit quicker some guys it takes a little bit longer at the end though it doesnt make a difference as long as youre playing at this level when it matters PJ hole hooks that one down I mean Im at the pickup side too like how many guys do you hear tell the story of yeah like I ran into this guy who plays in the NBA and he invited me to this game and became my mentor well its a lot more uh often now that happens with these guys during the off season and some of the open runs but right here though Clemson I like the move uh go to three see if you can Force Louisville into some uh perimeter jumpers because theyve been really dominating driving the ball to the basket three on the shot clock for curry and the hook rattles down well at least it made the news the clock well nothing working right now and again Louisville showing patience that time out of the zone gets it off the glass for Chase Hunter I think Kenny Payne told his Cardinals Clemson so explosive on offense it has any number of guys that can go for 20 and thats true they have four players that average double figures only two of them though have really made an impact tonight you need something from Chase Hunter and Hunter Tyson Applause heres Tyson defensively good seal on the Baseline and he shuts down JJ trainer Applause Music Hunter Bonner Falling Away cannot finish through contact Clemson wanted to whistle and probably L just left shaking his head active defense thats a tip goal now thought that should have been a bad Court lands wide open Curry man weve got a hook and the foul what a grab of the right leg by PJ Hall its the third team foul its been physical all night a look at Sydney Curry and PJ Hall talking for position yeah thats definitely a push yeah thats right there easy call for the rep to make now I think what Kenny Paynes saying is is that there might have been a hook by all before of the push Applause thank you now Clemson has been down in games this year and come back this would be nothing new but youve got to start hitting buckets tigers do hold a win over Pittsburgh at the top of the ACC standings well coming into the day they were down by eight with six minutes to go how strong to the hole weve got a foul thatll put Mike James at the line and Body Language tells a lot you can see Hunter Tysons frustration well I think the big things that happened in the second half Louisville has not had the turnovers that have plagued them and then defensively theyve been playing single coverage against BJ Hall uh and the guys down there and they just missed some shots when theyve had pretty good post position to go along though with them still continue its a struggle from the threepoint line right now Clemson two of 17 from the threepoint line for 12 percent Mari lands is a 93 free throw shooter tell you man that broadcast for Jinx thing is overrated he goes two for two this was a tight game in the first half Louisvilles blown it up to a double figure lead here in the second that was indeed a three thought there might have been a foot on the line its a Louisville ball had that gone down it would have been the fourth three this season for RJ Godfrey its just been that type of night again Cross Court pass wide open three balls went right in and out and again if youre brapper on now you cant be disappointed with getting a wide open look off of a beautiful skip Court Bass quiet second half so far for L Ellis 21 points he did most that damage before halftime we have a reach in on Chase hunter that is his third and the foul is mounting 8 26 to go Louisville is going to shoot Malcolm for the remainder of the game Ill go back to my first half of the comment and I said look how this game is going to be officiated is going to be key as we get deeper into the second half Clemson weve talked about it all broadcast one of the more physical teams in the ACC and now theyre going to have to adjust in this game because 8 26 to go Louisville and the bonus situation Thursdays womens Bass basketball doubleheader here on acc Network Haley Cavender in Miami against Haley van lit and Louisville thats at six Eastern and then ninth ranked Duke against NC State another great night of womens basketball on the ACC Network and the ESPN app 12 point lead for Louisville that is the largest of the night Rising Hunter missed stays here such an interesting characterization of Clemson season because in so many ways it is historic they are in all likelihood gonna win another game thatll be a School record for ACC wins so many things have gone right for Clemson but the year could be marred by several just unforgivable losses and in March again it is what it is this is one on the road uh Brad Brownell uh in Clemson they understand the importance of this game as we get closer to March pass was off Target to James so we had to drive instead of shoot land slipped got away with a walk James Flex on he just pushed off Hunter Tyson who you said could be the ACC player of the year timeout Mike this is not what the Clemson Tigers bargained for tonight and Brad bronnell we spoke with them this afternoon at shoot around new how dangerous of a team of Louisville is again it was no mistake that they almost knocked off Virginia he knew that coming into this one and was concerned coming in uh how well they have been playing over their last three games Clemson had gotten off to that red hot start they were 70 in conference and then fell that stumbling block losing at Boston College against Miami and then on the road at North Carolina right at the ship blasted Florida State into Georgia got a block called on Louisville but now Falls right back into that rut when everything seemed like it was going well Clemson needs an answer over the next 7 26 Music your grandmothers Fine China those trendy sneakers your collection of hand carved duck decoys Auto Owners protects your home because well somebody should thats simple human sense ask your independent agent if Auto Owners make sense for you down chasing the dreams of our childhood made real on the hardwood all the home games and hometowns for motivation to coordination the old God and the new blood from hoopas to Heroes breaking records brackish ankles and new grounds come for it all thank you Applause the entire KFC Yum Center on its feet here they got more than they bargained for they came tonight to celebrate the 2013 Louisville team and then the 2023 Louisville team said no no no no no its about today yeah the place is rocking uh the energy really as soon as they tipped off but really I think this team has been off of that and I think the big thing for them uh Kenny Payne talked about it but when they share the basketball they are a very difficult team to match up again and it has not just been El Ellis in the second half problem is that makes life very difficult for Clemson who right now is on the outside looking in of Joe Bernardis Bracketology bubble quad one record just hurts two and four now there are two more opportunities on the schedule but if you take another quad 4 loss which would be the third it makes it really hard for Clemson to make a case yeah a really a little room for error for Clemson right now to pose this season out inside PJ Hall fumbled it away and does get it back to score and its such a great Clemson story because in this day and age of all the transfer portal and nil and everything this is a Clemson roster whose three leading scorers are three young men who came into this program and really didnt play earlier in their careers and they developed theyve earned it the maturitys paid off youd love to see them finish it off good defense in there by one of them PJ Hall Galloway gave up the three to find a two well Galilee has made really nice read to end this game again Scott guys running at him because of his threepoint shooting ability thats a beautiful head fake step to the side and then a little heavy and finish its all set up though by their defense getting a stop and I like this move by Brad Brown now but going to looks like a little matchup Zone hes gone to a 23 Zone hes played man theyve done a whole bunch of different things to try to confuse Louisville four on the shot clock L Ellis didnt know it lands got the shot off rebound Clemson now remember the Tigers were down eight against Pittsburgh and one with six minutes to go and well have free throws forthcoming here for Chase Hunter I think thats for that veteran Savvy comes in and I again go back to when they went Zone the last really two or three possessions uh really has slowed down this Louisville team excellent change up by Brad bronnell going Zone Chase Hunters third in the ACC at the line 86 percent they missed tonight at nine Eastern after our mens basketball double header its our nothing but net crew breaking down the day in the ACC highlights and Analysis of all the mens games and a look ahead to the best games on the schedule coming up the rest of the week thats all the coverage you can find in one place right here on acc Network and the ESPN Hunter missed both guy shoots 86 percent Louisvilles led by double figures much of the second half L Ellis yeah there was a whistle a couple of guys I think thought it was a shoe squeak because they kept playing four fouls on Chase Hunter and this is where being in the bonus really benefits Louisville and again theyve done a nice job working the shot clock might not seem like a big thing but they passed up a couple of jumpers knowing that they have the lead and then time is in something they want to try to run down LL has missed the front end there how much is there blood in the water though youve got Chase Hunter with four fouls does LLS attack try to get his Defender out of the game absolutely try to either put him in ball screen too if you could get him switched out inside Hall great cut PJ Hall has now 22 points now weve got a timeout Louisville the lead is down to eight and Kenny Payne look at the intensity in the eyes Applause boy if looks could kill that is a coach whos trying to get his team to learn to win and I think its going to start though with his point guard L Ellis he is the guy set the tone in the first half you look at his numbers again he know he can score I think its going to come down to his decision making right here showing off the midrange one of the most difficult matchups in college basketball knocking down the three hes a guy that can score at all three levels but to close this thing out I think its going to come down to his decision making can he get them into right play and then make the right read whether thats going for himself or sending his teammate up weve talked about leads that Louisville has let get away this season LED against Virginia by nine points just on Wednesday night I thought Kenny Payne his words cut like a knife and shoot around today because he stopped and he said guys do you want to win because your body language says you dont and the way he said it so deadpan made it slice even harder he is in with these guys to try to turn this program around oh theyre going to have to figure out of this Zone see if they can get somebody in that high post area shot clock down to five L Ellis just drives in he got himself to the high post rebound Clemson you get a bucket here this is a much different ball game you get a three here and Louisville might be in a little bit of trouble Hall through a double team is going to the freethrow line and that might be the biggest celebration for a missed shot Ive ever seen well thats great recognition though by Clemson again they had Mike James on PJ Hall thats a mismatch a heads up play by Galloway throwing it right back out to PJ Hall let him go to work and they had no choice but to follow him right there that is a guy asserting physical dominance and at six foot ten he shoots 83 percent at the line I gotta stop doing that quietly if you look at Pauls numbers tonight 25 points efficient 1119 eight rebounds the one area though that continues to be a struggle for Clemson is the threepoint shooting two of 19 now in this game 11 percent worst night from three this season Applause two other times theyve been in that ballpark beat Duke shooting under 15 from three and then lost to Loyola by 18 thats the one bad stain from the nonconference schedule for Clemson good hands six on the shot clock Kenny Payne talking to his guys about using ball fakes again Clemson disguising their defense really well and theyre active in the passing Lanes four on the shot clock Ellis to the rim that never hit the rim and a shot clock violation and thats now backtoback possessions that Malcolm Louisville has not figured out the Zone yeah and again that one right there not a bad look by Elle Ellis just unable to finish off the glass theyre going to have to get a stop though right here 70 run for Clemson three consecutive makes from the floor downhill Hunter oh he got it to roll Applause and thats all directed by PJ Hall he knew Hunter had a mismatch with a big on him hed spread out go ice and let him get to the basket nine points shaved off the lead and Mike James will go to the freethrow line when we come back Clemson is back in this it has to keep its composure about to happen its called Neil makes dinner uptodate standings in the ACC that includes Pittsburghs loss tonight so Virginia stands alone at the top of the leaderboard seventh ranked team in the country Miami pit NC State Duke are the five teams Joe lunardi has in his projected field right now a lot can happen between now and March in this election Sunday show obviously all these teams including Virginia do not want to leave it in the hands of the committee uh theyre all thinking lets win out and take matters into our own hands but right now on the road this is a huge one uh for Clemson Mike James fouled before the timeout was the fourth on PJ Hall 24 in Orange hes your engine so he stays on the floor and just has to play smart I really impressed though speaking with Mike James this afternoon and shoot around impressive young man and certainly doing a little bit of everything tonight for this Louisville Club back up by seven Paul demanding the ball youve got to give it to him again deep three Tyson finally hits he had been over six all right thats getting it despite yourself though you have to get all the time well that is though a big time bucket and buy a guy that should be into discussion for Player of the Year in the ACC certainly Nevada should be First Team all ACC player of the Season that he has had shot clocks at four Withers oh Big Time mink because Louisvilles been using all the clock and its been a struggle nice response downhill Hunter oh English Applause now Clemsons using it looks like a some type of 122 press and now theyre going to drop back in a twoyear matchup Zone not that the question becomes what has the will learn from being in these spots it was here Wednesday night against Virginia the seventh ranked team in the country once again the shot clock is down heres Mike James with three on the timer Mike James for two these are Big Time buckets Hall of three thats not the shot you want him taken hes capable but you want his touches in the paint yeah that really not a good offensive possession for Clemson the ball really never swung left to right again plenty of time you dont necessarily need a three right there but you certainly dont want to settle for a contested three now Louisville continues to show patience running clock Louisvilles done a great job in the second half 50 from the four yes Huntley Hatfield with the X station point well Huntley have to have been solid for Kenny Payne right here big time offensive rebound putback and this one right here Kenny Payne and staff talked about the little things that booms out games now that hustle play right there for a second chance opportunity Applause they just played Muhammad Ali on the video board here riled up the fans at the um Center and Ill give the city of Louisville this much credit as well this team is three and 22 it is three and twelve at home and you would think they are the number one team in the country the way this community has come out and supported them tonight and all season long well I credit also Kenny Payne and staff but when you walk into their shoot around and Ive had him several times this year but you would not know that they were a onewin team in the ACC theyve done a good job sticking together now I think the key thing is theyve been in situations like this before where theyve had leads in the second half can they close it out and continue to do the things that have gotten them there which is sound defensively and then offensively make the right reads and certainly its probably going to come down to them making some free throws as well too Louisville is 19 of 20 at the freethrow line tonight theyre showing out because Clemsons the second best freethrow shooting team in the country and theyve missed some critical ones here in the second half and whats now an eightpoint game for checking the clock 592 is where we stay Tyson catch and shoot he is a 42 threepoint shooter that is what Louisville could not allow to happen and it was a beautifully designed play and again communication but uh its well executed right here again a little scrub screen and this was all set up uh to get Tyson the look right there you must communicate if youre Louisville you cannot give up an open three in that situation I actually think thats the play that they ran to beat Virginia Tech because they were practicing it exactly at shoot around today and its a couple of screens set by Tyson with him popping up for the wide open threes welldesigned play the execution really I think thats what its about the screens were there but if youre Louisville in that situation youre switching everything again the last thing you want to do is give up a three youll give up a two you just dont want to give them a clean look from three well jump uh well done and uh well executed play by Clemson two possession game now what do you think Brownell comes out with defensively here theyve gone to the Zone a lot do you throw a curveball and make Louisville thing well heres the the thing right now oh youre looking at what the lineup is for Louisville youre trying to file the worst free throw shooter on there so youre trapping obviously L Ellis you want to get the ball out of his hand percentagewise hes 80 coming into this game so youre trying to get somebody other than L Ellis with the ball in his hands and then put them on the free throw line are you fouling right away you go for one steal you have time for one steal you practice these end the game situations so theyre going to extend their defense probably try to get a steal if you dont get it then obviously you got to think about falling but in this situation you certainly want to get the ball out of L Elliss hands the worst free throw shooter on the floor right now for Louisvilles at 72 percent thats not bad but thats not going to get it done right through the wickets of James oh to say turnovers have been a problem for Louisville this season thats pain and that plays right obviously into the hands of Clemson two things no time goes off really and then youre giving them possession of the ball Kevin here you have to communicate on any screens get a review Applause and I think theyre checking to see if that ball was tipped by Mike James if there should have been any time off the clock Music Applause Roger Ayers is our crew chief he has been the referee on some pretty awesome upsets this week and right here again this is what theyre looking at see if theyre okay about from that it looks like it may have touched his leg this angle probably will give us a better look no not tough to tell there so Im not sure any times going off I mean the funny thing about that I dont know if you could do that again if you tried so 49 even on the clock Music and so thats absolutely what happened there so no time off the clock because there was not a touch by Mike James and Clemson had six people on the court Chase Hunter goes screaming to the bench again communication by Louisville slots weve got a whistle and Chauncey Wiggins takes his first shot of the game Off the Bench with 46 seconds to go Applause and thats off JJ trainer cant say enough about his length of what he has done we saw the monster dunk he had but defensively uh hes had some recoveries hes beat right there but because of his athleticism and length hes able to get out and get a block LLS is an 81 freethrow shooter we had mentioned Louisville was 19 of 20 thats why you play the game Applause two possession game here regardless six point difference obviously you dont need a three Clemson is the second best threepoint shooting team though in the ACC ENT so by all means if youve got one five in Orange is a 42 shooter from Deep thats Hunter missing at The Rim Louisville has the ball 35 seconds to go Louisville might not just have the ball it might have the win well weve been talking about the importance of this game on two clips in the team that according to Joe linardi right now looking on the outside a really small and really no room for errors that close out this season but credit Louisville theyve done a nice job in this game I think their defense really has been key in this one to close it out they forced Clemson into some really difficult shots in the second half this would be a dagger of a loss for Clemson they still do have two quad one opportunities NC State and Virginia those would be massive resume boosters this is obviously what you might call a seed line bump and the only problem is Clemson doesnt have a seed line to give Hunter to the rim for two inside 30 seconds Louisville does have to finish it and then Wiggins with the hard foul such an interesting test case because theres so many things that have been great about Clemson historically great season for the Tigers their next win will be a School record 12th in conference play they were at the top of the league started 70 and yet three potentially now four losses which is a pretty good sample size could derail an entire season of good a couple makes for L Ellis well I think the the mistake and again obviously what folks are going to look at this but the Way Louisville has been playing uh credit them dont want to take anything away from them PJ Hall and a timeout Pratt ran out so a sixpoint game with 19 seconds to go well end this game though it has really been LL is set in the tone uh into first half of both him and JJ trainer have been really good L Ellis got it going in the first half showing off the threepoint range but right here this is the progression of him making a good read in transition and this young man right here Elite athleticism and links a really Clemson did not have an answer for him when he started driving and then showing off the Hops he had some monster finishes in the second half Louisvilles going to win a game with these two young men in which it gets outscored by 22 points in the paint and only makes five threes like thats called finding a way well I think the big number and it hasnt been an issue late in the second half turnovers a Louisville to start this game off Clemson was getting some easy opportunities off of their turnovers they were pretty good defensively but then when they turned it over that was the issue they didnt do that in the second half Lee I think thats a big reason why theyre up six with 192 seconds to go Applause youve got a foul LL is to go to the line boy what a night for LLS what a week and a half for llis averaging better than 20 points over the last two games coming in he has 24 tonight on 14 shots hes gonna have a negative assist to turn over ratio which you were just talking about the turnovers dont let that impact what we just said right like hes played a phenomenal game sometimes theres a little bit more than what just the numbers will tell you well his last two games hes been over 20 uh plus points and certainly when you do that against the team like Virginia and now Clemson again theres no doubt that he is one of the better scoring guards not just in the ACC but in college I hope he comes back because he could have a great year and do great things for Louisville and an air ball by Tyson just kind of epitomizes the night for Clemson Tigers will finish four for 24 from three and thats the story of the game some of those uh in the first and early in the second were really clean looks thats unable to convert and some of them you have to credit Louisville they forced and contested a lot of those and Clemson concedes thousands strong and 2013 go to sleep by L Ellis Kenny Payne shaking his head a little bit at that and the understandable frustration by Clemson probably not the best idea if youre LL Ellis but the understandable excitement that Louisville lets out by picking up the W tonight well Brad Brown now and staff not happy about that certainly though uh Kenny Payne and this team Applause uh happy about the win at home they were impressive both ends defensively they were solid offensively though in the second half it wasnt just LL yes he had a big night but they got contributions from other guys JJ trainer was really big
