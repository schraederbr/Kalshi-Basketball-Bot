worked their way inside PNC Arena for this first of two meetings in the span of oh about 18 days between Virginia and NC State already 10 to shoot on the wolf packs first possession Taylor for horn five to shoot heres Taylor trying to get by McNeely at the top hell launch with the shot clock winding nows an air ball and NC State comes away empty on the first trade mark of Virginia the packline defense pressure on the ball Four Guys inside the threepoint line if youre NC State you cant over dribble you got to move the ball get ball reversal get Cuts you dribble the ball theyre going to load up against you in this match up here is Andrew roie hes a transfer from St Thomas in Minnesota and this is pakman who we spoke of done nice skip pass mcney was red hot the other night in the win against Louisville and that jumper bounces away Burns and the Wolfpack try to get in transition here with DJ horn leading the way well they want to get the ball to DJ Burns as much as possible whether its for a scoring opportunity 30 in the white or just a touch cuz he is an outstanding passer here is Parker now Taylor thought about it in front of the Virginia bench and see stay kind of heavy on the dribble right now theres Taylor left side morcel long three rattles out Ryan dun the rebound he leads the Cavaliers at almost s game Wes the more you take multiple dribbles you play right into the hands of the packline defense kick out mcney tries again that one is good Isaac mcney his 35th three of the year hes almost 50 from behind the line in Virginia on the board in the first 90 seconds thats a great sign for the Cavaliers because in his last five games hes only 33 from three had four threes the other night on the way to 18 against Louisville now heres Taylor on the drive had it knocked away in Virginia has kind of clogged up the arteries for NC States offense here in the first three Music possessions Ro and the Cavaliers now the Freshman Buchanan Tony Bennetts given him a lot of responsibility today given the prowess of Burns and theres a turnover heres an outlet with Taylor hes got done to beat the layup good terrific take for Jaden Taylor and the Wolfpack on the board and the big fella at the front end of that transition and thats one of the big keys for NC State score from their Defense Force turnovers theyre averaging 20 points a game in their last five games with their defense and second chance opportunities theyre getting 11 off the glass more points you can get without playing against the pack gives you a chance to win mcney alone in traffic on the drive knocked out of there morel runs it down and for Virginia its all about how youre going to double DJ Burns in the low post and can they find their threepoint shooting in their losses their three losses this year they have shot the ball terribly from the outside and there he goes burns on the board well that time he had the dribble on the left side of the floor for a lefthanded player West for some reason he likes the left side of the floor most lefties want to be on the right side going to the middle four in a row by the Wolfpack to give him the lead beatman trying to find a path this is RO a step in two that rims Applause out horn front Court oconnell Waits at the table for NC State hes a primary ball handler for coach Keith heres Burns again you Canon lets see if theres help

morcel three off the pitch for aead from horn NC State doesnt get a chance at that threepoint shot without Dennis Parker and the extra effort that he went to to save that ball get some points off the turnovers Parker you mentioned went to John Marshall last big Wolfpack star from Richmond went to Maggie Walker was a former Dragon Clyde Austin by the way Paul Im open too with you in the first half

run here Paul wolfpacks got their largest lead of seven they never had to go against the pack when you get an offensive rebound putback roie had it deflected out of bounds it will stay with Virginia thatll get Buchanan back in the ball game and how about the have Dennis Parkers head you can see he was locked and loaded ready to shoot the ball shooting 36 from three in his last five and Ben Middlebrooks working on the glass State averaging 11 Second Chance points over the last five games crucial in a low possession game 15 to shoot now for Virginia on The Possession Clarence Armstrong tried to readjust Kevin keatss spot at the bench to allow roie to put the ball ball in bounds and theres Buchanan going hard to the rack second field goal for Blake Buchanan that stops the 8 nothing

done hes stripped in fouled couple of shots coming with 70 seconds to play and the foul is on middle Brooks middle Brooks working the block on the Freshman Buchanan takes him to the middle finishes that time done with a cut to the basket Virginia playing a five out type offense in that last possession six first half points for Ryan done a year ago against the ACC averaged three points and three rebounds his minutes improved though because of his defensive effort and he missed the front end of the free throw there hes 0 for two at the line yeah West only 37 from the free throw line in his last five games got that one thatd be about right at one to three wouldnt it yeah sixpoint game but hes so valuable on the glass finishing rebounding Canon trying to help nice pass middle Brooks The Catch boy oconnell is terrific six for Middlebrooks oconnell has great passing Vision he hearkens you back to the college guards of the 70s Paul theres a drive hes got an old school point guard game middle Brooks draws another foul itll be his second but another look at the delivery here from Michael okon watch the way he plays with his head up his eyes wide open he can see the entire court great slip by Ben Middlebrooks this young man understands his role on this team we asked Kevin Keats before the game whats the identity of this team is that its balance its depth and guys understanding their role middle Brooks will come out on his second foul and back comes everybodys favorite DJ Burns its a play of the final 409 and the free throw on the back end by bman gives him five six now in this first half and you put DJ Burns in for offense for sub from the bench and now Kevin Keat going to take his use it to lose it here with 356 to go sixpoint lead for the wolf pack when we continue from Raleigh presented by Foodline Im a guy who lost a bet and my dignity as if watching my team lose wasnt punishment enough and if you have Cut Rate car insurance odds all You be paying for that yourself so get all Applause state neither snowcapped mountains nor or puddles of water nor unexpected detours with a 20ft drainage pipe well great to be with Paul B and cardi West Durham were at PNC Arena and Raleigh where NC State is up to 48 from the floor Virginia right at 39 here with about a half minute to go in this opening frame and its been kind of a Tempo based half but 3226 58 points seems like a lot of points in a Virginia in the game Paul well NC state has had some explosiveness in this game theyve scored from their defense they scored on Second Chance points they put some runs on Virginia lets see what they have right here going into the half you know DJ Burns is going to be involved and will Virginia and how will they double yeah 11 second differentials we wind down this half oconnell with Isaac mcney defending for the Cavaliers heres Morel with eight to shoot Casey trying to get it to Burns with five four hell skip it horn a three ball got it D the big fella just knows when to get rid of it three assists for burns beatman at the horn dumps it in eight for beatman but NC States going to take a lead to the locker room the ACC Road remember the loss at Memphis and the loss last Saturday at Notre Dame two of their three losses the other one was to Wisconsin down in Fort Meyers here is beatman and the Wahoos to start the frame McNeely Buchanan RO with him and of course Ryan dun here is RO on the drive had it poked away from behind and look who came up with it lovable DJ Burns got on the ground for it quick Hands by both pack fourth turnover by Virginia starts the half DJ horn kind of found his shooting stroke here late in that first half too yeah when burns out of the game they went to Horn they love to run this misdirection play right here they come off the double and then horn looks for his more cells to burns with five to shoot back to Casey morcel inside Parker the dunk and one he took a big fall but Dennis Parkers got eight and the foul is on Ryan Dunn at The Rim credit all around from the wolf pack DJ Burns recognizes reads the quick double he finds morcel morcel finds Parker right under the basket it was KC morcel who found Dennis Parker for that as you called it a fourpoint shot yeah the fourpoint shot right and here is uh Parker knocking down the free throw hes now got nine in the ball game great teamwork by the wolf pack largest lead of the ball game now for the pack at 10 3828 yanan just above the foul line left it on the rim and Parker the rebound heres DJ horn in the wolf pack Virginias going to have to change their coverage with DJ Burns sometimes they double sometimes they dont but they got to rotate out quicker Orel Ts up a three rims off done the rebound I guess the thing that catches your eye the most is when hes double team Burns has got a plan immediately and he knows how to execute it because hes finding the open man he doesnt panic beakman runs one up it rims out Buchanan the rebound and and didnt see State foul thatll War bu Canan two shots and it is on horn itll be his first and the first on the wolf out thatll put Blake Buchan into the line you get another look here yeah beakman trying to score you cant and work in the glass this young mans going to be a terrific player at UVA he had a monster game against Florida this season hes still catching up to the speed of the game so and the physicality free throw no good from Buchanan all right so heres the Buchanan recruiting story hes an accomplished player you know that right he was in the ESPN 100 go ahead Tony Bennett finds out about Blake Buchanan from his dentist no his dentist he used to have when he was a coach at Washington State who knew about the kid and so Tony Bennett first heard about Blake Buchanan in the eighth or ninth grade hes from cine his mother is the winningest coach in volleyball at the University of Idaho his brothers a very accomplished Collegiate volleyball player you ever Tony Bennett great line is it took me cavities to find out about play you Canon and Kyle getter the former assistant for UVA recruited him now hes the associate head coach at Notre Dame great find by Bennett and Kyle getter and the dentist and the dentist heres mcne beatman on the drive nice feed to done for the layup and thats where UVA has to continue to attack inside the paint more handoffs more rescreens penetration by beakman when the defense rotates give it up 11point lead for the wolf pack two and a half gone second frame in Raleigh same two teams again in well a little more than uh a couple of weeks heres Morel sets and too strong with the three and theyre going to call a foul on burns for a little bit of a push on Buchanan trying to control the long rebound second on DJ Burns second on the pack this time they play oneonone with a little bit of little bit of help but they were covering the shooters they contested theyre going to have to change their their looks on DJ Burns you cant have a steady coverage of on the catch on the dribble or single coverage you have to mix it up then you have to rotate out I coached against that packline defense when Tonys dad dick was at Wisconsin right the one thing you got to be careful of okay if youre NC State dont get seduced into shooting that weak side three cuz that will get Virginia back in the game Taylor fights over the top of the grow screen at the midcourt line stay with beat so burn comes out of the ball game middle Brooks is on the deck OK Connell is also checked in for the first time here in this second half for NC State McNeely got trapped and a foul will be called on horn Wolfpack trow wanted a f travel on McNeely instead horn gets his second its the third on the wolf pack here in the second half already they only hit five in the first half so mcney will go to the line for two hes 82 only three and 17 tries and the free throw good dont forget each weekday afternoon ACC PM comes your way on acc Network 400 Eastern Time Mark Packer Taylor tanon bomb all the great interviews features and topics to the discussion right here on acccn seven for McNeely coming off 18 the other night against Louisville in the win at

shootting heres Middlebrooks who had a really nice first half one quick dribble around grows put it up score eight for Ben Middlebrook thats the weakness of Virginia is their post defense right now banon is going to be very good in the future brw is just not strong enough right now and there we get a foul in the midcourt area its going to be on done itll be his second its the second on the

on to it turned over by the C Applause cers Taylor again bounce pass threw it away to mcney one of the rare misfires by the wolf pack in the half court today their six turnover of the ball game Virginias got to manufacture some jump shots for mcney Cavaliers also probably have to have a sense of urgency if they want to get back in this too dont they Paul yeah they do and then theyre not going to press theyre going to run their offense and theyre going to try to stop you with the pack line need this y mcne drills the three get him shots down the stretch 13 now the ball game for McNeely thats his third triple of the day back to an 18point Wolfpack lead what Virginia will try to do is just force you into turnovers by staying inside a pack Four Guys inside the paint one on the ball heres morel waiting on a burn screen and Buchanan tried to help and commits the foul second on the Freshman from Idaho four on the Cavaliers mcney you saw DJ Burns was on him he said look I got to start shooting the basketball for this team even if its contested they got to get him Shots bman Out tane Murray you see return briefly to lineup you get a look at mcney Murray wears 10 for

Miner a 68 grad transfer from marinac who grew up in Kingston Massachusetts he played just two minutes against Louisville nine against Notre Dame but it is another big body off Tony Bennetts bench there goes Morel and dun and roie affected that 18point game eight and a half to play good job by state to get Applause back Ro all the way down Runner with a right hand middle Brooks gathers it when they look at the film theyll see they missed a lot of layups yeah right around the pain area heres horn look at this kind of a reset now stop Music Applause ronnell morel round done on the drive in traffic bounce pass Baseline wh in the floater Wes that was such a high basketball IQ play by DJ horn casy morcel was shut down Horns Defender was watching the ball great back cut 12 for horn now on

to play its a 20po Virginia lead and now a Cavalier timeout were going to take it with him but DJ horn he got seven and the half for the wol pack he and Parker have been terrific but the little

watching oh oh Im Applause watching now on Sports Center another wild night watch me all right coach walk me through this wins and losses stuff for Virginia because its a 20point game with 7 minutes to go and Tony Bennetts taken some hard losses Wisconsin Memphis last Saturday to know today look at the threepoint field goal percentage in their wins and then in their losses when they lose they only average three M threes a game and they give up nine threes per game in todays game NC state has nine made threes wow is it that simple Paul against the pack line theres got to be a little more to it right well its all connected when you score you can set your defense and if you dont score then youre going to get beat in transition youre going to get beat off the points off of turnovers and NC States done a really nice job on Second Chance opportunities they have not played the packline defense up to their ability Virginia and theyre certainly not shooting well away from home gertrud the Freshman from New Jersey launching on the floor here for the first time Elijah gertrud who played 7 Minutes against Louisville and was scoreless he was ticketed for a red shirt coming off an AC L injury in the off season but the young mans been put on the floor and hes playing for the ninth time today think about those numbers Wes if you give up 9 May threes thats 27 points and youre only averaging three its nine its 18 differential yeah for to shoot heres horn working against Gertrude Rises and fire and missed Music everything so I think it starts with the pack line first they have to get back to who they are defensively now In fairness to Virginia lot of new faces even though theyre experienced players it takes about 6 months to a year to understand all the concepts of the pack line think about it beakman dun and mcne the only three guys with pack line experience yeah and heres the other thing too Paul as McNeely slides back to I cant tell you that its unanimous but in almost every visit I have with a coach they tell me well it took us 10 or 12 games to find out kind of who we were in todays college basketball well sometimes you get a system thats different like the pack line its a system that takes a lot of time to a Implement and B understand three ball by Parker air ball there but once they understand it you see how dominating it is in games teams really struggle against it gertrud had it swatted by middle Brooks heres horn for Taylor he will squeeze around McNeely and score what a terrific finish by Jaden Taylor and the foul on mcne Jaden Taylor watch the defense right there by Middlebrooks and NC State does a fabulous job of converting from defense to offense Taylor takeing it strong seven for Taylor hes a 75 free throw shooter played 65 games in two seasons in Indianapolis for Butler comes here to Raleigh and of all the transfers that have been added hes the most accomplished of them and averaging 15 in conference play hes got eight here this afternoon and he really helps the wolf pack defensively he and Casey morcel are great on ball Defenders yep you dont see that in the Box Score you dont see that when it comes to shooting but everybody knows you need the defense to win yeah hes Advanced his membership here on defense for sure T to shoot for Virginia who now finds themselves down 21 and Taylor almost came away with a pick again six to shoot for the Cavaliers Taylor is right in the face of Ree pakman and Tony Bennett he was worried about this wasnt he absolutely told us that heres pakman in the corner three ball thats done Ryan gun showing some distance hes got 14 now in the ball game seven in the half and under five we go but its an 18point lead for the Wolfpack wolf pack has to be smart on the offensive end stay aggressive but dont settle NC State won seven of their last eight conference games a season ago in this building they were theyve won 22 of their last 24 at PNC Arena middle Brooks a kick out Taylor launching another one back rim Miss and moner will pull it away W the first few minutes of this game I thought NC State was way too much with the dribble since then they have been beautiful with the pass really moving the ball and giving it up 15 to shoot Murray heres Miner now beatman trying to reroute around the miner screen got into traffic and a foul called on the wolf pack was seven on the shot clock and its on DJ horn itll be his third its four on NC State thatll put the miramac transfer Ro Jordan Miner to the line and Miner is two for three at the line first one is good dont forget
