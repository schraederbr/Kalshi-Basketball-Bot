in this league because they do it year in and year out and theyre wearing towels to honor the great john thompson somebody that we surely do miss and um definitely recognize his contributions to the game big john as everybody refer to him in the glory days certainly of the big east and very very much a missed figure in college basketball were set for the opening tip we get underway as syracuse wins that the orange coming in at 12 and six playing better basketball theyre six and five now in the acc dolajay everything seems to run through him number 21 for the syracuse orange and the long ones going to be off the mark is we are just getting things started about a foot and a half of snow on the ground in syracuse thats no big deal notre dame with their starting five and that includes cormac ryan who is back in their lineup danny after turning an ankle he had a great game against duke in a big win for the fighting irish yeah cormac ryan is someone that needs to make shots he has that capability hes a scorer hes a shooter but i love his willingness to defend and theyre going to need that today against this zone theyve got to get the ball to the high post and be ready for any type of trap once that ball gets into the short corner against this talented team syracuse starting five including gerard behind griffin guerilla and dolajay duriere leading everybody at 16 points and nine rebounds a game the 67 sophomore and a minute in no score in this one yeah guerrilla i love his effort and energy he brings that to the table every time he steps out there that is a terrific highlow pass against that zone griffin with an outstanding job there on the baseline to deny alan griffin the 65 junior yeah he had a game earlier this season danny we had seven blocks against virginia tech on a run out hub will lay that one in to get notre dame on the board yeah hes very active we talked about it earlier he is a do everything type of player offensively defensively he has a whole package Applause notre dame on the deny and on the spin move goodwin nice bounce feed to clear it back out leshesky off the front of the iron certainly the star for the irish the 610 junior averaging 15 points eight rebounds a game bayheim on the other end knocks the score here for the orange yeah the orange did a great job of getting it out in transition both teams have been really active defensively creating deflections and get it out in transition for opportunities and thats going to have to continue to get easy scoring opportunities out of the corner and goodwin cant knock it down but he is among the best threepoint men in the conference at 39 percent beyond the line behind trying to get inside that lane will spin to his right yeah syracuse just a little stagnant on offense right now a little bit out of sorts you got to give the notre dame defense a little bit of credit for being disruptive and keeping them out of the rhythm that starts the game jim beiheim in his 45th season at the helm for the orange the hall of famer trying to get his alma mater into the ncaa tournament for the 35th time since he has been the head coach over the top of the slam by durham they get it to the 611 center that is a great pass and a great finish and you have to look for that against that syracuse zone that will open up opportunities for you in a lot of different places if you can score over the top and coach bray talked about that yesterday with our breakdown session to back it out 61 sophomore one of the best assist men in the conference we know we can shoot the basketball his first one off target irish coming in at nine and ten and once again durham there right up on top of the iron great pass from trey works great vision had his eyes up durham terrific job of running the floor before the defense gets set durhams an interesting guy you know 10 points per game you always feel like at 10 and 5 danny that maybe theres more he can do hes obviously a premier shot blocker good touch there as behind ups in a pair yeah hes been the guy for them to to be the paint scorer he can probably step out to about 18 feet knock down a jump shot but hes much more effective closer to the basket hanging around the rim and on that acc logo area great good look there yes indeed thats something that you and i were talking about yesterday and earlier today notre dame is among the best passing teams and in fact both of these teams they share it particularly well well they sure do they do a great job with vision eyes up and theres another terrific pass over the top so these guys theyre ingrained to look up see the floor and share the basketball already you see the scoring beginning to pick up on both sides and if the threepointers start to fall as they did a year ago which is still an amazing number both sides hitting 15 of those the turnaround by durham man is he off to a nice start durhams off to a great start making his presence felt in the paint and thats only going to open up longrange shots for that notre dame team later on they have got a good look and hell drain that one he is number seven in the acc and threepoint makes per game when he gets rolling he can get really hot yes he is hes a shooter with deep range and he doesnt mind firing it up so notre dame by one on the baseline lechesky draws a lot of attention thats going to happen all afternoon works on target hell drain the triple great ball movement you see that extra pass turned down a good shot for a great wide open shot and a knock down three behind mcgann with a pull up too strong that time ski there for the rebound hes averaging eight boards per game yeah hes playing really well hes probably the most improved player in the acc to me with his improvement across the board offensively defensively with his body as well hes really playing like a first team guy certainly a second team guy in the acc about speed and a slam by durham and right now there is no answer for number 11 hes putting himself in position to score the basketball anytime you play against the syracuse zone you have to find those open areas and flash for the basketball and hes doing a great job of that and his teammates are doing spectacular than finding him in those open areas from the corner too strong that time 3a the 67 sophomore had a tremendous month of december coming in averaging 16 points again very quietly 16 and 9 heres durham again and another slam for the big guy the note to date the notre dame offense is terrific the notre dame 8 out of 12 so they are on fire and buddy behind looking to get his shot off the 66 junior filling it up early this is exactly what we anticipated talking about leshesky and the jump that hes made as you mentioned from last season to this season this goes beyond just becoming a better player hes become a star in this acc he sure has it he had a chance to learn from john moody last year mooney was a doubledouble machine and nathans come out this is a young man i recruited i got a chance to know him very well and he has more of a killer mindset right now when hes out there on the court and hes done a terrific job at the start of this game rebounding the basketball and having a presence on the glass and we all know he can really shoot and make shots notre dame on top 179 and syracuse with the basketball syracuse is trying to go down into the post and get a shot up and thats a great turnaround jump shot by dolazer we talked about him earlier he is a big playmaker a versatile player for the syracuse team very important to their success oh and by the way makes shots 55 hes shooting for the season up thought about it from long range back off for words who had a big game against purdue earlier this season and they continue to reign the longrange jumpers prentice hub and a really nice day last year on this court he hit six triples hes off to another good start yeah princess hub is one of the keys to that notre dame team play making and also shot making ability slicing inside a lot of iron but tap back out the irish on the attack again that was great yes he will bury that shot 2311 and the threes continue to fall here for the fighting irish notre dame on a 132 run you know notre dame is doing a terrific job of taking opportunities and not being hesitant and being very aggressive in their scoring opportunities and looks at the basket that is paying off for him by knocking down shots and meanwhile on the other end buddy behind commanding the offense hes coming off a 23point game against the irish last year inside the dome so hes still feeling that coming into the rematch here this afternoon oh absolutely you know whenever as a player you score a lot of points against the team you cant wait to see that team again and for buddy there are a lot of teams on that list for him hes someone that does a terrific job of getting open and knocking down shots so the irish on top by 10 by the way with nine early points for syracuse shot clock a factor now down to five kicked back out for words gets the shot in the air hes on fire early on yeah hes shooting the ball really well hes known for making shots and having great feel and right there shot fake take a step in not down mayheim again the following is short but he is looking for his shot virtually every time down so far here in the first half with 11 20 to go inside to dome in the opening 20 minutes and whistle with 11 18 to go the foul 2513 the fighting irish rocking in the early going heres our wednesday triple header clemson and wake starting things off at 4 30 eastern then nc state squares off against number seven virginia we capped the day with number 16 fsu with coral gables to take on rival miami all three games right here on acc network from our homes dave obrien and the legendary danny manning we look at the field goal shooting so far and obviously notre dame cant miss and danny theyve made 10 of their last 11 theyve done a terrific job of establishing themselves in the paint getting paint touches 14 points in the paint which opens up that threepoint line a little bit for them so notre dame on top 25 to 13 and with the basketball here on the road where they have had recent success inside the dome and launched by hub the tip wont go and collected by dolagis averaging 11 and five per game recently pulled down his 600th career rebound against boston college he did that a victory this week inside drops in two job he had a smaller guard on him took his time hitch baseline turned back to the middle good finish good elevation up again trying to get the pass free but a scrap for that a tie up on the floor and then you had this idea to i thought this was a lot of fun too to go with a bingo board explain what were looking at here today well ob this bingo board is just a lot of different ways that players score the basketball and i thought itd be fun to put it in a bingo board format and just see if we could get a game of bingo going i love bingo and uh its fun so you know these two teams are very high scoring offensiveminded teams so i think we might get a bingo in this game we just might we may be crying up and now when it happens youre the guy that has to signify it because this was your idea so i expect you to be the moderator here and be screaming out someones got bingo all right ill ill try to keep track of that you know right here dolozai comes down gets the ball into the paint attacks the paint does a terrific job of drawing the foul back inside but hes going to be rejected that launches the fast break and once again a foul on the play with 10 04 to go in a half yeah syracuse runs a good offense out of balance play joels eye slips to the basket great defense gives notre dame the chance to get out in transition hub drops it off too dojo gets fouled on the shot attempts so the 68 senior from canada joe go at the line and makes number one and he is perfect for the year at the foul line 15 for 15 both of these teams exceptional at the line that by the way was the first foul shot attempt the first two by either side in this game neither team likes to foul much dinner yeah both teams do a terrific job of playing defense with their head and their feet and staying in front of the ball and making teams shoot contested shots quick step for gurier but hes denied and again notre dame continues to play really good interior defense to deny the easy shots thats going to be stolen away by griffin thats what that zone defense does the link the athleticism deflection turnover steal and they get in transition and get a chance to attack the paint richmond cant get that one to go down and taken away by dane goodwin notre dame has done a terrific job on the glass rebounding the basketball trying to penetrate kicks it back out the motion offense for notre dame is really good theyve got three out two in right now great ball movement knocked down south cormac ryan the sophomore who rolled his left ankle in the first half of the last game against miami there was some concern that he might not make it back but hes just made this the biggest lead of the day 30 to 15 for notre dame notre dame has come out and found their rhythm offensively theyve got confidence and theyre ready to shoot the basketball and that is a telltale sign of all of coach brays teams he gives them great confidence on the offensive end to be aggressive again hes really taking it on himself because there has not been much scoring distribution here for syracuse goodwins going to lay it up and in and notre dame is just running away here doing a terrific job getting out in transition but also dolazar didnt want to pick up a foul so he almost had to let him go and give up that basket and the irish are flying high with 8 27 to go in the half leading 32 to 15 keep shooting 68 like this danny and theyre getting a lot of easy backs yes they are theyre doing a terrific job rebounding the basketball and know the game is known for pushing the ball in transition and passing an upper hand and theyre doing a terrific job of that scoring the ball in transition before that syracuse defense can get set an outstanding job of great vision and unselfish play and attacking the rim so theyre up in that category fast break points by a wide margin early 11 to two and theyre on a seven nothing run here inside the dome to open up a 3215 terrific job syracuse has got to move the ball get some openings and attack the pain and try to get to the freethrow line because they do a really good job of attacking that paint and getting to the freethrow line thats when theyre at their best so far they only have two guys who have scored it curry on the drive nicely done there for two its a bucket they desperately need it absolutely catch face up nice drive finish with the left hand at the rim so behind mandola jai 15 points you saw someone other than them finally score courier with his first basket over the top again they tried it once more for durham because the play has been so successful in this game but a whistle on the play itll go the other way yeah you know a lot of times that seems like its open but syracuse does a terrific job of getting a hand on that basketball and kind of taking that opportunity away from you and tomorrow we have a lacrosse triple header for you right here in the acc network number 13 the army men squaring off against number four syracuse at noon then the number 18 virginia tech women take on number 12 duke thats followed by top ranked north carolina taking on high point at chapel hill should be a great afternoon of lacrosse right here on the acc network syracuse doing a good job getting the ball into the paint just havent been able to finish draws the foul as he goes for the tough rebound yeah they do a good job getting the ball into the paint missed shot guerrier with a great effort play back up on the glass draws a foul hey thats one of our bingo blocks right there there you go one has been filmed syracuse going in line for the first time today and as a team they are shooting 79 percent if they finish out the season at 79 percent that will easily be a new syracuse record as durham goes to the bench and so far he has had an outstanding first half 79 leading the acc yeah they do a terrific job one of the better free throw shooting teams in the country so thats where we talk about getting paint touches and attacking the rim putting pressure on the defense to get to the freethrow line syracuse extending the pressure come out trying to speed you up they did that but terrific play in transition by goodwin finish with the left hand a very difficult angle to scoop that up and in so all manner of shots are falling for the irish dolage eye a little bit short there in the rebound by leshesky syracuse is getting the ball where they want it they just got to reward themselves by finishing some of those shots flashing up top his family has lived all over the world belgium australia connecticut florida spotter jay played in wisconsin where his sister abby is a junior on the womens team so tremendous roots in basketball deep shot from that corner by ryan the transfer from stanford filling it up terrific job of ball movement and one more extra pass we like to call that the hockey assist for a knockdown shot from deep range trying to get into the offensive flow and finally does hes coming off a game high 16 against boston college this week so already at the six minute mark here danny you talk about a game flying by when you were playing and coaching i dont know if you felt it like this games really rocking and rolling at this kind of a tempo but from a broadcasters seat you probably notice it in a big way right oh i sure do im noticing much more in the broadcasters seat because wed like to have a few stoppages of play gerard flynn at 3721 notre dame yeah gerard good job driving baseline hub uses his length of athleticism to block the shot from behind working on ryan the kick out for the long one off the back of the iron no good by griffin you know that defense by know the game right there is just what you want you come down and you give a little soft double team kicking out and they settle for a long jump shot in syracuse good win off the baseline back up top for a hub runs the offense the junior runner up for marlboro maryland off the fake works good win with another corner jumper so a rare threepoint miss but tapped out top and another effort here for the fighting irish yeah great second effort opportunity by keeping that ball alive on the offensive glass taking it out and theres another one great offensive stick to it this i guess by that notre dame team by scoring off an offensive rebound and you made the point earlier too and i think its a great observation that you know both of these teams usually were seeing that a lot today with notre dame playing very calm basketball not overly in a hurry as syracuse looks to cut into this disadvantage richmond with a basket thats a great point because they know theyre going to be in the game its not like 14 guys are going to show up you dont have three subs waiting to come in for you if youre playing for syracuse or notre dame youre absolutely right both players from these teams they understand it theyre going to be in the ballgame and theyre going to have opportunities to score the basketball so theyre not always in a rush to try to make something happen all the time great patience a great understanding way downtown for griffin who makes 37 the illinois transfer who is leading this team in scoring by a little bit and the orange need a lot more of that here down the stretch of the first half were already coming down the stretch of the first half yes we are that was a terrific longrange shot and hes an aggressive player he does a terrific job of making shots right now the notre dame offense is spreading the basketball out moving it around found that high post spot and another really good pass down a little bit denied by the length and athleticism by syracuse at the rim going in strong but thats an offensive foul so hell commit the charge on alan griffin 3926 notre dame with the lead here in the first half griffin trying to give the orange the lift from way downtown basketball is brought to you by zaxbys hand breaded chicken and fresh ingredients made to order only at zaxbys overhead shot of the beautiful syracuse campus covered in snow that shot was in july by the way the one were showing you right now im just kidding but it could be well tremendous start here for notre dame but syracuse is going to be playing the rest of the season without sedibe in the middle and this is a big loss its a very different looking team in many ways for jim boeheim if he has this guy in the center of things youre absolutely right siddiq bay is a great defender patrols the middle of that zone rebounds the basketball at a high clip and hes also a terrific shot blocker and also alters shots so his presence is greatly missed by that syracuse team in that zone defense i see the rebounding advantage for notre dame thats not a strength for the irish certainly but they have more than an edge here on the glass in the first half points in the paint 2016 and the irish with the basketball again they have led by as many as 18 points here in the first half on the road words will add to that lead with a triple yeah were coming close to a heat check ob these guys are shooting the ball really really well from the perimeter and theyre very confident when they elevate up and shoot the basketball trying to answer no big rebound by brazwell in the baseline to keep it alive and the second chance richmond on the spin and even the bunnies are not dropping here for the orange in the first half so a very very quick moving first half and the irish like it that way a shove from behind as lazzeski goes down and fouled with 2 15 to go yeah notre dame great job of getting the ball pass out of the double team any time that syracuse defense has a chance to trap you in that baseline area theyre going to trap you pass out for hog yes all nets and i mean not only are the longdistance shots falling theyre not even touching the iron danny youre right that was all net deep shot gerard with an answer yes notre dame is doing a good job of getting the ball to the paint then kicking it out to wide open jump shots so the irish 7 out of 12 on a very similar pace to what they did when they came here last year and won a thriller by one point game in which both syracuse and the fighting irish hit 15 threes and a rare miss beyond the threepoint line i guess its going to be off the backboard to miss if youre wearing blue today yeah you know what but you have to understand long shots mean long rebounds so when youre going in for a rebound you have to understand that a lot of times those long threes will bounce out away from the basket foul there by brazwell going for the block on le chesky with a minute 12 to go that was with just two on the shot clock yeah i thought that was a really headsup play by trey works getting into the paint drawing help and dropping it down to le chester on the baseline to attack the rim 45 to 29 with another one coming we celebrate black history month with acc winter unity week the conference initiative to allow athletes coaches administration from all backgrounds to come together gallon cup will be hosting a virtual roundtable celebrating some of the acc trailblazers on monday at 7 eastern right here on acc network and the espn app well only has three points danny but hes been killing the glass he has 10 rebounds hes doing a terrific job of going after rebounds rebounding the ball outside of his area and that notre dame team needs that when they force the syracuse team to miss notre dame continues to pour on the points here in the first half but an air ball there by goodwin we havent seen many misfires by the irish thats for sure in these first 20 minutes yeah that was uh that was a miss and now syracuse can get out and i really like it when syracuse attacks the paint because they shoot the ball so well from the freethrow line so theyve got to quit selling for long jump shots and get that ball into the paint area and make some type of play from there mike bray will take a timeout here 271 seconds to go before the break and well take a quick timeout as well 4632 notre dame field goals 13 assists as well to your earlier point danny about how well they move the ball and look for each other yeah theyre doing a terrific job of mixing up their offense sometimes its four out sometimes its three out two in but theres great ball movement and a lot of hockey assist making the extra pass so looking to run one more play here regardless of how this ends up they have to be absolutely delighted with their first 20 minutes 73 to go and another whistle yeah absolutely the ball movements been good theyre knocking down shots and theyre very confident in what theyre doing offensively against the solo queue zone notre dame plays like this and youre like why are they nine and ten why are they just six and seven in the acc and they are playing well right now they won backtoback games four out of their last five not giving up hope that a big run in the acc tournament might get to the acc uh championship and thats gonna be off target at the buzzer but at the half notre dame and they never trailed in the first half on top 4632 notre dame their biggest lead was 19 points man did they get out of the gates and just kept on making shots all through the first half big advantage heading into the center for our show this week man we had a lot of first time guest pack and some familiar faces as well we went with the grizzled veteran jay bilas though to lead us through these uncertain times with terrible weather coveted cancellations postponements who better to break it down though than our man jay billis though right and we yep absolutely and we started with his confidence level in the ncaa tournament happening im not concerned that were going to get through it were going to get through it um theres just too much money on the line its going to happen like the ncaa bubble event in indianapolis is going to go on um thats going to happen and and the tournaments are going to be played because theyre theyre the one thing that they have are massive contracts in place that they have to provide inventory to media partners so this is going to happen i have zero doubt about that um the the question is and to your question is you know how many teams are gonna are gonna suffer those interruptions and to me i mean i i thought about this a lot with the ncaa you know bubble event protocols for indianapolis how theyre gonna handle that and how i would handle it if i were running a team and really what youre gonna have to do is take your entire tier one uh group and isolate them like the players have been isolated this whole time because you know look they dont publicize this but one of the issues that weve been dealing with is the players have been in total isolation and their their risk is minimal the risk is being brought in by the coaches and the staff because they go home every day and uh and so if you really want to eliminate that risk uh i think youre gonna have to say okay everybodys gotta go into this bubble with the players if the syracuse basketball team got into a massive snowball fight who would be your number one partner who would you want as your partner in a syracuse snowball fight ill go to quincy you know canadian man gary oh montreal man yeah yep yeah youre going experience and size right yep for sure yeah and by the way if youve had the perfect snowball and quincy was your partner whos the first target whos the guy you want you want bayheim youre going after buddy first buddy yeah 100 you have to have the best beard in the acc you know i havent grown out my beard throughout these years but mine it can get pretty pretty intense so i think so yeah all right so all right well thats i like the confidence number one so whats the worst it ever got i mean did you go zz top on me whatd you do there well whats whats the worst that ever got quarantined this lap this past year from around march to id say july i let it grow and i look like an orthodox priest that is fantastic did bray see that did bray see that beard i dont know i dont know if i sent him a picture but um it was not popular among my family and the girls i was talking to so yeah well you know hey if the ladies dont like it then you know its all about adjustment right you gotta you gotta have that flexibility thats all part of the gig if the ladies dont like it no its got to go its got to go unity week on acc network back on the acc network presented by food line notre dame with a big lead 4632 over syracuse dave obrien danny manning danning at halftime i got to believe that mike bray was absolutely delighted with everything which is unusual for a coach oh absolutely very pleased with how his team was playing but he doesnt want them to be content they did a great job of pushing the ball up in transition pitching it ahead flattening out the defense and making the extra pass and they shot it very well from behind the threepoint line really good job yes i mean that fast break was a big part of the reason they shot about you know 68 in the first half search is trying to claw their way back yeah they did a really good job of getting the ball into the paint they didnt make as many shots as they normally do but this is what theyre gonna have to do to get back into the ball game attack the paint get the basketball to the rim and draw fouls and get to the freethrow line where theyre so good at a game summary now the fighting irish moving it so effectively 15 assists on the 18 made field goals big advantage in fast break points wurtz really really good three for three all from threepoint land he had 12 to lead the way for the fighting irish in the first half notre dame 46 ready for the second half with notre dame in control at the moment syracuse needs more than one hot hand to claw back into this thing 46 to 32 as the orange have the basketball as we get the second 20 underway dave obrien danny manning as we come to you from our homes today great to have you alongside a very busy day not only in the acc but across the country in college basketball well see who syracuse gets going offensively a little scoop shot by gerard wont fall loose in the corner and they throw it away so right back over the irish it goes you know what its a good job by syracuse of attacking the paint they just werent able to finish notre dame does a good job of closing in on the basketball and forcing the turnover irish such a good threepoint shooting team they make 38 and another good foul shooting team just like syracuse they make 77 of their shots goodman cant get that one to go yeah well thats a welcome sight for syracuse to see a miss so they can get out in transition and try to get a bucket i think the syracuse team needs to get the ball to the paint and play from there bay high with a pullup pop curie tips it to himself back up for bayheim and he will knock that one down from three that was a great effort played by gaurier hopefully they can parlay that into some more energy and juice on the offensive him notre dame has played one of the top 10 most difficult schedules in the country theres a while there i thought they had gone over to the big ten you know early in the season because thats all they were playing you know they played michigan state ohio state they were playing purdue and a jump shot on target by leski he had a quiet scoring first down yeah nate sure did but he rebounded the ball we talked about that we know hes capable of making shots and he knocks down the threepointer right there swung underneath oligar back out courier bayheim led the way with nine in the first half for his syracuse looking for some contact cant drop it in terrific defense stayed in front of the basketball didnt leave their feet walled up made them shoot a tough shot got the rebound and now theyre back on the offensive end durham boy he was something in the first seven or eight minutes of the game somehow got the pass free leski will drain the triple its going well for notre dame right now they get the ball to durham he almost turns it over with the travel finds princess hub cutting to the basket and the ball finds a shooters hand for a knockdown shot from behind the line and here they are again notre dame shot the ball like this last year in the carrier dome nine for 17 outside the threepoint line leading at 5235 dolage gave it up in transition this has been deadly today for the fighting irish their transition offense transition offense and ball movement has been really really good theyre sharing the basketball theyre finding open areas in that syracuse zone and when they have opportunities to shoot the basketball theyre not hesitant and theyre shooting it confidently and theyre knocking shots down both coaches wearing those towels on their shoulder a tribute to the great john thompson legend of the big east but i dont think unlike jim beehive i think that mike bray is going to keep his on forever he may sew it onto that pull over the way his team has been playing today he may never leave that shoulder youre absolutely right hes going to keep that towel on for a while and this is what he gets when they shoot the basketball when hes wearing a towel like this and look at words who just continues danny hes been amazing today hes been on fire that man is shooting the ball exceptionally well from the perimeter making great plays trey the son of a sports reporter his dad langston writes for the charlotte observer and the headline is that trey wurtz has been tearing it up inside the dome this afternoon yes he has he has doubled his scoring average durham with the misfire one and done on that occasion for the irish but they lead it 5537 on the road griffin and they need a whole lot more of that yes they do griffin theyre leaving the score needs to find ways to get on track and maybe that bucket will do it for him mike brady go back to his bench in a moment either side plays more than six seven eight at the most no surprise there look at the bench points notre dame with eights with a dribble down and gonna let that one bounce out of play 15 29 to go here in the second half more cheering from mike gray likes what hes seeing here this afternoon his team sharing the sugar and hitting the threes thats been a winning cup you can score points for your school and after the tournament the local boys and girls club will receive a donation

from threepoint land the most in an acc game this season hes shooting the ball very well hes making himself available and hes shooting the ball with great confidence and great results getting himself into the flow offensively the sophomore with two now look at the threepoint shooting for notre dame and on the glass they have a slight advantage 21 to 19 yes they do terrific job syracuse is going to come out now and pick up their aggressiveness theyve extended the defense theyre trying to turn notre dame over get some deflections to get out in transition shot clock down to five hub launches that missed ugly i havent said that very often today exactly what syracuse needed a tough shot now they need to get out and attack the paint again or to lead and score trying to get you on the board theyre on a mini run here the orange is six nothing run but a misfire 55 to 41 the irish trying to get to 500 with a victory here today both overall and in the conferences six and seven they have been up by as many as twenty leshesky got a good look there cant deny that but he couldnt hit it yeah great look great offense got the ball to the high post turn around jump shot youll take that opportunity from him anytime you like dolage with a touch working on joe go to his right well he got a good look but couldnt bury it a scramble for the loose ball and ryan comes away with it yeah really good job of being active and coming up with a 5050 basketball oh what a headsup play by gerard gerard cannot finish on the layin boy thats the way its been going for syracuse today huh it sure has been you make a great defensive play and you struggle finishing and rewarding yourself for that defensive play goodwin on the other end drains the three and the frustration evident on the face of joe girard 15 weve had some outstanding football products come out of syracuse university of course the greatest of all time probably jim brown who also was a magnificent lacrosse player jim was one of those guys you know if he picked up a golf club at four years old he would have won the masters five times he could have done anything he wanted but uh magnificent lacrosse player too and you you know danny the history of lacrosse at syracuse among uh the greatest programs of all time oh absolutely very talented history and program and you know you talk about jim brown hes one of the best to do it in a lot of different sports wonderful person kick up top roswell off the fade cant hit that shot big fight for the rebound and a nice save on the baseline by jogo thats the man syracuse needs to stop trey wurtz is left open again hell miss this one but hes had a tremendous day for mike gray yeah he sure has i think hub has done a great job of making sure he finds works when hes open and hes hitting them on time and in rhythm yeah im not sure prentice hub gets all the love he deserves as far as point guards in the acc were talking about six assists per game 14 points the junior from maryland can also nail the threepoint shot and theres a lot of things he does for this team when they win games hes usually right in the thick of it he sure is he scores a basketball he shoots it but his playmaking ability to your point does not get enough attention he does a great job of facilitating instead of setting his teammates up very capable scorer as well as joe go will hit the bench for the irish theyre on top 58 to 43 nine assists today for hub golijay yes hell swing inside for a pair yeah syracuse now theyve got to turn up to pressure defensively they did that the last possession they got a turnover this is another good defensive possession all but theres a foul reaching in but theyre extending that pressure and trying to turn up that physical aggression to get back in this ball game yeah richmond didnt think so he did not think he committed the foul but brian dorsey said he did and joe go back on ryan will go to the sideline you see everything so socially distanced there how tough would that be for you danny on the sideline i mean ive heard coaches talk about it a head coach will look for an assistant whos usually right there at his elbow and hes 12 feet away yeah you see a lot you see things differently when youre sitting on that bench from time to time theres no question about that thats where your staff comes into play making sure that their eyes are out there and theyre helping you see everything you need to see richmond with a smooth move to pick up two more and all of a sudden syracuse on a bit of a run here theyve cut it to 5847 and the press yeah theyre doing a really good job of trying to speed up notre dame with a miss so he blew the lane long distance shot wont go by goodwin Music you dont like the opportunities that youre giving up if youre syracuse but notre dame has not rewarded themselves by finishing those so you can live with it because youre getting the chance to get back in the ball game behind drains it from way downtown and syracuse has suddenly pulled within eight points on a ninenothing run what a momentum swing this is and theyve cut it to single digits for the first time in a long time good one on the other end well score it quickly to make it 60 to 50 great pass by hub finds a cutting good one to the basket thats a bingo slap point they did a good job there on the drive behind man made the shot count that and hell be at the line thats the play of the day so far beehive has been very aggressive with his touches did a great job richmond gets into the pain elevates up kisses it off the glass and buddy here gets into the paint takes the contact with the finish hyman company right back in the game 60 to 52 with 10 37 to go i thought i heard you yelling out of bingo a couple of moments ago danny yeah i think we got a bingo on this last play i think buddy does a terrific job of getting the ball to the paint right here a little hesitation dribble drive to the left hand finishes off the glass for an and one in the paint bingo Music your moderator one hall of famer danny manning and bayheim at the line makes it a threepoint play and this is a ball game and were talking about three and a half or so minutes into this half notre dame and a reach in and a foul here had led by as many as 20 and now its down to seven yeah syracuse has done a great job of applying pressure turning up the heat and as long as they can continue to make notre dame get the first catch in that corner kind of coughing corner and they can get a double team thats tough sled and getting the ball out of there with their length and athleticism looking for the double and the theft again and goodwin has it the offensive zone durham to the paint and throws it away syracuse with another pick yep great continuity to force those turnovers speed them up turn them over speed them up turn them over durham with the rejection out of play off notre dame so 10 12 to go ton of time here an 18 to five run for syracuse and a look of concern finally on the face of mike bray thats the first time weve seen that today yes it is theyve got to do a better job of handling pressure taking on two guys and finding an open player notre dame players have to make themselves available versus that type of pressure gaurier on the baseline with the catch backs it back inside flips it up no whistle terrific defense by durham stayed on his feet walled up made glorious shoot a tough shot over him so now the irish who have looked so calm and cool and collected i mean theyve been in fifth gear all day now they have to find themselves again and get back in an offensive groove shot clock is down to six and its tipped away in another turnover as syracuse comes away behind a quick shot great job with that syracuse defense thats what they do they use that linkedin athleticism to get deflection to get out in transition and thats how they want to play the rest of this ball game to give themselves a chance to get back into it and take the lead well theyve totally turned the momentum here you see how good syracuse has been at home nothing new there for a jim beijing team roswell gives it up dolage maybe a little too unselfish from time to time yeah i agree i think dolozai has the skill set to be much more aggressive when he gets that ball in the pain area to score in the basketball bayheim right in front of the horn absolutely buries a three a 152 run for syracuse theyve cut this thing to four points yes they have and behind has been the catalyst all game long being very aggressive with his touches and has got his team back in the ball game ill tell you what notre dame looks confused and another steal syracuse in transition terrific job of richmond whos one of the steals leaders in the league and it leads to a threepointer for syracuse guerrier to make it 6059 he has nine points and an incredible turnaround here from 20 points down now theyre down by one point with about eight and a half minutes to go and they are charging at the fighting irish buddy beehive hes been well a game that at halftime looked like it was going to be a walk in the park maybe for notre dame has turned into a fight for their lives this afternoon because buddy behind is cooking 21 points hes brought the orange back in this thing from 20 points down danny manning to just one down with about eight and a half minutes to go he sure has were gonna call them buddy buckets from this point forward because he is getting buckets hes playing bingo hes making shots and hes got his team back in this syracuse with a lot of good defense too on a 245 run ryan looking for an answer off the front of the iron the tip wont drop roswell comes away with a rebound syracuse has not had a lead all day and theyre looking for their first one right now yeah theyve got to come down and get some good ball movement attack the paint does i could be more aggressive when he catches the ball right there in that sweet spot that elbow he could be really efficient from there knocking down shots roswell from three a fight for the rebound a tie up on the play and a whistle was 7 48 to go those are the types of plays that you really need somebody to get you an extra possession a hustler playing effort play and guerriere does that on a regular basis right there for an offensive rebound durham back to the bench the big time shot blocker for the irish exactly syracuse on the baseline richmond kicks it back out launches another one he cannot miss and syracuse leads it 6260 buddy buckets buddy buckets ive seen some hot shooters this season but hes in another league right now on this saturday afternoon his career high by the way is 26 hes closing in on that he has 24 notre dame just cant score and they keep turning it over virtually every time down that syracuse defense the long theyre athletic they force you to throw balls and arrows that you cant get to it which leads to a turnover they want the ball in number 35s hands every chance they get a whistle off the ball and stops the clock at 6 57 to play here in the second half and if youre mike brady what words of wisdom do you have for your team that seemed to have the game in hand not that long ago danny well you want to talk to your team about taking care of the basketball making sure that you can deliver the basketball to your teammates on time and on target and then youve got to attack a seam of that zone try to get to the paint and get an easy opportunity i know we think this all the time down the lane and a foul as dola jai wanted the basket too hell be headed to the line we think about this all the time here in the age of cobin 19 but can you imagine what this place would sound like right now inside the carrier dome if you had 35 000 people here with this kind of a comeback this would be i mean your ears would be hurting you right now dave speaking from experience yes it would be very loud in that building right now yeah and i know that you know in your playing days you you led that charge to blowing the roof off allen fieldhouse many many times syracuse trying to extend that lead dolizhai does to make it 6460 nothing but net every sunday our weekly basketball studio show we preview the week and look back at the best games this weeks show tomorrow a special time at six oclock eastern two hours earlier than usual on the acc network yeah this notre dame team theyve got to find an open area in that zone flash the basketball go meet it and make an extra pass to get a better look ryan going in strong but an offensive foul so a charge on the irish terrific defensive rotation by brazwell he comes over beats cormac to the spot sets his feet draws the foul tremendous offensive play defensive play excuse me so ryan comes off syracuse trying to pick up their 13th win of the season and go to 75 in the acc they have scored 14 consecutive points and theyre on a 295 run gourier thats a charge another great defensive play played defense with her feet slid over cut off the baseline beat him to the spot textbook defense and taking the charge right there obviously its a big big game for both teams but its bigger for syracuse because many will tell you theyre a team on the bubble right now 126 65 in the acc a very bizarre season for everybody chris syracuse especially so at one point they were shut down for 18 days no and danny those shots that were coming so easily in the first half not in the second half youre right theyre not making the shots that they made syracuse is doing a better job of getting out and contesting those shots and putting some type of defensive pressure on them when they get ready to shoot the basketball ridgeman the freshman from brooklyn hes giving him a nice lift heres behind again rebound tip down a foul over the back thatll go against syracuse and dolage yeah buddy that was a heat check shot right there and hes deserved it hes made some shots he comes off of a pin down quick trigger hes capable of making those and just happened to miss that buddys favorite alltime athlete by the way is none other than tom brady he became an overnight tampa bay bucks fan this year and he admitted that he said yeah ill watch him wherever he plays and cheer them on in the super bowl long range and too long again and notre dame just not hitting those threes anymore and theyre 31 shooting in this half after shooting up near 65 the first half yeah the first half when durham was in the ball game he was a paint scoring presence for him they threw the ball over the top to him and he scored and it flattened out that defense hes not in the game right now so syracuse is extending that defensive pressure getting out to those shooters from notre dame and giving them problems and limiting their effectiveness in making shots just over five to play syracuse by four and as dramatic a turnaround as we have seen in the acc this season because they were down by 20 points well into the second half yeah syracuse just a great job of grinding it out and getting back in the ball game up top words they need him and hell drain that triple and he continues to be a hot hand its a onepoint game yes welcome sight for the iris to see a threepointer go down so syracuse on top four and a half minutes remaining by one point durian operate in the orange up it goes went for the bank and a whistle and a foul with 4 20 to play golizard great job of getting on the offensive glass and getting his team in extra possession they do a terrific job of fighting for position and going after offensive rebounds and this young man right here does it all for this team steps to the free throw line where he is a high percentage shooter he shoots the ball at 70 85 from the freethrow line again syracuse an excellent freethrow shooting team as you mentioned 85 for this guy and as a team 79 i frankly dont know who wins if it becomes a foul shooting contest because theyre both really good at the line youre right they both shoot the ball at a high clip from the freethrow line notre dame 77 percent golijay with 14 so three points separating these two down the stretch we come you know right now the defense of syracuse has turned up a little bit and theyve got notre dame playing out a little bit closer to that syracuse logo which is what they normally do when theyre turned up back out for words gets his own miss kept that alive lets look for syracuse to continue to apply pressure notre dames got to get that ball to that high post in the zone goodwin chases it into the corner shot clock down to two on the spin hub got it up off that backboard and hell get a third crack at it hub again big rebound by guerrier yeah syracuse they got lucky they dodged some bullets on that one right there no dave had some opportunities to make some shots based on great effort and hustle now syracuse grabbing the rebounding advantage and on the offensive glass as well golijay very difficult angle somehow he made the shot great dribble drive catches at that elbow drives it with the right hand finishes with a tough finish over the defense he has 16 points and that was his most creative shot today goodwin getting away from the pressure notre dame looking for someone to bring them back theyre down 6863 Applause that syracuse defense has turned up right now theyve got great ball pressure theres that high post catch good one yes contested in a big way yes thats what syracuse does to you right now they make you shoot tough shots at the rim because they are late in athleticism a very very different syracuse team defensively danny in the second half where notre dame was getting pretty much anything they wanted in the first 20 anything but over about the last you know 14 minutes theres bayhem again he has been the star lifting syracuse into a 7163 lead he has had a magnificent second half he sure has but that play was made by dolazar catching the basketball triple drive euro flip pass a buddy who knocks down another long range three ski with the miss and they hit their 154 to go and syracuse on the back of buddy beyheim had some great defense as a chance for one of the best comeback wins in cc network basketball is brought to you by food lion official grocer of the acc well this has turned into some game we mentioned buddy behind 27 points thats a new career high but danny manning how about some love for number 21 for syracuse mark dolagh dolazai is a big playmaker for the syracuse ball team hes one of their leaders and assists he catches the ball hes able to put it on the deck dribble drive find open teammates he rebounds the basketball he has a great understanding and feel and that is what helped get to sarah hqs team back in the ball game him finding that hot hand of buddy buckets 610 senior and jim beiheim watching his team make an amazing comeback here not done yet 7165 plenty of time to go here for notre dame and they put the press on again yeah theyve got to do a really good job of coming out and trying to turn over the syracuse team with ball pressure so they can get out in transition like they were earlier in the ball game and getting easier scoring opportunities three of the last four games have been decided by two points or less the game here at the carrier dome last year was decided by one dollar hesitation draws the foul so hell be back to the line at 85 that was the same play they ran earlier he catches the ball at the elbow and if you help off of buddy buckets he flips it to buddy for a shot if you dont help he turns the corner and gets into the paint and draws the fire as jim behind told us yesterday on the zoom call he said you know basically everything we do runs through barak dolaji hes played every minute seven times this season and smooth at the line to make it 7365 so with about 90 seconds to go you dont get real comfortable but a little bit of breathing room suddenly for the orange who barely led in this game until about five minutes ago youre right just a terrific job of grinding it and finding ways to get back into the ball game swing here for words hell drive it underneath for goodwin lays it in a time becoming a factor now for notre dame as they try and make a comeback yeah no danes got to extend the pressure they got to come double team the ball and try to speed up the syracuse team so jim boeheim whos been wearing that john thompson towel game maybe it becomes his goto for now on and not so much mike gray the way the second half has unfolded yeah he brought out a different towel for the second half he did a foul on the play you better have right yes those two had an amazing relationship taking a look yeah buddys shot the ball so well from the perimeter you have to get up on him and take that away which opens up a dribble drive opportunity for him going to that right hand and trying to finish high he draws a foul and gets to the free throw buddy tremendous at the line at 86 percent well he had a standout game against notre dame on this court last year but this is way better in many respects obviously the fact that he can win the game last year a devastating loss on a controversial no call at the end of the game now syracuse leading 7567 notre dame trying to get quick shots in the air 35 seconds to go and syracuse with a tremendous comefrombehind effort today on their way to a victory over notre dame that looked like it was not going to happen at halftime at the carrier dome danny this is an amazing comeback today for syracuse amazing comeback for syracuse and this is something that they definitely needed being on the bubble this is going to bode well for them on their resume shot clock violation theres six seconds to go and syracuse about to start celebrating on the campus at syracuse university today as they knock off the notre dame fighting irish who appeared to have the game in hand they were shooting the lights out syracuse was way behind and look at that reaction by jim beiheim syracuse closes the game on a 40 to 12 run and buddy baeheim with a careerhigh 29 are zaxbys player of the game
