indeed so we are set for the opening tip and were underway as the W pack takes it here at Chapel Hill Joel lardy right now has North Carolina as number two seed in the upcoming NCAA tournament slamming on the brakes living a well short DJ horn the top score for the wolf pack at 18 points a game so a rough start but he can get rolling it 31 against Wake Forest 32 against circus hes an El leite threepoint shooter as well OB so hes a guy that you have to keep an eye on El CAD getting that assignment early but you see NC State picking up 94 ft after North Carolina did not finish that game well against Miami they can expect a lot of pressure here today remember one important thing they won that game they werent happy with the way it played out at the end except for the W bot with a touch turns and fires and he air M it so Rocky start for both sides as we give you a look at the starting lineup for NC State DJ horn DJ Burns and Casey Morell combined for 42 points a game and right on Q theres Burns for the bucket but the wolf pack can really Stuffle the score time but OB DJ Burns did not score against Florida State last time out already off to a better start both Carolina starting line brought to you by eBay RJ Davis incredible against Miami 42 points on Monday but when Carolina won the first meeting against NC State it was Harrison Ingram who led them he had 19 rebounds in that contest Devin ke head coach seventh year for NC Applause State Kevin ke likes to hes confident in his teams ability to be able to come in here and get a win one he understands the Rivalry between these two Davis first shot of the day wont drop for him and he also understands the importance that his veteran team knows about coming into this building and how important this game is for them for the NCAA tournament champion RJ Davis had seven threes seven tws and seven foul shots on one day roll in the seven SC off for Ingram Ingram trying to get a little bit closer to the bucket and hell draw the foul and be headed to the line to 67 Applause J Kevin Keats beating Rivals Duke of North Carolina last season a big reason that they went to the NCAA tournament now theyve got him in backto Back Games up against Hubert Davis he and Bill guthridge the only Carolina coaches to win 20 or more each of their first three seasons Michael O Connell with his first foul Ingram at the line he was a giant in game one we were watching him out here here at about 1000 this morning all by himself shooting three shooting twos tied up 22 horen 43 Beyond a threepoint line heres okell Marcel on the Move Casey C attacking the basket similar to what he did Tuesday against Florida State where he scored an ACC High 19 points Ingram that early shooting pan off as he drills a long one he has five quick points Harrison Ingram off to a great start early hasnt had big offensive games the last two times out but hes focused and locked in on the task here this afternoon Rell again on the spin Airborne boy thats a pretty shot but once again casim Morel playing with a lot of confidence Kevin ke told us we need him to be better and he has been that the last two games win over Boston College and then the loss against Florida State Bott going for the slam hell draw the foul off the give and go with RJ Davis RJ Davis is a young man who of course would love to get another three up however even though he creates some space he does not take the shot to get a better shot for his teammate recognize that theres going to be a mismatch on the other side where Harrison England was able to catch the basketball on the post and get to the free throw line lot of discussion today with North Carolina head coach Uber Davis about how RJ Davis has matured bacock 2 two guys who have hung around theyve you know garnered a lot of really good coaching over the years theyve gotten better and better every single year but he also said thats what college is supposed to be about its he he looked at me and said hey this is how we did it you come in as a freshman and you learn and you get better as each and every year goes along and now all of a sudden here you are year four for RJ Davis youre an ACC player of the year I shouldnt even call it a candidate at this point its a shoe in he is the ACC Player of the Year oh nice job there for the big guy DJ Burns to wle free and go to the other side of the iron four points for him Kevin by one Kevin likes the match up with DJ Burns against B angram SLS it in K found him it was a wide open Lane and he knew exactly what to do with Music it that brings the big crowd to life here on a Saturday horn will launch got it a threepointer and OB DJ horn can make tough shots thats a difficult thing because you can play really good defense on him and he can still go get a bucket for example M Bryan on that possession had a good hand up it wasnt enough to stop horn from knocking down the free ball DJ is 62 grad played two years at Illinois State Arizona State as well and thats going to fall in Bok going in strong you talk about Armando Bott I know sometimes fans get frustrated hes had some up and down games nine points against Georgia Tech went for five and four F this you is five points against W Forest I think hes had a lot of very big moments for this team this year big rebounds in particular the back down by Burns he swoops and misses OB honestly I think thats been the biggest difference in Armando Bott this season is what hes done defensively and weve talked about this North Carolina team and how much better they are this season on the defensive end I think that is anchored by vott so regardless as the numbers even though hes still the only ACC player averaging a double double regardless of the offensive numbers he has been an anchor for them defensively and youd put him on First Team all absolutely hes on my first te now trying an early three coach Kei said if he hits one of those early hes a different player K nice angle shot off the window so North Carolina with a 1311 Advantage The Freshman his first bucket Hubert Davis going on his bench in a moment Burns an outstanding passer Ian Bott should be entertaining today no basket there they wave it off and a foul before on Armando Bott the battle on the interior its the bigs its DJ Burns going up against Amando Bott and Vantage burns with the spin move the reverse layup and Harrison Ingram the work scoreless couple of nights ago but you know he always believes The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow doesnt he despite no points over for two 12 minutes not a single rebound just the second time in 152 games going scoreless this is what he wears around his so just you know even in a rain cloud that Suns going to come out eventually I mean again if if thats your belief then of course what better way to make sure you show that than to have in crust in diamonds I mean thats the only way I can see it OB DJ Burns blinging coming into the game today there are people right now working on their laptops going where can I get one of those absolutely I kind of like that already seven lead changes and were barely underway morcel went to drive it Davis in front of him shot clock down to five and he cant hit jayen Washington 610 sophomore Into The Fray he hit the deck theyll come out take a high pass from Applause Davis Harrison Ingram seven points right away for North Carolina and thats going to go the other way thatll be be on Withers against North Carolina with the Music offensive Jaylen Withers with the foul so North Carolina by two NY stayed at 17 11 98 in the ACC they lost at FSU Tuesday seal shot 60 in that game thats the highest NC state has allowed All Season against an opponent Applause heres horn with a three to Strong Middle Brooks with a big rebound Obie thats something that Huber Davis talked to you and I about that they were giving up too many offensive rebounds even though North Carolinas the top rebounding team in the ACC he does not like the second chance opportunities theyve given up as of late OK Connell got the pass to Middlebrooks hell kick out for Taylor and he hits the three and thats a prime example of Ben Middlebrooks with the offensive rebound patience offensively by the Wolfpack ends up being a three by Taylor who scored 24 points the most as hes had in an NC stay uniform on Tuesday but from started or coming off the bench kind of a wild effort there by Withers Carolina one and done oconnell the guy who likes to hit the three as Applause well horn with a pull up midrange to Swit in DJ horn is going to stay aggressive no matter what hes going to make North Carolina have to deal with him on each and every possession down the Applause floor Washington took the shot got hit theyll draw the foul let see state by three and coming up here at ESPN Virginia and number 10 Duke thatll be followed by number four Tennessee and number 14 Alabama squaring off in the prime time match up so This Is A Feast for a college basketball fan today all day it absolutely is that so much great basketball especially this time of year being played and of course you can check it all out here on our ESPN family Network meaningful games Applause everywhere Washington out of Gary Indiana 63 foul shooter Harrison Ingram going to the bench for the moment Applause and the sophomore with number two and back to a onepoint game ellot Canó back on the floor here for Hubert Davis to run the offense but a different lineup for Hubert Davis now hes got three reserves on the floor alongside Cad and cor M Ryan both Armando Bott and RJ Davis sitting thats how much trust Hubert Davis has In his reserve one of those reserves Trimble picks it up hell drive it and score it set Trimble with the basket the best on ball Defender for the Tar Heels making immediate impact when he checks into the game horn gets free Applause no coming up on 12 minutes to go here first half from Chapel Music Hill Trimble lost the handle shot clock at four Trimble got to look at it got to get a shot in the air he Hees it up there well short and a shot clock violation so a sketchy possession there for North Carolina record it is because the leadership from the players there did did not take the lessons that they learned from Jordan Miller Isaiah Wong a season ago and pass those down to the younger players oh great feed inside for the quick strike Parker Jr getting in there for the bucket and once again its DJ burns with that great vision Miami had such a great year last year they lost two giant leaders certainly you know Miller and Wong made all the difference there but there was plenty of talent coming back but there was also Harlem bever and Anthony Walker coming off the bench and right now what you have for Miami is youve got freshman coming off the bench trying to step up into place of veterans when theres injuries going on Taylor shot with a Miss we saw it on Monday night what a great coach Jim Lena is kept them in the game Withers with a nice spin for two great job by Withers ceiling on the inside often you dont see that however no help and SE Trimble placing the basketball only to where his teammate can catch it and go finish back and forth we go thats the early narrative here lead Changing Hands 11 times already rebound there by cornack Lian Obie this is one of those games in its cliche but you hear it all the time with these two schools you throw out the records it doesnt matter whos having a great season whos not when youve got North Carolina and NC State going at it its going to always be a battle they got a determined move there He will draw the foul lets go inside the play here well as you see the defender trying to get on the outside DJ Burns making the beautiful find to Dennis Parker cutting along the Baseline was able to get the easy bucket burns with number one so Armondo to the line 77 and hes playing in his 161st ACC game tying Virginia ke clarkk for the Applause record 611 Brad with another feather in his cap Applause today where his 82 career double doubles is 31 of them in the NCAA tournament hes tied with the Admiral David Robinson with 31 in the tournament in the 80s with navy both car Lina on top 2118 horn wants to fire it up and Nails another one DJ horn getting to his spots getting to the midrange and a lot it has to do with the coverage from North Carolina dropping against pick and rolls giving him that midrange jumper and allowing him to get a full head of steam playing against B so far a quiet start for Davis kadle will rip that one for three Applause this has been one of the impressive things about North Carolina All Season Cory they dont necessarily need one guy to be the big scoring star oconnell too strong at times both Davis and Bott have been kind of quiet offensively on right down the lane he will lay it in Harrison Ingram with nine well there were two backto back very impressive plays by Elliot Kad hes showing off his shooting Touch where he is much improved two for 20 from three Ingram was the big guy with 19 rebounds but OB in that matchup neither team played well offensively but it was North Carolinas defense that really got them off to the Strong 9 and0 start in ACC play burns with a misfire in tight B with a board RJ Davis without a point so far after getting 21 in the first half against Miami but he hasnt forced the issue hes understood hes had other guys making plays specifically Harrison Ingram and he RJ Davis is about winning he understands that often times hes going to have to be a decoy he may not be the guy that gets the shot but he will get his teammates open because the attention that he draws RJ the top scorer in the conference 22 a game the 42point game against Miami we also saw him go offering 36 against waight Forest Obie I was shocked that 42 points only makes your average go up7 points per game but however he went from 215 down to 21 in the 12point effort against Virginia so I guess he wouldnt be too upset about it should be more than that though I it it absolutely should be but weve seen a lot of numbers being uh played around with here as of late well he was Sensational horn yes sweet three 10 points for DJ horn yeah and one of the things that weve seen thus far weve seen DJ horn playing well Casey Morel playing well now Jaden Taylor is able to get involved in the mix in this one we will see what Kevin ke hasnt seen all season which is all three of those guards playing well together bot on burns and diara with the rebound on the opposite side diar as a guy whos had a really interesting season he was in the starting lineup then he wasnt a nice scoop shot there by horen hes kind of getting whatever he wants right now he absolutely is but is set up by his shooting ability you have to press up on him but he has the quickness to get around his Defenders getting to the rim where there was no help waiting Davis with the kick briyan nothing there for him shot clock to 10 Kad with the drive it opened up for him and he laid it in just a smart play by Elliot Kad recognizing hes got the much bigger defender on him in the and just puts it in I would say fifth gear already starting out and just gets right to the rim Rell determined to get a shot up there diar had it knocked out Davis on the Run Davis to attack and L his first basket here in the first half Kevin Kei told us that he was sure that after watching the game against Florida State on Tuesday North Carolina would try to race it down the floor against his defense they struggle to stop the ball and they struggled to on that possession as well they got the easy layup Taylor no yes it was coming out and it rolled in hes got six we called his name we said if they can get all three of these guys going at the same time this NC State team will be extremely dangerous to defend and because of that now four of eight from Beyond The Arc its a twopoint game Davis with the save got it to Bott working inside not to be denied Armando B with eight strong move by arando B and the recognition to know that DJ Burns is not going to be able to guard him off the bounce that far away from the rim Taylor tucking that shoulder and He will draw the foul 604 in a fast moving half where its gone back and fourth DJ horn has been the man hes a 43 shooter from three but he can do that too and RJ Davis Off to the Races for North Carolina his first Applause bing two of three beyond the threepoint line he has gotten to a spot and continue to put pressure on North Carolinas defense each and every time down the four and OB this is a young man who will not slow down only six points for him in the first match up between these two he was looking for to get back here today five out of eight from the field and leading everybody to 12 six minutes left in the half horn again try to scoop on the other side of the rim another offensive rebound Taylor hell finish that with a triple and just like that second chance points thats the second time weve seen Ben Middlebrook pick up a offensive rebound and ends up with Jane Taylor knocking down the three as you mentioned 24 on Tuesday against Florida State for Jaden Taylor Ingram wants to operate with a Fall Away likes that shot and does it sweetly hes been the guy offensively for North Carolina Harrison Ingram off to a big start and theyve needed him in all those points considering RJ Davis only with two points here in this first half both teams in this rivalry game are shooting the ball well in in the first half horn giving off from Middlebrooks down to five on the shot clock horn with a Music Miss Davis TR to put it into another gear and hell draw the foul out Applause High One ESP and womens basketball triple head we have you tomorrow final games of the regular season South Carolina looking to make history and finish undefeated when they square off against Tennessee at noon and number 17 Notre Dave will be hting number 22 Louisville the afternoon capped off a rivalry game between Duke and North Carolina great match up tomorrow on the womens side South Carolina trying to complete another undefeated season question is can anybody touch them the runner off the window and the stuck by another question can anyone do anything with Harrison Ingram right now 13 points for him already in this first half but over you mentioned it earlier it doesnt have to be RJ Davis two games ago was quarterback Ryan at Virginia of course RJ with 42 and then its been Harrison Ingram here for the heels this afternoon Taylor again swishes it in from threepoint L RJ Davis has not made many mistakes throughout this season but there was one right there he closed out short on a guy who was already on a heater Brian air mailing that pass picked off morcel Davis trying to cover him morcel a tough guard at times diarra and it hung on the iron and dropped in look for all the world like that one was kicking out his first three points oh the wolf pack making themselves very comfortable here in the dean E Smith Center now taking a lead on another threepointer that used every part of the rim Washington and a whistle before the shot F against the wol pack with 337 to go and what has been an entertaining half Harrison Ingram off to a great start for the hills following it up with more points ahead right after that game Im an ACC guy we have discovered this week how certain conferences I wont say names have been manipulating the net you can absolutely change numbers thats all Im going to say Im going leave it said that yeah Scott vanel had a great discussion a great dialogue with himself really about all of that and its worth discussion here too at some point today braad Brownell put him on game yeah ran out of the pack Here Comes Applause horn the bounce for Burns Burns Into the Blue Lane and another one it catches all sorts of iron how many friendly rolls have the wolf pack gotten here in the unfriendly confines of the Dean Smith Center this is a place where theyre not very well like how these rims have L thats no lie eight nothing run here for the pack and a threepoint Advantage angram swings tremble drives it and whistle heres with eight on the shot clock 250 left in the half ABC NBA Saturday Prime Time the match up is the Nuggets squaring off against the Lakers at 830 Eastern Time coverage tips with NBA Countdown at 800 the great Roy and or the Swedish national coach however you want at I mean I love that sweater I tell you what as long as Aral you can wear it here Aral is the flavor in Chapel Hill burns with with the second foul tremble to the line career record against NC State just 385 but heres the thing OB now of course we had the rivals reunited when you talk about Coach K and Roy Williams but for Roy Williams he will tell you his rival is NC State you got to remember that Roy Williams went to the University of North Carolina he was a student here and he always not that he didnt get up for the Duke games but he was always ready to go against NC State cuz he understood what the Rivalry was in the 70s and early 80s between the Wolfpack and the Applause heels Bonnell heres Middlebrooks shot clock at five kicked it out to diara down to two now Im not sure anyone knows about and it will expire just their second turnover they dont turn it over very much anyway they do not but they did against Florida state that was one of the things that did them in on Tuesday but Kevin Keith group has done a much better job here North Carolina only two points off turnover and only two turnovers for NC State throughout this game NC State 96 turnovers a game number 15 in division one they are 12 and four when they have less than 10 in a game Bon Armando drawing some Applause contact under two to play before the break here at Chapel Hill and NC State with a twopoint lead Connell slamming on the brakes horn runs Davis right into the screen keeps on motoring and Banks it in love the patience by horn on that possession waiting for the help to evacuate the area before he goes to the basket kissing it high off the glass DJ horn 14 points this is the biggest lead fory state Applause today big got set the screen horn interfering with the play and its going to be n state to come up with the basketball his rim the one on our immediate left has been very friendly to the wol pack a number of times OB look at how much of the rim is being used on these ma shots and there have been about four to five of them already in this first half I got a feeling this opposite Rim is not going to be as friendly in the second half where all the students are NC state has made seven out of 11 from Applause three T to get off his shot switched in by oconnell I was going to say on the earlier possession okells going to have to be more of a factor on offense its got to be a threat because North Carolina hasnt even guarded him and on the second possession he comes up and knocks down the midrange 12 one run for the pack in about four minutes Davis kind of been turned off offensively poic in game hell pull and that wont fall and certainly the W pack have the momentum as of right now theyve quieted the big crowd a little bit too here at the Smith Center about a 4C difference between a game and shot clock orangen had a hot half twopointer got that and give him 16 uhoh OB he ran back down the floor rocking the baby DJ hor is on one right here with the win well see if the wack continues their run 141 run to end that first half and grabbed this eightpoint Advantage DJ horn with the basketball hes been the star the hand off for morcel morcel with a turn around sinks it but just patient getting into the paint allowing the crowd to walk away picking up someone else and leaving Casey Morel by himself to knock down the 10ft Applause jumper now the KE for Carolina might be RJ Davis who was silenced by the wol Ryan from the corner or it might be him couple of games ago he had 18 big bucket for corack Ryan to start the second half noan is going to need his shooting because they have lost the battle from the threepoint Arc significantly long one on the way thatll clang off the iron that didnt happen very often for the pack in the first half fact the rim was very friendly I believe Armando Bs got to get his opportunities in this half to be able to go at DJ Burns takes advantage of it on that possession youve got to make DJ Burns have to defend Armando to wear him down so hes not as good offensively B out with 10 and the crowd on their feet they want to be a factor in the second half Burns handing off for horn hor shot won connect battle for it there and its off the pack and back over to Carolina North Carolina with just one loss at home this season they 12 one here at the Dean Smith Center they did have a pair of stumbles like when they were number three and they lost to Syracuse in February and a whistle at 1808 to go here in the second half be interesting to see what the call is here Im not sure if that was a double foul or what Bill cumington he was right on top of it you Davis hopping mad yeah thats going to be a double foul so no free throws no Advantage either way and I like that because Bill Covington recognizing the type of rivalry this is you got to make sure you keep this game clean that was on horn and cornack Ryan as you see Ryan with the first blow delivered horn with the second one I like that call not giving either team the advantage from giving the foul to one one on the other going with the double foul and maybe settle things down right now Harrison Applause Ingram angram will a Fall Away not this time great job defensively by diaro on that possession one running Ingram off the threepoint line but then defending him in the post runs really wanted it looked it up there the tack on Fall Ingram wants to push it downstairs for Bott on the spin and it wont fall he missed the slam thats an NC State Rim theres no question about it that Rim has been in favor of the wolf pack all afternoon long Tiara from the corner one and done Davis had just two points in the first half coming off 42 points on Applause Monday Kido with the bounce beautifully done there Elliot K just so under control when he gets into the painted area the easy dump off to Harrison Ingram who gets the twoot layup Burns at the foul line shooting over botau Ingram wants the triple the those stepping in and the foul will go against morcel and temper is flaring a bit again OB I told you these two programs do not like each other it doesnt take but a small spark to start a fire between these two teams and this matchup goes way way back now Casey Morell reaching in but Ill be completely honest that was not Morel who incited that that was Elliot Kel because Casey Morel got his hand caught in the cookie jar and while his hand is caught in the cookie jar Elliot cadoo tries to take his hand out of the cookie jar M did get his second foul K got say yeah Morel got the foul but its going to be interesting to see what the officials come back with yep there at the monitor because if we look at the replay well Applause see yeah Bill cumington Clarence Armstrong Jeffrey Applause Clark well see what they come up with anything extra the Tobacco Road rival reach between morcel and Kad and bill cumington came over and explained after they took a look on the monitor there will be nothing more than the common foul there will be nothing more than the common foul it escalated it however when you get a chance to look at the Tobacco Road rivalry you think about Duke NC State North Carolina combined 13 national championships as we see Kad attacking the basket 50 combined ACC tournament titles between the three schools and of course the 4711 combined wins between the three Schools theyre the rivalries between these three schools Run Deep NC State here in Chapel Hill today their next game Monday night will be at home against the Duke Blue Devils its a strong possibility where ke and his team can find themselves into the NCAA tournament field if they can come away with two wins today and Monday going to be tough these rivalries definitely run beat but they did it last year they did it last year they beat North Carolina they beat Duke incidentally second half is started North Carolina grabbing a momentum a 9 to run and nine nothing in the last 3 minutes and 14 seconds DJ Burns has picked up foul Number Three Horn going in strong and takes a hit and the 62 grad is off to the foul line where he makes Applause 84 so well see how big that is for the big fella the 69 grat on of Rockdale South Carolina three fouls but I will say this OB Kevin Keats has the luxury of having Ben Middlebrook who transferred over from Clemson who has experience in the ACC and can come in and the production does not drop off hes not the offensive threat however and I got to got to be quiet right now because they got cookies on the line with a possible Miss free throw if he misses this one no cookies yet those by the way NC States first foul shots and a twopoint game we had 12 lead changes in the first half Koo with a blow by Scoops it in and to the foul switching hands there perfectly and a spectacular basket hell be at the line but I love the way Elliot gadoo has responded from the little scuffle that they had going into timeout the second time hes attacked the basket this time he gets the hoop and the harm opportunity to get to the line not only for the free throw but to make to regain the lead for the tar Tor with the personal an acrobatic shot tapped out and eras for that horn gets to everybody first swatted away diara tried for the bank and a Applause whistle back Ryan making the hustle play you see the tap out by Harrison Ingram but DJ horn wins the race quarterback Ryan wins the battle getting back blocking the shot however V running the floor picks up the foul against Alando Bott his second Mohamad diaro with another one on the way just 61 there and theyre up again looking for cookies he has him right on the edge doesnt he well now we bring up cookies you know they didnt have the same cookies here from uh when were we here Monday yes and I was actually missing those cookies pregame it were delicious heres Davis got it RJ on the money from threepoint land thats his spot OB weve seen him knock that down not only for his career high 36 against Wake Forest but also to get a career high 42 on Monday night he loves that spot Taylor trying to wiggle free and he takes a hit Jaden Taylor takes the foul take a look RJ Davis really faking the screen pushes Casey Morel into the screen the pump fake the side step dribble with to knock down the three ball but RJ Davis checking to make sure hes got all 32 up top simply because he took a shot to the chops where he got the foul against Taylor on the last play Davis made seven triples on Monday against Applause Miami making sure their jaws in working order so Taylor for the tie trying to make it 51 all here Chapel Applause Hill 14 points for Jaden Taylor whos been coming off the bench to transfer after two years at bu he has become a big factor for Kevin Pats got to get in the post on this one nice spin going in strong but denied picked up by horn he wants to ROM and right now horn has a mismatch nor Keana is zoning up to watch it trying to give Withers help a stumble by Taylor went down to his knees Davis diving in there trying to break it up it comes free to North Carolina hram to tremble Davis will he on the second half the pass underneath and thats going to be finished up by Withers great cut by Z Withers to find himself in scoring position and RJ Davis keeping his eyes up finding an open teammate right under the basket to regain the lead for the T here RJ with four assists horn got to force that shot fight for the rebound it comes to Morel cant Bank it in he wins it back again it spins out the tip wont drop and out it goes wol pack will retain remember our conversation about how friendly this Rim was going to be in the second half it has not been friendly at all to the wolfback two point blank opportunities as Taylor goes down but look at the bodies on the floor thats the ACC player of the year on the floor after a loose ball tells you about this r no foul in there NC State open for their last nine Morel trying to end that pant its going to be tipped out and again the Wolfpack will have it 5351 from IC here in the second half to put it mildly but I can tell you right now both these teams are battling OB you watch a game like this and you mean to tell me that only five teams out of this league should be in the in the NCAA tournament come on you got to be certainly not going to make that if you take NC State and you put them in a different conference this team is in the top five of the other conference Mell in heavy traffic he takes a hit KY Morel the 63 graad former Virginia Cavalier fouled by Jaylen Washington is Music first North Carolina number one rebounding team in the conference number one in offensive rebounding as well but NC State is beating them at their game to this point they have been attacking the offensive glass with Reckless abandon and again whenever you going to go up against a team thats a great offensive rebounding team the best way to do it is give them a taste of their own medicine and thats what the will pack have done here Kevin ke talked to us pregame about how they were going to go about attacking this and this game has gone according to plan for Coach Keats and the staff and I got to give Kevin Keats a lot of credit for the way he has coached his team throughout this year to be nine and8 in this league that is significant he deserves a lot of credit for the way hes brought this team along with the transfers and also the young players the standings in the ACC North Carolina 143 a game up on Duke where the giant meeting still remaining between those two Rivals and Virginia Clemson Wake cuse pit every time I look at Pittsburgh I think the ey test tells me theyre an NCAA tournament team well I believe they are NCAA tournament team and I think that they would be if it werent for the narrative that says that the ACC is down oconnell Davis staying home defensively with the deny Ingram back for Davis here it comes around and outs and Bill cumington will call a foul here against North Carolina now Ingrams got to be careful on that one throwing the basketball off after not getting the call going his way Bill Covington showing his patience with that one but thats one where it should be a delay now foul will be on Jen Washington number two Pats is going to get the big guy diara back on the floor here in a moment under 13 off the fake Parker gave it up 1252 to go and a rare turnover here for NC State but great job by Harrison Ingram being right on the spot SP as Dennis Parker spins he spins right into Harrison Ingram who has great hands coming up with that steel regaining possession for the T here Morel with his third along with seven points four turnovers so far for the wol pack that is how they stay in most games with very low turnover totals that theyve shot the ball a lot better in this game in particular that first half they were sizzling Kevin ke told us about hour or so before the game I like the way my teams plan offensively right now he really does and that theyre doing this right now with Ben Middlebrook whos the better defender on the floor but offensively DJ Burns is the guy Trimble and a foul here against the pack itll be interesting to see how long Kevin ke goes without DJ Burns and keeps middle Brooks on the hes a lot of trust in both these big men however as North Carolina starts the stor back and now theyve taken this lead we may see DJ Burns back in the lineup soon because NC State needs his offensive production as much as anything they need his passing and his ability to draw the double I mean he seeks that double but the one the difference when youre playing against North Carolina Hubert Davis trusts Armando B so theyre going to guard him straight up this the one of the very few teams that are not going to double team as we see DJ Burns checking in now coming back into the game and a great decision by Kevin ke knowing with the immedia timeout coming but more importantly youre doing it on a offensive possession middle Brooks heading to the bench and Trimble cant hit on that one off the back iron now Obie heres the thing you dont bring Burns Off the Bench to pass it around the perimeter the big fell has to get his hands on the basketball on this possession bodyto body on bot rolling air Mill that one North Carolina ahead Applause 5452 Kido penetrating left it short bacock got his hand on it and swatted it out and even though DJ Burns was unable to get a bucket on the with ob Im going right back to him on this possession because you have to make Armando Bott defend on this end of the qu to try to wear him down to keep that energy off the glass look at MC state in the second half 8 from the field I dont care who you are youre not winning a game shooting that poorly in the second half loose ball Carolina with it andc State tried to save couldnt do Applause it bod well away from the basket but they trying to get the mismatch Harrison Ingram with horn guarding him down low Ingram got free and a whistle and Harrison Ingram fouled by Burns and thatll be his Music fourth so number four on DJ Burns big development here North Carolina leading by a couple some greates everywhere you look absolutely George Lynch checking out and of course Antoine Jameson and you know whats so crazy OB when you look at the numbers Antoine Jameson did all his damage in three years and thats the thing its so many different criteria for these North Carolina Legends of course Phil Ford arguably the best point guard to ever play in ACC one of the best of all to in college basketball but then you consider Antoine Jameson who he had beened car went back to back in the NBA draft Antoine Jameson was the college star between those two guys he was the the franchise player here in North Carolina part of the reason why his jersey hangs in the ra 5652 North Carolina oconnell drives No finish Middlebrooks came away with a go and a second effort horn will fire it up horn got it back another offensive rebound Taylor off the back iron and Taylor Made all of those threes off offensive rebounds in the first half unable to get that one to go NC State over for their last 15 Bon and hit it and a foul as well Middlebrooks so Armando headed to the line but thats the difference between when youre playing against Ben Middlebrooks and youre playing against DJ Burns weve seen Burns be physical with amond Bott Ben Middlebrooks although hes experienced does not have the strength to defend Armando Bott that low Bott with the bucket an opportunity to stretch this lead out to seven for the heels and its been a major comeback for the Tar Heels to start this second half and this was DJ burns on the bench for the wol pack settled with four fouls and a 217 run North Carolina adding to that and on top 5952 and now the tahos 13 of 16 from the line taking care of business at the free throw line where they Le the ACC with 18 made free throws a game struggled against Miami from the line especially late in the game wack needs DJ horn who had a big first half and we draw the Applause foul third coming up here in the ESPN its Virginia and number 10 Duke thatll be followed by number four Tennessee and number 14 Alabama in the prime time matchup at 800 tonight thorm Ryan just collected his third and itll be horned to the Music line hes shooting a one and one of course whenever you think about the matchups here on Tobacco Road this weekend alone youve got these two Rivals going at it and then a buddy rivalry in Virginia and Duke and always think about the matchup coming up next Saturday and we had opportunity to watch the rivals Revisited West Durham doing a great job sitting down with both coach Kay and Roy Williams for a riveting hour interview in front of a a live studio audience that was probably the best part about it in my opinion OB enjoyed that Applause tremendously Kido try to split the defense and takes a hit just over 10 minutes to play and North Carolina leading 5953 they were down eight at halftime middle Brooks with number three and North Carolina with a oneonone Applause Music Cano 10 points 64 at the free throw Applause line OB Roy Williams of course a main State we know where to find him in this building but I got to ask coach are you going to be in Durham next Saturday for that match up because Roy has made it to a number of away away games this year we saw him in Miami weve seen him in Pittsburgh weve seen him in different spots sure for when the tar Hills are playing wonder if hes going to go over and uh be in the crowd at dur next Music Applause week 13 for kadoo North Carolina breathing a little easier here all of a sudden NC State missing 15 straight shots has had much to do with it horn just gave it up but this is the North Carolina defense that weve watched during the 10 game winning streak that took place from December 20th to January 28th for the tar Hills where they were Elite defensively holding ACC teams to under 60 points especially on the road on a nightly basis we got another mixup Ryan went down hard there as he got tangled up he is on his feet but in some pain and grabbing at his midsection on that one and again this is just basketball Im hoping they wont waste the time going over to look at this as you see horn and corac Ryan getting mixed up its just a basketball two guys going at it horn trying not to allow corack Ryan to have his spot but I love the fact that theyre not even bothering the w their time going over the officials had a great eye on this the entire time DJ horns third so Ryan trying to shake that off the sixthe man 87 fou shooter and no flop there by cor M Bryant and only reason I bring that up is cuz I got to give it to my guy Bill Covington who flopped at Boston College earlier this week OB the official it did go down my godov immediately goes down Orlando B draw stands up calling out a play on the sideline for Virginia Cub gets tapped on the 10 he goes down like he got hit with a cyer brick I could not wait to see Cub when he walked into the arena today OB to make sure he know I saw him fly North Carolina of 19 for 22 at the foul line on the day and that lead is bolstered to 10 about 10 minutes in between making shots try to snap an over for 15 and a shove and an offensive on Casey morcel number four but give Elliot cadoo a lot of credit for sliding his feet and getting into legal guarding position Casey morcel as you see the right arm extends that is a offense however if youre old school ACC you know its going to be physical when you got the tar Hills and the Wolfpack mixing it up the Rivalry has been renewed here once again Kevin Keat team 58 from the field two turnovers in the first half to 6 that almost seems impossible OB five turnovers they missed their last 15 field goal attempts here in the second half one for 16 since halftime K penetrates left it short Ingram springing in for the rebound but thats what Ingram did in the first match up 19 rebounds for him six of those on the offensive glass its Ingram open for three 20 points for him today NC state does not like seeing number 55 for North Carolina they dont OB Im get in and get my workout in this morning of course so I could always eat cookies whos in there Tyrus Ingram getting the workout in pregame Taylor with a good answer with the triple Harrison Ingrams dad beat me to the workout room OB he was in full sweat beforehand and Im sure as you mentioned his son was getting up shots at 10 am already so the work ethic comes from Dad and it is paid off here for here Harrison was working hard early on and that one kicked out itll stay on this end with 831 to go in North Carolina H by 10 they were down eight at the break the they have buckled down defensively on the wolf pack one of NC States top guys DJ Burns and the passing game that he brings is saddled with four fouls he is on the bench and when Kevin ke brought DJ Burns in it was really for about a 30 second stretch that he wanted to try to get to the next media timeout unfortunately DJ Burns got that foul which took us to the media timeout and now has had to watch Davis got it knocking back a three North Carolina number one in the ACC with a onegame lead over Duke with three to play including today marel trying to bring the pack back a line driver for two much needed bucket Casey morcel getting to the midrange is knocking down the jump shot and this NC State teams not going to go away now that theyve got the seal off the basket they know that the basketball will go through that Rim that should give them a little bit of confidence here in the second half Davis catches fires and a foul in the act of hitting that three trying to hit it 6958 Morel with foul number five Davis always ready always willing and oh so Music dangerous 10 and a half play Beakmans just had not only a great passing season spectacular defensive year and of course the most rookie of the week award go to Caron bub Carrington who has four however Im not sure that he will be the Rookie of the Year theres a young man out know today by the name of Marcus Burton who probably gets my vote as we look at Bracketology with Jo lardy in the ACC Bracketology which I dont agree with about half of this however I may be a little biased and I do understand that our guy Joey brackets is going by the numbers and I completely respect that however when you look at these teams and you and I believe the committee will look at this and youll say wait for us Pittsburgh even Syracuse if you take them and you put them in the Mountain West Conference these are top three teams M the depth of the AC is the reason why theyre in the middle of the pack of this league and I believe the committee MERS members will take that into consideration when theyre making these decisions on selection you realize Cory that if if in fact as we mentioned weell now at five if in fact the ACC lands only five bids thatll be the third straight year thats only 15 NCAA tournament bids in three years and you know what that would also mean that well continue to send teams to the final four like we have the last two years three teams in the last two years two seasons ago both North Carolina and Duke and then Miami last year coming up on 7 minutes to go North Carolina 71 NC State 58 a dramatic turnaround here in the second half in atar heels favor Ingram has led the charge with 20 points blocked by Applause diara plenty of time left though for the pack if they can find the shooting eye they had in the first 20 minutes Taylor reversing field Scoops it in tell you what he has been Dynamite Off the Bench now 19 points for Taylor with Casey morcel out of the game theyre going to need not only him on the offensive end but defensively because Casey Morel was the guy taking the challenge of guarding RJ Davis the pack with two starters right in the bench right now for different reasons Ingram is the open man and a rebound picked Off by Taylor the sit for Jun he wants to drive it and hell draw a foul by Ingram who stopped the clock with 6 minutes 16 seconds left and with his first personal so the pack heading to the line trailing by 11 they went stone cold for the longest stretch one point they miss 15 in a Applause row Taylor will drop in number one with the ACC tournament just a week and a half away our last regular season Tuesday double header is coming up especially big 700 number nine North Carolina and Notre Dame and then Georgia Tech squaring off against W Forest on the ACC Network and the ESPN now Ill be back at my home away from home OB be sitting right in this chair in the Deanie Smith Center for the noted aim game with my guy West Durham and of course Jimmy bracket AKA Jim Bayan your other guy my other guy on R Middlebrooks colliding there with Davis 551 to go North Carolina ball cuse had a wonderful ceremony on Jim beheim had the Dome to honor the legendary head coach and I know youve had a ball working with him absolutely have and again he you know the craziest part is that you have to make him go to stuff like that he doesnt want to be there you know to to receive his flowers he wants to just watch basketball little bump there and its going to be a travel before that on Elliot kadoo hasnt done much wrong in this one no he has not only the second turnover for Kad to go along with the seven assists so he has been special Distributing the basketball 13 points for cadoo also as he continues to grow thats the area where at this point in the season now you dont really look at him as a freshman point guard hes just the point guard of this team now because hes grown into that role DJ horn hes been silenced in the second half by the Carolina D can he get going again boy thats a tough drive heavy traffic for two give him 20 16 came in the first Applause half now this is the time of the game OB we watched we watched North Carolina on Monday with a 13point lead struggle to finish out the game against Miami Hubert Davis told us its better to learn those lessons and a win than to lose those games well see if North Carolina can finish this game the right way now with this double digit lead there way down but that clangs away hamerson Ingram leading the away 22 for North Carolina R will get it downstairs to bacock poked away that was di from behind yeah great job by di using his hands on that possession because he is out manned on the block by Bott who probably out weighs him by 30 lbs and thatll go the other way and keeps his up and arm still coming to call the foul against the wol pack and Ben Middlebrooks and hes in deep trouble four the foul situation has become but serious here for the P but what I like OB is you see Amando Bott having a conversation with Elliot CAD then Harrison Ingram goes over and says something to Elliot cadell because CAD has been complaining to the officials about the calls and so the veterans are going to their young point guard hey leave them alone keep playing doing what you do best dont allow that to distract you from our overall goal and a timeout for North Carolina K by the way with seven assists in this one Harrison Ingram has had himself an afternoon knocks down the seconds to play he hit a couple of big foul shots tar Hills tied the game when Walter Davis took a half court pass from Mitch cuup it banked in as time expired tar Hills went on to win in overtime classic game OB that was a year uh maybe I was 9 months old at that time in 74 but I do know that even though that was a great game neither of those were the best team the best team in 74 is also celebrating a 50th anniversary of a national championship that would be the second greatest ACC player of all time maybe the greatest and won David Thompson and the NC State W Applause back oconnell out High well NC State needs some of that magic right now down by 10 horn trying to penetrate hell heave it up there and an airball but those shots were going down in the first half for horn unable to get much going here only four points for him in the second half of this game give North Carolina a lot of credit for what theyve done defensively Bon rolling spinning no on the outlet heres okell for three he hits it big bucket now its a sevenpoint game and a timeout this is going to be a 32 timeout 736 Miami when they were up 13 and Miami had a chance down the stretch to win that game they absolutely did OB and I asked you re David this morning how long did it take him to get over that finish Monday and he looked the swirly eyes said Im still not over simply because he did not like the way his team finished the game the Miss free throws the turnovers giving up the basketball against pressure and he knows that NC States going to come in and pressure them if they are down at this stage of the game but its something that the tar Hills have worked on all week to this point North Carolinas biggest lead today has been Applause 13 up top for Kad the kick for Ingram rebound comes out high but a whistle 249 to Music Applause play and will March to the other end on the foul against Carolina and corack Ryan number Music four and itll be oconnell shooting a and one he is one of the better free throw shooters for The Wack 83 and thats going to be the four foul on corm Ryan and you go back to the first half when DJ H was able to get off of those 16 points a lot of that had to do with the fact that Kack Ryan was on the bench in foul trouble and so now Ryan with those four fouls as NC State makes this a sixpoint game opportunity for oconnell to be able to get it done we talked about how horn has struggled in his second half OB give cor back line a lot of credit for that struggle lonnell makes the pair fivepoint Applause game Harrison Ingram finds Davis Davis takes the foul and a 90 foul shooter hit by Taylor number two so take a look back on Monday night against Miami now they win the game but they looked very comfortable with about four minutes left very similar to this one Miami went on a 132 run cut it to two in fact had the ball North Carolina missed four of their last seven foul shots but did hang on to win and they were saved by two offensive rebounds off of those Miss free throws down the stretch Miami could not get the basketball back because they could not secure the defensive rebound and Hubert Davis talked about it when they watched film he showed his team those but he also said hey guys we won a national championship in 2017 by getting two of those plays so thats a positive as well horn flips it up left it short bacock grabbing a rebound they CAU seven rebounds in this one game in averaging 10 and a half number one in the Applause ACC Davis with a shot clock to eight Davis around the back fires got it it hasnt been a big time scoring game for RJ Davis however 12 second half points has helped him to comp the team to a ninepoint lead Mill Brooks trying to find a guard Taylor and Taylor shoved by Ryan thats number five on cormack Ryan so 65 grad is done with a minute 32 to go he has fouled out and this is RJ Davis time getting into his back going behind the back no push off on that possession getting to the midrange knocking down the field goal and RJ Davis who of course is Public Enemy Number One on every team Scouting Report just able to go out and make an individual play for a big bucket for the tar Hills he made a lot of those this season but you look at the free throw destru in this game and thats North Carolina basketball they win that battle they get more attempts and more takes and anyone in ACC from the free throw line but a lot of it has to do with the way they attack the paint and the W pack for a turnover well theyre going to right here Davis is stepping on the line and if theres one place on the floor OB that you never want to go to this is it because you basically have four Defenders when you cross youve got the sideline youve got one two defenders in the Trap but youve also got that half court line ends up being the eth turn over for the Targer who will answer now for the pack its Taylor leaning in left it well short he was demanding a foul no whistle on a play sevenpoint lead coming up on one minute to go and Davis will slow it down for the tar Hills under a minute now T to shoot RJ Davis Davis on the drive bounces no rebound tipped and mishandled by the wol pack it will be North Carolina ball with 44 seconds to play and thats the best case scenario for for North Carolina the worst case scenario for NC State because you guarded for pretty much the entire 30 seconds of the shot clock and you force RJ Davidson to a tough shot which he misses but you cant come up with the defensive board they come out on Davis hell swing it to Bott Bott denied by middle Brooks great play defensively by middle Brooks got to get a shot in the air the scoop is up and in by Kad whos really been an unsung hero today he has now 15 points for Kad we talked about the assist of turnover ratio and that could be the dagger ell air mails it and that will lock it up here as North Carolina hangs on in the end and they will knock off their Rivals NC State 7970 the score North Carolina continues to roll they are now 23 and six and 15 and3 in the ACC North Carolina continues to take care of business t
