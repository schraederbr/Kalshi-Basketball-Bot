but they have dropped five out of their last seven Duke continues to play awfully well they pummeled Virginia Saturday 73 48 they held Virginia without a field goal for over 9 Minutes in that first half against the Cavaliers and we are underway as the Wolfpack wins the opening tip and Duke still missing the Freshman guard Caleb Foster out with an injury but played exceedingly well without him over the weekend Burns getting his first touch getting in close for the hook and thatll drop in Jays only scored six points the last two games well NC State wanted to go to DJ Burns early one to get him going but also to see if they could hang a foul or two on Kyle filipowski try to take his legs away for the second half but this is where its going to be more difficult for DJ Burns theyre going to try to put him in ball screens and drive him Mark Mitchell getting down deep in the paint thats in and out rebound popping free to oconnell he stayed really good about taking care of the basketball only about 10 turnovers per game heres Burns Out high they want to ultimately get burs out on the low post ping in against Bowski laid it up cant hit the shot but draws the whistle theres that foul you were talking about yeah thats exactly what they want to do go right at Kyle filipowski put Duke in a position where they may have to double you know Burns not a bad passer out of a double team but if you go when hes already in the lane its going to be too late but on the other end you know they want to drive him they want to run him put him in ball screens make him move you know hes an immovable object on the offensive end but they want to move him around on the defensive end a couple of games ago Florida state held him without a point and he had just six against North Carolina he played in deep foul trouble for most of the second half yeah foul trouble for DJ Burns means that NC state has to go with the guard oriented lineup that that would certainly hurt them in this game because Duke has size and they can rebound ACC tournament beginning on Tuesday March 12 in Washington DC right now DJ burns on Mark Mitchell hes just hanging out in the middle of the lane but Mitchell a much better shooter than he was early in the season tyes Brer heres the long one from McCain and thats in and out rebound tapped by Burns and out of play so itll be Duke Blue Devil basketball here one of the difficulties if Burns is going to play in the middle of the lane and really play off Mark Mitchell Mitchell can get a run up hes really difficult for burns to block out Kan another one its not too strong we have seen him get rolling like the 35 he had on the road in Florida State where he hit eight threes in that game Rell negotiating the Baseline Burns again body to body in tight no tipped out he stay on this ENT try to keep burns out of the middle hes going to spin off his footwork is excellent you see Kevin Keats three and one here at PNC Arena against Duke John shy the win over Virginia his 50th hes the fastest Duke Coach ever to get to 50 wins and this is a fast strike here as Marcel will score it to make it five to nothing really going after the middle of the floor and when youre guarding the inbounds man youve got to keep the ball out of the middle make it go to the short side of the floor proor on the move and that one spits free up ahead horn racing the floor hell lay it in and Duke wants a timeout seven to nothing NC Applause State now back at PNC Arena this is exactly the tempo that the wol pack wants yeah Jared McCain just doesnt do a good job of angling his body to keep Casey morcel just from cutting straight to the basket watch this pass by Michael oconnell what just an excellent full court pass to DJ horn for the quick strike after that long rebound NC State off to a great start which you you saw in Chapel Hill on Saturday they go off to a really good start in the first half against North Carolina but it was the second half where they just couldnt sustain it they missed 15 consecutive shots in the second half and they did not bear much of hor resentence that first half team still only lost that game by nine and they were in it with about two and a half to go Kapowski com off 21 on Saturday the shots arent falling right away for Duke obviously not a bad job by DJ Burns forcing the tough two Duke missing their first four to begin this one Burns gets a clean look and itll drop in isnt it amazing a guy that big has such a great shooting touch and also fantastic feet hes like a dancing bear in the post dror airb tough shot gets it to go Proctor was out for a little bit with that concussion but over his last six games 24 assists just seven turnovers and he was really good against Virginia with those 15 points and five assists here comes up back down back out from morcel straight on those are more of the shots that Casey morcel got last year sort of the catch and shoot variety and they had Jord wav smithi short with a triple makes 35 Beyond The Arc more who averages 19 a game in ACC play bounces for burn everything going through the big fellet gets his own Miss cant hit that the tip wont fall and its batted around the W pack will retain just ran a little double drag up top and Tyrese Proctor had to switch off on burns that could not have been Pleasant talking speed demons and how the Wolfpack want to play it tonight when we come back to PNC I bought three of the same in the Wolfpack are three and0 in this Arena against Duke when they come in as a ranked opponent and if they want to keep that stat going coach Kei said it starts with the unrelenting amount of pressure that they have to apply on the defensive end in those prior three games they forced to combine 50 three turnovers DJ horn told me we know this is basketball but we want to make it more of a track meet get stops on one in and transition points on the other end weve already seen that on display this is a team thats second in the ACC in Fast Break points already guys and Angel its a unique challenge to play against Duke because they have a number of Shooters on the floor but they can also drive it so you have to take away the shot and the drive thats a chall Ryan young now in the game for the Duke Blue devs and a turn over nearly its going to be Duke ball they got the block but could not pick up the basketball 1545 to go here in the first half Jaden Taylor into the ball game now for NC State he has been so good over his last five games since hes been coming off the bench thats going to be a foul on the wolf pack hor trying to guard roach there deep in the corner and hell pick up the personal I know everybody seems to know this you dont want to foul jump Shooters but especially when you forced a challenged jumper and Jeremy roach even falling away a little bit make him make it without fouling him where he gets to go to the free throw line and watch the ball go through the net potentially three times well that was in the active shooting at three so hes got three shots here and he is an 87 foul shooter coming up tonight 900 Eastern a huge big 12 match up coming way number 11 Baylor hosting Texas in wake up Texas going to have to deal with jacobe Walter who is now hes a freshman but hes playing his best basketball right now got off to a slow start but the guy thats really killing it is Eve Mei their freshman big guy uh hes been spectacular of late and was really good against Kansas roach with his third shot and makes two out of three NC stayed by five and the ball DJ horn 43 Beyond a threepoint line you really got to watch that he had 20 points against Carolina on Saturday but only four in the second half he St can run some different things with Ben Middlebrooks in there cuz he can hes mobile so he can run outside of ball screen Taylor Applause denied oh went for the boun speed and that was spoiled by the arrows he get down on the deck and a tie up possession arrow keeps it on this end of the floor itll be Duke ball really good job by Mohamed Gara putting that right hand in the passing Lane so you give a little pocket pass which is just a short bounce pass usually big guys have their arms up he had it down in the passing Lane that caused that near turnover big Junior from France nice pass young couple of fakes and he bounces it off the window they talk about footwork when ran Young comes into the game you know hes going to fake and hes going to Pivot but still he gets you hes just so crafty in the lane Taylor 22 Saturday at 24 the game before that against Florida State hes really been their guy coming off that bench shot clock down to seven Taylor gets a look at it lost it got it back horn off the fake heres a triple he fought for the rebound it comes to two proor again to push it heres roach well that was kind of ugly Mitchell fought for it fights again great effort there for the basket Mark Mitchell the Lefty a lead St and field goal percentage and offensive rebounds but he has done a great job the second half of this season and now hes knocking down open shots and ACC play he 4 7 for three doesnt shoot many of them but now hes making them early he wasnt pucked Away by Young he hits the deck look at this effort was off his hand and out of play but a tremendous effort there onepoint game big fight here for Duke just a great job by diar to get in there and disrupt that with that hand low and then look at terrific footwork and fakes to get Ben Middlebrooks off balance and off the floor to get that what looked like an easy score CU he did really hard things Applause well so foring his way inside and a shot clock violation did not get it up to the 10 so Duke with an eight nothing run after NC State started the game nine nothing that shot clock violation was caused largely because of Ryan Youngs hustle going after that ball NC State youre not going to get a reset they got to go full court proor lips got it and Duke comes all the way back and then some to grab an 11 to9 lead Tyrese brocker thats his 443 of the season and John CH will tell you that he may be Dukes best shooter he hasnt projected as that because hes been in and out of the lineup with different injuries Taylor tripped up by roach on that effort DJ Burns jumping out looked like there was a near switch and thats not something NC State wants to have burns on trctor but they gave him enough room he could just gauge that and pull up you dont want to give him horse shots out there really you want to make D put the ball in the deck without catching shoot opportunities but at the same time challenge him off those drives thats tough to do to Leading the ACC and shooting percentage also threepoint shooting percentage and they have been the number one passing team in the league as well coming into play tonight Burns Another Touch heres oconnell yes nothing but net from threepoint La Jeremy roach got caught in no mans land he was halfway between Burns and oconnell if youre going to double you got to double otherwise you got to be able to close out P again just a couple of shots he would typically hit it comes free and blocked by diara he slammed it away for Mitchell now are first down the floor on the other end Taylor wants to hustle that shot wont drop Duke got all over it and a whistle with 1229 to go as it rolled out itll be Duke ball what a block by Mohamad diar with that left hand NC State couldnt get it to go on the other end but diar has done a great job on the glass especially in AC play his last six games hes averaging 10 points nine rebounds one and a half blocks in an ACC play hes averaging over eight rebounds a game had a monster game against Boston College at 18 rebounds in that game that gets your average up indeed he stayed by one and pressing a little bit now they pull it back one of the reasons your press up they were trying to force a turnover just slow the advance now they only have to guard for about 18 seconds once Duke gets into something 69ine freshman Shan Stewart now in a game John Shire talk about passing ability now watch Jeremy roach here hes in between those two but he doesnt go to double he just stunts but he stunts a little bit too far stunt is like faking at the ball you give a little fake like youre going to trap but you got to recover thats just too long to to go and Duke takes a timeout so as not to turn it over here and give it back NC State on top 12 11 12 13 to go here in the first half at PNC Arena of college basketball is brought to you by Progressive Insurance bundle home and auto and save visit progressivecom Music state has actually won six out of the last nine against Duke here at PNC Arena so this been a a tough house for the Blue Devils coming into play tonight give a look at the ACC top 10 North Carol Carolina and Duke separated by one Virginia Syracuse Syracuse by the way up to 20 wins now and if you saw him in Maui think that was a bit of a surprise a lot of contact on that law but well broken up by Casey Morel okell off the window on the other side Parker Jr will draw the foul Dennis Parker Jr did a really good job switching off on Kyle filipowski on the defensive end when he came in then an offensive rebound now going to the free throw line good minutes to start this game and that is number two on filipowski who had himself a ball against Virginia on Saturday 21 points had a big Slam in that one totally enjoyed Music himself we go back to the start of the game when NC State rent right at filipowski with DJ Burns that was why you hang one foul on him you know youre going to pick up a foul in the first half just on you know random plays but you target a guy and go after him he picks up one I mean now you cant play better defense than to have him on the bench Parker missed the pair trying to retake the lead here under 12 minutes to go first half young now in the ball game by the way around to back CER trying to pull his way through kicks it out for young he tried for the quick pass around the horn it goes power in the game around and out for TJ power where does Duke go for offense right now weve got Ryan young TJ power in the ball game pow a threepoint shooter out of nowhere up high Steward with the rejection what an elite athlete he is marker its going to be a Applause travel Duke impressive D there thats three turnovers now for the wack just a tremendous block by Sha Stewart who is just getting better and better early on still had that Elite athleticism but just wasnt sure what is going on out there hes much more sure of himself right now in the right spots and trusted when he goes on the floor he let Duke with eight rebounds on Saturday second straight game with eight rebounds young off the double and close as power cant finish and wins it back looking for help roach shot clock down to 10 Young up to set the screen he will step forward and drop in two what a nice play by Jeremy roach he just called for the ball screen to get DJ burns out on the floor and took advantage of it really well done sealed hell turn her and fire anyway its off Target talk about a tough too having to take that turnaround Jumper in traffic Proctor again cant nail it young went fighting for the rebound the officials going to keep it on this end right now Jeremy roach is going to try to put DJ Burns in as many ball screens as he can and you got Casey morcel off balance just takes that little extra step to get by thats a legal play in basketball and Jeremy roach going to take a little break but hes such a key element in this Duke team his leadership above all but hes just had a great senior season only 35 turnovers all season long for roach hes been so steady K denied by Marcel crowd wanting to travel thats just great defense by Marcel to stay in front young rolling basket the bou speed is a foul as Stewart gets it going for the slam and hell be to the line to shoot two that guys got another step on his ladder that most players cant contemplate and thats why you want to put DJ Burns in as many ball screens as you can because its the recovery now now of a sudden you have to help on that roll and there was a throwback and then Ryan young could just drive it and now ones got a guard two and hes a good passer Stewart has scuffled at the line he had been 11 for 21 before that make but hes got another one coming dad Mike played eight years in the NBA look good on that too John Stewart over his last two games 15 points 17 rebounds six of them offensive and six of nine from the field those are good minutes off the bench getting a chance to play burns with a catch a tipto into that paint thats tough to stop especially with the foot you know hes so big you try to keep him out of the middle he can drop step he always wants to get to that left hand that is a difficult guy to guard with his size and feet seven points still going up high snags another rebound finds power and he Nails it the threepointer for the corner thats what TJ power can do coming into this game 12 of his 13 field goals made have been threes now its 13 to 14 if my math is correct d and I believe it is Sir under nine in the first half Burns again switches it in he has nine points thats three more than he had in the previous two games combined Hes listed in the media guide as 275 but I think thats his left leg only proor gives off to Stewart with a leaner and knocks it down dke can get this kind of production from Sha Stewart that gives them a lot more options coming off the bench and makes them more powerful youre not taking any sort of dip when you sub again this is with filipowski sent with a couple of fouls oh look at that g downstairs to diar for the easy SL L J Burns hes fun to watch man he is fun to watch thats a long way to go to double and burns saw it then diara put himself right under the rim Burns is a big who really invites that double might have to Triple him hes so big its 15 bucks in an Uber to get around in front of him shot clock down to seven proor to the Baseline another nice pass oh St could finish Tapped Out High reset of the clock power again round and out Duke comes back with another couple points McCain on the Baseline NC State cannot keep Duke off the offensive glass its been sha Stewart Ryan young has done a good job 10 offensive rebounds in the game already for du so the first shot defense for NC States been excellent but theyre giving up these easy Second Chance opportunities Burns just wants it every time down not this time though and it will be Duke ball TJ horn the 62 guard out of nearby carry North Carolina and DJ burns out of Rock Hill South Carolina being honored here their families on hand as well its always really cool to watch there motion on the flooor yeah you never know these days this is Casey morels second senior day he came back for another year so he got to do senior thats why he wasnt holding the Jersey he got one last year and I think they told him were not giving you two he should have gotten a home and a away fifth year Music man and horns had a terrific season here for NC State trying to Spring a big victory over the Duke Blue Devils number n team of the country here D shooting 32 but theyre getting very good bench play theyre outscoring the Wolfpack bench nine to nothing back and they get a long one on the way but that one dropped from McCain another offensive rebound this is the story of the first half Duke is crashing the offensive glass thats 12 of them now Horns been pretty quiet try to bounce that one from M Brooks a loose ball and a whistle theyll get Ryan Young on the foul thats a tough pass to just give a little pocket pass to Ben Middlebrooks and have him catch it be able to make a play in the middle of the floor thats his first foul then middle Brooks transferred in from Clemson and his uncle is Danny canel did you know that I did not know that so I was asking Ben today like where would you rank your uncle Dannys basketball knowledge and he says on a scale of 1 to 10 I go yeah he goes give him a six I go youre an easy greater man come on canels a great family out of Southern Florida his dad was a marvelous surgeon inside middle Brooks in traffic will lay it in and go through the line what a terrific job by DJ horn to drag the defense out where he got an angle and he could hit Ben Middlebrooks on that roll right down the middle of the lane instead of trying to turn the corner he just dragged the defense he got Michael oconnell popping out and then Ben Middlebrooks just getting a run to the basket with that hard roll and a great catch and finish 610 Jor is home for Lauderdale and that didnt touch Applause anything middle BRS has had some really good games this year hes coming off he had two really good assists against North Carolina to go with five rebounds and then had a couple of 12point games and seven rebounds nine rebounds against Florida State and Syracuse Duke by two under six Ro lifs rebound Tapped Out okon The Run couldnt finish it wo McCain couldnt make him pay on that one but another offensive rebound those long ones are tough to get when youre trying to protect the basket first on the back down of the D middle Brooks knocked it away and saved the basketball right he also save Michael oconnell whos trying to play defense down low he came from behind knocked that away that was a great play by middle Brooks waren wants it Mitchell out to stick to him Mitchell sticking right with him what a defensive job by Mark Mitchell to stay in front and force that tough shot Kan tip tone in and a block by the and went to save it as well we are seeing Dave some hustle plays in this not just the block but the save and then okell and watch what oconnell does here the block first and then the save and then oconnell throws it right off the Noggin of Ryan young and NC State keeps possession young picked up a foul on that play too thats his Applause second DJ horn will take a seat di already with three blocks in the first half bench play has been so solid for Duke that John sh can keep pal filipowski on the bench with those two fou till the second half Burns trying to make a spin on Stewart and hits it John Stewart strong and he went flying there with a little bump from DJ Burns and that allows NC State to put on some full for pressure try to make it chaotic TJ burns with 11 ball kned up at 22 Prock there with a Miss fire another high rebound to dke NC State cant grab it Duke keeping it alive and chasing it down that is really keeping Duke in Applause this power with a pull off Burns looking for an opening into the paint got it thir and Counting for the big fella Burns coming out the guard R shot clock at five Proctor tried to make a move now hell launch it and hit it what a shot Fletch Tyrese Pro you played 29 seconds of great defense and that was just a fantastic shot the defense by Marcel was excellent Burns rolling right past his Defender and once again it was Stewart hitting the deck theres almost nothing you can do with single coverage its like guarding an NFL center with a ballerinas feet DJ Burns exploding in this first half after two really quiet games he has 15 points on the drive roach thats a pretty play right by everybody well just attacking DJ burn seeing he can recover just got right past him thats a spectacular drive by Jeremy Roach Burns has scored the last six points for the pack working hard for it knocked Away by Stewart and that is actually going to be touched by NC State out of play so itll be Duke ball when we Music return how many guys this size do you see moving like this Spin and then another Spin and then out top you give a little move he spins back who wants to take a charge on that no thank you Dave OBrien Music couple of assists for him he said I watched a lot of hakee elijuan growing up I just happened to end up with a Zack Randolph Bill maybe two Zack randolphs but hes just been spectacular offensively in this first half and Dave I think uh the defense of NC state has been excellent the problem is theyve not finished it up with an offensive re or with a defensive rebound two cast 14 offensive rebounds off 24 misses in this game and theyre 132 in Second Chance points ahead of NC State that thats really whats keeping them in there Second Chance opportunity proor way down nothing but net he has 11 here in the first half tyres Proctor it was great to hear the uh Studio analysis of my roommate Seth Greenberg we shared a we shared a house at Alabama this weekend because it was parents weekend again hotel room for tough to find and I got to tell you Dave Seth Greenberg snoring is unacceptable drives it hes denied kick back out to middle Brooks for a second chance Taylor shot clock down to one and hes hit he draws the foul and that with 05 on the clock talking about a bail out there yeah not a good foul sending NC State to the foul line North Carolina state has not taken a lot of Threes in this game just one of three while Duke is three of or now four of 16 after that last Proctor three Proctor picked up the foul Taylor to the line Applause 79 and our SEC Big 12 super Tuesday double header last one on ESPN starts in Gainesville Florida taking on Alabama at seven follow by round two with the sunflower showdown between Kansas State and number 14 Kansas at Allen Fieldhouse the wild cats have set The Jayhawks February 5th theyre on the wrong side of the bubble right now so this is a huge one for them its always big when those two teams play Ill tell you what Alabama that better be ready to rebound against Florida cuz talk about a good offensive rebounding team the Gators still get it off the offensive class found the opening and thatll drop in touch for Jeremy roach and eight points those little floaters are not easy but Jeremy roach his middle game is really outstanding just always under control when he puts the ball in the deck his presence has been really important in this game with Kyle filipowski on the bench with those two fouls and middle Brooks and thats going to be on him an offensive foul just gave the hook to Tyrese Proctor he had the size Advantage but Proctor pushed him off the lane a little bit and watch this left arm when he when he turns he just hooks him and puts a little elbow in the back of his head so as well as things have gone in many respects for the wol pack and especially for DJ Burns its still 3228 Duke here and the final seconds in the first half its all because of the offensive glass for Duke Mitch turning firing taking the hit and Mark Mitchell will shoot two NC State tries to extend its defense but able to pass out of it its that second pass thats really difficult to deal with in a rotation situation you got two on the ball that means youre playing four on three on the backside so two fouls on middle Brooks Burns getting ready to check back in for Kevin Keats as Mitchell has another one coming and with his 15 points in a dazzling first half Burns returns and this man has only played 4 minutes th filipowski because of a couple of quick fouls its always a difficult decision when you got a player pick up a second foul in the first half do do you play him and trust him not to pick up a third but Duke whos been you know within a few points throughout the first half now with this lead that was probably a really good decision by John Music shy two Blue Devils Z get some production Off the Bench theyve had some really nice contributions Ryan Youngs come in hes grabbed some rebounds played done a good job with hustle Sean Stewart block shots offensive boards theres been some really nice contributions Off the Bench with Kyle filipowski on the bench with those two fouls you know sometimes you you think hey a guy with two fouls youre playing great defense on him yourself by not keeping him in the game but its a risk worth taking especially on the road you know when you youre able to stay closer in this case Duke with a a fivepoint lead its a really smart decision now youve got a full second half without concern with filipowski coming back in stay holding for the last shot of the first half Taylor up high Orel trying to get free three seconds left and a half turn around and he hits it and that will conclude the first half very entertaining first half and Duke heading to the locker room with a threepoint lead on NC State of any more foul difficulty in the second half as they look to pick up their 24th win have to think NC States going to go straight to DJ Burns but its broken up by roach roach with with the Finish they were looking they were going to set a little screen for Casey morcel come out for a ball screen and get a high low with DJ Burns but was totally broken up by Jeremy Applause Music Roose looking to go to work again comes up top for morcel good job by diara to keep that alive his line driver will go Casey morels had a difficult season last year he knew where his shots were coming from a lot of catch and shoot playing off Jarel Joiner to Quan Smith its been a little different this year yeah he was points by Carolina Saturday that wont touch a thing Mitchell Way Off the Mark with his first shot of the second half 3532 Duke as we toss to dangel gray hey guys I was able to catch up with Coach Keats and he said we checked a lot of the boxes they wanted to play with a fast pace also play through Burns who has 15 points at half but he said offensive rebounds have been a problem they got nine extra points because of it nine extra shots because of it he said because of that we have no transition points as well their only transition points came at the beginning of the game when they had their 90 run now burns with another terrific pass and diar with the basket to make this a onepoint game you cant get caught staring at DJ Burns you turn your head diar with a fantastic cut to get that pass from Burns Burns with his third assist roach scooping and finishing that one thats his second step through move of the game in the first half he did that for a short jumper that time got all the way to the rim with that step through move three four times a game you see that veteran presence you know a guy making a play like that youre not doing that as a freshman necessarily burns on filipowski and got position and dropped in two more for 17 points right there I thought p filipowski played too straight up and down you really have to get low and try to use your leverage against DJ Burns hes still going to try to back you down but once you get straight up and down he can get around you and not through you McCain 10 seconds to get off a shot roach taking his time diars got good feet so he can switch heres the long one and cant connect really good defense by Mohamed diara there switching off and then forcing that tough shot over hes staying with a chance here to grab the lead but too strong for morcel this place the lid was ready to come off if Marcel hit that one Dan stumbl proor to set it up filipowski looking for a cutter McCain fires no Mitchell what a tough rebound and the stick back too what a great offensive rebound by Mark Mitchell on the backside he judged that very well shot from the right most likely if it misses its coming off to the left and he positioned himself beautifully for that offensive board this has been a great offensive rebounding performance by Duke tonight but still locked up in a tight one a threepoint Advantage are yes he stick that one he can do that too a big fell with a nice stroke and he is tied it at 39 thats his 15th threepointer of the year filipowski he will connect get a little cross screen little to big and filipowski got really good position where he can get an angle to the basket you want to post so deep that you dont have to make a post move his first basket first points tonight Rell roach sealing that Baseline pushed him into the lane and a foul a really good use of DJ Burns just going around him and no Defenders going to be able to get around him to try to stay with you but DJ Burns watch this pass nobody picked up di who made a great cut down under the basket and DJ Burns hes just going to back in use his footwork to get around and lay it in hard tonight anyway from three four for 16 is Casey morcel goes to the line he makes 76 and another one coming for morcel and now youre all ACC team I think the four the first four are pretty solid but I went with Armando Bott even though Blake Hinson and NORAD omir make great cases for First Team all ACC but Bott the only player in the league averaging a double double and leading the league in rebounding thats a tough decision for first Team all ACC so many players have played so well throughout the course of the year not just an ACC play but overall dke by one roach Stewart had an impactful first half he rolls on in and drops in two more a pretty open side picket roll theres nobody in the corner that corner is open so that you dont have a tag guy to get in front of Sean Stewart as he rolls to the basket what a nice catch and finish hes had really good minutes off the bench for do 69ine freshmans become a new story line for John sh here at recent days worn around the backy to get off the shots hes trying to get going leaning in two points really took advantage of the switch where he had Stewart on him and instead of settling for a jumper where Stewarts length could bother him he just used his ball handling ability to get in the middle those floaters arent easy just made it look easy only four points for horn came in averaging about 18 phip powski only four minutes played in the first half that comes right back to him surprised he didnt shoot that proor does round it out good defensive exchange by North Carolina State their defense has been outstanding all game long its just been the defensive rebounding leted him down the pack try to take a lead here rebound batted to the Baseline horn a short jumper got it give Ben metor the credit there for keeping that ball alive this crowd has been dying all night to be a big time factor and now theyre up by one we have had eight lead changes tonight fcy State really making catches difficult and pushing Duke further out on the floor a lot of dribbling not a lot of passing because of their passing Lane cover mcain finds himself open and it rattles in DJ horn got knocked down coming off a screen that left J McCain wide open for that short jumper but still its just a two freshman at huge games for Duke see if he has a big second half here hand off o Connell diara with a spin blocks what a recovery by Shan Stewart to take that right out of his hands cuz diara had pivoted right around for an easy layup and Stewart just blocked Music it Ben Middlebrooks keeping that ball alive went right to DJ horn after Jared McCain overp pursued its those kind of plays that dont really show up in a box SC that can make a huge difference shot clock at eight on the Music inbounds burns again young trying to stick with him his fall Applause away and a whistle underneath there to go against the Wolfpack 134 to go and hell get diara for number Applause two Applause horn sticking all over Jared McCain through those screens shot clock of factor down to seven T in the Baseline tough pass to Stewart off the window no rebound coming free to the big guy Burns thats probably rebound then in the first half Duke came up with at that time North Carolina State played excellent defense and just finished the play by grabbing the rebound Taylor for burns sloted away once again Stewart is the man to meet him his impact has been meaningful roach with a triple another high rebound young had it come free Taylor up ahead de Applause and see State surging back in front by a point 12 minutes to play how hard is Muhammad diara worked in this game at both ends of the Applause floor Ro steep in the corner and but its caught by Stewart and up an in for two anytime Dave theres an air ball its Advantage to the offense cuz you can as an offensive player you can follow the Flight of the ball Defenders are looking to block out sometimes take your eye out youre expecting it to hit the rim any good Inc State F could tell you that Mell in the paint going to turn around that rolls off the rim on the Run roach pushing the tempo McCain for threepoint land swishes it in m credit to Tyrese proor there when he got that ball just gave a little slip pass to Jeremy roach to start that break Duke by Ford Burns at a brilliant first half trying to find that magic again and a whistle and a foul against Duke thatll be against Ryan young thatll be three on young 1057 to go here weve got a timeout well you want to see some Springs watch Sean Stewart the elevation to block that shot thats a big time block by the Press when DJ horn fell down able to knock down that midrange jumper and hes especially dangerous in transition because he just runs to that threepoint line I think everybody remembers that 35o performance against Florida State where he made 83 set a freshman record for Duke and tied a freshman record with those 35 points tying Zion Williamson pretty good company yes yeah I had that game in Tallahassee and the Freshman didnt look anything like a freshman by the way but blowing and kisses in the stands he became a villain which very few freshman ever do in that game and really kind of grew into a star over that period of games for Duke it was like a video game in the first half is ridiculous but anytime you put on a Duke uniform youre all of a sudden a villain I dont know how that happened Burns at the line and in and out with a first one 66 foul shooter to 69ine Music grad and made the second and give him 18 points MC State going to go with some full court pressure make it difficult trying to force turnovers make it difficult just for Duke to get the ball up the court try to take some time off so they dont have to guard as long in the half cour Duke with only three turnovers in the game very clean none so far in the second half good job bya just extend that catch a little Applause bit filipowski turns to fire knocked it down a three diara gave a little bit of help when he thought it was going to be a handoff and filipowski just faked the handoff turned around shot of three its how tight this game has been this is the biggest lead six points Burns takes a stumble picked up by McCain working on okon hell lay it up an in what a great job by jar MC in transition put the brakes on and let aonor fly by and that brings a timeout for Kevin Keats time out thanks to a 10 to1 Duke run they have opened up a 5547 Advantage out of uh chip and Joanna gainess Restaurant Magnolia in wakeo oh my hope they make tip takes a long time to get to wakeo but thats a great stop once youre there its so much fun and Scott Drews done an amazing job with that program over the last 20 plus years everybody knows they won a national championship a few years ago but theyre starting to really round into form theyve been playing a little bit more Zone and the development of Eve Mei has really changed that theme so Ive got 10 minutes to go in this one now well see if Duke is at that moment when they break away or can NC State continue to get the basketball to DJ burns with brilliant in the first half how do you guard this its like playing against your dad in the driveway when youre 8 years Applause old I think John sh is saying let lets go single coverage with this make him take a tough shot over he certainly doesnt want to foul there but at least youre not giving up open threes you bring a double and youre you have to ask yourself how do you feel about open shots anytime you double the post but that is a tough cover for sha Stewart for anybody because once DJ burn starts backing you down youre going wherever wherever he takes you thats for sure 21 points back to a fivepoint game thats a season high for DJ but really the tradeoff Dave is those are twos and do you give up those tough twos so that NC State doesnt knock down a bunch of Threes Bowski tough catch there by roach and even more difficult shot it looked like he was stopping that cut Midway through but still was able to complete it once you go back door you have to go and still he was able to make that catch and finish Jeremy roach 14 points John morel Warren looking for room with the floater rebound tipped and control heres McCain McCain wants to stop Po and knock it back how about that in the old days you try to get a layup and now you take that open three its a big time play diara can answer burn strong count that thats go tending on Stewart well that was going in anyway so you might as well wipe it away and let him know youre there but once DJ Burns grabbed that rebound hes got a guard in front of him theres only one place hes going thats to the rim Jeremy roach looked like he tried to stop that cut but thats a tremendous catch 59 Applause 52 Applause Co working behind the screen heres Proctor proor over the top Stewart with a finish and hell be off to the line a really smart play by Duke they tried to get DJ Burns and a ball screen action in the middle of the floor and then they did it on the open side on the left and burns has to try to stop the ball then recover to Stewart and wound up picking up up a foul in addition to giving up the bucket but hes not hes playing More in drop coverage but that just gives Shawn Stewart that clean roll to the basket because its an open Corner steart already into double figures his 10 points no threepoint play diara had to rebound pop free but hell control it and he stayed in a danger zone here 6152 Duke they have North Car Carina looming on Saturday at Cameron indor at 630 on ESPN the bounce for burns into heavy traffic pass will fire a long one he cant hit it just didnt make a clean catch to get that shot off roach blowing right by and will lay it in with a quick step how about that change of speed that extra burst by Jeremy Music roach diara pass into the paint thats in and out another rebound comes to the Duke Blue Devils both Burns and diar were fighting for that offensive rebound both of them knocked it to Duke instead Bowski out of the double Pro theres triple Bo he got a great look well thats the second time that Jared McCain has been there to knock the ball away as rebounders bringing it down didnt come away with either of them but knocked them away Duke by 11 with seven to go Burns a whirling derish will draw the foul looks like they got Stewart first before filipowski could foul him 702 left and weve got a timeout Duke trying to break away they lead at Music 6352 were there a lot of pictures you you said that I did Duke gets another Point by the way they went back and looked at the McCain shot and they did rule that in a triple on the floor it was ruled a twopointer so he picked up another point in the timeout so its Duke 6452 Duke shooting 63 in the second half some of its come in transitioning Burns again off the window as sweet as he please hes in his way but the one thing these are twos and tough twos and John sh making the calculation if DJ Burns can beat you with twos one thing hes not going to allow is for NC State to get hot from the threepoint line Duke has made eight of their last nine poke free by diara and theyre going to get filipowski for the whistle well that foul saved the bucket because that was a run out for NC State after J knocked that ball away it was basically four on0 so filipowski foul saved an easy basket his third personal John sh choosing not to go double I mean thats a difficult shot that clearly DJ Burns can make over and over again but he would rather trade that tough two for doubling and perhaps giving up open threes DJ needs a helping hand from a teammates hes been terrific looking for more here pass will launch a long one and knock down the threepointer and thats what Duke was trying to avoid and when Sean Stewart went down he needed help and that left an open threepoint shooter and DJ Burns took advantage of Applause it bror gave up the dribble filipowski shot clock to six weel sticking to him what a pass and nice finish too by Stewart well you had Jared McCain at the threepoint line opposite and Stewart just got right in front of the rim and made himself available thats a big time pass over Casey Morel by filipowski filipowski second in ACC play hes second on the Duke team and assist he can pass it burs juming it down low the arrow oh it hung on the iron he wins it back heres horn in the corner horn to the Baseline yes he was a Flur what a finish by DJ Applause horn to by Applause seven McCain over the shoulder they work it around the horn to Roach got it a three well that is fantastic ball movement got NC State in rotation the ball moves faster than you can rotate back Duke Back on Top by 10 thats spits free Duke to run theyve got a three on one a fast break the ti wont go roach is underneath heres McCain hes fouled and he hits it he hits the triple goodness so Duke had a chance on a couple of tips after Miss in the layup but they make the three with a foul well what a heady play after this Miss in the MST of the tip what a heady play by Jeremy roach to look back out to the threepoint line morcel his momentum took him right into Jared McCain thats a back breaking three lets go to Angel guys John CH said Jared McCain is one of one he has not been around around a person that is more confident than him he said even when he has a down game he always thinks about the next play ahead he only had two points at halftime right now he is on a surge in the second half coach Sher also said hes the Swagger infused in this roster guys and his nails are beautiful yeah thats been well documented Tes great care of those has 14 and those are in the second half 14 points in the second half for Jared McCain on that transition three where Duke had a twoonone could have been a layup when he pulled up for three and then that fourpoint play those are big plays by Jared McCain 16 for the game huge second half roach left it behind wins it back as he hit the deck still loose big scramble Burns gets in there possession arrow keeps it here on this end of the floor for the Duke Blue Devils what a great Hustle play by Sean Stewart hes been all over the place in this game double figure points hes grabbed some offensive rebounds blocked three shots and thats a big loose ball to come up with and hes Music bleeding keev we got Max as coming your way that is Texas at Baylor that is the second game of our big Monday match up yeah for Texas to win this game Max Asus needs to be aggressive play downhill get in the lane make plays and put pressure on the back court of Bor over 3000 points in his great career hes going to add to that tonight back to you Obie thank you 328 to go here 01 on the shot clock Jay what do you have time to do just a control tip you throw it up to the basket hope you get fouled tyres Proctor to put it in the Baseline for Duke here leading 7359 and the Applause he NC State to take over and since NC State got to within seven and the crowd really got into it Duke has gone in a seven zip run DJ hor off the Stager duuk switched it the catch proor comes up to guard him diaro will heave it up there and cant hit itel a big rebound returns it what a big rebound by Casey morcel grabbed that with two hands again its just a two and with this deficit NC states can have to force some turnovers Duke only four turnovers on the game 255th alltime meeting between these two Duke leads 151 to 103 in recent years Duke has had some problems on this floor theres roaches Blowing by everybody again and dropping in with the right hand for 21 points D just spreading it out and trying to use some clock they dont want to be in a hurry here they dont want to take the air out of it but the clocks your friend with this kind of lead Stewart got in that passing Lane again no reason to push it up the floor right now you can burn another 30 seconds this makes a comeback by NC State that much more unlikely yeah approaching 2 minutes to play Sean Stewart has really been an unsung hero in this game hes been fantastic just his athleticism his energy hes made a bunch of big playsi off the fake got the Airborne and he completes it this is the way you salt away a game especially on the road dke making some really good decisions on the offensive end late theyre shooting well over 60 in this second half Burns needed a lot more help As He will draw the foul with a minute 40 to play needed somebody else to explode too and it just didnt happen then lineup coming up on Saturday is a Dandy including the Sonic Blockbuster North Carolina and Duke at 630 from Cameron Indoor Jay will be there with Dan shman Burns off the inbounds will lay it in and a timeout Inc State Duke more concerned there with taking away the three they dont want to give up the two but youd rather give up that slip and allow DJ horn an open three so some of the NC State fans heading for the exits here at PNC with a score 77 to 63 and if it does play out that way the wol pack will drop to 17 and 13 at 9 and 10 in the ACC and dropping backto Back Games should have come to pass against North Carolina Duke they beat those two last year its a big reason that the Wolfpack played their way into the NCAA tournament yeah they were a different team last year with Jarel Joiner or Quan Smith they had guys that could just manufacture baskets and those two I thought made Casey Marcel better he could just catch and shoot but NC State did some really good things in this game defensively I thought they were really good in the first half it just the offensive glass that crushed him they werent able to get those defensive rebounds to end really good defensive possessions and in the second half Dukes been surgical just surgical in the way theyve gone about it this is Duke and North Carolina two most balanced teams in the league the balance between their offense and defense and those two things are connected its great point and it means they can win without necessarily the Stars having huge games yeah and to have sha Stewart come off the bench and give this kind of performance in this atmosphere that that vs well for Duke as they go to Washington DC for the ACC tournament and then the NCAA tournament ACC tournament beginning in March 12 in our nations capital Proctor the shot clock to five and another offensive rebound Duke has been Giant in that category with 19 of them NY States only got three team fouls so if they wanted to play the foul game theyre going to to foul a lot to get there not going to do that shot clock again down to three filipowski attacks and lays it in it turned out to be a great decision by John Shire to keep Kyle filipowski on the bench playing only four minutes in the first half hes been a presence in the second half and foul with 43 seconds to play and thatll go against Applause Stewart n State here on senior night able to go to their bench Alex nunnelly coming into the ball game carrye North Carolina just got engag so hes got a lot on his mind it was a nice moment too earlier in the first half when Burns went to the bench for a breather and Roger a is the official and over and just congratulated him on his career tapped him on the shoulder and they exchanged a couple of words and its a nice gesture between a longtime official and a guy finishing up his college Applause career Alex Nellys got a decision to make he may want to continue his career playing by transferring where he can get a graduate degree and hes thinking about law school I tried to talk him out of it going to learn a lot of big words 7964 and DJ after a tremendous effort 27 points it will end in defeat here tonight but he was a oneman ban for a long stretch of this game he was unguardable oneonone in the post so Duke will sail to the victory in the end they broke away at about the 10minute Mark really and put the hammer down tonight against NC State and they are going to knock them off the number time9 team of the country will improv to 24 and six finaly from the wing and wont hit it rebounded away by filipowski so the final seconds here at PNC Duke winning it an impressive second half of the Blue Devil 79 64 the final score well with a great second half performance
