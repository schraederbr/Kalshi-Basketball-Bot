Georgia Tech on Tuesday coming off a loss to Wake Forest Yellow Jackets missed 23 of the first 24 Shots in that game Louisville beat Florida State last Saturday lost the close one to Syracuse midweek yellow jackets have never won at the Yum Center their last win in Louisville came in 1991 at Freedom Hall yeah the endings for each team in their last game couldnt be any different right Georgia Tech gets blown out and Louisville loses at the Music Applause buzzer Caleb Glenn making his fourth straight start little turnaround and the rebound by B Dongo starting lineups for Georgia Tech Miles Kelly still the teams overall leading score but he and Ka Reeves went a combined 1 for 14 Tuesday Reeves had an early three that game Kelly was shut out yeah keep an eye on 11 for Georgia Tech hes been their leading scorer Dongo in the ACC Dongo Miss fires and the rebound by Brandon Huntley Hatfield starting lineups for Louisville Huntley Hatfield in that win last Saturday against Florida State went for a careerhigh 29 as sky Clark turns it over Clarks been dealing with a hip missed the game against Florida State came off the bench went against Syracuse well two teams that are really struggling on the defensive side you can imagine keys to the game will center around defense for Georgia Tech get back and defensive transition that is first and foremost for Damon stalle second shring to Court Louisville likes to drive Georgia Tech needs to be in the gaps for Louisville they want to have a lock down defense in this game thats how they get off to good starts but also Den limit the turnovers because that plays into your defensive transition offensive rebound off the gari Miss crowd wanted a walk George sets up for three and its Tracked Down by Louisville at the shoo rounds today was all defense was discussed yes they went over offense scouting reports but they talked about and emphasized getting off to a good defensive start they are last both are last and second last in defensive efficiency in the ACC dong go through traffic turns it over take a look at their scoring defense Georgia Tech giving up 80 points per game in the ACC Louisville giving up 81 A5 that has to change if theyre going to win games down the Music stretch heres sky Clark he had 23 last time out now Glenn the freshman land off to nice speed and those are our first two points of the game but when you drive Baseline youre looking for the opposite corner if not the dunker Applause Music spot Reeves sets up back iron on the three and we get a foul with the battle for the board this is terrific offense by Louisville look at sky Clark hes looking for the opposite corner out of the corner of his eye finds his teammate cutting to the basket Caleb Glenn those are the two spots when you drive Baseline opposite corner or right to the dunker spot Clark picks up his first foul Georgia Tech 0 for four 0 for three from three lob down low tipped Away by Glenn Here Comes Mike James Louisvilles leading scorer thats the energy Kenny Paynes looking for on the defensive end the awareness by Caleb Glenn for on a deflection Trey white uses the shot pick Clark open for three nobody went for the rebound Glen hustles and he chases it down well this team hasnt had trouble scoring the ball or playing on offense theyre sharing the ball pretty well they score a lot of oneonone situations Louisville this time theyre running a flex cut they trying to get Trey white on a post up White against ree shot clock at one Fades and thats a shot clock violation you go back to Tuesday Georgia Tech opened that game against wake one for 24 from the field theyre 0 for four tonight but the one was a threepointer KY Reeves hit a three and then there wasnt much after that for a while and Damon stalle talked about getting off to a good start on the road all teams talk about it but Georgia Tech is failing it from their last game they need to get off to a good start Big Time shot right there and they need Miles Kelly who did not score in that game hes been shut out twice in conference Hunley Hatfield beats the defense down floor he may be Louisvilles most improved player this season Huntley Hatfield kapari through the contact out of bounds to Louisville Lou coming out hot the penetration by sky Clark the drop off Caleb Glenn the Finish 42 lead on Georgia Tech yes both teams sit at the bottom of the ACC and a Paul B and cardi but both on their best nights have shown that theyre capable of knocking off some of the top teams in this league yeah two teams that are searching for confidence and momentum down the stretch Georgia Tech B Carolina and Duke Florida state has averaged 96 points in their last two games these two teams are capable and dangerous in the rest of the season yeah Louisville with wins against Florida State they went to Miami got a win against the canes as well and uh Georgia Tech you mentioned Duke and Carolina they also have the win against Clemson and Mississippi State earlier this season so they teams that can score and defend they just havent put it together on a consistent basis for 40 Music minutes The Freshman Tyler Johnson into the game Louisville he had 27 points in that win against Florida State a careerhigh hes the reigning ACC rookie of the week hes been terrific for them high assist guy sometimes a high turnover player but he brings energy to Louisville hes a catalyst number four in the red Off the Bench that rims out the rebound grabbed by Miles Kelly who averages almost six boards Music game nice help that time by Huntley has field on the quick ball screen Louisville worked on that today at the shooter around defending ball screens Reeves gives it up here comes James to Huntley Hatfield and we get a blocking file down low Two Shots coming this Georgia Tech Team Paul theyre a little shorthanded ebener danana got injured in practice yesterday Debo Coleman out with a concussion so from a depth standpoint Georgia Tech missing some pie is that are part of the rotation yeah Coleman is a threepoint shooter right now 35 in the ACC and danana is the guy that they need inside to protect the rim and rebound play low post Applause defense in a league filled with quality bigs Huntley Hatfield doesnt get the attention as the PJ halls and the Armando Botts and the north chadow m over the last N9 10 games though hes been outstanding hes been terrific hes been their second leading scorer in conference play you know Brandon Huntley Hatfield Anish was a top 25 recruit out of high school went to Tennessee he has the body he has the skill hes still learning the game and right now hes progressing under Kenny pay Miles Kelly has all four for Applause Georg Georgia Tech really in the gaps on defense they want to play threepoint line defense because Louisville doesnt shoot it that well and they want to protect against the drive good defensive possession by the yellow jackets three freshman on the floor for Louisville kapari catch and shoot no good came into the game shooting 8 for 39 from three and thats why Caleb Glenn didnt make a full close out theres Johnson do not leave that young man open number four in the red hell make you pay hes quick off the bounce to the rack and hes quick into his jump shot now he wants to steal theres Nate George boy has he come up big in crunch time had the two big threes late in regulation against Clemson a game Georgia Tech won in overtime and then have that game winner against Carolina and Nathan George has been a pleasant surprise for Georgia Tech 60 assist rate in his game he helps the offense flow hes got good size defensively I like his game and hes been very dependable for Damon stalle Kelly away off stays in bounds comes back to Dongo and he cant cash it thats all right if you miss it you just need to get back and protect Williams Applause and both teams now three of 11 shooting that is great ball Movement by Louisville right now if youre watching Louisville on offense you can see why theyve averaged 96 points in the last two games they really moved the ball and they running great offense with spacing what a block numbers for Louisville the lob Trey white missed the dunk wanted to flush it with one hand just want to get two points sometimes today play todays player wants a stylistic two points you got to come away with a dunk on that its a twoonone heres the runner too strong and we get a Applause foul Louisville has been very active defensively in this game theyve had deflections now watch the block right there by Johnson Huntley Hatfield with the push ahead its a twoonone Trey white its a give and go the right idea Trey white Just Lay It Off The Glass take the two points dont worry about the Music Highlight but everything right for Louisville in that possession except for the Finish you love the energy theyre playing with the unselfishness and the activity on defense Johnson lost it Hunley half field against taian claw and unable to finish yeah Claud did a nice job just Walling up that build is strong risky pass itll stay with Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets on Tuesday is season low in points as Mike James is the injured Louisville player underneath thats their leading score theame 22 and Mike James is the heart and soul for Louisville definitely the hardest worker and he went to try to catch that pass fading away going out of bounds went down on his backside he is a tough young man out of the state of Florida just Dependable consistent with his approach I think hes the hardest worker on the Louisville team I think the coaches would agree to that and hes provided the leadership during good times and bad for Louisville and not quite in the locker room hes in the hallway and theyre trying to looks like stretch him out a little bit and James last month had three straight 20po games as that one Applause goes Applause first lead for Georgia Tech ayle sturon 38 this year from Applause three thats the first three by anybody and Kelly rewarded on the drive to the basket George Tech with a much needed three on the road Kyle sturdavant 38 from distance knocks it down the best talent in this game may be the coaches take a look at Damon stalle bonsy Wells was a stud at Ball State we know about the greatness of Kenny Payne Danny Manning at the time the best college basketball player in the country Nolan Smith who played at Duke and and for Georgia Tech they also have Carl Hobs who is a great player at Connecticut he actually played high school with Patrick Ying at Cambridge ringe and Latin Carl Hobs there he is and I worked with Carl Hobs at Boston University that man could score the ball with craftiness he was a smart Petty guard terrific associate head coach for Damon stalle and as a coach he is not a good but a great recruiter excellent recruiter evaluator he was a heck of a coach at George Washington he the head coach there for a while he was one of Jim Calhouns top recruiters at Yukon when he coached there was at ruter with Steve pel as they got that program back on track thats o cor four on the inside and remember by Dongo was headed to ruter Carl hops is part of the reason Dongo flipped to Georgia Tech well Carl Harps went with Damon STM Dongo followed him and thats usually what happens in recruiting pretty good G they say its about relationship just who youre comfortable with and who you trust the Music most just a simple ball screen slip Georgia Tech how about the pass fake by Johnson he looked to the wing shot it right down the middle NE team has shot it well so far Georgia Tech 4 for 16 Louisville 4 for 15 well Id like to give the defense some credit here theres another thats the third deflection for Louisville in this half Claude throws it up and and its coralled by the cards and zamp P the coaches have emphasized it theyve talked about it theyve watched film on it they really want to see their teams have a defensive effort in this game white misses Kelly another rebound Kellys got six of the 11 for Georgia Tech Sturman not that time Tech now one for seven for three but we saw the close out by sky Clark you know in some of the games Louisville has played and has not been good defensively especially against Syracuse late on the close out not knowing the Personnel this team right now is in tune defensively George and dango at the scores table for George Tech Johnson the pull up yes hes hard to stop off the ball screen you dont know if hes going to drive it pass it or shoot Applause it another deflection Johnson the active hands theres Clark rebound Kelly and a foul you mentioned the emphasis was heavy on defense leading into this game for both these teams were seeing active hand is with Louisville Kenny Payne talked about oneonone defense today at shoot around he talked about helps side defense he talked about trying to get deflections to be active so far four deflections in this half and all deflections lead to run outs Johnson has been a catalyst for the Cardinals in the first half all right next Saturday ACC Network mens basketball weve got a triple header Virginia Tech heading to Chapel Hill to take on number three UNC Carolina beat Miami today the U goes to BC BC lost to Duke earlier on ESPN Louisville visits pit you think pit has a chance to get into the NCAA tournament I really do I like their roster I love Henson Carrington Jaylen low The Freshman I think its a team that could sneak in Carrington and low really have played well of late the issue for pit you know for a team like that to get in youre going to have to score some wins against some of the conference Music Applause heavyweights oh hard foul on Clark but thats what Kenny Payne wants to see transition from defense to offense and this team has a lot of talent it really does its young talent but theyre a talented group the throw ahead the push Sky trying to punch it home Clark hurt his hip against Clemson he didnt play last Saturday against Florida State and then came off the bench in the win against Syracuse 31 minutes 23 points in that Applause game see Kenny Payne right now hes still teaching hes still coaching his personality just encapsulates the team his ability to communicate with his players they love him and hes trying to figure out how to press their buttons defensively he says I feel good going into games now that we can score last last year I didnt feel good about scoring this year I do now I want to make sure our defense gets tightened up offensive foul momentum on Louisville side theyve scored the last eight and that is two on Dongo Damon stalo doesnt have the same feeling about his team offensively obviously they had a bad outing against Wake Forest but there been scoring droughts for Georgia Tech in a lot of games this year and then eventually the defense starts to break down against wake Georgia Tech was three for 24 from three shot 28 for the game rims out for Trey white battle for the rebound and pay gets fouled see the crowd loves the effort nice penetration and kick by Louisville when you get a good clean shot attempt you have an excellent chance to get an offense rebound right now Louisville is in Rhythm Applause Music offensively white 0 for four looking for his first points down low Huntley half field against CL yeah they love him on the left block kicks it out to White seven to shoot out a lightning quick Johnson bothered fouled and two shots for the cards Anish when it comes to Johnson and his offensive game hes a little bit Herky jerky hes clever with the ball hes extremely quick and when you think hes going to shoot it you get up close and then he blows past you he can stop on a dime and pull up when his Defender backs up he understands how to pull up hes the first 201 10 and five game in Louisville program history and that was against Florida Music State you had him as a top 100 player coming out of high school just on the outside of the top 100 actually but this young man can put the ball in the bucket and he understands how to find his open teammates Mike oh Mike James back in after taking to spill earlier Music kapari looking for help Kelly wide open buries the three they need more of that Georgia Tech I mean hes their leading scorer overall this season hes been shooting the ball really well from three in ACC play Music Applause 37 Applause white posting up against Carter Murphy Murphy doesnt play a whole lot Louisville recognized the matchup advantage and thats their matchup play when they see the mismatch they want to post on the Block wild shot by George now Johnson wants to Applause Music run nice Cut Clark cant get the bounce well the ball is moving for Louisville right now in this game they are looking for each other nobody holds it for more than a half a second to a Applause second Kelly he has 12 of Georgia Tech 17 well 50 of his points come behind the threepoint line so Kenny Payne talked about knowing your personnel when he touches the ball you have to be closer to Miles Kelly you knew he wasnt going to be shut down two games in a row 0 for five on Tuesday held Music scoreless James back iron Claud Music Applause pulls both teams under 30 from the field Kellys been the offense for Georgia Tech kapari ran out of real estate on the Baseline Claude keeps it alive and Johnson nearly had another steal Miles Kelly starting to get hot for Georgia Tech this one was deep six times this season hes recorded double doubles against Mississippi State Duke and NC State this guy knows how to put the ball in the bucket the senior from Stone Mountain Georgia has range and accuracy and he needs to stay hot in this game on the road yeah Damon stanmire has been very clear and he was a a little dispirited after Tuesday I did the game against wake and statamire during shootaround told us man we feel this team is close they played well against NC State just had a a poor spell which doomed them against the pack they had beaten UNC and then you have your worst offensive performance of the Season that was disheartening but he said the margin for error is not great thats true for both of these teams Miles Kelly has been held below 10 points in three of the last six games they need him to be a consistent double digit score hes part of that margin for error you cant have him struggle the way he has against a way can pit no it has to be Miles Kelly Nathan George they have to score by Dongo as well but those three guys they need to score points for Georgia Tech to be good and the mar forever you talked about its only about an inch wide dangos on the bench with two Music Applause fouls Murphy joined Georgia Tech from Air Applause Force Kelly wants his third career hes got it 15 for Miles Kelly and hes making up for Tuesday well hes showing everyone what hes capable of doing and this is what Damon St meire talked about he needs to score for us and he needs to score big a simple ball screen at the top Trey white ran into the screen you have to either go over the screen or under the screen and the guy covering the screener are you going to hedge you going to switch how are you going to help that time Miles Kelly got a semi clean look he scored the last 10 for Georgia Tech and you know Paul he really hasnt forced anything tonight no he he lets the rhythm of the offense come to him Georgia Tech has great spacing watch them on the offensive end they are high and wide first follows his miss the extra pass by Huntley Hatfield to Caleb Glenn just the light switch to go from an offensive rebound loose ball and then to an attack mode there wasnt any thinking on that possession by Louisville it was all instinctual and Kelly with a chance for two more hes got 15 of the 20 for Georgia Tech and watch this possession right here Balls loose sky Clark grabs it snaps it Huntley Hadfield gets rid of it quickly and Caleb Glenn right to the rim unselfish attack Style offense by Louisville that thats what Kenny Payne wants to continue to reinforce with his Music Applause team Kelly last year at 19 against Louisville today hes almost outscored the Cardinals by himself in this first half he has been the offense for Georgia Tech he scored the last 11 for the Y jackets and has 16 of the 21 the Georgia Tech is doing a good job at trying to find him within their offense Here Comes Clark pulls up over George airball oh Kellys earned a heat check Huntley Hatfield came out to greet him Murphy wide open drills the three James open way Applause off well Carter Murphy has only taken 12 shots this year 11 of them have been threes know where he is dont let him get it off only the four team foul on Louisville Huntley Hatfields Applause Music first Dongo on the bench with two fouls we have not seen much of kaasi Music Reeves theyre daring gari to shoot because they know the Scouting Report they do on him now I know Carter Murphy hasnt taken a lot of shots or played a lot but now that hes made one you got to make sure that youre up on him you cannot allow someone to come in Off the Bench and start making shots against you at home Louisville in the bonus so free throws for Mike James itll be a one and one neither team is really good behind the arc when it comes to shooting threes and now I know Louisville had a good shooting night up at the Dome and against Florida State but by and large these teams do not shoot the ball exceptionally well behind the arc so you really have to know who can shoot it and who likes to shoot it thats Applause important Claude to gari and its a turnover for Georgia Tech thats number seven in this first Music half just watching the Louisville defense in this game its been alert its been active and I think Kenny Payne has to be satisfied at this point with this defense and and these two teams are at the bottom when it comes to defensive Applause efficiency has it been defense or bad offense its been defense good deflection that time by Georgia Tech but were going to talk about offense right now Miles Kelly off the simple ball screen he makes it look easy Georgia Tech with a onepoint lead on Louisville Tech has lost 10 out of 12 Louisville had a big win against Florida State last Saturday and then lost a close one to Syracuse midweek 94 to 92 neither team has really shot it well Miles Kelly has been the story of the first half 15 points 16 points excuse me to lead all scores Louisville in this game has 10 points in the paint to zero for Georgia Tech so I think thats been a big difference so far in this game Louisville really attacking the paint and getting some Second Chance points as well Damon STM first year head coach for the yellow jackets team got off to an 83 start theyve lost 10 of 12 but when you look at their know big wins Mississippi State Duke UNC they went on the road against Clemson his message is look when weve played our best we can compete with anybody consistency though with the young team sometimes that takes time yeah their offensive rebounding was great in those wins in nich and also the threepoint field goal percentage defense those were the two big reasons they beat those teams Kelly over James 19 for Miles Kelly whos put Georgia Tech on his back you got to take away his air space that means you got to be chest to chest its no more arms length away and try to contest you cannot let him get it off Wi off the shot fake Johnson using the shot fake out of bound is to Georgia Applause Music Tech and thats his fourth threepoint make in this game Miles Kelly obviously the senior on the Scouting Report leading scorer overall for Georgia Tech so now the defense has to ramp up a little bit against him maybe you dont leave him at all you chase him off of all screens there you go take away his airace good job that time they go right back to him step back over James that one in and out hes feeling it that one looked good but Mike James is a heck of a Defender for Louisville Johnson hits the turbo boost and a foul on the floor first foul on Music George next foul puts Louisville in the double Applause Music bonus thing about Miles Kelly when when you look at his stats hes 30 from three overall this season but in ACC plays 375 so you have to understand hes a dangerous threepoint shooter and right now hes a hot threepoint shooter he leads the team overall in scoring and tonight hes feeling it and his teammates are looking for him so if youre Louisville you got Mike James you just got to hug him everywhere he goes almost make it four on four Music Applause game they get it to Kelly tend to shoot James all over Kelly gets the step throws it up toward the rim offensive rebound 21 for Miles Kelly whos doing it all well that time they got up on Kelly but you got to take away the shot and you still have to anticipate the drive white launches and Louisville with its first three its Trey white the USC transfer Trey White not a big threepoint shooter he loves to score deep twos and at The Rim that one looked good Louisville had missed its first eight from three Murphy coming off the Applause Music screen Kelly to gari Murphys open splashes the three just a gorgeous possession by Georgia Tech they played pick and role they made the short pass the penetration wide open shot Johnson got ambushed Tyler Johnson eight points to lead Louisville gring ACC rookie of the week gives up some height here to Kelly going for the steel kapari has it taken away numbers for the cards the alleyoop and James connects well that time defensively Louisville was very active they chased Miles Kelly off screens and Johnson is everywhere defensively coming up on the auto owners insurance halftime we will cap a wild finish in Miami between the Tar Heels and the canes and Lake Forest getting a big win against NC State Joe lardy has wake as one of its first four outs youre high on Wake for I think they can be a sweet 16 game sweet 16 team if they can defend just a little better well they really can score the ball Hunter Salis was fantastic today hes been fantastic all season long now Sal went for 30 plus well step aside 476 to go drop PA and cardi before we went to break we got a push off call on the Music inbounds lets take a look at it right now George Johnson and George called that was easy Nathan George he he let Johnson get under his skin and thats what Johnson can do he he likes to provoke you a little bit likes to antagonize you on defense hell bait you into a call Nathan George the Freshman against the Music Freshman Johnsons been a Difference Maker on both ends in this first half absolutely hes been a big spark for Louisville he just brings energy to the game and just a little bit of a risk taker heres Johnson left it short Applause and Claude with a mental error does Johnson remind you a little bit of Russ Smith the more I watch him play thats what comes to mind Russ Smith turned into a pretty good player at Louisville he turned into pretty good great player at Louisville just you didnt know what he was going to do sometimes hence the nickname rusticus didnt patino name one of his horses rusticus he did Johnson Applause slips and a timeout called by Georgia Applause Tech great Hustle by Georgia Tech Tech has never won at the KFC Yum Center Music last time they beat Louisville you got to go back to the early 90s that was when the cards played at Freedom Hall Denny crumb the head coach and Louisville looking to win backto back ACC home games for the first time in two seasons wow and also for Louisville if they can win this game tonight theyll have three ACCC wins in conference last year they only had two theres still another month to go in the season now it doesnt sound like much to the person at home saying hey they only got two wins yeah but if you can surpass your win total thats what you strive to do and you still have another month of basketball thats what people dont understand theres a lot of games left and there still a tournament and we talked about in the open these two teams are dangerous and theyre capable we saw what Georgia Tech did to Mississippi State to Clemson to North Carolina to Duke with those wins and Louisville when you post 96 points on an average in the last two games in the ACC you know you have something thats boiling right now and we get a foul its on Johnson his first well these teams are dangerous if youre a bubble team in the ACC cuz a loss to one of these teams can hurt you I mean it could destroy you yeah just asked Florida State they took an L final seconds heres Kelly the star of the first half gives it up and Louisville had a foul to give so they do give it Trey Whites Music first Kelly will inbound with 27 and now they want Kelly to be a part of this so Reeds will be the inbounder look for Kelly to come off a little zipper cut down screen there he is try to get it to him they do Kelly hoists it up hits the backboard coming off of blutarski on Tuesday Miles Kelly exploding for 21 points in the opening half seven of 12 four for seven from three hes got 21 of Georgia teex 32 rambling wreck up by a deuce to the studio and Kelsey Tech Anish they have seven offensive rebounds in this game but they only have two points to show for it You like to get a point per possession in a twopoint game that thats a big difference a back out on the floor for Georgia Tech is by Dango who was on the bench quite a bit with a couple of fouls in the opening half yeah they need his offense his fluidity his ability to score take pressure off of Miles Kelly Nathan George was quiet in the first half kapari is now 0 for six from the field Dongo whos the teams leading score in conference play without a point in the opening half again foul trouble a part of that and you have to be careful in the second half with the Georgia Tech because Louisville loves to attack the paint with the post up and the drive theyre one of the best teams in the ACC of free throw rate and if youre Louisville you look at Mike James and Brandon Huntley Hatfield just seven points combined you hope to get them going in the second Applause half Here Comes Clark gets some separation and the rebound coralled by Applause Reeves both of these coaches talk today in shooter M about the next play whatever happens lets concentrate on what happens next Glenn the block on Dongo Kelly knocked it away from James who wanted a foul thats a great job by sky Clark he read the offensive player out of control and he just stepped in and took the charge watch sky Clark that time is a block transition now watch sky Clark he just stands there lines him up takes it right on the chest looks like the train that runs through Louisville Clark over George connecting you make a great defensive play Anish then you get the offense on the on the offensive side of the ball you get the confidence that you need sky Clark is a very talented young man he can do a lot of things for Louisville his first field goal hes got six kapari wide open no good he has now missed his last 12 from three on the season 8 for 43 and Louisville is going to leave him open as they have so far in this game white no good Dongo a rebound yeah thats a oneonone shot by white you can get a better look plenty of time on the Applause clock I didnt like that look and I dont think Penny Kenny Payne cant for it as Music Applause well Dongo from 15 yeah thats big part of Georgia Tech offense hit that pocket pass with a short roll Dongo has been fabulous at that this season James off the kick from Clark in and out tipped by Glenn not there rebound Applause Dongo theyre got to get Dongo continue to get him involved he can come up big in the second half for attch they are daring gari to shoot a three every time he touches the Music ball hes camped out behind the threepoint line theyre not even defending him here comes Dongo from the elbow Reeves an offensive rebound theres gari and hell get a chance of the free throw line rais a 65 shooter thats what you want to see out of Georgia Tech when the shot goes up two and three guys multiple players go to the offensive glass your point guard has to get back for defensive balance but you cant stand and watch behind the threepoint line go attack the glass when the shot goes up a kapari sing the floor more today no Deo Music colan no ebener danana either ACC womens basketball coming your way Thursday on accn NC State goes to Notre Dame and then Duke and Virginia Tech we get a chance to see Elizabeth kitley for the hokes how about the Louisville womens team with a big win against Notre Music Dame and the Louisville womens team routinely among the best in the Applause ACC tyor Johnson in there for the cards comes James dribble Drive got tied up and well get a foul and this is what Louisville loves to do they spread you out its a dribble Drive concept spread you out hand off Drive hand it off to their next player and thats why theres such a good free throw attempt team they get to the line a lot 11 of 12 in the opening half turnover stur it to Dongo and by Dongo with his first points Kenny pay talked about it as a big key to the game must limit your live ball turnovers and and defense they have the defense so far in this game Glenn blocked by gari goes right back at him and a chance for a threepoint play watch how quickly this turnover by Louisville Trey white with a soft pass right into the defense and it turns into two quick points thats what going to happen at this level anytime you have a live ball turnover especially High you have the free throw line you might as well counted to the other team great take by Glenn The Freshman is really strong and powerful he played his high school basketball at Lair up in Indiana Louisville native National Power lumir you had him as a top 70 guy I did great energy highly productive as he continues to play play minutes for Louisville I think youre going to see that productivity hes a good screener rebounder and finisher hes making his fourth straight start today hutley Hatfield working on Dongo and they get Dongo with foul number Music three time is out on the so Dongo picks up his third foul four minutes into this second half Music tie of 35 4 minutes gone by here in this second half now Louisvilles offense took off the last two games Georgia Tech coming off its worst offensive performance of the season and and neither team has shot it really well both teams rank at the bottom in defensive efficiency in the ACC I asked you in the first half is it bad offense or good defense you said good defense why because teams both of these guys are really active theyre playing the ball well theres good weak Side Health the rebounding has been solid I dont think the baskets have come uncontested in this game theres been some open shots but for the most part these guys have been really tight on each other following The Scouting Report theyre playing hard right now thats the most important thing to pain in STM Johnson back iron Dongo the rebound earlier they went to Huntley Hatfield you know dangos got three fouls Im curious if that becomes a concerted to get Dongo that fourth foul well they want to try to get a mismatch when they cant or try to get someone in further foul trouble Kelly had 21 in the first half still without a point in the second but sometimes when you try to do that too much you lose the rhythm of what you might have had offensively and we get a foul away from the Music ball you know both of these teams have qu the head coach has questioned the toughness and the work ethic at times during the season and right now tonight theyre giv everything they have to their head coaches well big big loss for Damon Stan Dongo just picked up his fourth and again away from the ball not the type of foul you want to see they go right inside to Huntley Hatfield and he gets Two Shots funny how that works well Huntley Hatfield I mean hes the biggest strongest guy in the court right now he stands close to 69 its got a chisel frame broad shoulders its got a beautiful touch for a big man and as I mentioned in the first half I believe hes the most improved player on this Louisville roster shooting it well from the outside loves the postup game hes been terrific hey its softball season weve got the Shriners childrens Clearwater Invitational heavyweight lineup Thursday Kentucky UNC LSU Georgia Tech udub North Carol Carolina Northwestern Georgia Tech Saturday and Applause Music Applause Music Sunday ibraim aako on the floor he gets the pass from stent and lays it in what a beautiful give and go by Georgia Tech they worked on that in the shoot around today in terms of backup point guards youd be hard pressed to find many better than Kyle stur into the ACC no hes solid hes steady transfer from USC hes played a lot hes started games and right now with Dongo on the bench with four fouls Louisville said were going inside to big number five check out Georgia Tech the ball goes to the wing theres a handoff and then a give go week side help was late the offense was in Music Rhythm second foul on Claude seventh team foul on Georgia Tech and one thing that Louisville does well they get to the free throw line at a high rate and theyre shooting it at a good percentage theyre at 78 what a touch for Huntley Hatfield you dont find 69 610 240 who can shoot it like that and now hes understanding the concepts on the offensive end hes talking a little bit more on defense you can hear him right now bark out instructions thats what Kenny Payne said to shoot around today I want to hear your voice so far Louisville theyve been talking on defense James picks up the foul coming up coming uping up Louisville has seven wins on this season if they can find three more they will avoid backto back singled digit win Seasons something that hasnt happened since the early 1940s during a stretch when they were playing less than 20 games a season Huntley Hatfield picking up the foul and thats the end of the floor that Huntley Hadfield needs to improve upon you he wants to be a stretch big well you have to cover both post and perimeter that time he just got kind of pushed inside too close to the basket so Claude with a chance and he completes the threepoint play well traveled started at Morehead State Claude was at Western Carolina last year where he was the top rebounder in the socon and that win against North Carolina earlier this month remember Dongo left that game early with a head injury Claude came in gave them some solid minutes nine points eight rebounds three blocks hes averaging 17 minutes a game and hes grabbing five rebounds thats pretty good Johnson Miss fires Murphy the Applause rebound and and well get a foul as Kelly drives its on Trey white the one1 defense by Louisville its going to be tested now here in the last 1350 theyve played good defense so far but Kenny Payne talked about it today our oneonone defense has to improve we cant pick up Ticky Tac fouls 20 25 ft away from the basket on the Music ball twopoint lead for Georgia Tech Sako through the contact well theyre running the little ball screen situation with a short roll pass Louisville needs to come over a little bit quicker on that Johnson using the Glenn screen James dumps it down low Emanuel 04 four the sophomore from Nigeria who missed most of January with an ankle injury he gives Louisville some size inside 69 220 they really dont have the center so he becomes the center Kelly a long three his fifth triple hes got 24 those were his first three of the second half hes shooting the ball tonight with great offensive confidence Miles Kelly Johnson cannot answer tipped into the air Glenn wins the battle for the rebound Clark for three its good just Louisville second three in 13 attempts theyve been living at the free throw line in ACC play and in this game that time sky Clark in rhythm with plenty of room knocked it down we get a timeout well step aside as well George attack by two now in this game Miles Kelly thats his fifth triple in this game hes got 24 points overall and on the other side a timely threepoint shot by sky Clark only the second for Louisville in this Music game with Dongo on the bench with the four fouls you saw louisv try to go inside a George attack is pinching in the paint and you get the sense Louisville is going to have to knock down a few outside shots this is a team where the last couple of games they shot 54 against Florida State and Syracuse they hit 11 threes against the cuse that might have been an aberration though might if theyre going to win this game Louisville theyre going to win it playing to their strength which is the free throw line and pain points and for Georgia Tech they have to get to the line themselves on the road and continue to find Kelly he turns it over well you mentioned the free throw line in the win against Florida State last Saturday Louisville had 45 free throw attempts pretty good formula thats what Im thinking about here in the last 12 minutes Murphy in the passing Lane and see Georgia Tech theyre trying to shrink the court that means theyre making Louisville see multiple Defenders on the dribble Kelly kisses it off the window hes got 26 four off a career high another turnover by Louisville in points by Georgia Tech nobody stopped the ball you cant defend that you cant have a scouting report against the turnover and again Georgia Tech squeezing on the interior stur of it the other way and foul F by aor Applause Music Applause for Miles Kelly from the turnover a little hesitation nobody picked him up nice little big emphasis for both these teams its not just turnovers its live ball turnovers that really doomed Louisville Wednesday against Syracuse yeah their timely turnovers Kenny Payne talked about it today at shooter on if were up at 15 17 turnovers in this game I dont feel good about our chances right now theyre at 11 opponents are scoring 17 points a game against Louisville from their turnovers and thats the number one key to this game and whats interesting is Georgia Tech is last in the ACC in forcing turnovers they have the lowest steel rate in the ACC its just not something theyve done at a high level in conference yeah these have been mostly unforced turnovers by Louisville passes right to the defense or sloppy passes casual passes and when you look at the film tomorrow youll see that Georgia Tech didnt force a lot of turnovers out of those Applause 11 now Wednesday night against Syracuse Louisville shot 54 11 of 25 from three the bad 20 turnovers leading to 23 points off turnovers and Syracuse had a 336 edge in Fast Break Applause points Georgia Tech now extending defense just a little bit of two21 showing some pressure trying to see if they can get Louisville into another turnover and they go back to a Zone its a two3 Zone largest lead of the game for Georgia Tech Huntley half field pierces the Zone inside well you can post up against the Zone A lot of people dont think you can it does try to take away the big out of the game but Huntley Hatfield just parked right inside good look by Johnson hes got eight points seven rebounds Kelly with a chance for two more hes closing in on a career high watch Louisville attacked his own Tyler Johnson with a beautiful little bounce pass into the post you dont see a lot of guys feed the post today and Hunley had field had his man on his back he was near the restricted Arc that was easy but Damon stle knowing that Louisville is not a great threepoint shooting team the numbers in this game are two for 13 you may see him go back to the Zone on dead ball here Clark picked up his third Kelly with his seventh 20point game this Music season and hes a 273 off his career best its one of those deals right you see a guy go scoreless a score as good as Miles Kelly law of averages tell you hes going to make up for it the next time out the competitiveness in this young man is shining through in this game you know its been dong Dongo and and George as leading scorers nine of the last 13 games one of those two have been the leading scorer you just knew Miles Kelly was going to explode in a game Georgia Tech still in the zone its a sloughing manto Man actually looks like one of the Josh passner trick mirror zones does its a little bit of both its showing Zone they got theyre packed in could be a hybrid Zone meaning its a half a Zone a half a man by the way Josh pner did a fantastic job here at Georgia Tech to win the ACC tournament develop Moses Wright Jose Alvarado I know he in TV right now doing a great job in TV by the way yeah he cant take our job or my job but hes a guy who needs to be back in coaching he is great for the game and hes terrific for young men hes not only a coach but hes a a great Applause mentor Georgia Tech has been through some really good coaching Brian Gregory Josh passner Paul hwit Murphy had a couple of Threes in the first half stur of it to quad kicks it back out heres Kelly he has been the offense for Georgia Tech and we get a foul underneath and it looks like theyll get Sako and the defense for Louisville is starting to break down right now theyre going to say its Claude and that is four on Claude so claudes got four dong Gos on the bench with four you dont have danana you dont have Debo Coleman both injured if youre Damon statamire looks like Claude will stay in how long do you keep Dongo on the bench well it depends on two things the time of the game which theres plenty of time left but also the score as the score starts to pull away in terms of Georgia Tech favor you dont need it if Louisville makes a run they take a lead then you got to think about but as long as Georgia Tech has the lead you can keep him on the bench but therell be a point probably the 4minute TV timeout that I would put him back in regardless of the score and you mentioned free throws Theres an opportunity for Louisville one more foul by Georgia Tech Louisvilles in the double bonus the rest of the way and they attempt over 20 free throws per game big 15 plus tonight Louisville 17 of 20 at the line they just need to be solid Louisville stay in front of their man Kelly hits his sixth three hes got a careerhigh 31 when you think youre close enough to Miles Kelly get closer thats going to be the mentality of Louisville down the stretch cards cannot answer theyre now two of 14 from deep and theyve brought Curtis Williams back in to be a threepoint weapon but that shot has not been there and youre going to see Georgia Tech run some screening action for Miles Kelly tried to free him up stur of it over to Sako lines it up in and out and a foul on Louis they get Huntley Hatfield and for the Tennessee transfer thats his third watch Miles Kelly just off a simple handoff but the defense reacting late I think it was Mike James you got to be there when he catches the ball you hear so many times coaches say take away his airspace well you have to be body to body make him feel you when he shoots it hes had too many clean looks in this game a one and one for Claude Tech in the Applause bonus Claude has given him some active minutes tonight hes only 63 from the free throw line but if he can rebound defend and make his free throws thats a huge contribution to Georgia Music TCH and the further this margin grows the more time Damon STM has has to keep Dongo on the bench you dont have to rush him back in with the four Music fouls Georgia Tech back to the Zone theyre going to see if Louisville will start to settle for threes Tyler Johnson had eight in the first half does not have any in the second and there is Glenn freshman to freshman thats the future for Louisville beautiful pass by Johnson just Glenn coming underneath behind the zone Johnson with the assist Murphy Baseline Drive offensive rebound Second Chance heres Kelly the drive the feet inside Claud the tough turnaround offensive rebound Kelly to more hes up to 33 and Georgia Tech lead back to nine and and now we get a whistle go against the Zone look at Johnson Caleb Glenn underneath Johnson with the flash strong finish and thats good offensive execution by Louisville but they are breaking down and Nish defensively they are getting beat off the bounce theyre all helping and rotating a step behind theyre a little bit out of sorts on the defensive end they were terrific I thought in the first half half in the first eight or nine minutes of the second half a foul on the floor but that puts Louisville into the double bonus so two shots for Tyler Johnson well the good news for Louisville is not only getting to the line with the opportunity to score points but also they can set their defense its hard to get beat in defensive transition when youre shooting free throws Johnson 83 from the line tonight 830 Eastern the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the ACC highlights analysis of all the mens games look ahead they have the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week as well its right here on acc and thats a hardworking crew anchored by the great Kelsey rigs she is on the present everywhere Music Applause everywhere simple little cut by Georgia Tech Louisville is starting to react a little bit late defensively theyre not guarding the ball Balls getting in the paint that time it was a cut off the ball ball they bumped the cutter now theyre putting Georgia Tech to the line so the defense the concepts the focus starting to unravel right now for Louisville a one and one for Kelly only a 69 free throw shooter this year he was 90 a season Applause ago hes a young man whos has to carry Georgia Tech in most games this year here the Freshman have done a really good job Nathan George and Company but they need his points throughout the rest of the season if if theyre going to start to win some games get some momentum and continue to build the foundation this season 35 for Miles Kelly a career Music high James weaving through traffic and hell get two shots you wonder if miles ke K needs the Jordan rules here down the stretch in the last 8 minutes when he touches the basketball maybe a double team deny him the ball face guard him a box in one possibly not saying you got to play a junk defense you can still play manto man and faceu guard him make him go back door for layups take away his three theres somebody who also covers lacrosse you know what they call that in Lacrosse shut shut him off shut him off well in basketball they call it top blocking meaning you dont allly to allow a guy to come out from the corners or underneath off a screen you just make him cut to the basket youre almost giving him the back cut but youre taking away the three why are we talking about lacrosse right now just bringing it up as a different point of reference because you call it and youre great at it the season has started Music anyway going the other way with 747 to go in regulation Georgia Tech looking to get off the schneide Louisville looking for backto back ACC home Music wins Kelly this is not a game no its not and Dongo in the foul trouble hes been on the bench for most of this game and Nathan George has not been a factor offensively and Reeves has been ineffective as well 0 for four hes been on the bench most of the game but Ill tell you this about probably three of the six threes for Miles Kelly theyve been unassisted hes been pure Music tonight white launches rims out Glenn fights for the rebound knocked away it stays with Louisville whether Georgia Tech is in zone man or a switching sloughing manto man they are inviting Louisville to shoot the threepoint shot and if youre Louisville keep driving the ball keep getting into the paint youll get followed on the bump and go to the line dont settle dont get seduced by the defense letting you shoot it oh Johnson split the defense Glenn cleans up well Glenn Glenns been fantastic on the glass and thats what he did in high school Caleb Glenn they didnt run a lot of plays for him at lumir but he attacked the glass and he scored in the paint hes had the best game of his career 11 points 10 rebounds first career double double for Caleb Glen has a lot of promise for Louisville and Miles Kelly gives it up defense on that possession by Louisville little bit more intense a little bit more focused on Miles Kelly I mean it its got to be physical without committing unnecessary fouls James Applause Music hits a 70 run for a Louisville Mike James splashes from Applause three every year thousands of athletes disappear in clutch moments due to Fallen hydration levels theyve been told how you feel yourself doesnt matter then just like that theyre gone get yourself back in the game get yourself a Gatorade rehydrate replenish Music refuel a timely three three by the red short sophomore Mike James watch him run the Baseline a staggered screen defense is late and James is pure behind the line hes shooting 42 in ACC games behind the arc you can count on Mike James on both ends of the floor hes had his difficulty tonight C Miles Kelly remember he took that hard fall underneath in the first half and that three was just Louisvilles third of the game in 16 attempts Dongo enters with four fouls with six and a half to go kaasi Reeves and Nate George out there with Kelly and Carter Murphy and that one poked away out of bounds last touch Louisville and from the dead ball Louisville decided to pick up full court manto man what does that tell you they want to be more aggressive theyre trying to energize their own defense and it comes off the threepoint shot by Mike James Music you know offense energizes defense and defense energizes Music offense Kelly to a cutting Murphy Oh sky Clark just fell asleep everybody was watching Miles Kelly his man cut right to the basket and now you got to go on to the next play for Louisville you cant put your head down you cant Georgia Tech led by as many as nine in this half James and hell be fouled by Kelly Two Shots watch the breakdown by Louisville all eyes on Miles Kelly sky Clark helped didnt need a help Carter Murphy smart cut right to the basket beautiful pass by Music Kelly Mike James an 81 free throw shooter and the win against Florida State went to the line 19 Applause Music times and this guy just plays hard that thats what he does hes productive he plays hard hes become a threepoint shooter hes 80 from the free throw line and Conference play and thats where he scores about 30 of his points Mike James and he can be a defensive stopper and he needs to be in the last 5 and a Applause half seven to shoot Reeves blocked from behind Louisville can tie with a two take the lead with a three great white got beat then he came back with the chase down block great effort most of this crowd on its feet Johnson gives it up Damon statamire wants his team to push thats a moving screen by Carter Murphy Applause Trey white gets beat but he doesnt give up great chase down block that leads to transition Johnson going a little too fast a little too excited but you know where his heart is and in that last possession Carter Murphy with the moving screen great action down the Applause stretch Applause wide posting up Reeves Clark for the lead Glenn keeps it alive hes been everywhere on the glass Anish he had multiple double doubles in high school in fact he had one night where he had 17 rebounds in a Applause game shot clock at seven Clark drops it off for Glenn who could not handle the Music pass but a foul is called what I love about Louisville right now theyre not settling for threes and that is five on by Dongo so Dongo who had been Georgia Techs leading score in ACC play fouls out two points eight rebounds limited to just 15 minutes basically in foul trouble for most of this game he never got in a rhythm and and when you get foul trouble early in the game a lot of coaches like to sit guys with two its hard to sit in the first half then youre sitting at halftime then you come out the second half youre worried about your foul situation you dont play aggressive basketball you end up committing more fouls and its something you have to learn its just a freshman and you have to learn how to defend without committing fouls be aggressive without creating contact but hes a learner of the game staff loves him says hes very coachable tied at 62 Kelly down low and Claude shuffled his Applause feet Louisville was locked in on that possession not just on Miles Kelly but on the weak side they had a defensive lapse in the middle of the second half but the crowd is trying to help them on the defensive end its paying off Georgia Tech back to the Music zone Johnson down the lane off the window Glenn gives Louisville the Applause lead Again Louisville not settling for threes not looking for threes great way to attack the zone as penetration theyve been terrific George at the other end hes had some big shots rebound Tyler Johnson he pulls up glan almost had another rebound hes down slow to get back and George is bumped by Trey white theres an energy in this building that we havent seen in sometime it reminds you of what was and what could be and the cards looking to string backto back conference home WIS together for the first time in two years Georgia Tech looking for its first win at the Yum Center they havent won in Louisville since the early 90s back when the cards played at Freedom Applause Hall well Georgia Tech was in control of this game they were up nine with about 8 minutes to go Louisville on the defensive end got tighter got better but I attribute it to their offense not settling for shots falling into the threepoint shot but more than anything just attacking trying to get into the paint make the extra pass from here on out both teams will be in the double bonus Louisvilles got nine fouls of the next one by Louisville would be two free throws for Georgia Tech the rest of the way and now the advantage at the free throw line is telling Louisville 25 out of 28 Georgia Tech 13 of 15 and Nate George a 71 shooter at the strike air balls the front end hes going to live with that now the rest of the game but he did not play the first three games of the year for Georgia Tech but hes been great in the last 20 White open and Music hitch sturdivan unable to answer offensive rebound clad knocked away he wanted a foul and Kenny Payne wants to make sure they get a good Applause shot hutley Hatfield white Scoops it up the put back its an 182 Louisville run and the Cardinals with 223 have their biggest lead of the game this crowd has been standing for the last five or six minutes during the comeback penetration and kick Trey white deadly from the corner Trey white puts it up Huntley Hatfield right place right time and nich this is a team that is seven and 16 and the crowd is loud theyre vivacious and theyre giving their team energy on the defensive end and offensively theyre encouraging them its been wonderful to see is it a sellout no it feels like it but theres a lot of people here and that has not been the case for a large part of this season you and I have both been to this Arena plenty of times when this place is full and rocking and when the energy is there it is as great a homec court advantage as there in as there is in college basketball this is one of the Premier venues and when you have a Louisville basketball program that is at its apex and weve seen that we saw it under Denny clone we saw it under Rick patino theyve been through a lot since then there are very few places in the country that match the Young Center yeah we talked about it before the game this is a top 10 job meaning that Louisville eventually this program can get to a top 10 and right now theyre trying to win this game but was it the team that gave the crowd the energy or the the crowd giving the team the energy Im going to say it was 5050 because Louisville has played well in this game for most of the game and the crowd has appreciated the effort and theyve responded Lou three for eight from three in the second half 1 for 10 in the first 20 minutes plus 12 on free Music throws six Louisville players in double figures while Miles Kelly has been Hercules for Georgia Tech with a career high 35 but you know what the crowd loves the effort and the the effort has been I would call it an A minus by Louisville its been outstanding had a a few lapses and right now the crowd is trying to carry them home to a win stur it on the drive through the trees one1 defense thats been the Achilles Hill for Louisville this season what of these final two minutes come down to execution and turnovers you can talk about defense and thats important but you really have to execute and get a good look and not turn it over wild shot by Johnson Glenn has been Mr cleanup 15 points 13 rebounds for Caleb Glenn Sako for three KN back it comes to Huntley Hatfield ahead of the pack white and Louisville with its largest lead at nine they get Johnson with the foul and thats two shots for Georgia Tech you we talked about the lack of Defense by Georgia Tech and Louisville this season in the ACC well seems like Louisville took it personally in this game Johnson with the quick attack Caleb Glenn just a nose for the basketball and he cant grab it with two but he tips it with one and Huntley Hatfield the throw ahead Trey white has been terrific in the last 10 minutes in this game made a timely threepoint shot made a huge block Miles Kelly had been seven of eight from the line 35 points for him the most by a Georgia Tech player since Michael devau went for 37 against Georgia back in 2021 and devvo could really light it up for Geor attack the Lefty if he gets to 40 he the first Yellow Jacket dont say it send Kenny Anderson to hit the 40o mark back in 91 okay you want to be in that living room Kenny Anderson Miles Kelly Ill serve drinks and food to those Applause two Lethal Weapon three Clark trying to get it in and thats going to be a foul and if thats Claude that is five it is so now Claude has fouled out Dongo has fouled out danana is injured and there is not much interior size left for Georgia Tech no theyre basically playing with five perimeter players but Ill tell you what theyre coming off a blowout loss to Wake Forest Georgia Tech and Claude is down and theyve showed a lot of mental toughness and resiliency in this Applause game it also tells you a lot about Miles Kelly what you learned about him tonight had some rough games coming into tonight what did he do he didnt put his head down he didnt sulk he started to get hot then he kept shooting the rest of the game his teammates found him but he kept looking for his hes having a career night meanwhile for Damon St team their crunch time lineup tells you a lot no Nate George Dongo and Claude have fouled out no kaisey Reeves its Kari Kelly Sako Murphy and stur it and saying all that in Niche with the foul trouble injured players they were up nine with 8 minutes to go I mean they put everything they had into this game game Damon stomah told us the room for mistakes is not quite an inch wide they played hard tonight the 10point lead by Louisville the first double digit lead by any team tonight start of it the tough Runner Whits got the rebound stent commits the foul Music can it last well see but these last three games a win against Florida State a 9492 loss to Syracuse and showing some resiliency today against Georgia Tech I know Georgia Techs at the bottom of the ACC as well were seeing some fight from Louisville were seeing a team perhaps growing down the stretch and perhaps a team that can be a tough out over these these last few weeks they can be very dangerous because they can score the ball at a high level as the defense continues to clean up they become more capable of beating teams they look so much more connected on the offensive end you know Anish confidence and momentum are a dangerous thing in sport and when you have both you can beat anybody and you made the point earlier in the broadcast its not like this Louisville team is devoid of talent as Kelly does not hit Georgia Tech will not foul this team is loaded with top 100 players yeah former top 100 players that means guys that seven total top 100 players and when they play up to their ability and they play on the defensive enwood effort youre going to see more wins by Louisville down the stretch but Kenny pay said it in the Huddle before they left for shoot around today were going to win this game with our defense were not going to make it about offense they have done that holding Georgia Tech just about 65 points they were giving up Louisville 81 points a game I dont care who youre playing youre playing an ACC game and you hold a team to 15 points less than youre giving up you came to play Johnson one of six Louisville players in in double Figures its a 203 run for the Cardinals over this last 5 and 12 minute stretch Georgia Tech missed nine of its last 10 and lisal team that was down nine with a little more than 8 minutes to go in this half is now up 14 its been a collective effort Mike James made some timely shots in defensive plays Brandon Huntley hafi came up big in this game Kelly to shako thats bookkeeping and how about the play of Caleb Glenn I was just going to mention him Caleb Glenn was everywhere they didnt run a play for him in this game they did not he had double figure points and 13 rebounds maybe they ran One play but he was the Energizer for Louisville tonight for Glenn a careerhigh 15 points to go along with a career high 13 rebounds James dribbles out the clock and Louisville has won backto back ACC home games for the first time in two years they finished the game on a 215 run
