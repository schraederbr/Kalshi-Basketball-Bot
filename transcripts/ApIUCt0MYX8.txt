comfortably in that game so here we go number three North Carolina wins the opening tip and were Applause underway Elliot Kad running the point RJ Davis will take the first shot and a bit too strong he hit five threepoint shots against Wake Forest yesterday he got rolling he did he hit five of the eight North Carolina shot it extremely well in their first game here played where Jaylen Withers made Seven of his own 13 for the tar Hills but only eight of 22 yesterday over the top intended for lman batted around and Carolina will keep it our officials here Bert Smith AJ Desai and Lee Cassel for the first of our two semifinals tonight in Charlotte this matchup between Isaiah Evans and Drake Powell these two guys OB were team mates for team CP3 of the Nike ebl and now theyre playing against each other here in the ACC tournament in the greatest rivalry in college basketball the O calls a play Luben up to set a screen five to get off a shot hell back away and fire it and a lot of Rim but it wont drop and a whistle itll go the other way I believe theyre going to get Ben Allen Luben on the first foul trying to get to the offensive glass K malawat trying to keep him off and attracts that foul but when you consider now seon James tyres Proctor how the veterans have to step up in the absence of Cooper flag look for both these guys to be aggressive early every Duke fan in the world is saying the same thing I am fascinated to see how Duke looks without Cooper flag but Im not thrilled with it inside the first minute malat will lift the long one and a little too Applause Music Applause Music strong how on the Move shot clock at 15 for kdo trying to drop that pass down deep kdo on the Baseline another pass right back to little for the slam and is a small thing but a great job by Elliot cadoo with the pump to get the shot block and malat in the air dropping off the dime to then Allen Luben to finish it off Duke starting lineup James Proctor kiple who was marvelous yesterday Evans and malawat kiple coming off 28 Proctor little hesitation and it drops down expect to see tyes Proctor being very aggressive through this day one of the things when you look at the Duke backp in comparison to North Carolina the size allows to be able to get into the painted area and finish yeah he was Rusty yesterday two for 11 Davis fighting past Proctor lets see how much they let him play tonight on the bouns Luben whos had an excellent tournament lost the handle shock clock of factor now Withers little too strong rebound Tapped Out High another chance for North Carolina Davis wont Waits batted around again and back over to the Duke Blue D the pump fake a lost art as Elliot kdo gets amongst the tree of Kam malawat just a simple pump F gets him in the air allows him to drop it off Vin Allen Luan with the stuff quick lift for Proctor no too strong Withers is Charlotte Nao had a big first game in the tournament and tied up there great job by Applause kiple able to get the hand in there and the possession arrow in Dukes favor and Jaylen Withers being aggressive early but KH kiple up for the challenge does a great job moving his feet but more importantly getting both hands on the basketball forcing the tied up possession the arrow in the blue Devils favor got not fouling Duke looking for 30 win of the Season tonight as kiple Slams on the breaks Evans will toss one up there and hes fouled on the play and the active shooting a three big lift yesterday when Duke really needed it Evans scored 14 the bench the scouting report on Isaiah Evans absolutely has to be that he is going to shoot the basketball every time Elliot CAU stepping in and this is CAU a reckless close out in the NBA level however you have to give a shooter an opportunity to be able to land correctly that is a foul by sticking that left foot underneath Evans got to let him land hes saying yeah pass alvan letting Eliot cadell know you have to let him land you have to give him space to be able to get both feet on the floor cleanly that was a rule put in the game kawi Leonard versus the Golden State Warriors years ago in the playoffs someone came underneath them turned his ankle changed the entire trajectory of that series and both college basketball and the NBA have guarded that closely ever since you like the rule I absolutely love it I mean when you see think about what were talking about in this game Cooper flags not playing because of turning his ankle on someone and that was inadvertent so but you still have to give that person the opportunity to be able to land cleanly by the way looks like he is dying to take that warm up off and get in the game let me tell you right now he is struggling having to watch his brothers on the floor and over a top for Luben he had a couple of monster dunks yesterday and hes off to the races again tonight and Kad getting downhill making the focus to be able to draw the big man and find Benin Allen Luben the second time theyve done it so far in this game the nipple off the malat string gets double up almost lost it proor to fire around and out got a great look with Carolina to run tied at four in the early minutes F out for Kad he wont take it drives it instead kind of a wild shot but draws the foul Le Kad the sophomore on the move he had 10 assists against Notre Dame in the first game of the ACC tournament Ellen kadoo is letting it be known he is going to live in the paint throughout this game attacking on the dho if you try to go under the screen youre going to give him an opportunity to get into the lane drawing milaw and throwing it up for Vin Allen luin their second connection so far seon James with the personal his first T Hills really played great defense yesterday holding Wake Forest to 59 points in the quarterfinals its in fact the first time theyve held backto back opponents below 60 This Year OB Patrick gangba coming into the game for K malawat malawat played the first 10 minutes straight of the matchup yesterday before they brought Malik Brown into the game John Shire going to the bench early getting gungo on the floor the 611 freshman and mil watch the 72 freshman on the bench Malik Brown going to be over there coaching up his guys The Freshman big men competing today James a determined drive and takes a hit most importantly the second foul on Elliot Kad Carolinas seen this too often this year however they hold a onepoint lead ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by T roll price invest with confidence e e e e welcome back to Charlotte tar Hills with a onepoint Edge over Duke and as duke entered the arena today all eyes were on the presence of Cooper flag and while he did not participate in the shoot around with today it was reassuring to see him walking through the tunnel on his own especially in his own shoes so no Malik no Coupe before the Duke Brotherhood they said no worries as far as them with them off the floor they went 19 and two as far as their run coming into the second half in their previous game in the quarterfinals and six different players scored in that span I was speaking with Coach shy he said his teams heart their character and their competitiveness never waivers and he doesnt expect that to change today guys we look at the offensive rating offensive and defensive and net ranking as well when he is on and off the floor and it pops right away doesnt it how different they are defensively when hes not in there it really is Obi and we saw it yesterday when you consider the play before he got hurt he blocks a shot starts the break Isaiah Evans makes the first threepoint field goal for Duke in that game after starting 0 of 13 after that Cooper grabs a rebound and turns his ankle but hes on his way what he does because he rebounds so well defensively he also initiates their offense so theyre going to absolutely miss him offensively but defensively is where hell be missed the most set tremble in the game here for North Carolina two fouls as you pointed out for Kau thats been an ongoing issue in the first half hasnt it it absolutely has been in 30 this is the 35th game for the tar Hills this year 23 times now Elliot cadoo has picked up two fouls in the first half and early youre talking about still 15 minutes remaining where youre going to have to play with Elliot Kau being very passive on the defensive end your point guard off the back iron that one drop James following the Miss GLE trying to get involved with the blow by and it wont roll in rebound batted around and Davis has it North Carolina seeking their 19th ACC tournament Championship their first since 2016 trying to get into the championship game Davis will be a big reason why if they reach it his first bucket but you dont see anyone coming from the help side OB and we also have to mention no Malik Brown youre talking about the two best defenders for the Blue Devils so Duke will look different defensively without Cooper flag and Malik no one there to challenge RJ Davis at The Applause Rim dbba downstairs beautifully run and laid in by Proctor great cut great pass you see gungo with the ability to see over the the top offensively and deliver a strike to tyres procer off a nice Cut Hooper flag and when hes in there their chemistry is so tight man is free downstairs Washington will slam it in so to me thats one of the really interesting things how will that chemistry be affected it has to be I believe it will be but we saw a little bit of this when Cooper got poked in the eye in their last game at Cameron indor but when you consider having to play a full game in game planning without Cooper on a defensive end is where hell be missed and weve seen it on the last couple of possessions where the tar Hills have got easy buckets the nipple let it knocked away pull up pop Davis he cant knock it Applause down Roa will sling it back for kiple outside the three Carolina fans love the defensive effort but in the end Duke lines up with the basket and driven in by James thats a nice take by seon James more importantly using the pump fake get the shot blockers in the air and then the easy layup Im sure he will be in attack mode and youve got Washington and gunba getting tangled up the foul is going to go against GBA not allowing jayen Washington to be able to move even though GBA took the friendly fire to the face on that possession yeah watch to your left here you see the left arm of GBA grabbing Washington first and thats where the foul is called gunga took a pretty good shot too and the officials are going to go over and look at that John Shire has talked to AJ theide hes talked with Bert Smith about the fact that hey we understand that the foul is on gunba but the extracurricular afterwards needs to be looked at to see if theres anything to upgrade on Jayla Washington so watch this under review for possible flagrant theyre looking at that for possible flagrant I wouldnt be shocked if they came back and said that this was a flagrant foul the original foul was absolutely on gunga but once the whistle is blown you see the left arm come down from Jaylen Washington and hitting gangba in the head theres a strong possibility they will come away with a flagrant foul on this possession would not be stunned as Bert Smith AJ Desai Lee Cassell the officials tonight get a look at our first review hope youll join us tonight at 930 here from Charlotte itll be Louisville and Clems are two red hot teams and playing exceptional basketball go headtohead in our second semifinal now theyre getting a lengthy look at this Patrick gungo one of getting kind of poked in the eye too hes given shy some very valuable depth this season even in the quarterfinals he had seven points and 10 minutes and theyre going to switch positions now Lee Cel going to go over with Bert Smith to see the replay so that all three of the officials as AJ Desi goes over and speaks with Huber Davis what do you think this is a tiebreaker I think they all have to be on the same page theyll come together and decide what its going to be but just to set a precedence in this game early and of course the officials always have to control the game I believe you have to go flagrant one here just to make sure that it doesnt happen again not allowing players to feel like its okay to have extracurricular actions especially after the whistle blown so they gather and chat those three and Lee Cel one of the rising stars in officiating is going to come over and explain what they came up with here exactly 13 minutes to go here in the first half Duke and Carolina and the the terminology was wrong and again thats why I kept saying after the whistle blew so it wont be a flagrant one fou after review of the previous play we have a common file on number 21 white from duke and then its followed by a dead ball contact technical file on number 13 from North Carolina we will shoot two free throws and Duke will take the ball out on the end line but its because the whistle had already blown before jayen Washington dropped his arm and hit Patrick gum in the face so now that its its the action is over the whistles are already blown thats why its a dead ball contact technical foul in comparison to a flagrant one so Proctor with another one coming 75 at the Applause line really our first Duke Carolina moment of this semifinal six points for Proctor and what happens because its a dead ball technical foul the basketball now goes to Duke in comparison to the Carolina getting the basketball back after the technical foul The Possession changes even though the common foul was on gunba we had a clock on that all of that took about four minutes so now Hubert Davis is going crazy because apparently Patrick gumba just hit Jaya was in the face I dont know if there was Applause contact how trying to drive and kick Jacksons outside to Fire and too strong and ni will hit the deck for the second time so its getting Fast and Furious Caleb Foster of the game the 65 sophomore to get it downstairs and Washington went for the block but thats going to be go Applause tning so count that basket but heres the what bothered Hubert Davis thats a elbow to the face of jayen Washington right after a Deadfall technical foul and Hubert Davis sees Applause this and they are going to go over and take a look they absolutely have to go look at this to be able to see what happened there were going to come back we have a rivalry UNC Duke part three in OB were off to a fiery start here in Charlotte in the semifinals of the ACC tournament SP just a little bit e e e e Music the Cory already a couple of tone setting moments here in the first half Duke and Carolina they absolutely have been you see Patrick gumba swinging the elbows it does make contact with Jayla Washington but weve had a conversation with the officials theyve said that this is a normal basketball B play it absolutely would have been a cylinder foul had they blown the whistle at the time but because they did not theres nothing you can do it ends up being a basket for gangba off of the go of Washington but you see Jaylen Washington being tended to on the sideline more than a little blood has been spilled in this rivalry over the many decades heres Davis I believe we showed about five occasions in our tes correct yes and before the shot went down but no basket there there was a whistle and a foul now Obie what I will say is that throughout this tournament and you and I have seen it the officials have done a great job of allowing these teams to play very much you know allowing them to be physical but not dirty after the way this game is started I expect to see many more whistles as RJ Davis calls the timeout because the Blue Devils do a tremendous job defensively on the underneath out of bounds play well at least nobody got fou there it was timeout Music Music well Duke on top 149 1159 first half what it wins tonight what it will mean with a win tonight for Duke in North Carolina and North Carolina trying to get into the NCAA tournament right now Joey bracket says they are in I think that changes what they lost OB I believe they absolutely have to get to the championship and if not win it to be certain that they will be in the tournament because as weve seen with other teams in the similar scenario once theyve lost in the conference tournament they immediately drop often times from the last four end to the first four outs rocked a way downt but no he was very chilly yesterday he was over for five from three duke overcame that an impressive win without Cooper flag and without Malik Brown neither of whom can played tonight trying to slice inside Jackson one and Applause done Foster has been trying to find a roll for himself all season long after starting 15 games last year thats swatted Away by Luben and numbers for thear heels with Gillis down in the back court oh tiptoeing in and another goal tending and I believe they will look at this one later but right now is a goal tending its an play that they can go back and review you at the next dead ball as pal goes to the basket thats probably going to be taken off that looks like a good block as the ball is still going up gumba gets to it before it gets to the basket to the backboard I believe those two points most likely will come off at the next de certainly agree with you on Applause that zipped up top for Gillis and a whistle and a foul Mason Gillis the Purdue transfer very much a calming factor for this team and the foul will be on Seth Trimble his first Mason Gillis who is normally the substitute for coopa flag still in the role of coming off the bench with Isaiah Evans getting the start but hell be someone that John shy leans on heavily without coopa can nipple after to 28 yesterday getting a lot of attention on the spin Foster leaning inside it wont drop Duke with a board but on the line going back to yesterday the reason Cooper flag unable to play tonight this was nasty he was so high up and to come down on that ankle in a lot of pain he was in a wheelchair for a while on his way to have an xray the Xray was negative hes responded well to treatment but not going tonight theres the Slam by pow a beautiful find from Ben Allen Luben the nice cut by pal and North Carolina right now dominating points in the paint when you consider everything that theyve done has been in the painted area not really getting much going from the perimeter nipple catches fire hes got it a three on the money he makes 40 as mentioned Malik Brown is the second best defender after Cooper flag out with a shoulder injury tipped Away by Foster working on Davis to lay it in he had a couple of moments like that in the last game against Carolina he really did John shy recognizes Caleb Foster is from the state of North Carolina its important for him to be a part of this rivalry and hes come in and given him good minutes early tremble what a determined drive he laid it in and took the foul Seth tremble to the line and the family cheering him on Mom Lance in the building as shes watching her son trying to get a win over the Rival blue doubles Seth Trimble attacking K malawat able to go around malawat and get the bucket opportunity at the free throw line SE TR was eight of nine from the free throw line yesterday eight of his 10 points came from the free throw strike only one of six from the field cant connect on the foul shot but that was 63 against 72 weve seen an up a set this year it doesnt matter to him hell go up against anybody almost went into the stand here GRE May over here well he gets dapped up by Drake May along right beside us watching the game theres Drake hanging out watching many of his guys he was just in school with him last year wasnt he OB ago now a star for the New England Patriots what a bright future he has very popular guy in New England James will back it out seven to get off a shot here for Applause Duke James steady fires and itll go down he got it off in time for a threepointer how about the Veterans for the Blue Devils stepping up seon James Tyrese Proctor Caleb Foster the returners was something to prove here today after the Freshman carried them here to the semifinals picked off by Foster another theft Davis trying to chase him down heres Gillis malawat right back up and down it goes 245 and Duke getting a little separation OB John Shire is confident that that the Blue Devils without Cooper flag and Malik Brown still have more than enough to win the ACC Tournament Davis pushes off long one up there no Luben with the left hand that was a unbelievable rebound by Luben going over the 72 mile watch to grab it and then the presence to lay it up with the left hand not allowing the shot blocker to affect it Luen having as we mentioned an outstanding tournament backto back double doubles here in Charlotte Elliot kads got to be careful OB hes already playing with two GLE got a great look absolutely buried it and a smart play by Caleb fer to ATT attack kadoo knowing hes playing with those two fouls beats him off the bounce and delivers a strike to canle in the corner his mom who is an outstanding player herself kadoo big Drive rebound tip Luben again and he takes a foul with 710 to go willll take a break and Duke on top by 10 this is the way the Rivalry has gone over the years its been a bloody rivalry and much of the same tonight a lot of physical play and were just getting started Duke in Carolina once again e e e e e Music Music zoom in guys thank you very much 710 left first half ACC tournament semifinal in Charlotte Duke with a 27 17 lead no score change in fact they didnt really look at the goal t a few moments ago North Carolina the five seed Duke the number one seed weve got the best four teams in a semifinal dont we we absolutely do when you consider what the ACC has been this year these four teams have really cared the attention when you consider Clemson and Louisville both coming up next 18 and2 both teams and only Duke get 19 and one better than those two teams so it has been a topheavy League this year in the ACC and of course thear Hill is a national brand always going to be in the mix Clemson the only team in the regular season to knock off Duke we were there with Dicky V at Clemson Tigers played a great game and theyve just got better and better they are a handful remember they were an Elite 8 team last year so theyve been good for a long time7 wins now yeah Brad bros done a tremendous job as as Pat Kelce tough trying to figure out who the coach of the year was this year kle swish it in from threepoint land and hes at it again he has nine points and I can tell you who I voted for its the guy that won the ACC and had a 191 record and is putting in Patrick gumba wow in place of common Mal watching has develop GBA he didnt start the season playing OB he missed his entire senior year of high school with injury but the Blue Devils have developed him all season long for times as such and gumba standing the test with jayen Withers attacking him at The Rim possession Aro keeps it on this end as a jump ball out for kadoo knocked away was Steel by Evans seion James will run it Duke on top 319 and thatll go the other way a foul on Duke with 621 to go theyll get James for his second foul lets go to Angel guys I wish you could see the energy feel the energy of this Duke bench over here even though Cooper flag and Malik Brown are not participating Malik Brown using any healthy extremity to cheer on his team they have been on their feet the majority of the time on the bench and speaking to a couple of their teammates they talked about how this is indeed a Brotherhood they played like it so far today they really have Angel and you had so many different players step up we talked about the Freshman from yesterday Patrick gumba was three for three from the field as we watch RJ Davis get going along the Baseline but OB gangba has really stepped up on a defensive end and you can see how much work John Shire and his staff have done with gangba this was a weakness for him coming into dke but he has absolutely helped his team on a defensive end today and he should have had a block already they didnt give him emans out of the corner DBA nice job keeping that alive heres James and a bit too strong tell you what if Im the manager I find something a rope or something to tie Cooper flag to that bench man I dont want him on his feet but I dont think theres any way to stop it hey youre not stopping it from getting up and on his teammates he is far the Brotherhood hes excited to see his teammates playing so well especially his classmate Patrick gumba who was stepped up with malas getting in foul trouble stepped up big time especially on the defensive end of the floor Davis second Team all ACC James hounding him in the Music corner Carolina down nine here in the sem Final on the drive and the kick heres kadell yes a three needed that the first made threepoint field goal for the tar Hills in this game Obie after game one of the ACC tournament the tar Hills had made more threes in a fiveyear stretch than they have in the history of this story program finally made one their first and a big drive by GBA P this is his gift he is Elite offensively thats why John Shire recruited him fou lost the handle but right to Davis RJ at 17 points a game is had a tremendous career in North Carolina luans the open shooter but that didnt touch anything out it went and the Blue Devils will allow Luben to have all he can eat from Beyond the threepoint AR they want to keep him out the painted area if he want to shoot threes they will allow that to happen and feel like theyve done their job defensively Ben Allen luin is going to beat the blue that was from outside then hes just going to have to beat him Duke Blue Devils with Cooper flag most of the time leading the nation in scoring margin just really beating people up heres the shot going to be short by Foster got his own Miss right on the Baseline and good to continue to attack Elliot kadoo and a smart play by Caleb Foster you can tell that he was told from the side line when you get into the game go at kadoo hes trying to play with two fouls Caleb Foster attacks Kad picks up the third foul well watch the guys on the bench who cant play tonight but they are in it and in a big way it is Duke in Carolina 356 to go in the first half Music he e e e e ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal let our expertise round out yours gorgeous night here in Charlotte in a Queen City which has treated us tremendously well throughout the week championship game coming up tomorrow night Obie when you consider the Duke Blue Devils playing not only without Cooper flag and Malik Brown but also minus one coach we know Jay Lucas took the job at University of Miami to be their head coach so that left a lot more responsibility on the coaching staff had a conversation with Coach Emanuel dildy who made it very clear that a lot of what was going on and the their responsibilities that they had now fell on he and will Avery who was now responsible for the guards you see cayb Foster who didnt play in a matchup on big Monday that we have with the Blue Devils before they go to Carolina all of a sudden they go to North Carolina Caleb Foster is inserted into the lineup to the rotation and now Foster coming in playing a huge part here in the Blue Devils having success against their Eight Mile rival tar Hills in the ACC tournament they played only 5 and A2 minutes yesterday he had a very strange season for a a guy who really really relied on being in the lineup last year started 15 games it was a started earlier this season its been a struggle to find a role but and its been a constant communication between Caleb Foster and John Shire John shy was a starter his entire freshman year he came off the bench his entire sophomore year I asked John I said have you told Caleb he said of course weve done everything that we can to try to help Caleb low that we are going to need him as this season progresses and they have needed him here today shot clock inside 10 Tribble With A Little Fall Away no rebound was tapped and a whistle there as Gillis took a hit check out the bracket in the Big 12 this a 10point game in the semifinals in the ACC Withers just picked up the foul but BYU Houston in the semifinals right now and he ISP two and Texas Tech two seed in Arizona at 30 and weve got some more friendly fire in this game K malawat coming down with the right elbow now thats incidental contact I mean it hurts Vin Allen Luben is thinking to himself yeah its easy for you to say that over there with the suit and tie on however Vin Allen Luben taking that friendly fire in this one always dangerous when youre dealing with sevenfooters and their elbows are at forehead level for you yeah that sounds like youre speaking from experience my friend yeah Ive caught a couple of those more more so on the top of my head though Im not even at elbow level for seven Footers Jaylen Washington took that shot early and still remaining on the bench and a good save by Withers 3524 Applause Duke carolina8 and one in their last Applause nine Davis he beats Powell and short for the long jumper Proctor off to Gillis in transition though theyll get another chance but a great play by malawat tipping it out to his teammates getting a second chance opportunity proor taking on Davis chest to chest GIS and looking for the slam great adjustment Banks it in hes going to the line his first thought was he was going to slam that down but tremendous control of the body to make sure he got the basket I am with you 100 OB the big F was going to drop the hammer however when jayen Withers comes over to contest he knows hes not going to be able to get all the way to the rim but hes able to lay it softly off the glass of course the V reacting with excitement can we get a microphone on Cooper flag because I have a feeling itd be pretty good at this playbyplay thing I can tell you this OB CP talks quite a bit of trash Im not sure all of it is going to be able for us to air it yeah youre concerned that this is a family show I get it you can remember the technical foul at Boston College oh yeah 221 to go and a foul with Duke opening up a 37 24 lead and a personal will go against Duke and Isaiah Evans his first time for a one and one so Carolina heading to the line and one of the best fou Shooters in ACC history at the stripe RJ Davis 89 this years eight for eight yesterday in a quarterfinal win yeah this is how North Carolina survived yesterday at getsway course in that quarterfinal matchup they were 22 of 27 from the free throw strike they only shot 339 in that game and was still able to get a win because of how proficient they were at the free throw line and naturally he misses that Applause one Carolina only shot 34 yesterday thats a season low for them was it gritty win Proctor again spinning and kicking another offensive rebound by malawat and showing off the soft touch once again to put it back this is a N9 nothing run so Duke starting to look pretty darn comfortable how gets it up that wont drop kiple with the rebound and give Isaiah Evans credit for doing the job defensively thats the reason he didnt play much early in the year but he is locked in on the defensive end now trying to help his team get a win kiple banging with Jackson and bangs it in off the window for two and hell be headed to the line he has 11 the blue Dev was playing inspired basketball OB they love having Cooper flags as a teammate but they hate hearing its Cooper flag and the Duke Blue Devils Cooper is the first one to tell you no it is a team it is about the entire team and right now kka nipple come on malawat and the Blue Devils showing that they are a great team with or without HOA flag in the lineup 42 24 here in the Applause semifinal Tar Heels in need of a hot hand Davis blocked by Mal watch and another foul with a minute seven to go a smart play by tyres Proctor recognizing Drake pal trying to Trail the play as K malawat cleans up the mess denying that opportunity from RJ Davis at the rim and Proctor trying to get out on the break recognizing Drake pal trailing him just goes right into his forces pow to foul him and gets him to the free throw line North Carolina has missed their last five shots proor 75 had a good one against Carolina Chapel Hill with 16 points and he makes one of Applause Music two so four minutes without a point for North Carolina they have gone stone cold here in Applause Charlotte Davis trying to break free and lost it right back over to Duke go and you see how excited the Blue Devils are with the way they have defended in this game thear Hill shooting 37 and Caleb Foster getting after it defending RJ Davis forcing the turnover Foster Blowing by and lays it in man as he brought some energy 15 nothing to run Jackson trying to end it oh look at Evans hit the floor kiple two a tremendous effort here by Duke defensively but look at Isaiah Evans OB I have watched this young man play basketball ever since he was in the eighth grade I have never seen him do this defensively he comes in and helps but hes the first one to the floor knocks the ball loose KH kipple on the floor after the basketball and immediately all he wants to do is go congratulate Isaiah Evans for his defensive effort but the Duke banss in full throat here Duke has grabbed the game by the throw 3 second difference shot and game clock and air mailed and enough time to get off a decent shot here for canle 5 seconds before the break Pro to around the back off the fake fires around and out but Duke closing the first half on a Mega Run and they are on top 45 24 OB and theyre still playing like they sure are is scrapping for every loose ball James on the attack to the Baseline as we get started here in the second half in Charlotte and a lot of North Carolina fans in a bit of a State of Shock proor Airborne cant knock it down Davis went for the rebound and North Carolina Applause controls so Carolina trying to get up off the Music Applause Music mats gdau Zips the pass for Withers and too strong then Allen Luben and another block another rejection by malawat Withers will try again and misses again with Carolina will retain here and a new shot clock North Carolina getting anything they want on the interior theres another one now nine of 12 on layups and dunks but everything else has been a struggle only two May buckets outside of the painted area another delivery from Kad to Vin Allen Luben but Im not sure twos are going to be able to beat the Blue Devils kiple Big Time drive for another bucket especially when you cant stop the Blue Devils on the other end of the floor K canle showing that hes much more than just a shooter beautiful pass and pow up for the layup to make it 4728 thats really the only thing thats been successful for North Carolina offensively is throwing over the top and allowing their athletes to be able to go finish Duke has been able to defend pretty much everything else theyve done on the offensive end again Duke leading the nation in scoring margin they had 10 Conference wins this season of 25 points or more thats an alltime ACC record James off the hesitation beautifully done and smart play by James he gets Withers in the air witherss already playing with two fouls fortunate not to pick up one on that last possession Canó trying to operate off the dribble and a whistle with 1736 remaining and if youre not with us at the very beginning of the broadcast coer flag and Malik Brown out today thats all we know right now is theyre not playing in this game as youve mentioned and many have said its highly unlikely certainly the way theyre playing with these guys that they would have to play at all in a championship game maybe not even in the first round of the NCAA tournament you know I honestly when you consider playing them in the first round now you only have 48 hours to be able to turn around I believe and the Duke scene that were seeing without them is just good to beat pretty much anybody especially a 16 seed that theyre going to face in the first round of NCAA tournament I would absolutely look at not playing those guys until then proor well short malaj collects got to get a shot up though six to shoot never got to the iron alaat will take a long one and bury it from three and why not hes done everything else throughout this game why not knock down the three ball he took the three on the first possession of the game for Duke on the offensive end Im not sure John shy wanted that one but he absolutely loved to see him knock down to three at the end of the shot clock thats a no no no yes yes yes but again as you said the shot clock was winding down and Duke without two outstanding players and the man many believe is the best college player in the country on the bench still firing on many cylinders Luben picks up the rebound and there should be numbers for the blue for the tar Hills right now need to attack with malawat behind the play Luben asking for the ball does not get it Davis does for POW in the corner air mail that one and another whistle malat continues to make his mark on this game yeah common malat in all honestly OB in a normal year would be an option as a number one pick in the NBA draft but his buddy will be that but malawat showing that hes much more than a rim protector and a shot blocker showing that he has the touch from Beyond The Arc and has a strong performance here today his second foul as he goes to the bench Luben nice pass Withers to the other side of the iron for the Applause lay guys just a reminder that that is just malow watchs third three of the Season Cory you POS the question do we see Cooper flag at any point in this tournament going Beyond this game Co coach sh sorry a little tie up there Im going to give it back to o yeah scrap on the deck here and the officials will separate them with canle down on his back in the middle of it and hell be lifted up by his teammates John Shire coming over to make sure his team gets out of that nothing more comes from it well have more on Cooper flag when we come back here to Charlotte angel can you hear me yeah what Cory if you want to come back and have a question just about what youre seeing from the team Im just going to say what coach sh said postgame no say what coach sire said post game but then get into your point about the guards defensively okay thats fine me because yeah so so just go into that and then Ill tag that when you come back from it okay got you I got you e e e e ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal let our expertise round out yours back in Charlotte lets toss it to Angel guys coach Sher said in his postgame presser that this entire team will have to convince him that Cooper flag can go in this tournament but I think instead this team is showing why he doesnt and they think they can hold down the PT especially on the defensive end Coach Sher told me pregame that he believes that he has the best defensive back court in the league if not the country he said I had three different players on my team that I could have nominated for Defensive Player of the Year all eyes may have been on Cooper flag but by the committee and what we are seeing on display here tonight against the tar Hills they are literally making it very disruptive on every single play for the back court for the tar Hills they really are Angel and when you consider that the back court of the tar Hills is a combin three of 11 RJ Davis who was the ACC player of the year last season two of seven over three from Beyond a threepoint Arc and we have to remind you he had 23 points yesterday on a very efficient only nine field goal attempts so when you see the way that tyres Proctor seion James have locked in defensively but more importantly the ways that the younger players and Isaiah Evans Khan kiple have been able to follow their lead on the defensive end of the floor that truly shows you that the veterans have gotten their point across to the young players canle a freshman malat a freshman Isaiah Evans a freshman well hes a freshman whos been huge in this game and yet certainly not playing like it and thats one of the things and the old adage is once you get to this point youre no longer freshman and again and these guys have gotten so much experience you think about the big games that the Blue Devils played early in nonconference playing Kansas in Las Vegas of course playing Kentucky in Champions classic going to Arizona playing against alurn at home they had been tested and so now that is showing Applause up Kad with a good look to drain a triple and give North Carolina a little bit of light the second three made by Kad he has all the threepoint field goals for North Carolina Im not sure that that is by a plan but its going to be difficult for the tar Hills to win when Elliot Kad is your best threepoint shooter K kiple on the line on that sideline and weve got Clemson and Louisville which should be an absolute Dandy both of them ranked in the top 25 do you realize how long its been in the ACC since two teams ranked in the pole have battled each other it hasnt happened much this year 293 games I think it is so that should be a terrific matchup the tip is going to be up and in by Luben continues to have a really nice tournament and a little life from the tar Hills now still trailing 17 but I agree with you Obie Ben Allen Luben has absolutely been a spark as the Tar Hill faithful here at the Spectrum Center starting to try to find a way to give their God some energy Applause Music Applause roor back up top for gunba open shooter Foster and out it goes yeah thats a nice effort by Elliot Kad getting up there blocking the threepoint field goal attempt by cayb Foster Elliot kadoo playing with those three fouls but hes played inspired basketball here getting back on the floor in this second half and again hes going to have to get some help from his teammates the desperation has to set in that sense of urgency for the heels goodle got to get a shot in the air shot clock down to two as that clangs away Jaylen Washington back on the floor for the first time since taking that hit to go on the drive now will this be a goal tending does he get that on the glass yeah they are going to count it that is go tending one early we werent so sure about but see does it hit the glass first it does not and I believe theyll look at this one also gunba looking like hes got a good block on that one as well we didnt see if the ball was coming down or not but he does get to it before it hits the glass similar to the first one we saw Patrick Gumble but that one looks as though its coming down you can absolutely see that one being counted as a good basket the basketball is on its way down I believe this one will count for Elliot kadu and Tyrese Proctor with his second foul on the play 1354 lefts as they review the goal tending now Duke a marvelous first half despite Cooper flag on the bench and Malik Brown on the bench and just ran away and HD they were up 21 at the break against North Carolina and this their third meeting of the Season Duke winning the first two pretty comfortably and they continue to take a gander at the monitor now for todays experts at work brought to you by principal well its been about the defense of the Blue Devils everyone on a stram getting involved cayb Foster fighting over the screen denying R Daviss OPP unities and then of course being celebrated by his teammates Isaiah Evans getting on the floor K kle getting on the floor and more importantly the energy and the effort that the Blue Devils have brought into this building in his rivalry game has been a vexus amongst their teammates weve seen that level of Defense all season long by Duke you know and covering loose balls the 5050s the tremendous enthusiasm to play defense well OB Im wrong again this one is no goal tending even though it did look as though the ball was coming down on that one its no goal tending so kadoo will go to the free throw strike for two points and this will not be an opportunity for a threepoint play K the sophomore out of West Orange New Jersey playing with three fouls hell drop in the first one he makes 67 so much talk all season long about will the tar Hills be excluded from the NCAA tournament do they belong in the field cutting the lead to 15 now the tar Hills will go to their four court pressure this is how you have to attack if teams are going to press you its better if you can score early Advantage Basketball two onone KH kiple hooking up with Patrick gumber for the line that pops free and out of Play It Was tip 1337 Music Franklin in a second semi final Clemson and Louisville those are two of the hottest teams in the country about to go toe to toe pulled up by kadu well short and Gillis with the rebound you talk about the top three teams in the ACC all coming in on winning streaks and playing their best basketball late in the season Louisville 20 out of 21 pulled up by kiple and Applause short the heels need a long run trying to climb back in it and thatll go the other way on the foul an offensive and theyre going to get Washington for that one his second and we have you covered on selection Sun Monday once again it all starts at 6 with sports center on ESPN recently the guys look at the 68 followed by Bracketology with breakdowns of each region then at eight the womens bracket of 68 will be revealed Carolina on a run out Trimble with the slam and its been a much better start from an energy and effort standpoint in this second half for the tar Hills however going down 21 and halftime youre going to have to rely on some miscues from the blue lels to try to get back into this game James will go right to the 10 and lay it in and this a smart play whenever you have a two onone and this is something that you work on at the beginning of practice every day three on two two on one and the Blue Devils are executing to Perfection when they get those Advantage opportunities on the offensive end Washington as you mentioned back in the game set the screen Davis floats it in for two RJ Davis career has been filled with big moments 2676 points J Huber Davis backing off the pressure OB recognizing that Duke is prepared and scoring on the last two times they tried to pressure them P Court going to back off the pressure and see if they can get some stops in the half court Proctor and malawat ready to check back in for Duke and they turn it over tremble into the lane Banks it in and a whist as well and hold the phone for a moment here the tar Hills have come to life OB there are a number of tremendous athletes on the floor right now however Seth Trimble is the best one of them all and hes showing it off in transition as both these teams are getting up and down the floor and sep Trumble attacking Mason Gillis the concentration and the bank is still open SP late night in Charlotte e e e e back in Charlotte Dave ob Cory Alexander Angel gray with you wasnt that long ago it was 5228 since then Carolina a 15 to four run the tar Hills have found their energy here in the building and now theyre able to get out in transition 10 du turnovers have benefited the tar Hills however only five of 10 now six of 11 from the free throw strike Seth Trumble who was over three makes his first free throw of the game after going eight of nine last night Applause James right in front of his own bench heres Proctor keeps on dribbling and a great job by malawat to roll off it and a smart play by Proctor making sure he engaged the big man to give malawat enough time to get to the rim malat closing in on a double double into the paint picked off by Gillis now the 10 turnover for the tar Hills where each and every possession on the offensive end becomes extremely important trying to catch up to the blue doubles the nipple again man do they love to run that play those two are Batman and Robin they absolutely are and Superman is out hes cheering for him on the sideline but Batman and Robin are getting the job done for the blue do on the drive off the window Prett shot by RJ Davis who still uses the glass as well as anybody well North Carolinas found a rhythm on the offensive end OB they just cant get stops thats going to be the concern can they lock in defensively and find a way to keep the BL Devils from operating so well in their offensive end coming up on 10 minutes to go in Charlotte our first semifinal here in the ACC tournament kiple takes the pass leans in cant finish but hell be off to the line and hes the best foul shooter on the floor 92 set and a personal on Ian Jackson thatll be number two on a freshman for North Carolina and we have Clemson and Louisville still to come great crowd here tonight for game one were in Charlotte with the tar Hills and the Blue Devils there would be a great crowd anywhere if if you take this this matchup it doesnt matter where you go but here in the Queen City you absolutely have to expect a packed house for the ACC tournament semifinals have you spent a lot of time in Charlotte I retired here you did yeah with the Bobcats my last year in the NBA was in Charlotte so I spent a lot of time here I was actually saw Mugsy bogs yesterday the first time I ever went to play golf D Curry and Mugsy Bogues took me out to the links how did that go Id love to know well there were a lot of divots and the ball didnt go very far lets just say that Davis lost the dribble picked off and Duke collects it 6146 canle on the drive great defense there by North Carolina to get back and prevent an easy basket Trimble stumbles through the paint hell shovel that to Davis working around Gillis another floater but no this Applause time they going to get a foul as kiple attempted to race back into the paints a foul on North Carolina and on RJ Davis number one malawat will hit the bench and Patrick Gung back on now for for John shy John Shys got to be delighted with this effort he really has to be especially when you consider what the Blue Devils have been able to do defensively right now even with the surge in the second half the tar Hills still only shooting 42 four of 24 on everything outside of the restricted area d by handing off here for Proctor proor drives using the glass a sweet shot Elliot Kad is injured OB grabbing at that left arm going to try to shake it off and stay on the Applause floor taken on kiple oneonone and a whistle we are under 9 minutes left left here in the first semifinal two fouls now on Kon nipple The Freshman from Milwaukee youve got to give the Duke guards a tremendous amount of credit when you consider seon James Tyrese Proctor Khan kipple the way that these guys have manipulated the screen and roll action as Bert Smith is talking to Elliot kadu about the chirping thats going on between these two teams Drake p trying to be Peacemaker letting him know I got my guy Smith was saying stop it right now yes but when you consider that these guys lost their coach Jay Lucas is the point guards coach but you thought Kayla Foster in that mix as well not only what theyve done defensively but you see how these guys are playing pick and roll action and theyre engaging that big man and making last minute decisions on whether or not to throw the lob or to go on their on and finish weve seen great examples of both throughout this game I know Jay Lucas is watching in Sunny South Florida smiling seeing his guys go to Applause work so here in Charlotte thereve been a couple of potential roadblocks that could have tripped up Duke but it really hasnt another one now a slam by Applause gunba Duke fans loving it 6547 he has eight points pile nearly lost his footing very deep down for Luben in the basket and another bucket inside the restricted area 3 feet and within the tar Hills have been excellent they just havent been able to get much going from outside of that area and down 16 with less than 8 minutes remaining theyre going to have to find something from Beyond the three to try to chase down the blue dou Music proor knocked away and stolen by kdo hes got pow and hell lay it in and a foul Drake pow the Freshman going in strong its the only thing that the Blue Devils havent done well throughout this game is the turnovers 11 turnovers for the Blue Devils that have led to 14 points off turnovers for the guar Hills outside of that everything has been excellent especially when you consider the effort diving on the floor and the want two in this Music rivalry e e e e e do appreciate that very much Duke on top 6551 Cooper flag Malik Brown unable to play tonight because of injuries it hasnt mattered a whole lot but the timing for North Carolina in a game like this is still 741 to go and down now be 14 opportunity to make it 13 for Drake Powell here at the free throw line theres absolutely more than enough time for the tar Hills to get back into this one and see if they can come away with a win which of course would would be oh so necessary for the NCAA tournament chances they were down by as many as 24 tonight Carolina was and pow connecting give him nine points so 6552 piple leading the away for Duke with 15 James on the wing RJ Davis coming back on now in a moment here for North Carolina thats going to be four K thats number Applause four give you a look at our blind resume now and on your right 22 and 12 1 and 11 in Quad one Joe lard says last for in on your left last four buys at 20 and 13 and 5 and 10 in Quad 1 Im looking at that Im pretty sure its a sec team it could be Oklahoma could be Arkansas could be Vanderbilt in that spot team will draw the foul when you consider that theyve played 15 quad one opportunities and well go with Arkansas but you look at the net North Carolina with a higher net but you look at that quad one 5 and 10 versus quad ones I honestly believe OB with that 1 and 11 and again if the tar Hills dont win this game that becomes 1 and 12 I think its going to be difficult for the committee to allow a team with one in 12 record vers squad one into the tournament and how badly you lose can also be a factor cuz itll affect your efficiency rating yeah exactly and when you think about the way that the tar Hills have lost a number of their games you go back and you think of at Clemson and then of course at Duke earlier in the year those are the things that come into mind and you also have to remember that they dont take in account the last 10 games any more thats no longer part of the criteria well theyve rallied to cut the Gap a little bid under 7even minutes lben lost the handle on it picks it back up and scores again as he continues to play really good basketball here in Charlotte he really has been a bright spot 16 and seven for him backto back double doubles in the last two games and now down to 12 can the tar Hills get a stop malat turns cant lay it in follows his own Miss and it just came out of his hand and this is where trle has to continue to stay in attack mode slapped away from him with 624 to go this is the point in a game like this and you and I have covered Duke many times where they would rely on number two especially on the road thats where hes been best when the team is up against the wall theyve always had that one guy in Cooper flag that they can rely on to go get a bucket or make a play for one of his teammates lben Airborne almost made it caused the foul and theyre getting it down to vanen Allen Lu the 68 Jr every opportunity malawat with his third foul H Davis making a concerted effort to get VIN Allen lubben involved hes been the guy thats had success for the tar Hills throughout this game the leading score with 16 points seven of nine from the field and an opportunity to make this a 10point game 66 at the line for Luben and true on the first one gunga back on now for malaj for Duke but you got to think about the confidence that John Shire now has in gunba and Patrick gumba didnt really start playing until the initial injury of Malik Brown where he sprained his knee Midway through the season but has gained valuable experience throughout that time with the different injuries of Malik Brown and now a reliable part of the rotation dont look not but a 10point game 91 Run thats exactly what Shys looking at 6 minutes to go plenty of time for North Carolina here 6656 in the semi e e e Music Music e cant wait for this one Louisville and Clemson and of course the Ville on the Chucky heon shot at the buzzer advancing to the semifinal with that game winner Clemson 27 wins that is a School record they rallied late to beat SMU in another tight one thats our game coming up two against three in the semis two First Team all ACC guards going at it in a huge matchup between 18 and two ACC teams up next North Carolina has rallied to get it to 10 Evans with the oh up and over the top for gunba and the slam out of the Applause timeout so a quick strike for the Duke Blue Devils heres Davis good open drains it from threepoint land the tar Hills have made three threepoint fi goals in this game all three coming from Elliot kadu Obi it was only two weeks ago they were daring him to shoot the basketball against Florida State Kau stepping up and making big shots for the Tar Hill last time it had been under 10 was with four minutes to go in the first Applause half in side once again gunga real active offensively how about the a dozen points performance from gangba OB six of six from the field in this game hes perfect he was three for three in their matchup yesterday perfect nine of nine in the tournament Kido trying to use the screen under five minutes to play Trimble Airborne banking it no rebound up and in by Luben whos been everywhere in Charlotte its a ninepoint game OB its in single digits but the question continues to be asked can the Tar Heels get a stop Luben came into the tournament averaging eight points a game he has 20 tonight he had 17 the other day against Notre Dame Foster trying to get inside and deflected away off of Carolina great job defensively by RJ Davis Kay the Foster able to beat him off the dribble but reaching in getting a hand on the basketball 425 to go in for kiple quick shot well short heres tremble pass break and a foul too Applause the Tar Heels are kicking and a foul will go on C James number four as Trimble goes to the line for a threepoint Play Obie Im not sure who we watch in the first half but in the second half we have seen the North Carolina Tar Hills they push the basketball on makes or misses theyre always one of the best teams in transition and by doing so they found themselves now only down six as Shaman Williams the ACC tournament most outstanding player in 197 1997 looks on and encourages his troops sixpoint game four minutes to go kiple finds James on the drive leaning in and blocked Carolina wins it again smart play by RJ Dave was nothing there bring it out make sure you get a quality look tremble driving hard Scoops it up another foul North Carolina was down 24 theyre within six and headed to the foul line ESPNs exclusive presentation of of college basketball is presented by tro price invest with Applause confidence e e e e give you a look at tonights Dynamic play of the game brought to you by tro price a lot of Alle you dunks it absolutely has been the Blue Devils have been flying over top assisting on a number of Aly throughout the game there have been many different passers and many different recipients but of course the tapack the top of the head on your head celebration has been used often look at the flip though here in North Carolina 40 points since halftime theyre going to be at the foul line with a chance to make us a fiveo game you know you mentioned that all six of the assistant coaches of the coaching staff for North Carolina all went to North Carolina all played for North Carolina some under Dean Smith some under Roy Williams but all of these guys played for the University of North Carolina so you can only imagine what that conversation was like at halftime the effort that they saw in the first half against their rival I am absolutely certain that it was a heated discussion and Roy Williams who can only sit and watch now also played at North Carolina and probably wanted to be a part of that conversation OB tremble knocks down number one and another one coming I can guarantee there were a number of bbies thrown around at Halftime by Hubert Davis and the message was received as the tar Hills have an opportunity with Seth tro at the line to make this a fourpoint game he does exactly that 70 to 66 they were done 21 at the break proor with it now watch rolling again a pull up pop and itll roll in nice touch by Applause Proctor here is Applause 11 just about everybody on on their feet in the building here at the Spectrum Center tend to get off a shot now for Carolina Kad on the drive right by everybody Elliot kdo has been the star in the second half for the tar Hills missed the majority of it in foul trouble in the first half but hes been a catalyst here in the second Applause Proctor in traffic T to shoot now James James working on Davis Evans off the fake a three in the air he cant hit it PO with the save Carolina ball again down by four what a comeback for thear heels tonight in a semifinal Huber Davis calling out instructions what he wants on the offensive end understanding a huge possession right here they need to get the best possible shot they can get six on the shot clock pass got to pow slapped away and there is a whistle 152 to go theres two on the shot clock when the whistle was blown theyre going to get Isa Evans coming in slapping his former teammate Drake pow on the arm Hubert Davis animated on the sideline calling out instructions exactly what he wants to get to and great execution by the tar Hills to get Drake pal to the free throw line for Applause two well not many saw this coming North Carolina down by as many as 24 has come roaring back Powell at the line and a isir but Obie theres so much pride in this rivalry between both these schools you can only imagine the feeling in that Tar Hill locker room and trying to see which way and how they can find a way to get back into this game showing a tremendous amount of heart in this second half to make it a one possession game 7269 Duke well they turn to this man kiple fighting his way along with Powell Mal watch gets it off for Applause James high post once again malawat GLE was demanding the ball into to save it hes on the line he turns it over North Carolina has it 13 turnovers for the number one team of the country and its not important for the tar Hills now to go for a three and tie this game continue to get the best possible look you can they want to get Drake pow and Elliot kdo involved in screen and roll action kdo picked up the dribble Davis Evans on him got to get out of that corner coming up on a minute to go a ferocious comeback for the heels Powell lines up a long one he cant hit it bwas got up real high for that board still more than enough time for the tar Hills to play solid defense and get a Applause stop time out Duke takes it right here at 508 well go away for 30 seconds right back 7269 Duke Music so there there is a reset 7269 Duke North Carolina three timeouts remaining Duke is down to one Carolina with a foul to give and when you consider what has happened for the Blue Devils coming out of timeouts of course held a 24point lead at one point now North Carolina making seven of his last nine field goal attempts but most of the time when they come out of timeouts theres been someone getting downhill with the option to throw the lob or get to the rim and finish I expect to see John S bring KH kiple off of a screen with either seon James or tyres proor handling the basketball get it to KH canle his best free throw shooter trying to get him downhill and allow him to make the decision as to whether or not he would drop it off to the big or try to go to the basket get fouled or score a bucket Chile run for Duke without a point in the last 234 but for the longest time as duke had a giant lead it did not feel like a comeback night but thats exactly what its become coming up next our second semifinal Clemson and Louisville right here in Charlotte 508 seconds to go duke ball and kble to put it Applause in seion James to bring it across 10 on the shot clock poked away now five GLE drives it still on the Move cant finish it and theyre going to get the foul on malat Seth trimo coming in gets the rebound and it could have happened better for the tar Hills other than SE tro being down and from follow watch thats number four because now you have the opportunity to put points on the board and make it a onepoint game without any time going off the clock malawat coming in as tremell grabs the rebound but with only a two second Applause differential Mal watch on four as we mentioned two shots coming for Trimble in North Carolina but OB with only a two second differential now if sep trimbles able to make both free throws well regardless makes one does Hubert Davis have to foul here I dont think you can afford to play out the 30 seconds and Dukes going to do everything in their power to get it to canle anyway was just about automatically the line triple crimble drops in number one 7270 Evans will step off and Gillis on now for Duke but regardless of a made free throw or not youre going to have to get the basketball back you would hope for a make and most likely you foul you go for the steal if you dont get the steel you foul most likely kiple makes two but it still gives you an opportunity to get a three on the next possession triple 82 and sinks it 72 71 how about this with 32 seconds to go well you think about Duke and Carolina and all the great games and the incredible finishes North Carolina down 24 points in this game they are within one and at halftime as Im walking through the tunnel everyone says you got what you asked for well we now have exactly what we asked for this rivalry this match up the tar Hills coming back making a onepoint game OB 32 seconds remaining well see how Hubert Davis handles this I know they will go for a still most likely foul and get the basketball back still down one possession and have an opportunity to tie with a to be able to try to go on to the AC CC tournament Championship or possibly overtime here in Charlotte Duke has the possession arrow in their favor Carolina two timeouts and the Blue Devils down to one Dukas only lost one game in the ACC all year that was against Clemson on the road they certainly looked like they had this game in hand even without Cooper flag and Malik Brown but that gigantic lead its almost all Music gone and it would certainly be Cooper Flags time of the game if he had not sprained the ankle yesterday and unable to play here tonight 32 seconds to go 30 on the shot clock and this also could possibly be the last game for RJ Davis if they are unable to win this one and kiple and Powell got tied up in the whistle blown here without any time you dont mind that you dont mind OB because thats the foul to give that the Hills had so now that that foul is called a foul will be immediate free throws its a great play by Drake pal because any foul now will be immediate free throws but a one and one for the Blue Devils yep and nothing coming off the clock and no time coming off the clock officials are going to get together n Cel and and Bert Smith and AJ Desai and chatting with Hubert Applause Davis theyre just checking to see if seon James can run the floor so the officials doing a great job do run the Baseline the officials doing a great job converging to make sure and allowing seon James know that he still can run after the foul in for canle still with it got it free Proctor over to James now you want a foul now you have to with 217 Im a little shock they didnt foul Proctor once they got the basketball out of the hands of k k nipple but even still a one and one Hubert Davis likes his chances right now and Im sure they have planned what they want to do on two made free throws or one made free throw if he only makes one you want to have Elliot gdau attacking the basket seeing if he can get to the rim or seep Trimble as well if not you want to have RJ Davis is your guy lined up to take what could be the biggest three of his career to try to tie this game proor makes 75 too strong and ATT and a timeout Carolina takes one with 176 to go theyve got the basketball the shot clock is off obat understand the timeout I get it Hubert Davis wants to design what he wants to do but youve got Elliot kadoo the fastest guy on the court who has had success going downhill the entire second half with a head of steam with seion James back pedaling I think Im going to take my chances there with Kau getting to the basket simply because you have more than enough time to Bow if youre not successful and its a one andone again putting pressure on the Blue Devils well an amazing comeback here for North Carolina but a chance to grab the lead here in the final seconds and maybe shock the number one team in the country given what the score was its an absolute stunner to be here with 176 on the clock in a onepoint game amazing and it absolutely is and you would expect Huber Davis to try to find a way to get RJ Davis they look here it doesnt have to be a three youre only down one but you want to get RJ Davis the guy whos gotten you here in his fifth year an opportunity to give your team the lead tremble to put it in canle on him heres Applause K 10 seconds to play K gave up the dribble on the moving side lben and a whistle on the play with 41 and a foul on Applause Duke thatll go on Mala watch and thats Applause five and John trying to get his team over take full advantage of the 30 seconds before you have to check in a new player Vin Allen Luben who has been spectacular for the heels all night attacks the basket you see malawat leaning in to the foul great call along the Baseline by the officials as Cooper flag can only watch Vin Allen Luen with an opportunity to tie and then give his team a lead with 41 seconds remaining well hes had three terrific games in this tournament tonights been his best one talking about Luben but he had 17 points 10 rebounds against Notre Dame in game one against Wake Forest 13 rebounds and then tonight hes been better than that he he has gone off for 20 points he and this is the biggest moment of his career his career overall but especially in this one year at University of North Carolina an opportunity to tie and possibly give his team a lead here at the free throw strikes he has two shots 41 seconds to play and try to tie it here he cant do it he has another one coming Applause the Junior from Orlando with a second chance to tie it at Applause 72 oh no a whistle that wont oh no and North Carolina moving there in the lane dalen Withers tried to fake and was a lane violation Withers with the violation he moved and despite the make which would have tied it they wave it off that a critical mistake maybe seon James trying to get it in and getting a timeout with 4o one to go could not inbound it well take one more look Withers who is the hero in their first game when he hits seven threes makes a mistake in the lane there wither stepping over the line Im not sure if it he was trying to fake it or he was thrown off by the motion of his teammates free throw but a tough moment for a fifth year God to be in right now still enough time but youre going to have to foul immediately once the ball comes in bounds and then hope to be able to get an opportunity a good look on the other end of the floor but a costly mistake for a veteran player of the tar Hills now North Carolina still a timeout Duke looking to inbound with 41 on the clock and clinging to a onepoint advantage and what has turned into a rather incredible semifinal so James again had to get a timeout seconds ago as he couldnt get it in still looking and does get it into kiple thats exactly who they want to have the ball at 92 at the foul line 28 seconds left and hell be shooting a one and one he was 12 for 13 yesterday at the foul Lan KH canle the freshman and important to make both free throws because a heave and a miracle three which we have seen often times in this rivalry you go back to 1995 with Jeff cable doing it for the Blue Devils to send the game to overtime anything is possible in this rivalry so you want to be sure to make both free throws and they have reset the clock to 32 seconds and again Carolina does have a timeout left and if canle does make both free throws you could very well see John shy foul in the back court to avoid any attempt running toward the basket and kiple drains the first 7371 Dyer is going to put Patrick Dumba on the ball on a May free throw to try to disrupt he makes them both gumba on the ball try to disrupt any good look down the court threepoint lead Trimble getting a timeout immediately 25 left nice play by the tar Hills great thinking by Hubert Davis to get it into the front court and set up something to see if he can get RJ Davis a look to tie this game down three is there any doubt in your mind that maybe its not RJ its somebody else maybe he decoys the third leading scorer in ACC history the alltime leader in threepoint field goals made last years ACC player of the year theres no doubt in my mind thats what theyre going to try but also John Shire knows that so therefore theyre going to do everything that they possibly can to try to deny our J Davis an opportunity but you can never discount that there may be a foul but it has to be done strategically well to make sure you dont foul in the act of shooting because whomever catches it especially RJ Davis is going to be looking the fire as soon as he gets the basketball in his hands a dangerous spot to try to foul a three a shooter well how before they get into the act of shooting North Carolina needing a three to tie here at the last seconds and again they reset the clock so they pick up almost a half second more 29 now for North Carolina Duke will put gunga on the ball once again to try to disrupt a good pass the tallest guy they have on the Applause floor looking to get it in heres the shot that his fires off of the rim and thats the ball game two kangs on they win at 7471 and move on to the championship game
