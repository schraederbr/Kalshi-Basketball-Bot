Jim Lena 40th years ah head coach overall is 13th at Miami and his hurricanes will start with the basketball Jamie lucky Tim clockery AJ desire officials Miami in the black Syracuse and the home whites it is an orange out it typically is but its specifically an orange out here in the dome where the Hurricanes off a 29 and8 season control first and they get an easy touch for noo want to start that as a twopoint per game scorer has the games first two and you see right away with Malik Brown hedging so high they have to have that rotation Come From The Bottom thats something Syracuse and Miami both need to have tonight Syracuse is starting five Starling Judah mince is their top score Brown has been terrific this season getting to start with nem McLoud out for the year along with Justin Taylor and Chris Bell through to Min the oranges leading score at 18 and a half per game controls the leading scores in the ACC will lean in with a second to shoot and his Miss shot cleaned up by wga popler and we have an injured Miami player here as popper got the rebound and appears to have been hit up high look at the full hurricane starting five Pat Cleveland popper George and noo and heres what happened to wga Music popper maybe hes got hit with his own hand on the way down that happens it it happens sometimes in the game that would be one of the more bizarre injuries weve seen a selfinflicted facial injury poppler will tow it off it can itll afford any more injuries right now up Miami without o it is already a team that gets almost no production from their bench yeah only playing six or seven guys they need everyone they can get hurricanes off a loss against Florida State on Wednesday 8475 and working inside of noo again how about this start Michael noo The Freshman from Toronto the first two baskets and youre going to see it all game from both teams theyre going to try to get downhill you see Cleveland with the steel and Cleveland a little bit of an odd delivery midair ends up banking it in off the back of the rim and Miami starts three for three these two teams are similar as far as their style of play wanting to get downhill but two things theyre going to have to do is contain the guards and be able to take care of the basketball two teams that play at a high Tempo Miami and Syracuse that Balls thrown away by Bell another turnover and then mince will take it back and get bumped in the back by Wugga poppler for the games first foul but it is a sloppy start with the ball couple of turnovers so far for Syracuse yeah you see right here theyre trying to play up the short roll Miami does a great job of hedging hard the short roll should be open but Miami did a good job job of rotating from the backside and getting there thats just something that these Syracuse guards are going to have to notice where does Syracuse most Excel on offense they getting downhill theyre I mean again Miami and Syracuse are similar as far as their style of play they really Excel getting downhill obviously Judah get to the free throw line and JJ get to the paint but what really helps them and separates them is when they can get their perimeter Shooters going and that helps space the floor and helps those guys like JJ and Judah get downhill Le Crow pokes it away off the Miss three by Chris Bell 19 to shoot for Miami Hurricanes the second highest scoring team in the ACC 832 points per game and the fifth most efficient offense in the conference very good Shooters very good from three and they will struggle with turnovers heres George a deep one is Off the Mark for Kean georgeon cleaned up by the yards leading rebounder Malik Brown heres Brown off the feed for mince lays it in and they can finally take their seats here in the dome and Kevin we talked about that short rle Miami does a great job of hedging hard their defense is high up so that leaves the rim to be open a lot Syracuse has to be able to take advantage of that throughout the game Brown now 70 for 99 71 field goal percentage on the Year Nigel pack with a little step back too 1499 Career Point score the fourth year Junior pack gets on the hes a guy who leads this Miami team as he goes the Miami team go there is Starling and thats a pleasant sign for Syracuse aete a couple of Threes that P on Tuesday JJ Starling is at a tough years shooting from three only 26 with a confident Music start on the ball right now at pack freshman George right in front of the very active Adrien ay first gear Syracuse coach bring mnam to his right on the drive heres wga popper dud is are very capable Defender but a lot of times he plays Olay defense and lets his Defender go right by hes a guy who needs to be able to stay in front and keep those guys doesnt put so much pressure on his bigs Miami starts at five for six Taylor off the shot fake Blows By George rattles out at two and starlings able to keep the ball in bounds heres a three for Malik Brown which is red probably not the best shot that they wanted but you know what its good to see Justin Taylor getting opportunities and looking for his own early on popper misses a three heres Bell and popper bumps him in front of the bench thats a second foul against wga popler for an already thin Miami team foul issues early but Michael noo in his first career start with a couple of buckets JJ Sterling a Syracuse answer game had had many health conditions and health issues during his life but had such a deep love for Syracuse basketball was enrolled to the University School of Education Jamesville dit graduate very close with Buddy baheim Joe Gerard former Syracuse players very close with this current team the funeral held yesterday and a whole lot of Syracuse coaches players and administrators when we want to send our love and condolences to the family and talking to folks around the program Liam was such a bright light not for this team but in this community in general so our best wishes and love to all of Liams friends and family Syracuse plays with a heavy heart on this Saturday afternoon and the Syracuse managers just overall mean a lot to the Syracuse basketball program and we know how much they do so again sending our condolences to the friends and family had practice yesterday I think there were 20 Syracuse managers there like seven more managers and there arent players on this staff at all times and then if theres a wet spot youre going to see all 20 of them right there on the floor getting it ready to go so its they mean a lot to the Syracuse basketball program theres just a handful of them down on the end of the bench so Miami with a 105 lead they take wga poppler out of the game he picked up his second foul going to break but here Copelands on the floor for Syracuse hes missed a couple of shots already fighting to get his own rebound back and then a foul AJ Caseys Off the Bench for Miami and Casey 69 sophomore in there with George foul is charged to kesan George and for Syracuse we know they excel at getting to the bucket getting to the paint but we have to see some of those perimeter shots knocked down so you can open up some of those driving lanes and make it a little bit easier for these guys get into the rim is two for eight to start that ball deflected with 14 to shoot penley Josephs on the floor for Miami for the first time time his first game Off the Bench this season Casey replac loo at popper Judah minz taking a seat for Copeland early for Syracuse here is the hyperactive guard Copeland looking to get his shot up again at the expiration of the timer fighting for another offensive rebound Josephs on the deck in a Copeland Taylor sandwich and the possession arrow will stay with Syracuse and you like the energy for young players a lot of times they see the first opportunity its open they dont take it and then they go into the second opportunity and makes it a harder shot and that was the case right there for Copeland but Copeland you know over the last six seven games hes playing extremely extremely good basketball and not only is he a Swiss army knife he his energy just impacts this team at a whole different level turnover is an issue of points but talking to Adrien autrey feels like the last few weeks theyve gotten some of the crazier plays out of his system quader Copeland Benny Williams checks in the game now found a real connection with Copeland Off the Bench and Judah Min returns to the floor Bell off the shot fake round it out for two and Miami finally clears it with a junior benley Joseph theres that high hedge from Brown Step In by George and an offensive foul as he hit mince in the face thats two fouls on kesan George so two starters with two fouls already for Miami I dont know Kev I mean it was it just looked like he was getting by it was inadvertent it wasnt anything on purpose but I guess bad luck for George and this play is going to be reviewed at the monitor by Jamie lucky and the officials because of the elbow up high officials will typically review a play even if it seems inadvertent with an elbow to the face does this meet the definition of flagrant or is this a normal basketball move I dont think theres much there Kev having played it happens all the time I I just tell you that and I dont think it was inadvertent but I mean how they calling the game now I guess its something that you just have to look at questions for flagrant is it excessive Andor unnecessary is it a legitimate play on the ball and this is going to be a common foul clean up quickly and George is 68 and mince is 6 foot so that he was already at that level where so nothing malicious by George at all clean up quickly by this veteran officiating crew you deal with these officials much in your time Jamie Tim and AJ you know what I Id like to say I did deal with them no it wasnt no wasnt inverting yeah Jamie L giving us information exactly it it happens when when youre playing basketball did any of these officials tee you up is what I want I Ive had a few tees in my day Kevin I have i you know what I wasnt the quietest guy on the court when I used to play I used to I used to talk a little bit so is that right it is heres Williams getting positioned inside Benny Williams on his first shot sticks it a layup good to see Benny Williams hes had a lot of ups and downs this year but when hes engaged and locked in and comfortable he makes a big time impact for this team Miami working on a scoring drought of nearly three minutes as brown deflects it from Casey youve got Christian Watson who did not play last game on the floor for George this is an odd Hurricanes lineup as Pat misses a three and its punched in the air to Judah minz surveying the floor the Syracuse sophomore into Brown from Williams heres a three for Bell thats good Syracuse ties it on a Chris Bell triple Ill tell you what if s can have that guy right there Chris Bell come to play theyre a whole different team just spacing the floor out and talking about those driving Lanes just getting a little bit bigger for Judah and JJ and the guys get to the basket and then Kev speaking sorry speaking on oms absence for a second its just going to put a lot of more pressure on these guards pack Bentley Cleveland to really be able to score the basketball Matthew Cleveland misses a three again if youre just joining us North Channel Mir out with a lower extremity in iny which he suffered during the week Miamis leading score and rebounder not available today up ahead Watson gets the leak out Christian Watson cannot finish the layup blew it right at the 10 with mince behind Copeland bell comes flying in and Cleveland clears for Miami Cleveland and pack the two scores in the lineup right now and Matthew Cleveland takes it strong to snap a four plus minute scoring Tria Kev I really like this guy uh Matthew Cleveland I think hes just a NBA type of player three LEL scorer hes improved as a jump shooter as his career has you know got uh prolonged but hes a guy that can really uh make an impact right now and I think at the next level as well talked to Bill Courtney their associate head coach before the game he said he pleasantly surprised by Clevelands decision making this year first year over from Florida State its been a big lift for them with the shot clock of three mince is fouled on it by Joseph the fifth Miami foul and Judah mince will shoot three when we return to the Dome an early lead but some major early foul trouble for Miami she found it the feeling of finding the psoriasis treatment just brimming with Talent make their move number 10 LSU number one and undefeated South Carolina Thursday at 8 on Music ESPN Miami has the lead for now right before went to break Jud mins fouled shooting a three by benley Joseph who got him right on the hand in the act of shooting and that puts Judah Min to the place that hes very comfortable at top 10 of the country and free throw makes and free throw attempts and just as a head coach following the threepoint shooter especially a guy whos really not a threepoint shooter is going to kill you and and Joseph hes still out there but uh you know another one of those is obviously get him on the bench Scouting Report Kev Scouting Report its not a great threepoint shooting team as a whole minz has improved this year but the orange third worst threepoint shooting team of the ACC 33 though they did shoot it well Tuesday at pit they were 10 for 17 had seven players make a three in that game its the first time Syracuse had done that since 2011 against Colgate M here goes two for three yeah when Syracuse can have bell and Justin Taylor contribute on the perimeter and make shots theyre a whole different team so Miami without toppler with the two fouls George is off the floor with the two fouls they get it inside to naoko the freshman in his first career start has points hello noo thats what youre here to do just be around the rim drop offs bang it home he had not scored since December 6th until he had two points on Wednesdays three for three in the first 9 Minutes up top he somehow sees Brown through the trees that last dunk by nooka was an athletic powerful dunk that was just a hes taking advantage of his minutes Christian Watson a spot up three Off the Mark grabbed by mince Miami 0 for five from three there seven for eight from two BR looking for Kyle cuff cans transfer in the game for the first time out of bounds off Miami with 19 to shoot and Kev you know what advantage Syracuse does have is theyre playing Miami is hedging hard now theyre getting that short roll with Malik Brown and its making noo come out from the rim a little bit further than wants to I think Malik Brown has that Advantage right there you know getting by and get to the rim Adrian ay told us the practice yesterday you can run anything through Malik Brown offensively hes one of those special centers and here he finds bance cuff lost it on the way up chance for an assist but out of bounds last Touch by cuff in a Syracuse turnover I just think Malik Brown is an NBA Talent hes a guy that can provide a lot of different things on the court and I think at that next level you always need a guy like that who can do a Applause lot pck and Joseph running the show Cleveland Watson and noo and no Nord shadir with a lower extremity injury Joseph nearly traveled finds Cleveland another rebound for Judah Min is fourth coming off a career high nine on Tuesday Williams Syracuse is five for 15 in the first half of the half Mi pulls up and gives the orange its first lead great patience just holding him on his hip waiting to see the read whats open knocks down the open pull up brown called for Syracuses first foul on the swipe from behind Im looking at nooku and hes this is the most hes played in a while Kev hes hes a little Gass but hes hes earning his minutes today right now hes definitely earning 79 minutes per game this season hes already played six hes a very good recruit in Nook hes a fourstar recruit out of prolific prep which is a terrific program played with Aiden Holloway at Auburn E Mei at Baylor Trey Green at Xavier and hes been thrown into the fire today his first career start with omir out a lot of dribbling by Christian Watson Copeland All Over p from way outside no and Syracuse has been a little better than it typically is on the defensive glass as Starling emerges from the freay great individual defense on that possession M surrounding out heres Cleveland taking the ball all the way down the floor Matthew Cleveland finishes at the rim and hes got six to tie the game that was a tough finish we talked about him being a three LEL scorer there you see him getting all the way to the cup and then he defends starling well as Joseph runs the other way for Miami Cleveland off the bounce off a tough game against his old team Florida State on Wednesday Matthew Cleveland leading all scores with eight leading to an Adrien Entre timeout 302 timeout with Miami back on top despite being shorthanded at the Dome has your adviser created a portfolio based only on your age and risk tolerance this year they returned a lot of good pieces from a 298 final four team a season ago but they are without one major piece today North Shadow Mir started all 17 games leads the canes in scoring 172 a game one of the best rebounders in college basketball 96 a game its being dubbed a lower extremity injury that happened earlier in the week how are they coping so far without him you know I think noo is doing a great job coming in and take advantage of his opportunity like we said in the post in the pregame it comes down to containing the guards and how are they going to play defensively yeah offensively it puts a lot more pressure on the guards but I think these Miami guards are used to you know carrying a lot of the load on the offensive end only 12th out of 15 defensive efficiency in the ACC but right now theyre holding Syracuse to 6 for 18 shooting with three turnovers M trying to back down benley Joseph a terrific Defender and mince finishes strong over him to Min with his second made field goal I guess you dont typically see a sixfoot guard going into the mid post and and working on his post game but you know Jude is a guy whos super crafty has great feet and he knows how to get out of situations and and you know get that open shot theres pack penetrating Christan Watson and a foul go against Kyle cuff be a two shot foul for Watson when we return all squared away between 2 12 12 and five teams at the Dome Im fuie Im like 7 Bouie the allnew 7 deal lovers menu at Pizza Hut choose your 7 faves 7 days a week because its only a deal if you love it no one out pizzas the Hut Im a guy who lost a bet last season Miami made its first final four and this season they are not even in the final four teams out of the field according to Joel lardy theyre are next four out right now the net is 62 only one quadrant one win at the moment they have losses in Quad three and quad 4 including a a pretty brutal home loss to Louisville a couple of weeks ago so Miami you figure a lot of the players returned from last years final four team maybe theyre going to be a contender again Isaiah Wong Jordan Miller Big losses though theyve been a little bit banged up and pack and popper missing some games and it just hasnt been the same Elixir right now for Jim Lona well you said it I think guys have been injured they havent had the chemistry that they thought they would have you know going into the season you know guys havent been practicing like they thought they would so it takes a while for guys to figure out their roles get comfortable with each other and and and develop that chemistry but Kev can you tell me a little bit more about the quadrant stuff Im not Im not well versed on it I I dont really know too much about it quad went one quad two were actually going to give you a pop quad quiz at halftime okay great thats I need that actually this would probably be a quadrant one with Miami in the long run because itll be a road wi against the top 75 team you figure if Syracuse ends up in the top 75 of the net and right now theyre 76 it would be a very good one lets lets put it that one but if Syracuse loses it could go down to a exactly okay Syracuse beef hit Tuesday in the road was a quad one win and then Wednesday morning hit net had dropped so far was a quad two win just win baby basically yeah thats it its a lot of different factors that go into it I guess yeah Miami throws it away for Cleveland our first ESPN big Monday double header the season coming in a couple of days and we start in the ACC where North Carolina is still rolling undefeated top of the ACC RJ Davis in the heels against a good week forest team then number three in action Kansas hosting new Big 12 member cincin starts at 7 Eastern on ESPN and the ESPN app hurricanes with twoo lead without Nord Shadow Mir here in the dome Orga popper has barely played in the first half Kean George same thing both with two fouls so in that respect Jim Lena has to be very pleased JJ star with his second three thats a great great shot by JJ and you know what they have to do on That Elbow set they have to do a better job of going and really going hard into that down screen now they got the slip and also they got the guy coming off into that threepoint shot second straight game with two threes for Sterling Joseph in all kinds of trouble in the lane we have a tie up Miami with the arrow with eight to shoot so far in half court Miami is really struggle getting downhill I think Syracuse is doing a great job of being there on the boxes and elbows and being in help and then individually theyre doing a good job of staying in front of their guys right now Tim L has not made a substitution in 5 minutes he is rolled with this unusual lineup fronted by pack who buries it from three Nigel pack surpassing the 1500 career point mark with a deep one and when you have 1500 points in your career that means one thing you can score the basketball and we all know that n back can do that snaps an 0 for six start from three for Miami Vince misses and here comes Cleveland whos with a oneman fast break show of points he sets up Watson Christian Watson with four points off the bench and Miami getting some unexpected contributions this is where Miami excels at and both of these teams want to be able to play up and down and get out in transition less decisions to make pass it ahead and get to the rim Miami does a great job of getting out and just throws it away an unforced ER over the head of Taylor Syracuse turns it over for the fifth time just being simple with the basketball make make the right play you know you dont have to overdo it if its not there kick it out reset it and get it going again with 10 nothing Edge at fast break points 188 points of the paint right now pack again off the screen from noo couldnt convert from three Miami without omir still does not have an offensive rebound and star nearly had his third three I love the aggression I love when he sees it and its open take it CL sensing the mismatch with bell HS the dribble alive gets around Chris Bell and scores it great job of proven just keeping the ball alive not picking up his dribble wait until something opens up hes a guy hes another guy who can score on all three levels 7even nothing Miami run its been a stagnant start offensively for Syracuse Bell CLI penetrating Bell catch and shoot left to short and heres Joseph on the run again T might have gotten away with a travel Applause there theres benley Joseph attacking the lane Joseph gets to the off hand and Adrien arre will use his second first half timeout nine in a row for Miami which is six for its last seven from the field his shorthanded hurricanes attacking the paint in Syracuse a big game for Miami they lead by eight still dominated the paint yeah you see Miami getting out and exceling in transition they play best when theyre in space Nigel pack proven waiting for the right opportunity to get to the basket and you see Bentley just getting down hill and having a strong finish they excel at those things getting out in transition and getting downhill to the basket 22 of 29 Points in the paint right now for the Hurricanes outside the paint not so good one for eight from three 11 for 14 inside it Adrien arri used a couple of timeouts and Miami on a N9 nothing run looking for what would be borderline quad one quad two one the dome for team that Goldy has in the next four out just Taylor back on the floor for Syracuse Starling feeds Bell bit of a high catch couldnt pull it down and shoot it deep in the shot clock again for the Ys its Starling a hard screen by Brown Freda and then three hurricanes including Watson going for the rebound and heres Joseph again pushing Tempo pack dragging in behind and he couldnt convert rare Miss near the rib for Miami Syracuse needs to get play Up Tempo a little bit more too get easier shot there it is semi transition you see Bell hitting open sh but Miami is doing a great job of pushing Syracuse away from the rim being there on the catch and making them play tough shots second three for Bell snap set 9 nothing hurricane run change LED by Cleveland with h Taylor fronting him right now a foul Mal Brown was reaching in from behind and Malik Brown just picked up his second foul I I dont know Kev CH are you disagreeing with an official its my second time today well red H is going to leave Brown in with the two fouls remember Syracuse does not have nem McLoud they normal starting center is out for the year with foot surgery Brown has played the whole game and brown takes it away right here Syracuse goes to their typical two three out of bound out of out of bounds its nice to feel a little bit like its still all time two3 in the dome its still there they still got a little bit of that manto man defense has been exceptional but Syracuses best defensive team in quite a few years first year manto man under Adrien ay pack getting around mince into the paint Nigel pack leades a short rebound for de copelan can he run for Syracuse without numbers Scoops it to great extra Starling yes that a great extra pass by Chris Bell great job by Copeland pushing it down creating that opportunity for the extra pass backto back threes for the orange and its Copeland leading the break and then this pass you love the extra feet so much T by Bell love the extra feed and when JJ Starling is hitting jump shots his confidence is on another Music level JJ Starling had some knee injuries last year and a pretty debilitating shoulder injury was at Notre Dame hes admitted it really hurt his mechanics it threw his shot out of whack he started the season one for 18 from three you include the three today hes 15 out of 37 sense if we do some quick math which I know youre a fan of quick math I love math its 41 sense hes looking like the McDonalds all americ he was out of high school and too I I think it was a mental thing you know when you have an injury and when its messing with your form it could get mental and now when you start to see the shot not falling like it typically does now it plays into other parts of your game so I think for him its just getting back to what hes used to getting in the gym getting those extra reps up and I know hes been in that gym with with GMAT getting the extra reps up and and you could tell hes hit three threes today and and again when hes hitting jump shot its just opening up um the rest of the floor for his downhill game and everything else that he has three threes that ties a career high third time Sterling has done that so off the Miami timeout Nigel pack will control the twopoint hurricane lead and no wga popper since the 1539 Mark with two fouls Jim L has been very conservative in this first half Cleveland around and out Miami still does not have an offensive rebound Jud Min has his fifth defensive rebound it could be that omir effect you know hes averaging 10 rebounds a game and a few of those are definitely on the offensive side of the ball under two to play in this first half which has been led by a shorthanded hurricane team Williams will step into the foul line line drive it out only two offensive rebounds for Syracuse they tie it up here with Copeland and mince and the orange has the arrow Kev I love what quier Copan brings I I feel like Im out there in his body right now when hes talking but I I just love the energy that he brings to this team you know besides on the court and his skills his energy goes to everybody else and they can feel that and thats thats the most important thing that he brings for me Adrian ay said hes just as talented as anyone in this program he has found a little more consistency the last couple of months quer Copeland Williams left him all alone and Benny short arms to three well hes capable shooter if hes going to let him shoot and shoot the ball Joseph with an air M at the other end that looked uncomfortable that elbow popped out Kev when that elbow pops out its not going to be a good shot imagine you know as a shooter when your elbow pops out instantly this is not going to be what I intended Im trying to keep that elbow lined up right there straight through fell off the screen by Williams a drive by Chris Bell stood up by noo Williams battling hard got it back and hell get to the rim extra effort from Benny Williams Off the Bench I thought initially Nook did a great job just being straight up but Benny Williams bringing that energy and effort thats what thats what Syracuse expects from him and I like what Chris Bell did instead of settling for the pullup getting all the way downhill to the rim hes 67 in athletic you can get to the and make a play at The Rim Benny Williams 10 for 19 at the free throw line this season will shoot two featur ESPN womens basketball match up tomorrow afternoon Angel Reese the defending national champions the LSU Tigers hosting Arkansas 5 Eastern for local on ESPN its streaming on the ESPN app one short one long there two Miss free throws for Williams free throws matter they do matter especially in a game like this Miami scoreless for over three and a half minutes nursing a twopoint lead into noo again Williams ties him up and Cleveland comes out of nowhere to statch an accidentally perfect pass Matthew Cleveland with 10 after a twopoint game on Wednesday against Florida State he leads all scores and Miami leads in the final half minute of the first pin in the lane Williams for three yes indeed well we just talked about hes a capable shooter he missed one if you have another opportunity let it go back hold for the last shot Williams on him Williams commits a foul Syracuse has quite a few to give will not a bad foul with 26 to go Kevin we talked about the similar styles to play you can even see on the defensive side of the ball Syracuse and Miami hedging high so theyre really decep of leaving guys away from the rim they got to be able to see that rotation on that back side both teams copelan KN away for pack copelan did not get it off in time gave off the basket it does not count and Miami picked up his second foul at the 1401 Mark he didnt return wga Poler second foul was with the 1539 Mark he didnt return theyre both back on the floor for Miami along with Cleveland noo and pack and look at this wga popper who sat for the final 1539 picks up his third foul after 11 seconds well Kev that was just is silly right there I mean there there was nothing there and then you see him put his shoulder right down into his chest that was have some awareness of you already having two fouls Jim Leno will let him ride it out for a little bit Syracuse with mince Taylor Starling Bell and brown the Ares starting five thee McLoud out for the season due to foot surgery Malik Brown a permanent starter heres Bell for three thats not close Chris Bell just two for seven from Deep today you see Miami switching up they picking roller covers to set of hedge and you see Nook hes staring to stay down a little bit protecting the basketball pack fls it in and out the first offensive rebound of the game for Miami comes from Michael noo who is one away from a season high in minutes and hell go to the free throw line Kev this dude is a monster under the GL I mean his body type right he he is a big boy and you know what we talked about it ear hes taking advantage of his opportunity and he seems like hes having fun with it as well the season high points was nine against the vaunted NJIT Highlanders hes got six already and he is making his first start because of that man on the left side of the bench l cadir a lower extremity issue suffered earlier this week 17 point per game score 10 rebound per game Monster on the boards aloko has seized the opport opportunity he goes one for two and Miami has the first point of the half and and the wel has done a great job but theres no replacing omir what he brings just as an experience to the team hes been around the program for 4 years you know hes a guy thats really Irreplaceable theres Taylor thought about the three hell set up mince instead that is off the IR to the right cugh is now 6 for 19 from Deep Cleveland its so good in transition today look it back back for wga popper a step back three and another offensive rebound for noo popper again steps inside Taylor gets to Cleveland in the paint Cleveland swishes and hes got a do it and I thought wga had the you know first threepointed ATT he said he didnt he didnt shoot it but it was a great job getting to the Lane and finding the open guy good job by Cleveland finding open space doz points six rebounds three assists for Matthew Cleveland two to Min six points in the first half for him JJ Starling LED with nine Starling its the bigger George will feed Taylor three to shooting Taylors got George all over him Taylor gets it on the ren popper soes in for the defensive rebound ke you said in the first half how Syracuse was stagnant offensively that was another possession where theyre just playing all out on the perimeter its hard to play basketball like that youre always going to end up with a shot like they just got Adrien AA practice yesterday had a moment as Starling sets up and misses a three Taylor grabs it he just blew the whistle he crouched he stayed silent for 10 seconds and he said everybody please just pass the ball and right now they havent passed it terribly well they miss a couple of open threes thats for Taylor 0 for five from three to start in the second half pack penetrated and he left it short tries to get it back Taylors on the deck pack as well and this tie up will go the way of the arms you know what I think a lot of times too in especially for both of these teams Syracuse and Miami they have a lot of individual Talent so you can get caught up sometimes and trying to do too much oneonone instead of being able to get in move the ball around and get the best Applause shot Syracuse fans are still on their feet the tradition here at the as you stand and clap until the first made field goal of the half that will come from Taylor right on time Im not standing the whole time Im sitting down a couple times seriously Im sitting down man take a break make your own rules popper only two points in the game gets his deflected pass back Brown will hedge back thats a good recovery by Malik Brown tied for second of the ACC and steals hes just forcing it right now W hes forcing it a little bit too much Taylor Maybe got hit on a follow through there but no foul and Cleveland was all alone under the basket for a moment poppler didnt see him poppler will take it himself and brown just parries it out of bounds on the way up yeah again I I think its you know poer hes trying to do too much right now hes trying to make up for the time that he hasnt been playing and and you know rightfully so hes trying to make plays but you just have to be able to to read and make better decisions I think Jim Lena thinks the same thing youre thinking popper will take a seat its the first sub since the 1140 Mark of the first half not including the reentry of the players that were subbed out at halftime its actually a great throw in right there got an 88t pass under of the basket George from Joseph spot up three is good for Kean George O they have gotten hit there as well no foul but he gets all three from Miami and look who hes guarding now hes 68 guarding the six foot point guard Judah minz one of the best scorers in the ACC that just shows his versatility and we weve been waiting on George since the beginning that we talked about him hes hes a very capable player no deflection there thats a bell turnover Kean George with his first bucket Miami keeping the orange at Arms Lane with no fivepoint lead for Miami here in Syracuse we had a special moment at halftime here at the Dome uh Eric dorf playing the role of Cory Alexander today and doing so quite admirably I might add something for you at halftime thats very important you really made your mark in this community after you playing here youre strength coach here at the ed23 foundation thats you with Fran Brown and a couple other folks getting a 10000 check yeah well I mean the Syracuse Community has has been you know a part of me since 2005 and um they mean so much to me and in the ed23 foundation it was three things that really came to mind provide resources Inspire change um and connect likeminded people and and thats what were trying to do in the community and we couldnt do it without the help of um you know everybody in it so Im Im very blessed and grateful for the for the check that athletes who care provided the foundation youve had a lot of different roles on family pack misses Matthew Cleveland has the offensive rebound player for Syracuse analyst philanthropist and of course how can we forget beheim Army Champion under the rule of Ryan Blackwell and Kevin BBY a couple of years ago at TBT shout out my guy Kevin BBY and and Ryan Blackwell I guess Im trying to be like the uh the quader Copeland I guess the Swiss Army Im trying to provide a a little bit of everything man but again its just Im so grateful to be a part of the Syracuse Community uh and theyve stuck with me through the ups and downs and and Im super blessed to be here and and do what Im doing Syracuse right now down by five Miamis had the lead most of the game and mat with Cleveland a big reason why this is a jumper Rin shooting at 1 for seven in the second half 0 for six from three the quiet game offensively for Mintz again Syracuse just needs some more movement even off the ball just going to down screen or just being able to exchange on those wings theres no movement its a good look for Bell its a seven straight missed three though to start the half Cleveland just straight up lost it Miamis had some turle over trouble thats the 11th for the ks I dont know if if Cleveland is uh you know typically bringing the ball up as the point guard like that but you know Judah saw that took advantage it put some pressure on him see what his handles like and Losing Isaiah Wong the ACC player of the year really has hurt Miamis ball handed issues the second worst turnover team total turnovers per game in ACC play copelan going to drive it into George copelan hanging in the air for a long time rebounded by Brown Bell will step in off the fake and Bells shot is spiked by noo noo are you making your presence felt yes you are you definitely are making your presence felt but how about George as well I I I mean just his versatility as a freshman 68 being a you saw him guarding mints and now taking on Bell staying in front making a hard shot letting no wo come over and you know get the block deep in the shot clock again Starling will pull up from the elbow and JJ Starling has had the jumper going I think hes a guy right now for Syracuse that has to look to be more aggressive he has to look for a shot he has to look to get to his spots and pull up and then if he has an opportunity he has to take it lead down to three Cleveland gets around Bell and slithers in with the left tough inside hand finish tough right there Matthew clevel hes got 14 to lead all scorers mince Starling again using the shot fake to his Advantage get him the basketball right now you you got to ride that hot hand hes feeling good hes hit down hes hit a couple jump shots now he could mix up and make better decisions as far as what you need to do get downhill or do you have that open shot popper back on the floor replacing George look at popper with just two points one for five in the Applause game hack throws it for noo Scoops it right to Bell another Miami turnover the Hurricanes 12 mince somehow it got to Brown BL no and then Brown gets out to deflected Starling yes sir wow give that one right there to Malik Brown just that hustle and that effort those are the type you play plays that you need if you want to win these type of games Malik Brown hello and now you see the defense in intensity pick up the crowds getting into it a little bit more lot of dribbling by pack hes tied up with brown they hit the deck hard smashing into Jim Bayan courton its Miami ball on the jump with seven to shoot Im ready to go in sub me in for real I know Im a sub right here but I could go sub it right now and play I tell you what that energy that Malik Brown is bringing is at a different level right now and you see the Dome is getting into it I mean if he doesnt get get to that ball Miami might have a five on two break I tell you what effort is a skill a lot of a lot of players dont realize that but a lot of guys arent playing as hard as they can when you play as hard as you can youre giving yourself and your team in Advantage now he throws it down the floor with only a few seconds to shoot pack the pull up he missed the rim and Copelands got the rebound Syracuses last lead was 16 14 and mince has a chance to take it back look for him Starling stripped and out of bounds it will go to Miami off the knee of Starling one more look at this play and the effort by Malik Brown to keep this possession alive leading to three from JJ Starling yeah well hes four for seven from the threepoint line which has opened his midrange game and also his down to the downhill game to the basket and hes just playing aggressive hes looking for a shot and Syracuse needs needs him to be aggressive if they want to be good 166 made field goals a lot of those assisted by Judah minz who has eight assists tying a season High the four threepointers a career high for Starling who was at Notre Dame for year local product from Baldwinville transferred back home after Mike Bray ended his Notre Dame career knew Adrien arre from age seven said he felt like a family member and it was a nobrainer to return to Syracuse 3939 with 11 12 to go Miami a bubble team looking for a big win at the Dome and theres a big shot by benley Joseph who hits his first three Miami has those type of guys plays broken down give him the ball go ahead go to work Joseph right there taking advantage Starling off the cut What A Catch by Brown hes showing us a little bit of everything today Kev no nem McLoud Malik Brown has played nearly every minute 68 sore from Virginia Benny Williams guarding Cleveland Browns got the rebound his fifth to go with six points two Steals and a block the same thing we were talking about Syracuse being stagnant Miami is getting in that stagnant mode and just settling for shots instead of moving the ball and getting those good looks that they got early on Williams he found Copeland after the hesitation quader copelan will shoot Applause two Georges third foul and and I and Ill tell you this some fans dont like the the emotional and and the talking about I love it I Im a guy who loves the guys getting emotion out there obviously you got to control it but it means youre passionate about what youre doing youre passionate about the game and if you ask me you have to be passionate about something if you want to be really good at it and I see Copeland out there he brings that I just love it I you know I cant say enough about this kid hes got the the whitest smile on the roster whater cop for sure 66 sophomore Philadelphia optimistic joyful you go to Syracuse practice you see Adrien ay get on players and coder Copeland will be just smiling behind his back the or front of his back the whole time too he just loves to play loves to play I tell you what Miami needs to do they need to get packed back on track he needs to look to be aggressive and just cuz hes 3 for 12 he cant settle you got to be able to get to that bucket or take that opportunity that you get packed with Cleveland poppler George and Casey heres Kean George pack with 10 to shoot some good movement better movement popper bodied up really well by Judah minz has to throw it back to Nigel pack its his game at the end of the shot clock and he buries it from Deep pack you must have heard me he heard me talking over here Kev he heard me second three of the game and now copelan drives right by him and brown knocks it in the Applause rim Sy starting to own the offensive glass their 10th offensive rebound and its pack again backto back possessions hes up to a dozen yeah he knows his time hes you know under 10 its his time to go ahead and start being a little bit more aggressive I think hes fell back a little bit in early on now he sees that he has to take over 14 point per game score Nigel pack hit the 1500 Career Point Mark today Starling a catch and Sh Brown got in there late and mince is blocked but fouled by a disbelieving Cleveland his first Kev we need stat for Malik Brown how many plays is he keeping alive how many deflections is he getting I tell you has four offensive rebounds but as for deflections and somebodys got to be charting that on the Syracuse bench absolutely its not us but they are over there they if they want to come over and tell us they can but wed appreciate it hes keeping plays alive so free throws for Min whos two for three at the line today first tonight from Scotia Banker arena in Toronto UFC 297 the middleweight title fight between Champion Shan Strickland and Rising Star drias duplissy M car begins at 10 Eastern on payperview the prelims at 8 Eastern ESPN and ESPN Deportes ESPN plus coverage starts at 6 Eastern to order the main card in English and Spanish ESPN pluscom Applause SLV two free throws for minz its a onepoint game Miamis largest lead was eight Syracuses largest was two Pat gets free again hes hit three in a row eight straight points for pack you know he heard us talking over here he knew it was his time take advantage of it 42 threepoint shooter Nigel pack Copeland inside George and another Miami foul thats on Kean George its his fourth and it is on Kean George see him just getting downhill playing off a two feet I think young kids I say this all the time once you get in that paint area if youre able to play off of two feet even if that first opportunity isnt there you keeping the Play Alive you can kick it out or you can pivot off and get into a you know right left hand shot whatever it may be but playing off two feet like Copeland did there he just gave him himself a better opportunity so George is going to take a seat with 848 to go Ben the Joseph returns George with three points four fouls popler with two points three fouls omir injured and unavailable Miami hanging on for dear life with 848 to Applause go Applause Joseph been letting Nigel pack cook of late he hasnt touch the ball on this possession its Poler and its going to be a blocking foul this time on Malik Brown very close to what would have been Poppers fourth instead it is Malik Browns third I dont know number one Malik Brown well I mean the extension of the arm right there is enough to you know call the offensive foul but again I I just think poer he hes forcing it man you know we know hes a talented guy but you got to just let that come to you no spacing on that drive at all track for his worst offensive Game of the Year can he get it going here yes he can that type of guy hes that type of guy he just needs one of those to go down and now hes back on track Miami h four straight shots and the Kanes lead it by five in the lane mince left it short contact no foul Here Comes CLE Cleveland Joseph to his left R away oh goodness Cleveland rocks the rim a great decision to keep it I thought he was going to give it up to Joseph right there on the bounce a Syracuse timeout Miamis hit five straight shots Matthew Cleveland bursting the Hurricanes to a sevenpoint lead that was impressive dude Applause food has definitely been a very dominant voice in my head you said Nigel pack needed to start to get going in the second half Nigel pack has gotten going yeah it was only a matter of time we talked about a guy who scored 1500 points in his college career we just need to see one go down and now we saw three in a row now the floodgates have opened for him 19 points and back to to back games coming in hes got 15 today in Miami which had a dreadful shooting half in the first half five for seven from Deep theyve opened up a sevenpoint lead well Miami is one of the most efficient offensive teams in the country even when theyre missing shots you know what theyre capable of and its only a matter of time 1 for nine and now you see in the second half 5 for seven theyre shooting 50 Syracuse shooting 33 a little bit of a free throw edge and a turnover Edge have kept Syracuse somewhat in the game Min got hit in the face there he gets around Joseph and attacks the rim which we havent seen him do too much today I think its time for Judy to go ahead and start being more aggressive offensively and looking for his he has eight assists hes done a great job of getting guys involved but now its time for him to go ahead and look the score and the double figures with 10 with seven rebounds to maybe some triple double watch heres Pat and he check a short and theres rebound number eight for Jud Starling into copelan over the top of pack mokos there to help out and theres a foul called by Jamie lucky that will send us to break a fivepoint lead for Miami quadir Copeland and Syracuse trying to come back and stay unbeaten at home after 51 Music years 7 Minutes 1 second to go in this game and the odds are good that Matthew Cleveland will play the final 7 minutes and 1 second he has played the first 32 minutes and 59 seconds of this game has not had a sub in a day where Miami does not have North Shadow Mir where theyve had foul trouble for wiga poppler and keesan George Matthew Cleveland on Wednesday playing his old team Florida state two points two turnovers shot one for eight talking to Bill Courtney before the game and he said look remember Matthew Clevelands really close with a lot of those guys still his former teammates they figured it was just a one game look for him turns out they were right yeah I know he was chomping at the bit to get to that next game and just erased that from his memory and you know so far hes having an efficient game you know besides the four turnovers hes a guy that has continuously put pressure on this Syracuse defense here Copeland five for six at the line Syracuse back within three despite a poor shooting day benley Joseph for Miami sets up Cleveland in it out rebound Malik Brown what do you look here at through Syracuse well you got to look to get downhill and get to the basket if you can I mean you want to look for the open opportunity but right there Mitch gets down hill he missed the layup though 11th rebound for Cleveland Miami has an advantage and feland not a bad foul really to slow down that Miami break its only his first and the teams third and I like the play by Syra get it to the Elbow come off that little rub screen he hands it to him then he has an opportunity you just got to finish now when you dont finish those opportunities a lot of times they can get out and transition and play fast and thats when you have silly fouls or you know opportunities that mind me P finds that extra gear and thats a go 10 taken off the backboard by Brown by yeah definitely definitely a go 10 looks good though Kevin it looks good looks good on TV nisel packs four of his last five hes got a game high 17 now Miami has led for nearly the whole game Syracuse just a 90 second lead Benny Williams from Starling thats way Applause short heres popper only five points in the game Poler Cleveland quarter pocket loo tips it and its into the hands of Judah Min Ill tell you what I love these Miami guards though nothing phases them and theyre going to be aggressive regardless if theyre 0 for 10 or or 10 for 10 theyre going to play the same way Copeland spinning into traffic Copeland draws a foul its on popler and its going to be a two shot foul so Wugga popper has four fouls and Copeland will go back to the line I dont know if uh if popper and and Copeland have a little bit of History I dont know if theyre both from Philly but I I you know I could tell by the back and forth that I think that might be it playing against each other growing up or whatever it is but they they definitely have some ties yeah they are Philly guys and look is still laughing at five for seven shooting and now six for eight at the line tell you what the game of basketball brings together together all type of brotherhoods man and and they stay forever so its unbelievable to be able to have Applause those pack again got three rebound to Brown thats his ninth to go with eight points just another day at the office from Malik Brown Bell thats a big one and its a onepoint game and Syracuse is hitting perimeter shots they are a different basketball team now you see the energy pick up on the other side of the ball popper its the screen Browns out there to hedge Poppers off the side of the rim maroko keeps it alive offensive rebound and its packed with the Finish plus the foul what a tough player I mean probably wasnt the best shot by W it wasnt a good shot at all but Pat get in there 6 foot look at him getting in there at 6 feet not afraid of the contact finishing over Brown thats tough and you know as much as he struggled you know for most part of the game hes come back and showed us what type of player he is its a really significant foul to the fourth on Malik Brown and much as brown kept that offensive rebound alive for the Starling three earlier in the half Michael noo a freshman who so good keeps this play alive for Miami pack is a great free throw shooter cant finish the threepoint play scored exactly 19 points in the last two games hes at 19 today Sterling for minz and we are TP what an exciting game on both teams Miami Syracuse these guards are getting downhill and making plays its going to come down who can get a stop Kev who can can get a stop a 10th assist for Judah minz as well good no call good no call Joseph Miami back in front I tell you what man this is good basketball right here Id love to see a high level going at each other took a little while to get the Rhythm and flow going but we found it Bell off to me Chris Bell with his 4 three 6262 youre up n your pack youre turn its Cleveland rising to Deep Over Bell rebound JJ Starling he get a good one right here SRA you dont need nothing crazy mins has been the distributor today 11 assists he drags the feet he gets it up off the backboard Brown takes it out of the sky and Syracuse has its first lead since Friday Mr Dependable what a scene we have in the Dome the orange back on top in the closing stretch the magic never leaves you when you stay with the Disney Resorts here at the JMA Wireless toone sh making on both sides JJ Starling first for Syracuse and benley Joseph with the Miami answer penetrate kick come back down penetrate reverse kick and then Chris for all a couple of minutes it be specific its just over a minute and a half but Syracuse has the lead 6462 with 310 to go Kean George back on the floor for Miami with noo Cleveland popper and the man of the hour Nigel pack itll be the Freshman George back in the game who takes it into TI Bell has to get off his hip and get back in front Malik did his job of being able to get there and then get back to noo but Chris Bell has to get back in front on that copelan with mince Starling Brown and bell for Syracuse both teams 12 and five both three and three in the ACC mince got caught in the AA his man underneath its copelan for his first field goal Kev I dont know how many guys can just hang in there for a little bit and then still be able to make the right decision great play by Jud Min hes been having a great allaround game today new career high 12 assists on triple double watch here at the Dome George again into the body of bell ke Shan George the Freshman on the right side of the lane for a second straight possession talked about it before the game Kev this guys an NBA player he has NBA potential 68 can shoot the ball put it on the deck this kid is going to be special making just his fifth start of the year today a big impact down the stretch Brown on the slip Starling for three he get it again un I dont know if you know how hard of a pass that was for Malik Brown to make to be able to get it and then know where he is right away in the corner chemistry at its finest Syracuse their first threepoint lead of the game and a foul out High against Chris Bell play Kev were minute 32 we this is Its the gritty we got to get we really getting into it right now only the fifth foul Kyle cuff who has barely played this game is going to check in for Bell right now in a minute 32 to Applause go and a little push on the body right there from Bell maybe lets see where Miami goes they

automatically turn and know and see where his teamate is and then George on the other end Young fella you have shown college basketball what you are about get into the basket and then in knocking down the Deep three so Miami with two timeouts Syracuse has the arrow with 186 to go Orange has not lost at home this season their best start in the dome in six years their last nine and0 start in the dome was 10 years ago that 20134 season Miami meanwhile 192 after a loss the last three years theyre coming off a loss against Florida State and this team which is in perilous bubble position looking to avoid an 0 and2 week in cords play what do you look for here for Syracuse for the final show Kev you put it in juds hands you want to get downhill but I think we have to have some off the ball Syracuse has to have some off the ball movement as well in order to get an a good opportunity for a kick out hope and gets it in hes got brown Bell Starling and Mintz its Judah Mintz the third leading scorer in the ACC on a day where he has a career high 12 assists guarded by Cleveland five to shoot mince still with a dribble lost it its Copeland for the win yes yeser cop is your hero whoa quader
