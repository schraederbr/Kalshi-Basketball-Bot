is that youll learn a lot more about him stay tuned to hear His Amazing Story it really is one of the wellliked guys in this conference and in his locker room and away we go a mustwin for NC State and pit with it first at 7 11 in the AC 16 and 13 overall but the Panthers on a threegame losing streak and they have dropped seven of nine and 11 of 15 this is Ish legged second leading scor in the top rebounder and now cam Corin 116 rebounds per game and he says too small after the games first bucket good time for the Panthers to get Camp corn going give him the ball in the post its not something they usually do hes better at facing the basket and attacking you off the bounce that time with a really good move in a post Michael oconnell turned it over and now GMO Diaz Graham moved it for low the sophomore from Texas turns it over Ron pass with the pick oconnell joins blocked at The Rim by Zack off atin the accs leader in Block shots got up quick and with that block he now has 50 on the season pass buries the three happy senior night Brion pass in his first career start you called it you said hes going to score de fers here tonight so Im going give you credit if he gets to take check out the pit starters for Jeff cable load the top score then is legged like we said a do everything guy for pit 50e senior from against georgs County Maryland low no and tantre styles clears it for an NC State team at 11 and 18 overall 4 and 14 in the ACC so thats tied for second to last and we know the bottom three dont get to Charlotte with this 18 team ACC this year yeah its its new to everyone and its unfortunate that NC State wont be able to protect their Championship conference title I mean thats just sounds weird cam Corin lost the footing lost the ball and Brion pass with it for NC State Jaden Taylor Michael otle Dantes Styles and Ben Middlebrooks join him in the starting lineup as you saw for the pack Styles connects this time Kevin Keats told this H shoot around this afternoon that D Styles has been their most consistent player this season he has and been really hot from threepoint line again averaging over three ma game he got his first one here tonight heres post entry for Austin hes got the smaller Bon pass on him but instead backed it out for ish Leed Leed shut off by Jaden Taylor the best on ball Defender for NC State cam corn on the reload shot clock winding down and it rolled off for pet you said NC State I think hes one of the best on ball defenders in the ACC in college baskball for that matter I think hes amazing he Ain a guy thats sitting behind us where the catalst defensively for this final a four run a year ago well Brion pass making a statement to start out senior night he is hes showing coach ke hey you should have put me in a lineup a long time ago as he steps in as a senior and knocks it down we said to Kevin Keats yeah whats it likeon pass guy who stuck around four years he said I dont know what he was doing it never happens anymore a guy stays four years and never transfers it may never happen again good hands from g o Diaz Graham Corin then drives it away for pit stuck on two points in the first three plus minutes coming off a loss at number then 19 Louisville on Saturday and they LED in the final seven minutes Leed short from deep and another rebound already the fourth for Dantes Styles and Leed and low are going to draw a crowd when they get the basketball and theyre driving someone else for pitch is going to have to step up and make shots its legot this time good hands from Bon Pass Austin recovered low wide open and he buries it Jaylen low the sophomore from Missouri City Texas hes averaging 17 points four rebounds and five assists per game he has and has struggled from behind the threepoint line like I said this to you earlier mik I think he and Marcus Burton and Notre Dame have I dont anyone in college basketball has as much responsibility as those guys do pass swirled out that one looking for a great start here were you leaning trying to make the ball go in you were trying to guide it in good hands from Brion pass poked it away forc the turnover from cam Corin Connell at the controls the floor General fifth year senior the second year with NC State after three at Stanford Styles cant knock it down and Jaylen low secures it for pit off that 7968 loss at Louisville where Chucky heern just went nuclear career high 37 6 in the first half and pit has run into a lot of that recently I think Chucky hurn is an all confidence guard first team on acc and my Bo me too Corin steps out knocks down the jump shot Jeff cable was telling us in shoot around today thats part of the next steps in his Evolution yes to consistently be able to knock down that shot itll do so much for the pit panther offense just being able to space the floor a little bit him doing that As double figures like we said after transer in from Florida State Taylor knocks down the triple and NC state has opened up with three threes you got to throw away the the numbers when theyre in this building the last two games theyve won theyve made a ton of Threes And you look at the numbers you think hey this is not a great shooting team but their last two games theyve won making over double digit threes and got to get out the contest Corin got fouled by J Taylor who doesnt love a good senior Knight Brion Pat unfortunately passed away in high school and was the basketball coach in Reedville North Carolina where Brion played we were chatting with Brion today and he said after his playing career he wants to go back and coach at his high school like his father and he said to us today I know my dads looking down on me very proud of all that Ive overcome and that hes watching tonight just an un unbelievable young man and his story is just great and a reminder to us all the last words his dad said to him is he loves me and I think we all can take from that its just a beautiful story and you know tonight is dripping with emotion for Brion pass on senior night who is graduating this semester which is really important to he and his mom with a degree in sports management he told us earlier today Im Sal Del had a bucket now a turnover but then is leged takes it right back for the Panthers delich the kick Le it the shot fake and he knocks it down is legot can do so much for pit he has and the other freshman Del comes in and hes making plays he got to lay up the previous possession and he makes the right play there when he comes in hes really aggressive both ends of the floor trying to make things happen freshman from bosnan heroa nice shot in the midrange for Marcus Hill the Bowling Green transfer in the top score at 12 a game and thats his spot hes a midrange shooter loves to get to his spots puts a lot of pressure on the rim he comes in he was a lead score hes been for the pack but hes been struggling the last five games hes failed to get the double figes low is trying to muscle in on Hill Leed got it back drives on Taylor playing off two feet and he scores plus a foul is legged making his presence felt the last few possessions youve got to corow these guards you cant allow them to play oneonone its too much to ask for any one player because theyre constant in attack mode theyre patient youre not going to come and double got to be able to come and and and and help these guys out one on one its going to be tough see him here never crits on the play hes a twoway guard I would imagine hes going to get some votes for all confence who has to because of the way he plays he and jayen low I think I think first team in my opinion is set I think he will one of these guys will make second Team all ACC two very good guards for Jeff cable so leged stamped the threepoint play and in the process he got the second foul drawn on Jaden Taylor you mention excellent on ball Defender for NC State so Taylor to the bench for Kevin Keats who dips deeper into the reserves with Bryce herd and Paul mcneel a couple of freshman into the game Brandon Huntley Hatfield is out there as well spelling Ben Middlebrooks really aggressive ball screen coverage by the Panthers really hedging on that ball screen ell got fouled with 27 seven left on the shot clock by amsal delich Jeff cable year seven two years ago was the ACC Coach of the Year this team was off to a great start in early December was ranked 18th in the country but we told you theyve dropped seven of nine 11 of 15 he said to us a few weeks ago we just havent been the same team since Christmas theyve struggled with confidence and I think Damen done injuries his inconsistency of being in and out of the lineup now hes done for the year its just taking its toll on the Panthers lineup and he just such a huge part as a big guard kind of taking that Bub Carrington road with this team and theyre missing him and I just think its just overwhelming putting too much pressure particularly on those guards to do too much for everyone else fractured elbow for the Houston transfer who was getting about 10 points per game had also missed a month and a half earlier this year with a dislocated thumb and even the games that he played in he wasnt 100 I mean he played in more games when you look at his numbers but I I dont know if he was ever 100 at one game at any point during the season and well extended pressure forces a pit turnover from NC State we wondered how much we would see of that from the pack they need to score and and get to the free throw line so they can set their defense they have an advantage of numbers and this is what we talked about forcing turnovers and scoring off those turnovers is vital for the wolf pack Styles got shut off on the Baseline now the freshman with a ton of confidence Trey Parker left that short and Brandon Cummings soared for the rebound for the Panthers really good on ball defense there by Leed forcing a tough shot there fade away Music Applause to low Leed and cummings all on the floor for a small ball lineup for Jeff cable delich backs it out and now cam Corin working on Brandon hutley Hatfield shot faking Drive Corin from delich couldnt get it to go had it altered by Styles great find there by delich cam corins got to find a way to Coral that and put that in hill behind the back now backs it up on delich drivs the contacts and will get two on the other side 15 all in the first big game for both these teams with an eye toward the ACC tournament we check out the top 12 in the conference standings top nine avoid playing on the first day hit right now one game back of that cut line with Virginia and Virginia Tech both at 8 and 11 and so for pit thats the objective youre on the road here tonight at NC State and then finish the regular season at home Saturday night against Boston College and for pit thats big because it gives you one more day rest you know in their way of getting in theyre going to have to play multiple days to get in and thats possibly four games in four days and thats a lot of basketball you want to take the shortcut if you can NC State of course they got to go long theyre doing what they are what theyve done a year ago so they dont have to look far they look internally and just remember what they did a year ago but that starts now their ACC tournament is already started for them they have to win both of their remaining games and they need Notre Dame to lose both of its remaining games Notre Dame plays later tonight 900 eastern time at home against Stanford on ESPNU Zack Austin draws a foul underneath on the block all right so diving deeper on NC State again 18 teams 15 make the conference tournament so NC State is looking up at Cal Notre Dame and Syracuse but they lost the season series with Cal in Syracuse so cant jump them they did beat Notre Dame so again they need Notre Dame to lose out and they have to win out starting tonight they have and you look at this point of the Season that team has lost so many nail biters so many last possession games um Virginia Tech at Virginia Tech the Carolina game early in the year they just needed one play to go their way and unfortunately it didnt and noted a is the only team that they can catch right now ESPN analytics gives NC State just a 2 chance to reach the ACC tournament and were at 17 all Midway through this first half after after a couple of free throws good from Zack Austin after he got fouled by Trey Parker who initiates for the wol pack paper decides to throw a little full court pressure there at the Wolfpack most teams that apply pressure dont like the pressure Wolfpack handled it well then Middlebrooks with a good catch and then he got fouled as the shot clock was winding down Ben Middlebrooks is an important piece for NC State here tonight guys dealt with foul trouble all season in his second year with the pack after transferring in from Clemson and he was off to a very productive offensive day but only was able to give 17 minutes on Saturday at Georgia Tech trying to stick with Bango and this has been the foul issue All Season hes been the most foul prone player in the league he has and we talked about this with Keats its just created some inconsistency with their lineup because he does so many different things you love how how hard he plays ability to attack you off the bounce to finish inside but he just cant stay out of foul trouble and with the slow in effectiveness of Brandon Huntley Hatfield is just exaggerated a little bit more because they just havent gotten much out of him so theyre struggling to find consistent production from their Center Spot good job by middle Brooks Walling off cam Corin and it leads to another pit turnover States got to be careful inbound that basketball is Leed has gotten the steal earlier hes picking up the ball full court youve got to see that thats on the passer as a point guard your back is facing him you cannot see the defender Bron Cummings departs for the Panthers NC State with backtoback home wins against Boston College Wake Forest he had the shooter out today Kevin Pete said to his team lets make it three home wins in a row thats the objective he said tonight mcneel was huge in that game against Wake Forest with 24 in his first career start top 50 recruit cant knock it down low the rebound out in transition the lob Austin couldnt finish NC stay back with numbers he went spinning shut off muscles it in for two great play there by Marcus Hill thats his strength getting in the paint great job there being patient looking to pass to a teammate then spins and finishes again hes the leading scorer for NC State but tonight is fourth straight game Off the Bench you would mention five straight in single digits for Hill he plays with a chip on the shoulder they need him in aggressive in attack mode as soon as he touches it dont take bad shots but definitely attack tough shot for legot in the midrange and then leot commits a foul on oconnell and thats two on ish legged great job pushing to the jayen low and you see Zach Austin there waving his hand unable to finish and fourpoint play you missed that bunny Marcus Hills makes you pay and so the lead is three for NC State and pit has is legged on the bench with those two fouls see if and when he might come back for Jeff Cap who is on the lenient side when a guy picks up two in the first half according to kenp well he will be linging when his is legged thats for sure three on pass one back that basketball for NC State now Hill a shot clock winding down its a shot clock violation forced by the Panthers and we just talked about is Leed picking up the basketball full court that time he got a foul ass possession and lets see what happens to this Pittsburgh offense because now as I talked about it puts a tremendous amount of responsibility on jayen low to create not just for himself everyone on the floor needs help on his offense and they love to run this middle ball screen play to get him going to that left hand attacking downhill he gets denied by Dantes Styles and then low hunches down and sort of motions toward his midsection as well missed the game a few weeks ago with concussion pit was able to grit out a win against Miami when they didnt have him came up gimpy in their last game against Louisville but was able to work through that for pit and again showing some discomfort oh they are hes at the top of the scouting report for every team and youre going to have to be physical against him just a part of what teams are trying to do no ones trying to hurt it but you got to be physical with delich off a very smooth looking shot fake we saw him star against Miami in that win two and a half weeks ago hes just really aggressive and he comes in hes not he doesnt wait on the game to come to him he attacks it hes been really effective in his minutes so far here in the first half see he hasnt averaged very much this year Brion pass knocks down another second three for Brion pass on senior night you just get the feeling its going to be his night described by everyone around NC State as one of the best players that has come through this program in the eight years of Kevin Keats and who has stuck around Austin follow drops great job you can see panthers the second time they try to post up Austin on that switch he gets a small a guard on him any of those guards from Wolfpack and hes trying to run directly in the post pass list at 6 ft Buck 75 was trying to go up against the 6 7 Austin Styles driving kick turned it over cant leave your feet on a pass got to stay down Corin good look at Pass Austin recovered and it rolled off Marcus Hill in transition all the way to the cup that was silky thats twice already pit Panthers have missed a layup and the P wolf pack have made him pay pushing the tempo getting to the rim Marcus Hill been a beneficiary of that on both times its happened I dont know how he had that handle without it being a carry but it was good it was pure Corin sticks another midrange jump shot see the confidence with him its just hes got to be a guy hes been in third lead score and doesnt space to flow a threepoint line but if he can stick that 15 to 17t jump shot you got to get out there and guard him and he can take you off the bouns middle BR is trying to do just that Corin muscles out of there with a rebound so pit down by two inside of six to go in the first half low wraps one around and then Corin couldnt go up with it on a great delivery from Jaylen low inside of six to go in the first half and Marcus Hills got a game high eight so far he has I think hes on track to break that double digit scoring streak on his way to having a big game hes the lead in wolf Music pack oh we got the Thea gun going these guys are ready to play huh they are NC State this season only 32 from three but you see in our game summary five of nine from threepoint range here in the first half and when we were chatting with Jeff cable this morning at shoot around he said yeah I know in their last home game they knocked down 13 threes against wake fours he was worried about that and he knows with his defensive game plan your game planning to protect the paint and close out Lake the shooters but he was really concerned how the wolf pack shooting this building Brandon Hunley Hatfield gets his first points to the Ball Game the senior averaging Just 4 and a half over the last two months his talent dictates so much more he is the most talented player for North Carolina State and its not just that he transfer he transferred into conference you just wonder what has transpired for him not to be more productive for nor K State Austin no dice from Deep flip side for pitch is two of five from long range here in the first 15 minutes Hill you can see the confidence growing for Marcus Hill here in this first half lot of standing around NC State a lot of dribbling Hill driving on Corin whos swats that its got to be more movement body movement and ball movement with the in state they like to take you off the dribble its got to be more movement low for Corin lost the handle passing transition lets it Fly knocks it Applause Music down tear up The Scouting Report you better get the Brion passes as he knocks down his third three in the first half 115th career game first time hes ever had three threes in a game hes done it in 16 minutes and hes got a block on jayen low wolf Packers committed to guarding low and leged oneonone theyre not sending any extra help pass an entire Arena at the Lenovo Center wanted him to shoot that Trey Parker saying come on man this a great job here here turning defense in the off offense this is what the wol pack need to do three pass knocking down to three he steps into another one and there is absolutely no way he should have thought about passing that last one his teammates are even telling him to shoot it we talked to him at about 230 pm today and at that point he didnt know for sure if he was going to get the start but he told us if he did it would be so special y Mo Diaz Graham missed it Austin his tip wouldnt go NC State by seven inside a four to go in the first half this is as large as the lead has been for either team pass why not swirls one out I wonder who was more popular on campus was it DJ Burns or is it Brion pass thats a thats interesting question I have to ask someone for a wolf pack the biggest cheers no question during the pregame senior night festivities were for forign white gon p low offt Target way too strong in the midrange Bryce heard the rebound in the Fast Break ambitious behind the back somehow got it to oconnell couldnt pay it off Styles soaring and then last Touch by Diaz Graham so itll stay with NC State when we come back threes flying for the wolf pack theyve got a half dozen from long range they do its a big part of their offense and when theyre in this building the rim just seems a little wider pack hot from behind the threepoint line knocking down six Music already havent been a good rebounding team all year he said especially since January hes talked about that being a common denominator in some of their losses theyre only minus one right now and theyre actually plus one in offensive rebounds but like you said that last little spurt helped grow it for NC State meantime other end for pit approaching four minutes without Points Austin for Corin its a foul on Brandon Huntley Hatfield its only the fourth on NC State so you talked about low legged and then who else Les been in foul trouble Corin has produced hes got six where else does it need to come from for P I think its Zach Austin I mean hes someone there and lets not forget Del he comes in really aggressive as a freshman and hes not forcing shots up hes just really aggressive to make plays and taking shots when they there hes got a couple assists somehow kept it alive for delich right on Q buries a triple its like you know what youre doing think Ive done this before but no hes deserving of the time hes hes getting hes forcing coach C to play him hes just making things happen for a team that been inconsistent offensively hes coming and giving him a spark and its a turnover on Bryce herd at NC State Im Sal belich from Bosnia and heroina his father Amir played professionally for more than 20 years and currently coaches back in their home country as well he looks like a coachs son I mean he he accepts his role he knows what it is and hes coming in and he plays with the right mindset hes trying to make plays he takes shots when theyre available like this but hes also really unselfish in looking to move the basketball for a fresh hes not always trying to impact the game by scoring had only scored five points the last four games so sure enough seven here in the first half with inside of two minutes to go andc stayed up by five Corin battling with Huntley Hatfield Marcus Hill looking for the Post entry here is Brandon hudley Hatfield Hill not known for his threepoint shot comings to the rebound Id like to see hudley Hatfield turn and face hes really not a back to the basket player turn and faceing you can attack the defense a lot better cumings add it roll off aome great ball movement for the Panthers another freshman for the Panthers who I think one opportunity is been given has really answered it oconnell Stacks it Michael okells second three the fifth year senior starting point guard its a pass first a guy but he will Stu up and take shots when you make them more than capable shooter as he knocks down his second three Jaylen low driving on Hill they get tangled and its a foul on Marcus Hill hey ESPN NBA Friday its a western conference double header its the Grizzlies and the Mavs got dealt another blow with Kyrie Irving season ending injury thats at 730 Eastern then the Nuggets h Kevin Durant Deon Booker and the Suns and it all starts with NBA Countdown tipping off our coverage at 7 Eastern tough go for the Mavs has been make that trade and season all but over for those guys in the expectations of losing Kyrie irvan and unfortunate part of turning ACL at this point in the season he will not start next season and its how does that linger its tough coming off an injury and not having an off season in a build to conference with all right so we got 40 seconds to go in this first down NC State by six oconnell pass Huntley Hatfield Styles in Hill to five for Kevin Keats to close it out H initial ball screen defense is really good pass on the Baseline Rises to strong and loow to the loose ball shot clock off 15 seconds to go low in transition Pro finding Corin for Applause two and Kevin Kats will take a time out his us it or state in the league theyve been in games like this this isnt foreign territory for them the question for them is can they finish this team lacks confidence in these close games in these moments and sometimes theyve had bad luck and then just luck of the draw but when it gets tight theyve got to stay relaxed and theyve got to just continue to execute their offense and its legged being able in foul trouble could be a good thing because he can be fresh in the second half Corin on the Block couldnt score it after Michael oconnell had kicked the basketball forced by jayen low that prompted the turnover on the first possession of the second half and now NC State goes to work middle Brooks with the size advantage on Austin on the repost what a luxury to have often as youre starting small forward able to defend a five man how about a 43 for Brion pass he had never hit more than two triples in any of his first 114 career games and hes hit four low on the drive tough follow away comes up short styles clears it for NC State up seven what a day for Brion pass now dant Styles drives on Diaz Graham and cant pour in the rebound again NC States got to win these last two games of the regular season tonight here at home and then Saturday at Miami another team at the bottom of the league standings they need some help from Notre Dame State needs the Irish to lose twice leg it no on a follow away and styles another rebound is ninth already for the wol pack really good defense the last two possessions for the Panthers have been contested twopoint shots oconnell could knock down the triple from straight Music on and now you see from NC State their offensive SCH theyre playing with pace and this generating offense for him its an unforced turnover here for the pit Panthers three on pass yet again from long range senior night baby you only start youve knocked down three why not knocks down his fourth three and were early in the second half from Reedville North Carolina hes a great football player as well thats a football craze town in Reedsville had some thoughts about playing football as well in college decided two sports would be pretty tough so hes stuck with basketball good cut by styles from Middlebrooks great pass there by Middlebrook on the give and go we he and Don Tre Styles Jeff Cap needs a timeout we Applause got we have a win congratulations you just won Jeff cable and pit seem to have run into more guys go off for big threepoint shooting days when maybe their numbers to that point in the season dont dictate that than most other teams in the ACC so is that them having a defensive problem or is that bad luck running into guys getting hot on one night against P I think its a combination of both but you tend to worry about your defense in on the interior they struggled to defend G OD Diz Graham is more of a finesse big styles on the attack and as donrees Styles reminds you theres no Rim protection for the pit Panthers so there full go you attack the rim aggressively and no one there to alter that shot so trouble defending the three and then nothing on the interior as well its a foul committed by NC States it Styles get out and running hes got seven points and nine rebounds get now running a wing here hes shows you the athleticism gets up giving you his best Mike Monaco impersonation Above the Rim its pretty good its close its not its not true but its good 17 and a half per game for dant Styles over the last four coming in its another foul on guo Diaz Graham and who do they get itsan Connell not middle Brooks who could have been battled with two in a row just a great job of avoiding the contact you see his leged NOS he cant get up that high I got to get out of the way Dre Parker likes it see those last four games numbers for Dantes Styles has been really good good hands from Ben Middlebrooks on Zack Austin forc the turnover NC stayed up by 11 as big a lead as theyve had at any point tonight hits turnover was mounting pass little wild there and it belongs to the Panthers I think the previous possession offensively for the Panthers Zack Austins got to win that match up in the post at least get the shot to the glass against Brion pass Marcus Hill checks in he replaces Brion pass who might have got poked in the eye by the way second foul on Ben Middlebrooks all right so what do you want to see from him offensively we were talking about Austin there hes got to take advantage of his size and size hes got to get the shot up you know he has a distinctive size advantage in the post he brought it down and allow Brion pass to get his hands on it and for pit you see theyre intentionally trying to post him up as they do here and a foul will go against Jaden Taylor so thats three on Taylor he picked up his second early in that first half at 1240 left you can see as part of the game plan theyve ran this three or four times here tonight they hadnt gotten a lot out of it is that a foul its a good block up top but theres contact maybe when he lands again its you have to throw that pass and thats on Zach Austin hes more of a three and D guy but at his size you got to they switch you got to punish the smaller guards in size let the little guys come and deflect this shot or strip it from him too many times this game hes one of the best free throw shooters in the ACC at 90 hes got a great case to be on the ACC all defensive team you would expect he leads the league in Block shots he does he should be right there for defensive player of the year with his versatility to defend bigs I talked about it he defended middle Brooks earlier in the game he defends on the perimeter not a more veral defender in his lead ell got fou the pick and roll hell get free throws on the other side NC States up by nine on pit early on in the second half up turn it up regular season title but Clemson and Louisville are not far behind the Blue Devils at the top of the league and Im not sure a lot of people realize that I know Duke has been so dominant all year long and you kind of forget that Louisville and Clemson are right there only one game behind and it going into robbery we week playing at the dean Dome against a red hot Carolina I mean UNC team that weve seen crazier things happen just look at this schedule here and you and I talked about it if they ended up in a threeway tie Louisville gets the one SE three end up at 18 and two Louisville would be the one seed next week in Charlotte and that be unbelievable considering Duke is has a number one seat in the NCAA tournament may be the overall top seat with just recently losing yeah g Mo Diaz Graham knocks down to Triple first points for the 7 foot Junior from the Canary Islands with his twin Jorge on the squad as well changes everything thats his strength to this team as a fivan being a stretch five is knocking down that shot you I know coach cap was expecting more of that from him Styles what a move theyre running him off the line hes been red hot from the threepoint line theyre closing out hes showing you Im more than just a catch and shoot whats he showing you these last few weeks of his senior season now it is third school like whats HE capable of I think youre seeing a guy thats just playing with a level of desperation and you know youre at the end of your college career its just a confidence about the work that you put in hes been a productive player at the high major level so theres no reason for him not to feel that way and you see that in the way hes closing the season here for the world cut delich short off to catch and shoot dant styles with with a 10th Applause rebound Hill off the glass back the other way quickly for NC State NC State is starting to get to those numbers they they want to get out in transition youve got to get back in corala basketball your Pittsburgh Hills in double figures for the first time in three weeks trying to battle with the sevenfooter Diaz Graham and Hill commits a foul that comes on the Flor its his second and dant Styles is having a day Senior Day in his one year at NC State and like Brion pass hes got the custom shoes as well that chose jerseys from previous stops we dont think its an exhaustive list because there is no Carolina blue on there but there is a final four Banner which with the Carolina State rivalry feels like a smart way to do it off another pit turnover oconnell moved it Taylor off a shot fake throws a foul on amsal delich thats his Applause third you got any custom shoes that that youre rocking with I would like a pair of those to be honest I think wouldnt we all hes playing really well you said maybe feeling that sense of urgency closing out a career yes you can see him closing out the season really well on his way to a double double here the most consistent player Kevin ke this today theyve had all season middle Brooks through a foul it will come on the floor on Zack Austin that is the first on Austin choppy start to this second half pitch chasing defensively the ball is moving NC States playing with a lot more energy here in the second half and when youre playing against a team and youre not expecting them to be shoot the ball as well as NC State is shooting it and then now theyre knocking down shot it forces you to alter your game plan State doing a really good job of just driving these cloth outs putting so much pressure on the rim Taylor drove it and what do we got a foul is called youre going to get that it looks like on Marcus Hill for NC State so its pit basketball and thatll be three on Marcus Hill see St State fans dont like the call but its the right call I thought he grabbed his arm and and D Styles is grabbing at his hand it looks like he dont want to come out hes still grab it running up the court grimon grimon yeah left handed looks like for Styles when youre running out of times youre running out of minutes in your college career you definitely want to end it on the floor Jaylen low is probing and he got bumped by Ben Middlebrook so all of a sudden has three as well and we got fouls all over the place so folks pour yourself a decaf coffee creepers both teams are trying to attack the paint off the dribble is what their strength is and when youre really aggressive off the bounce and you put that kind of pressure on the rim you draw a lot of fouls and not many guards are better to that than the scy the free throw line Brandon Hunley Hatfield comes to get Middlebrooks with his three so the foul trouble for NC State looks like that low to the line 88 this season two of two tonight earns another whats the next step for jayen low with an eye toward next season I think physically hes got to take a step in preparing his body for the attention that hes drawn and whats happening to him right now is with the injury to Damien done its just forced him to do more its not that hes capable of doing it but the efficiency in which he needs to do it and sometimes he has to force things because he is the guy that has to create he has to score and he has to create for the entire front line of the Panthers from three through five I mean a lot of that responsibility falls upon Him pit settles into his Zone trying to slow down getting driven by NC State Hill missed it in the midrange and Corin ripped down the rebound great call by C there having trouble with to start this second half defending man man Cummings on the drive couldnt get it to go but corn battled for it and cummings took it right back Le it and T one he knocks it down much needed for pit and Kevin Keats takes an immediate timeout so Jeff cable goes Zone they get a stop leot pays it off and its down to a half dozen still a long way to go in Raleigh Music Music Music is leg its been so for pit recently last five games averaging 18 point6 rebounds a game hardly coming off the floor and was in foul trouble in the first half tonight but you said fresh legs ready to go in the second yeah and that could be a a bonus for the pit Panthers having him fresh to close out games its a great sign of your pit they keep battling to to get back in this game and theyre scrapping and here theyre extending their defense trying to create a turnover they they theyre not as aggressive in their full full pressure but they wanted to delay and theyre going to fall back into their Zone something theyve used this season only 4 of the time but they had seven possessions of it last week against Georgia Tech and they showed it a lot in early February at Wake Forest and thats the pool that Jeff cable goes to here in the second half hes a manto man guy but when your team is spread out this team is n States knocking down threes theyre driving your close outs Music want to change defenses like that create some indecision like Brandon huny half there on a post up 10 turnovers now for MC State and by the way ish legged is out here with his three fouls picked one up on that last trip down the floor pit Now by six trying to grab a first round by in the ACC tournament but right now looking up at Virginia and Virginia Tech Corin went spinning back iron Styles another rebound hes got 11 matching a season High Taylor around a couple of screens Styles quick First Step leot recovered and thats four on is legot theyll say the fouls on the floor but ish Leggett just picked up two fouls in a span of 37 seconds and hes got to come out of this game he doesnt know how to play any other way hes just such a competitor and again Inc state is putting so much pressure just driving the paint forcing contact and made the officials blow the whistle its one of the reasons why Jeff Cap went to the Zone hes trying to protect is legged that time he got caught trying to close out again and its just a tough foul you want to trust your seniors now hes on the bench with four in the game youre trying to get control of dant Styles works out of the corner for NC State Taylor Rises way too strong and G Diaz Graham hauls in the rebound for pit so without Leed its low Corin Cummings Austin and guo Diaz Graham Brandon Hunley Hatfield picks up a foul battling with Cam Corin well step aside six point game final week of the regular Music season it was vital and that run to the final four a year ago quite a run it was before last year NC State hadnt been past the sweet 16 since 1986 Now Kevin Keats in year eight here in Raleigh and and I like to add too its theres been a lot of negativity around the program this team has been back toback NCAA tournament appearances its not just that that final four run was a fluke M Brooks tough Fall Away got it back than to OK conell Middlebrook sticks a three only the sixth of his entire career four of 17 on the season knocks down his fifth three and if youre a senior why not what do else do you have to lose let that thing fly hes battling down low shooting fade away you know what Im working too hard let me get out here knock down is three man this kid plays really hard yes theres been foul trouble but you know what youre going to get from Ben Middlebrooks you never have to question his effort its a really good passing big as well not relying on him to score a ton if he could stay out of foul trouble I think he would be would have been a double digit score qu a look back senior from Fort Lauderdale again first two years of course Clemson coren had it roll off on the front end so its NC State by S Kevin Keat slows things down approaching the Midway point of this second half NC state has to win today and Saturday needs two Notre Dame losses to continue its season past Saturday pit Panthers are in that zone and trying to keep it out of the the middle of that zone they dont want the ball to go to the free throw line Paul mcneel backy low at the controls for pit again is Leed picked up his fourth foul with 1207 to go here Moz Graham came up short and then he hacks Jaden Taylor so again pit right now has fallen not just out of the tournament but off the bubble according to Joe lardy over the last few weeks Panthers have dropped 11 of 15 and NC state has zero margin for error to a season continuing past Saturday yeah both teams are still playing for a lot just in the conference tournament theyre going to need that to have any type of postseason hopes for the Panthers playing for that first round by into the ACC defending Championship playing just to get in it hit is still sitting in that zone SZ Styles got to the middle of the Zone with Taylor now oconnell backs it out for Jaden Taylor who lets it fly it was blocked on the perimeter by Zack Austin Jaylen low pushes crossing over someone else with the pit Panthers has got to make a play cant just you cant totally rely on Jaylen low to create for everyone low for Corin and a foul is called on the floor so two free throws coming for cam Court yeah this is what were talking about where pit has fallen out of the tournament fallen off the bubble turn of the new year they were a six seed according to Joey brackets they were still in the field as recently as early February took that tough loss against Virginia that Jeff cable said was probably as bad a performance of any team that hes coached but right now out of the fields so they got a lot of work to do they do they were to find a way in and if Damen dun was was available to them it would just take so much pressure off of is legged and jayen low and theyd be better prepared for moments like this when one of those guys are in foul trouble and out of the game instead of relying on freshman you rely on a guy whos a really good Defender and also is a double figure score for pit pan cam Corin is two of five at the line but pit gets it right back down by seven with n and a half to go and their offense is Cam corn in the ball screen or Jaylen low low driving off the glass and a foul theyve done a really good job containing him off the dribble for most of the night but you cant control him all night long keeping him out of the paint is nearly impossible with his straight line speed Marcus Hill got cor peing at that screen he drives by initiate contacts kisses it off the glass and a chance for the n one hes played all but 28 seconds of this game 10 points six rebounds six assists nine plus minutes to go triple double watch is not Out Of Reach for jayen low had one earlier this year against VMI and its going to take that type of effort because again they just dont have anyone else to create offense for them and part of this zone is to help him and protect this Le when he gets back in the game you said P didnt want NC State out to the middle of the zone and thats where Styles was thats where you get in the middle of a Zone thats just the one spot when youre on the back line or perimeter guy in that zone when he gets in the middle youre scrambling because you just dont want it there the intention of that zone is to keep it from getting to that spot Styles has his third double double this year offensive foul is called get it on cam corn for the illegal screen all right lets break this down against the zone you can see Del is going there hes trying to get out to the shooter no communication between he and jayen low and the ball gets to the sweet spot right there at the elbow around the ACC area and at that point you dont know what to do because defensively your the defense is designed to keep the ball from being in that place as you see now theyre in their two two pre 2 two1 pressure and theyre going to fall back into the Zone again NC State had eight turnovers in the first half only two here in the second half styles again near that logo lost the handle you can see jayen low chasing it down created that deflection to keep it out Diaz cram couldnt pay it off with a transition triple McNeil was running the floor okell says my bad didnt spot you what the Zone has done is he stopped the pace NC State had a lot of body movement and Bol movement going on and it slowed the pace down Jaylen low had to commit a foul with a size disadvantage in the post one in one coming go to ESPN pluscom ppv all right 759 to go Lenovo Center in Raleigh North Carolina NC State with the students in attendance for the final home game of the year has watched the wolf pack put up a sixpoint lead on pit alongside Randolph chis Im Mike mono our entire crew behind the scenes one in one for Ben middle Brooks good on the first whats going to be key here down the stretch to watch one thought on both sides please wheres the offense run through for the pit Panthers until Isa gets back in this game can they stay within Striking Distance and how long will cap go without him youre in C State you got to find a way to crack the Cod against this Zone youre in youre in the bonus you got to continue to draw fouls and look whos going to the scores table ish Leed with inside of eight to go hes been out since 12 seven low up top for cam Corin thats where the offense comes from for pit with Leed waiting that ball screen with jayen low and cam corn its been the goto but you see his Le coming back in the game they got to find someone else to help create offense what does NC State do against the Zone Styles sets a screen for otle and now Paul mcneel the true freshman inate kid top 50 in our ESPN 100 can supply some shooting sh clock winding down Taylor lets it Fly cant connect and a loose ball is battled for in the corner and itll stay at this end of the floor somehow pit didnt come away with that loose ball weve talked about the biggest issue with the pit Panthers aside from Health its been the inability to rebound the basketball gal Diaz Graham has to find a way to secure that rebound you can see Jeff cable unhappy with his inability grab that rebound takes him out of the game hes got to find a way to grab that Jeff cable said last week with their rebounding issues he said sometimes just grab the ball thats in front of you thats all rebounding is say a want and a will to go get it pass no dice Styles went for the tip slam hit down by six low on the Block scores two more a dozen for Jaylen low hes going to get to his spots and you cant stop him from doing so you got to find a way to Coral him inside and again hes been off the floor for only 28 seconds of game action tonight this dude is emptying the tank on the road for pet hes doing what hes done all year long you got to try to find a way to get that basketball the middle of that zone instead of settling for threes which is not the strength I know they shot it well tonight Taylor okon pass shot fake Rising Fire can knock it down and and then leot says Ill take matters into my own hands on the glass hes been their toughest player on the defensive glass hes the leading defensive rebounder for this team shows you why C trust him with four fouls on the floor 6 three hes their best rebounder low moves it delich shot fake TP two and he hits onsal delich sort of a floater from long twopoint range Mike hes a gamer as we talked about being a coachs son he just doesnt seem sped up he comes in he makes the right place hes earned the trust of Jeff Cap Ron pass on the drive left hand pass has 14 to match a career high with his mom Nikia here watching on senior night Applause approaching 5 minutes to go the lead is four for the wol pack low navigating and had it blocked by Ben Applause Middlebrooks looked like delich was wondering if he drew a foul and then he threw it up anyway without one yeah with the dirt the winsky pullup expecting a contact which wouldnt have counted anyway young man its college basketball not the NBA got to be careful there with that bounce pass on the perimeter sure do and the shot clocks winding down on low got it to go and a foul Jaylen low is taking over for pet hes starting to wear down this defense they trying to play him oneonone in these ball screens relying on the defender to get back in front of the basketball thats a difficult ask against jayen low and hes trying to close this game out for the pit Panthers putting him on his back with how much hes played Im amazed he still looks as quick as fast as anyone on the floor well one he is and two its what hes done all year long hes they just cannot play without him the team looks different he has and I said it he has so much responsibility on his plate and he continues to answer the Bell guy whos felt a lot of pressure this year who at times maybe has lacked some of the confidence that you mentioned with the team going through its struggles boy he looks Mighty confident right now and is flirting with a triple double down the stretch okell attacking the Zone back out Taylor cant hit middle Brooks the offensive rebound just beat cor of that basketball scores it in a Applause Music foul the inability for the Pittsburgh Panthers to rebound and thats difficult to do out of the Zone Middlebrook just gets a running start goes in gets it patient inside draws the foul and the chance for an and one Middlebrook staps it lead back to four for NC State at home the crowd has engaged as its been all night cor a slip got fouled midle Brooks with a star down and now starts jawing at cam Corin says that wasnt a foul but it is and its four on Ben Middlebrooks great challenge by Ben Middlebrook hes late on the rotation he Hedges on the ball screen cam corn slips it in the middle of the floor its a difficult play to defend because youre worried about one of the guards coming off as we go to a break here and great opportunity from the lip reading Department he says theres theres no way lets have a look clean not clean up top its clean theres contact below just depends on he thinks it was clean I can assure you of that well have a look at it 43 to go Music Music Music w e Music Music k Applause Music Music he Music Music after after review there was a legal block by 34 of NC State it be a two shot foul no bucket by that they mean legal block attempts from Ben Middlebrooks it is a foul but its not goal tending a dunk attempt and middle Brooks is entitled to go block that basketball or try to which he did but he does pick up a foul and it is his fourth well he grabbed the rim and they were called him for the go to because he touched the rim but because cam Corin was actually dunking the basketball its a legal defensive play to go block it at the rim and be able to touch the rim so its only a two shot foul which could be a big play here because cam corn is struggling he miss the four in a row 62 this season and he snaps that streak makes it a one possession game with four plus minutes remaining here at the Lenovo Center and C State breaks that pressure and now will size up the Zone from pit I like CNC State be a little bit more aggressive when they break this full qut pressure attack the rim theres no shot blocker for the Pittsburgh Panthers and Zack Austin does a great job of that but track the Press try to get a layup or an open shot because youre struggling against this match up Zone here so Kevin Keats is even perspiring in this one coming down the stretch Styles tough fway gets it to go dant Styles has been a monster today 1 points 13 rebounds in the leads five showing you his experience finding a weak spot of that zone hes flashing in the middle theyre trying to get him there and he was able to just get it a little bit low and go into his Fade Away hit needs a bucket Le it off the bounce pulls up is leged no loose ball Leed ran it down lets it Fly connects is leged makes it a twopoint game thats just such an ish legged play hes the winner you need a play he goes in he misses a shot he gets an offensive rebound and then knocks down a three he just makes winning plays Jeff cable told us today I have never coached a better kid than ish legged everything hes been through in his life he shows up with a great attitude every day you know hes going to work hard hes made it a twopoint game otle answers Michael oconnell on senior night restores the lead to five no hesit it looked he was right at an angle we could see it it looked good from the time he left his hands low split the screen and scores it at the cup and Jeff cable takes his penultimate timeout with 231 to go dueling threepointers on both sides and ish legged just plays hard this is just such an each legged play shoots the shot battles for a rebound has a where with thought nowhere he is steps up and knocks down a three heres NC State coming off that ball screen and no hesitation for Mike okono as he knocks down another three ish legged storys been well told but his father dietr when ish was a freshman at high school they were in the car together driving to basketball practice and iss father Dietrich suffered a stroke they got in a car crash left his father paralyzed and unable to speak was in the hospital for 6 months underwent three brain surgeries and with all that the legot family has been through ish has persevered and carried himself as just a Class Act throughout he has and I recruited him during that time and he is an amazing young guy you will not find a better student athlete okono broke it and Middlebrooks got fouled hard by Corin and they might go have a look and see if thats a flagrant one on cam Corin its at least his fourth personal Middlebrooks comes up shaking his head Kevin Keats is calling for a flagrant himself and the officials will go have a look at this theres a mistake on the back line no one was there left Middlebrook by himself they were trying to trap no one rotated over and theres definitely a foul from that angle its hard to tell if theres any contact to the head that would make it a flagrant so what youre looking for with a flagrant one the terminology is excessive in nature Andor unnecessary is any of that excessive Andor unnecessary from Two and blue Cam Corin in your mind no I think he goes for the block and midle Brooks it back and tries to dunk that with for and cam corn trying to time that hes late rotating in on the play I didnt think there were any militias in sent I thought he went for the basketball and unless he made contact to his head I think itd be hard to make that a flagrant one well you mentioned a breakdown on the back end because they got a trap on okon who just barely did get it over the line but nobody home and thats Cam Korn who made the mistake he responsibility call stands common foul Two Shots middle Brook as you thought yeah as I thought in Corin made the mistake he rotates up they trap here on the sideline hes supposed to rotate back and protect the rim so Ben Middlebrooks to the line to shoot two 73 this year 74 for his career four of five at the line tonight hes good on the first so corins got four leot got four thats the foul trouble for pit for NC State Middlebrooks and Marcus Hill they both have floor Four Hills not on the Music floor Twisted saying rivalry all right fivepoint game 215 to go and Jaylen low whos been at the controls throughout this second half gives it off to lean off the screen lean turns it over a backcourt violation as Leed lost his footing tripped up there as P going to that middle ball screen and with its legged in the floor now you have multiple guards it could be low it could be legged that time he tripped up on the floor and tried to get out un turnover there for pit G Diaz Graham comes back for Camp Corin protecting him with four fouls pit in dire need of a stop can they rebound without K Cor in the FL puts a lot of pressure on the guards inside of two minutes to go Bon pass is in there as well shooting threat against the zone five to shoot styles step back cant hit Austin can secure the rebound low comes to get it 140 to go hit down by five jayen low time triggers cant hit a battle on the boards and okells got it in transition the fifth year senior point guard pulls it back out I would have liked to see him continue to attack there they had numbers fivepoint lead you dont get uncontested layup you dont mind him pulling it out but I thought he had numbers an opportunity to get a quick two there instead it stays a two possession game for now pass off the screen Rising Fire cant hit leg at the rebound approaching the final minute hit down by five and a turn over again leg had a couple of costly ones the last few possessions for pit hes going to scratch his head on this one no one really stops the basketball and he turns around carelessly trying to pass it and Jeff capable body language there shows you how he feels so Jeff cable goes as far as to take him off the floor momentarily need the foul its some point or play it out I think its a two possession game I dont know if you want to let this clock get under 30 40 seconds because the clock is as much your enemy as as the score Taylor drives on Cummings and then they get a foul 21 seconds into The Possession so either do it or dont obviously not trying to at that point with nine left but Jaden Taylor draws the foul and will shoot two but thats what you got a freshman on the floor you got two freshman out there now and hes got to know just dont foul that situation so thats the dmma you have and youre under 30 seconds so now its going to be you put him on the line and you could have done that if the 20 seconds on the game clock but Taylor is 75 free throw shooter Le it comes back in so does Camp Corin for pit and Jaden Taylor is trying to make this a three possession game pit you got to push it quick you dont need a three but youve got to make a decision quickly I think theyre going to get right to the middle ball screen with jayen low and cam corn low walks the dog gets it and goes driving on Taylor gets the roll very quick quickly done by jayen low in about 5 Seconds to get down the length of the floor and get two thats exactly what you want for quick basket two or three it does not matter now theyre going to try to set up full court pressure they dont get a uh Deni in the Music turnover you can see there this is isolation there to clear out everyone a giving Jaylen low his left hand to drive it to the basket got a quick basket matters if they dont take care of business that 2 is all they have to rely on and it wouldnt have mattered if they didnt take care of business tonight and theyre doing so 34 seconds away from giving themselves a chance and Jeff Cel that timeout has to explain the rest of the game to his team its going to be quick here you try to expect full court pressure if they inbound a ball in coffins corner they could trap it try to get a turnover after that you got to file immediately and see St practice Against full court pressure today Kevin Keat said to his team if they think were shaking theyre going to come at us obviously a late game situation here can NC State stabilize styles for oconnell Cummings commits a foul as 4 Seconds come off the clock so Michael oconnell will go to the free throw line where hes only a 65 free throw shooter this season 72 for his career he just doesnt go a lot spends most of his time hes a pass first guy hes not attacking you to score hes attacking you to pass four at the line here tonight has hit one of probably the two biggest shots in program history told us the other day it took two or three days to respond to everyone on his phone after that shot against Virginia in the ACC tournament last year and rattles in both our friend Derk whittenberg would would push back on that comment but second big jayen low off the bounce driveing on middle Brooks and got fouled nearly got it to go Middlebrooks fouls out with 223 left and two coming for jayen Applause low all too familiar territory for Ben midbrook fouling out of a basketball game hes done so quite a few times but hes given heck of an effort on both ends of the floor and what they ask of him hes done his part here can they hold on these final 22 seconds very nice Ovation for the senior from Fort Lauderdale Florida part of a final four Team part of an ACC Championship team and his senior day here in Raleigh comes to a Applause close fitting because he plays hard and leaves it on the floor four no doubt about that Kevin Keats likes to say hes our toughness well he has put jayen low at the line and low misses for the first time and hes not the guy you want to foul but his free throw percentage has dropped some hes 88 on the year he was in the 90s splits sixpoint game 223 left and okell gets fouled again now we told you Michael otell authored one of the biggest shots in NC State program history it will live on Music forever and he missed it 4 seconds technical difficulties there but NC State fans know how it happened for Michael oconnell whos good on the First with 206 seconds remaining Kevin Kats team in a mustwin spot theyve just been so much better in this building as most teams are at home winning is hard and its definitely hard winning on the road the leads eight Jaylen low lets it Fly cant hit loose ball Marcus Hill 10 seconds to go pit calls off the dogs and the Wolfpack are still alive in the ACC Wolfpack have been difficult to defeat in this building they continue to do so winning three games and you can see the emotion of Brion pass and his teammate celebrate his effort tonight
