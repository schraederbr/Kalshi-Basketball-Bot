the wings and of course in the backcourt youve got a couple of dynamos specifically Tyree Appleby picks up Jalen Worley to start the game off and thats going to be interesting matchup seeing whirling the much taller point guard playing against a smaller Apple Wake Forest gets to the smaller lineup with his guard thats the one advantage before this thing does happen the smallest dog they have 60 miles lets see how much their lamp bothered for him because shot clock or look in the corner Caleb Mills able to knock down to three ball Mills has been a great threepoint shooter this season but a big start for him to open up the game good opportunity to see the Wake Forest lineup Appleby at the point hildred and of course the Mario Monsanto who you talked about in the open car and Marsh complete the front Court theres your guy you talked about you like shooting I do and demarma Santos shooting close to 40 percent over the past five games from Beyond the threepoint Arc knocks down his first as we see the FSU line up worldly at the point as we mentioned Mills was already knocked down at three Darren Green Jr one of the best threepoint Shooters in the ACC Matthew flindberg and hand corn up front as Gordon is able to attack the basket unable to finish well have this opportunity at the free throw line youre already seeing theres a big difference in Florida State team when they started the Year this isnt the same one in nine team to start the season this team is is winner of four of their last six games and the insertion of warley in the starting lineup you see him coming and he assisted on the first three getting to the paint throwing a lob there so having a point guard play now with slides Caleb Mills off the ball Matthew Cleveland has less ball handling responsibility this is not the same team we saw back when November when the season started and you have to mention of course you know best wishes to my guy Cameron Fletcher who tours ACL in the Virginia game and that was the move yeah that really was able to get Morley into the starting lineup Leonard Hamilton was playing his best players of course Cameron Fletcher one of those guys but with him out it is sort of worldly a true point guard into the starting lineup well his past first mentality hes just getting more Ball moving hitting the ball to the right guy hes an excellent Defender to get the turnover as far as packs the Baseline its going to be a travel on Andrew Carr trying to penetrate inside the Florida State Defense and a great start already for Florida State who hasnt been a good road team yet looking for their first true row win throw the record out of the window this is not the same team again in the start of the season they started out one to nine a ton of injuries you want to call actually you know doing that horrific injury Reflections and this is just a different team yes we only once again attacking the paint finding Matthew Cleveland who gets on the board early his first bucket of the game and youre talking about a young man in Matthew Cleveland five straight double doubles hasnt been done since our guy Dougie Edwards did it in 199192 a long time ago his name will come up a little later Cleveland fouling Monsanto who knocks down his second threepointer of the game already the nice driving kick by Tyree Appleby as Cleveland goes out to contest the shot too much contact but you never want to help strong side defensively there thats a major mistake hes hot you want to close out and deny him from the jump you dont want to give him a passion Lane to catch it on strong side thats a and you definitely dont want to foul you make a mistake at night lets get the ball and then you fire thats it coach you told me you talked about of course you sat right down in front of us on that sideline for many years coaching in this building your first time in this booth talking about the Wake Forest being the Deacon and right now what do you like about the Deep start again the Santo getting all hit two threes is a good thing I dont you know youre a little bit concerned if youre Wake Forest right now because Florida States attacking the paint theyre knocking down shots and theyre getting the training wheel and hildren getting to the bucket that time no help off with the strong ball side and hell just able to go 101 and beat his Defender to the basket giving way force their first lead at 970 lets see what suggestions are being made offensively as well Florida State switches everything so Wake Forest is coming up early theyre doing a lot of slipping on ball screens a lot of rejection Wings nice find from Green inside to cam corn now four points for Thorne has gotten off to a great start young man whos won an ACC rookie of the week already this season nice five good ball movement over to Appleby lines it up knocks down to three one of the best percentage threepoint Shooters in the ACC with the easy look you dont want to get the second late score in the league and open the look but great ball movement Drive penetration forcing to help him I have to be knocking down an open three okay but Bills attacking the basket the quarter pass and a nice job by Hilda stepping in Applause foreign give me that car stepping in taking that charge gets his body in position outside the restricted area sees Mills out of control if youre not a shot blocker you got to come over and you can equally affect Shots by just coming over get your body in front taking the charge great job by car Im gonna have some defense plays both teams will shoot the ball in the hot clip right now still no missed shots I think thats going to be considered a turnovers Cleveland gets out of transition unable to finish off the Euro but an offensive rebound to put back the hoop and the harm Dana Wally as P4 and the crowd here unhappy with that call considering there was no call on the other end of the floor I think coach Forbes upset with just his team not getting back I mean cant turn the ball over and you got to get back they want to make this Florida State team play in a half court South Applause Music Applause foreign Applause Joel Veterans Memorial

Cleveland is coming out and averaging a doubledouble the last couple games the last five games hes averaging 19 and 11 and for the Deeks Im interested to see Monsanto coming out hes hit seven quick points tonight we talked about him early before the game started and hes living up to the reputation with the great threepoint shooting knocking down his first two three over under you being in this building calling a game for Wake Forest over under how many times you say Reed here this evening Im gonna say it again not again not again oh because he already said it once before the before the national audience joined us he already said what he wants okay Taylor Jackson getting to the midrange with the pullup in Florida State once they score one to continue to pick up full form this has not been typical in a Hamilton team hes having to play guys more minutes than usual but the style of play has not changed well hes getting bodies back this is not just the Florida State team we talked about the start of the season one and one in nine this team has completely changed theyve added Baba Miller out there on the floor those that dont know Baba Miller was in Spanish national team player first round projected draft pick suspended for the first 16 games of the year in his first action here early going to the first half court super skills everyone in Tallahassee excited about him getting his opportunities going to court his first time hes checking into the game but Hamilton recognizing theyre going to be a lot of nerve yeah for Miller in this one and I know he has to be excited about being out here with Derek green Hines one up for three maybe call that four Steve Forbes not happy about it takes the time out as Florida state has done a fivepoint lead here on the road

bundle home and auto Bob Miller u18 Spanish national team freshman projected first round draft pick suspended the first 16 games of the Season due to improper benefits for those who dont know you know we International Players youre not allowed to have nil dudes and because of that his punishment he received three thousand dollars and it was you know deemed as you know money he couldnt receive and something todays climate its just something that you just dont think of information benefits and its been the first 16 games and folks ham joked about it and said he had diapers for him today because he expected him to make a few mistakes out there tonight but hes so far so good his energy being good and expect him to play well in the defensive end hes got his hands with some balls of him and Coach ham also happy to have him back just to increase the depth of this house Golden State right now as Miller steps up having to guard Appleby and wins that battle even though after he got a good look Music Applause I think those forces upset because he sensed the way the game is going then Florida state is just out there in the Florida stations out there just playing at their pace so weve got a flop on house on that trying to get the call of course a flop now will result in one free throw can I say Im not a fan of this rule you say whatever you like I mean yeah who sticks out the hand sticks out the right leg trying to get the foul and again it was a flop absolutely a flop you dont like the fact that it is call no and you get the technical free throw on it I dont just no call let them lay on the ground and just keep playing the in one possession game conference wins is so hard to come by I just dont like it to be an automatic or technical at least a warning I dont like it being an automatic Center people could repeat that okay maybe youll take but I just dont like teeing them up in the beginning theres David willing to lose the basketball out of the bounds so now to that argument what about those of us who want to see flopping out of the game of how do you administer it if you dont give them the technical fact I just dont think its I mean well you dont talk most of the time when someone flops it just falls on the ground leave a man play I guarantee you if someone flops and falls down and they dont call it you just call them soft and tell them get up get back remember this is not the 90s what we play I get it I get it I get it but man I I think thats I dont want to give away free points for that either I get I completely understand I do not disagree with you on that and that is one of the very few things I do not disagree with you on many people will find out theres many things I do disagree with you on as we continue throughout this game nice look what ends up being a turnover for Florida State to kick ahead the Cleveland thought he got contacted on that one and Wake Forest is able to get it Appleby with the ball in his hands youre talking about one of the best assist guys in the league Bonnie Bobby Clinton does a great job getting back defensively taking away any easy opportunity watchful wakes boys can reject a lot of ball screens for the Dukes early here against Florida States pressure yeah good call to six turnovers already for the Demon Deacons but he eventually getting the basketball back Monsanto with a nice look over to Applebee once again right home wide open in the corner hit the top of the backboard thats not something you see from a guy whos super close to 48 from three and ACC today now Applause respect Matthew played the win for the basket the last time went finesse didnt get the bucket this time he goes with authority I think he was upset he didnt get filed it last time down he wanted to make sure that he was going to put this one in the room trying to put misanto in the rim with him thats going to be the second foul when damari Monsanto so a big play in a number of ways before Matthew Cleveland attacking the basket getting to the freethrow line but more importantly most likely well see Monsanto having to check out and thats unfortunate for Wake hes gotten off such a hot start hes two for two from behind the line and hes got a three and a full point play here early leading the D with seven points Music struggling right now from his field its almost four minutes without a field Applause goals in 40 seconds since the last time they got in the field goal outside of that technical free throw thats been all the scoring for the Demon Deacons well we talked about it before I said it this this is a different team when you were coming in here expecting an easy game its not going to happen you saw Forbes getting on this guy as early and telling those guys to focus because he knew his team is starting to play good basketball winners before their last six and we saw some of that and shoot around this this afternoon this force was getting on his group trying to get them to lock it and take it seriously and he told us clearly this team regardless of the overall record that three and two in the ACC as Cleveland is able to get the offensive rebound to put back now four points for Cleveland Second Chance point for the no hardest thing about playing is Florida State team is theyre switching everything you can see the pressure theyre extending it out to half court look where Wake Forest is running their offense so you got to recheck ball screens because theyre coming off theyre just switching everything so theyre really not running any sets Im going to stay forcing just to play and make shots nice look from Hildreth to the corner from Appleby who missed his second consecutive three and this is a guy you got to pick Britain up when he crosses half court hes got Randolph childrens tight brain matter of fact let me read your number something in the numbers just just guys 22 can shoot great shot there you got to find that guy baby on Williamson shoots 41 from three so definitely got to find him a lot of great Shooters on the offensive way Styles here Florida State wants to attack the paint and wait wants to attack you outside in and Florida State wants to attack you inside out they do with the Florida State team actually hit 103 points against Georgia Tech in their last win 10 for 25 and 40 percent as Tom Housewives unable to knock it down and he McLeod thought he had an offensive rebound but it didnt work out that way as the Knowles hold a threepoint lead heading up to the timeout Hamilton liking what hes seeing from his team early on the road eat like a king whos on the budget three tasty options fries drinking nuggets all for five bucks wait that cant be right just confirm that thats the real price Music Im your glitchy WiFi and Ive decided

ever love it pour your money back Randolph childrens AKA chill you have mentioned a number of times that this is not the same Florida State team tell us the difference between them in the first 10 games and what weve seen over the last six well I mean aside from them struggling in the first were going one and nine I think the biggest adjustment over these last six games is just their they gotten healthy theyve gotten bodies I think theyre searching the New Orleans and starting lineup they got another facilitator hes helping create offense so now the scorers dont have to worry about passing and getting people over they just got to worry about shooting a basketball and thats what youre doing right now youre seeing these guys coming up theyre playing More in roles that theyre accustomed to playing in and they and it got off to a fast start I think theyve been wakes fortunate that they hadnt you know scored as much in transition as they have they only scored eight points and those six turnovers I think theyve gotten to the rim a couple of times with a charge and the travel theyre pretty easy being double figures already plays alternative yeah Florida state with only two turnovers to their credit so theyve had the basketball very well and taken advantage of those miscues by the Demon Deacons as hard back to back was able to finish off in the interior first bucket for car in this I love him just gets in the paint cant speed him up plays at his own speed that time against the big Defender created for a team hell just one of those guys you think you think hes older than he is actually he does have an old man game um yeah and I dont mean it in a negative way but just the way he moves he doesnt hes not a blur hes not hes not moving a lot of quickness so he moves at a pace just a controlled pace Cleveland going to the post at the free throw line making a tough shot over good defense by Hildreth Matthew Cleveland is just a scorer he just he dont think hes a great threepoint shooter he shoots enough for you to respect him hes shooting 43 but he just find ways you score those are trying to attack that pain once again kicking it out Appleby who missed a couple of Threes attacking the paint once again Music hes down to 35 percent Applause Music missed that bad three on the Baseline before I thought he had the three there and try to take shots even when youre not making them early trying to defeat inside the corner the third turnover for the Seminoles as the Demon Deacons try to take advantage of it Im not sure if card going oneonone is going to be the move but still gets the bucket going at Worley in the middle of the lane is able to finish over the top Norm you dont see the 610 guy going 101 and beating the 65 guy to the rim Music well wakes gonna try to attack matchups when they get to match up to like the car just wanted to get to a spot he knew he was a bigger than bigger than his Defender and just got to a spot shot right over

step right into the shot Let It Go two Dynamic of the score wake needs him to get going byebye Miller in the corner looking for his opportunities weld a nice gift pass as Miller right back in the same spot unable to knock it down this one does draw Iron and one of the things we talked with Coach ham about earlier was you know is this simply about getting him calmed down getting the nerves out knowing hes going to be nervous playing his first game after that 16game suspension coach hand made it clear no we need production from him to try to get a win here on the road yeah I think hes he doesnt know the system and hes you know thats it thats what he does he can bother bother you in the defense event offensively his shots gonna come hes a squeaky shooter no hell get shots hell get his legs up on the room Im talking to a guy that shot two air balls and then told his coach dont take him out hes gonna get hot so he hit the he hit them on one of those so I think hes due wait youre

Music cottages Music back to Wednesday night with CA and chill Randolph childrens yes you have put together a list yes that would be your alltime Florida State team break it down for me yes this is my alltime Florida State starters and bench of guys who played only in college not what they went on and did as professionals but collegially in that uniform and those are my starters George McLeod if you dont know you better look him up Bob Seger threetime Old ACC guy bucket gave you some of those buckets as well Mitchell Wiggins yes Mitchell Wiggins the father of Andrew Wiggins the number one pick in the current Golden State Warriors NBA champion althoughton if you dont know Dave Collins and what hes done then you just dont know basketball yall to look up my man DC who was my assistant coach my rookie year with the San Antonio Spurs and I like your list I dont love it but I do like it I would move oh my God Peewee Barber who actually was the point guard on the team with George McCloud and so I would move him on there I would move George McLeod to the three take on witness yeah yeah yeah he called he goes second team no but on that second team is where we got an issue okay because again you and I played against Florida State of course you know in the early 90s and Florida State was a different team now the football season was over as Pam Hilton was able to get to the bucket and get the easy one giving Wake Forest a twopoint lead but Florida state was a different team after football season is over when Charlie Ward stepped back onto the basketball court they started winning yes because he had buckets with him he had Sam for sale on One Wing and Bob sir on the other wing and Im not saying Charlie Ward but shes the player but hes not on my team okay Applause deservingly something got a five second violation on the sideline Matthew Cleveland unable to get the basketball in the fifth turnover for the Seminoles Wake Forest starting to settle in a bit on the defensive in the Floor of Florida State over that last six from Beyond the threepoint range and sitting on a ball right now offensively as Hilton continues to attack the basket unable to finish I cant stress enough how difficult it is to play against a team that switches everything I mean Florida state has five guys and you can see Wake Forest is a team that likes to run their sets their back doors their cuts and now theyre being limited to just oneonone isolation basketball and rejecting ball screens because they know the switch is coming in so its gonna Force someone to make plays if thats the thing you have to be able to make plays because teams are switched you got to have guys that make individual plays and Matthews going to attack the basket denied by card great job by car staying vertical but you gotta have guys like Tyree after you really break down his van his car gets a look in the corner and is able to knock it down for three just like that you got to be plays move the ball make shots thats going to be the key to this game for Wake Forest Leonard Hamilton does not like the way things are going for his Squad Wake Forest running a fivepoint lead here at home I mean mother nature can be very powerful these storms go over all of our roofs the minute the wind stops blowing were open if youre evacuating we have food we have water come inside letting them know that youre not alone in this its been unbelievable and the way everybody has stuck together its like you can really see we have a family theres no limit to what we can do as long as were taking care of people Music youre turning it up on a defensive end here theyre letting it to turn the defense in the offense here rotating over goes vertical great Perfect Defense time is great then coming down just Ball moving ball movement Florida States doesnt match up knocks down the corner three theyre gonna have to take advantage of that when they turn defense in the offense themselves because thats what Florida State wants to do to them now how often do we see that and I know youre not familiar with this but the guy makes a great defensive play and ends up getting a look on the other end of the floor youre not familiar with it because youve never made great defensive plays but at the same time you took a lot of shots on the other end right I was the guy that just rewarded for it but no I think the biggest thing is its just the basketball God rewarding you its just great defense unselfish teammates just finding guys oh Baba Miller with his first Collegiate bucket Collegiate bucket on the putback second chance points off the Cleveland air ball is Johnny on the spot right in the right place to be able to finish it up and now having to take on the challenge of gardening Towery Appleby and losing that battle talk about being able to make individual plays Tyree outfit is the gospel Wake Forest now eight points for their leading scorer I thought Bob Miller had good defense just a better shot inside the corn off of his leg unable to handle it I mean just put Bob on the spin cycle right here just up and under Babas out there dancing but Jakes back at his nerves hes just flying everything hes just antiquing a veteran guy like Applebee just fakes like that to get angles to finish over a guy like that so its a great play good defense was better offense do you think well but at that point is saying wait a minute I havent seen anything like that before I havent experienced that in the national team nobodys giving me all that get used to a big father thats why you came to the ACC thats a guy you cannot leave open there green misses that one the cam Ford picks up the foul going over the back of Andrew Carr Wake Forest starting to build some momentum here on their home court a fivepoint lead with three 52 remains Music Applause anyone going through a natural disaster its always going to be hard to understand but know that theres always hope there is always

Demar Monsanto in the corner Monsanto now with 10 points a great job if youre a little guard High School coaches and guards if youre watching driving to the rim playing off two feet allows you to make that pass had he jumped in the air I dont think he can make that passion guys dont do it as much but its something that way amazing the way offense inspires great defense the nice trap there by Appleby and Carr forcing the turnover knocking the basketball off of Jayla Wally now an opportunity for the deacons to be able to stretch this to a doubledigit lead happy once again trying to attack getting hildren who touches the paint takes it himself and is able to finish great coaches coming out by fours hes just running ISO plays giving guys the dominant hand to get down the lane they get to the rim they can finish is not skipping to the corner they ran the same play twice see Florida State makes any adjustment to it Appleby that time fighting over the spring just clearing out dildo just gets down to a strong hand he gets the angle and just finishes the way you punish the switch you got to drive it play off two feet fine guys when they when theyre rotating and Applause great job as you mentioned of finding the right people to put the basketball in their hands to make these plays Hilger feels like he has an advantage against Cleveland on the perimeter and of course Harry outpie always feels like he hasnt abandoned with the basketball in his hands hey if Im the second lead scoring the league and second in the system its offensively gifted as he is Id always feel no matter whos in front of me a chance at making a play and that young man is having Player of the Year kind of year but youve been second in the league and scoring but nowhere near the top and assist that was not your thing sir I know that personally being your high school teammate I couldnt even get the basketball half the time oh just give me the ball now Matthew Cleveland going into his bag picking up his pain point on the evening stays the same rub screen clear out to the right hand but different options each and every time this option is finding Monsanto in the strong side quarter the second its a breakdown in that side yeah they keep making that mistake because the ball starts on the weak side theyre not making the adjustment when he gets to the strong side and theyve been laced twice on Closeouts in the Santos Music four for four or beyond the threepoint Arc all of his field goals threepoint shot as cam porn is able to attack the basketball you see the threepoint shooting Wake Forest

the basket unable to finish but you saw the Finish By James a previous possession and thats the advantage of having a six foot five foot six point guard a guy they can go finish over the top of bigger players camcord now picks up his second foul Music photo snakes not in a great deal of foul trouble tonight so thats a good thing they can hell afford to have that they need bodies and in depth for the style of play that they like to play equipment as Appleby picks up another assist Butlers first basket on the evening and you talked about Wake Forest possibly getting to 10 threes theyre at nine here in this first half are we talking about it from the game I didnt think in the first half they still got enough time to get one it is clocking a game clock so Music believe theyre going to the post big post once again able to finish over the top but it does leave wake with enough time to be able to get a quality look on this end of the floor Williamson loses the basketball unable to get off a nice shot but Wake Forest picking up the momentum here to end the first half Applause 4435 lead for the Demon Deacons and now its time to go to the studio Dallas cup alongside my sister wait whats her name oh yeah Kelsey Ray and a half yet this year you got to think youre gonna come out do a little bit of a defensive end but right now the way mansanto shooting the ball and Applebee and these guys I mean theyre going to be a tough out you mentioned that Florida State giving up a season High 44 first half points time to game one against Stetson Stetson home 44 on the nose in that loss as Applebees unable to knock down to three but Leonard Hamilton cant be happy with the defensive effort here he cant win that way on the road as green is unable to get it going to the basket the way both teams want to play in last position down weight gives you three this time Frank Lane does a better job than win this game great get a better job of knocking down threes in the first half nice fine from cam hildred in transition the only player in the ACC to have a triple double this season as Taylor Mills attacks the basket scores early only his second bucket of this game the first game on the first possession knocked down in three in the corner five points for Mills but he hasnt been very aggressive on the offensive under tour at all hes gonna hes got to get himself to this game in some way shape or form I mean hes kind of just letting the game come to him I think hes got a level of aggression Applause taking advantage getting the defender in the air and of course masanso who is a knock down shooter gonna get a lot of attention beyond the threepoint r Grange up the second time so great job by mansato getting him off his feet he didnt want to take that shot he took shots like that early in the year and he found himself on the bench he started taking better shots and shot percentages start growing up and started getting more playing diamond becoming hes becoming an invaluable piece to this to the Dukes offense and player did I think coach Forbes has to happen I can go as far as to say now I think hes the second best player behind after beat Santo up to 15 on the evening so far four threepoint field goals made Applause efficient like me yeah Im glad you agree with that you wouldnt call me anymore Ill tell someone a story about how efficient you are in a second great defense there about the Deeks driving in and theyre helping in the fast and laying almost backline like and helping all these drives theyre not respecting some of the shooters they know Florida State isnt a team that shoots a lot of Threes they know they have to to lay off certain guys and extend their defense so guys they can they can lay off so theyre going to get the faster in a lane and help protect them from driving get past danger the longest sideline Appleby tiptoeing it still maintains possession are looking to take his match up into the painted area turning it over but hildred right there on the spot goes for the Finish no call there is going to be a call whistle there Music its just a habitated here I mean cars really uncomfortable there leaves his feet you dont want to do that the rain just slopped me with the ball it was just Johnny on the spot takes it from him and goes in and draws the foul Music Applause plays so much bigger than his 64 size I think he plays more six seven six eight had a triple double only the third program history was Hana Alanas wins a year ago big fella TD did it he did it with 10 blocks I like to refer to as Mr theodorius best place to call them in rookie years San Antonio you think about this Tim Duncan had the fortunate pleasure to play with you in college and to play alongside me in the NBA I mean who could be more blessed than that I tell him every time I talk to him he doesnt believe it hell look at it that way no Im sure he does he might look at it the other way around another turnover for Florida State green over there too those are the difficult ones I mean it gives you gives you but its just unforced tin Turner was here already for Florida State and multiple times just throwing away the ball not getting a chance to shoot youre not throwing a backdoor cut or anything Applause attacking the rack the finish and really starting to grow more confidence as a player you can see hes a different guy than Hebrew was early in the season oh hes jumped eight points he made that sophomore jump Four Points to 12 points so far this year in sophomore year and his green comes back and attacks him back and he got snatched on one and he says hey I got to get you back on this and it knocks down to three yeah its like Randolph childrens wearing the number his best defense is his offense not going to compete on one end of the floor so you got to make sure you guard him on the other end weight running a lot of iso getting in the paint and fully ball knocking Mills to the ground and still to finish hildrift with 15 points Ian masato have been a thats a problem for the Seminoles here to start this second half expect Hilda to continue to attack meals if he gets him I think hes the one Defender lineup that hes just physically bigger than Music Florida State still a 12point lead for Wake Forest who was confident on the offensive end before Appleby attacking the basket green having no parts of that one coming up with the big block chase down block there Appleby had the angle on him smart playback green going to the midrange to pull up right there and I believe it as you mentioned Darren Green didnt like the fact that Hills went at him no hes been a little more aggressive on both ends of the fourth since that bucket oh hes got a challenge and hes answering the challenge right now cant have a guy go at you on one end and not go back at him nice ball movement car for three on the wing knocked down another basketball great movement penetrating kicking Full Pass difficult for any team then to make that many rotations and just a great job open man knocking down shot for some selfish 12 for car on the evening is Wake Forest opens it up to a 13point lead foreign Applause we are going to reveal random

that inspires the moment weve all been waiting for random children Wake Forest Squad there you go I didnt put myself on the list I got musty starred at the point I got Charlie Davis 71 player in the Years too Josh Howard oh so three player of the year Rodney Rogers the Rookie of the Year 91 93 Player of the Year dunking twotime Player of the Year coming off the bench I had to reward CP I couldnt punish him but skip Brown is 2 000 when even 2034 points when he retired he was the alltime assist guy Frank Johnson Rod Griffin was a player of the year Lynn Chopper twotime Player of the Year Dickie Hamrick schools alltime leading scorer aint no debate on this list so dont text me dont add me theres nothing for you to say on my list right there just leave me alone I love when you say no debate because that means Im about to debate I am going to put my guy my brother on the first team at shooting guard because I know many of you all think he was a point guard but Im here to tell you the truth he was not believe me we played together he was not a point guard when you look at these numbers second in Wake history at all time points three pointers made threepoint percentage and free throws made first in three pointers made first and threepoint percentage how can you call that a point guard the best shooter in Wake Forest history has to be a shooting guard right thats the way I look at it so therefore nothing against Charlie Davis much respect no he goes to the second team no hes not and Im putting my God chill now on the first Tyler Davis Applause for three able to knock it down has something to say to the fans along the sideline eight points for Mills now remember he is also a North Carolina native one of these games where you got guys coming from the state getting opportunity to play in North Carolina they want to put on and speaking of putting on Demario basanto continues to put on a shooting display here 19 points for him Monsanto hasnt missed the shot at some point I think you might want to get out and guard him I mean he is high with his fifth three tonight Demario masanto has three games this season when hes went over 20 points and in each of those three games hes made at least five threepoint field goals maybe on his way to a fourth here hes as good as anybody in the country and catching the basketball if he gets himself ready to shoot I think he gets himself in trouble when he starts trying to put it on the floor play with a little bit catching and shooting it I think hes as good as anybody in the country and right now hes in a rhythm any reason you think he wears number 30 nice look inside Applause Mills to corn and you know thats one of the things with Kayla Mills hes not just a score had seven assists in there win Over Georgia Tech where Florida state had a seasonhigh 23 assists to only nine turnovers handled the basketball extremely well Mills who started out the year having to place a point guard now off the basketball but continues to be a facilitators warleys at the top of the key still 14 remaining on the shot clock a bailout foul because Zach Keller they got its time to step out Kelly getting action hasnt played since the Rutgers game yeah so Steve Forbes going a little deeper into the rotation getting his third big man on the floor I think you have to because the scholar played at Florida State plays they are locked into an eightman rotation for quite some time and Florida State plays So Many Bodies at you I think you know you need to go nine if you can go 10 Deep on your bench just to give guys this Big Blocks another turnover for Florida State at 12 turnover we mentioned only nine turnovers in their win on Saturday not handling the basketball as well here on the road theres another unforced turnover as well Music I like the attack from Andrew Carr trying to get downhill this car finds a way to get to the freethrow line car who had 16 points against North Carolina only five against Louisville but playing better basketball as of late Music weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help this winner ACC Network wants to experience Esports from your perspective

will you dont love yourself oh looking back to my Santos for Three Counties Applause kind of give it to him hadnt missed a shot all night why would he start now knocking down his 63 already here plenty of time left here 22 points but damari masato two away from his career high and finding the range on the break man Santo doing what he does best just knocking down threes great pass by Applebee

five threepoint leaders in the ACC from a percentage standpoint on the floor here this evening Darren Green Jr 42 coming into the game Demar masato at 384 percent but Monsanto is moving up with an efficient six for six from Beyond the threepoint line tonight yeah he is efficient I only know one God is probably more efficient than he is tonight and hes six for six and that might be You Preach people dont realize Corey was so efficient he was sleeping his clothes when we were in high school together in time that he only needed two minutes to brush his teeth and be in a car for us to go in school so he was sleeping his uniform it doesnt get more efficient than that efficiency expert no I showered at night before I just showered you did all that yeah I sounded night before I got dressed you did and you would come wake me up too early as Matthew Cleveland knocks down to three you would come wake me up and we would go jump in the car and take us to the traffic and take that hourlong riding school which I would go back and see yeah eventually go back to sleep thats called efficiency though the thing is he what I was doing was taking advantage of my rest so I can grow thats why Im calling them yeah Im sure thats what you told me tell Aaron katzman that too Im sure he loved here now she believes that tell him I got something to sell Applause get it down pushed off a little bit with that right arm and left arm and bring with the foul meet the Flyers falling down but great job saw him extend the arm cant extend it Santo made his first mistake of the night not bad only the 10th turnover for Wake Forest they struggle with the turnovers early in this game had six within the first you know four minutes or so so it really calmed it down found their way on the offensive end of the floor ever since I thought Florida State missed an opportunity there earlier they saw some turnovers it just didnt get out and scored the kick out the bills who shot the basketball well from Beyond a threepoint Arc his third threepoint field goal made here 11 points for Caleb mills tonight still a lot of basketball left to play Music expect weight to continue to attack matchups like this were gonna attack meals every chance they get hard with the advantage still facing up a much smaller worldly cut off headed to the basket great defense by Florida State but Carr still finds a way off the loose ball so finish it on the reverse layup 15 points for Andrew Carr you can see cars as being so much more comfortable turning and facing against some of those smaller guys he can just dribble to a spot turn and Elevate just shoot over theyre not gonna bother a shot much right now you see how far Wake Forest playing off of warning Worleys still not stepping up and taking that look hes going to have to keep the defense honest at some point hes got to throw a shot hes got a cut hes standing there with the ball watching and playing him almost zoning Applause Florida State still sticking around knocking down three here Caleb Mills keeping his team in the game but the Deeks are coming right back and theyre responding got a ball game here long Joe Coliseum eat like a king whos on the budget three tasty options fries drinking nuggets all for five bucks wait that cant be right just confirm that thats the real price Music Im a screen addicted tween and if Im not posting on social media I dont feel seen hey mom look mom oh my God Mom you gotta look at this nope keeping my eyes on the road is paying off with driveways post about that boring say cheese no thank you unblock me that was awesome hey once youre at Ill tag you get Drive wires from Ball State say 40 for avoiding Mayhem like me is the toilet sneeze every blush spews harmful bacteria onto surfaces that when

everything there was to see or have you realized you cant look away and that the game has never been better Applause that is hockey hey you its that time of year again then its okay to get a little carried away for football why because this is playoff season Applause its all about stepping up and throwing down from motivation to coronation all three quarters Applause brackets ankles and new grounds come for it all wow Applause Music Applause nine ACC teams in the top 100 net rankings you see Wake Forest at 81 right there but these are the teams that youre going to start talking about considered for those NCAA bids when do we get late into the season of course one team will be in automatic qualifier maybe not even out of this Bunch but this is important especially this time of year which makes games like this so significant seems theyre fighting I mean this is so much going on we saw a Carolina group with the Armando pay cut injury we dont know how long hes going to be up its a lot of movement three or four weeks and you see the Wake Forest breakdown two and three in Quad one which is important Wake Forest a team that was left out of the NCAA tournament a year ago because of a weak nonconference schedule Steve Forbes making sure that he was able to show up that schedule a bit this year played enough the much tougher nonconference and his team is Jennifer from it as they benefit from getting the basketball in the hands of Andrew Carr whos able to finish through the contract opportunity for the one and now 17 points for Carr bring drop again theyre slipping the Trap they know they know theyre switching so hes slipping it but you know causing computer you see the guys theyre debating on whos communicating whos supposed to happen but when he slips you dont know the rule is you want to say if theres contact you dont switch unless this contact you talk touch and take and Florida States have a difficult time with that but thats the scheme those are the things that Wake Forest knows they can do against Florida State theyll continue to do that theyll reject ball screens and theyll slip them whatd you say that was touch talking lets talk and take look at you something like you know something about defense I played this game a little bit of time yeah but you never play defense you know what I love your honesty I can appreciate that I got Dave Odom was up here talking to us earlier your coach of course here and he would agree you did not maybe you didnt need to we all gotta roll huh everybody got to roll everybodys got to play their roles Music no you would actually attempt to defend when you played against me though you actually would do that Im all right well I take that back you only you only would when you were matched up with me because you made sure to tell coach Odom Im not guarding Corey in this game as Mills picks up his fourth and of course Darren Green Jr both both starting guards for Florida State with four fouls so trouble area now for the Seminoles in the backcourt not a lot of depth in the backcourt theyve got some up front you gotta let them play I think the four fouls are down 17 here possibly 18 you know this is the guts of the game I know its 10 minutes to go in the second half but if youre going to make a run to get back in this game you need those guys on the floor you need green you need Mills Music apnel with 17 points so 17 but car 17 for Hildreth as we see Wake Forest going to a 131 Zone not something you see often in college basketball coach putting out all the tricks but it didnt work yeah hell go down the bench and blame one of the assistant coaches on that whose idea was that throw that away he didnt run out again you sound like youve got a lot of experience being that assistant coach though you got blamed for them I just looked down supposed to look at now Shanes scratching his head I mean just a great pass great finish I mean you cant let the ball in the middle in any Zone but its really dangerous in the weather be one because you only have one guy back there protecting the basket so Paul gets to the free throw line area against the 131 Zone you get a threepoint shot or youll get it done Applause Applebee takes care of the freak first free throw now a second opportunity for him to get the double figures and he would be the fourth member of the Demon Deacons in double figures in this game as he becomes that 10 points for Applebees theyve got great production from their starting lineup they have and its actually great for Wake Forest because Applebees even though hes second in school and second insist his percentages he struggled in ACC play so far hes shooting 35 from you feel me since hes playing hes only shooting 30 now hes three percent in this game so amazing you mentioned that Tyree Appleby whos shooting over 45 on the season overall but in ACC play as you mentioned 352 but the crazy number is even with that 352 percent hes shooting 48 coming in from threepoint range in ACC play such as from point nine right now its unreal 248 is just incredible Saturdays are for college basketball and ACC Network and the ESPN app this week were headers starting at three Eastern with Pitt Georgia Tech and then were featuring the final two games kylester leaves number 24 Duke against Hunter Tyson and Clemson and Little John Coliseum at five eastern theyve Notre Dame and Syracuse half the day should be a great afternoon and evening of Hoops on acc Network Bravo man youve done a lot better in your second time around you know we were at Flint Hill I went to class Im not going to speak for you you know you were a senior and you kind of had senior ideas all year long you know I had to make sure I stayed eligible um where are you this weekend sir I am from tough loss today against the dookies no thats going to be the fourth foul on the corn so now three starters for Florida State with four fouls as foul trouble continues to mount up and this is one of the things that Wake Forest does in this building and they get to the free throw line and backtoback wins over Duke and Virginia Tech in this building to end 2022 they had matching 26 freethrow attempt games in both those wins so thats how they get so many threes because they put so much pressure on the paint they attack you off the dribble around the post with the pass so they attack the paint you come in and rotate and they kick out to the shooter so thats the reason why they have 12 threepointers theyre 12 to 20 you know these games because theyre attacking theyve done a great job the second demon Deacon was over 20 points in this one as he joined Monsanto who has the basketball right now I I I love the same place showing so much patience hes you know Odom I mean Music youre the flashback you know he came up here to see us on my mind is always happy to see coach how many times you see a guy just stay perfect for a game taking good shots and put him in a Groove continue to stay patient and take the right shots Cameron Georgia for a second straight game ties a career high with 19 points for him hes been aggressive we could see a third demon Deacon with over 20 in this game right now Wake Forest with a 20point lead got it going all their way here at home Music eat like a king whos on the budget three tasty options fries drinking nuggets all for five bucks wait that cant be right just confirm that thats the real price Music Im a screen addicted tween and if Im not posting on social media I dont feel seen hey mom look mom oh my God Mom you gotta look at

whats your 11th it doesnt get better than six and six from the field but more importantly one is six and six from downtown the Mars met Santos just putting on the shooting Clinic here shooting it from everywhere Baseline threes Wing threes top of the key threes hasnt missed the shot overnight four for four from free throw line careerhigh 22 points just having himself a heck of a game tonight I mean I expect him to hes got to get another one off dont you think he got to get another one the only player in Wake history to go six for six from three is CJ Harris First Virginia Tech back on Mark 10 2013 I remember CJ the great note from the only sports information director that shares the same level of confidence as you and I would be one Lucy Perez who of course gives me a very difficult time Im sure she does the same why would why would you say something like that okay she likes me better thats fine but yeah but no to your Point Break pass fine great block thats the one thing with Bobby Clinton as he gets stronger hell take that up a little bit more aggressiveness and finish that I think he went up a little too passively against the length and athleticism with his Florida State team Matthew and Cleveland goes up and blocks it at The Rim I think if he goes up strongly there he gets it its just great hops great athleticism too yeah get played with a lot of credit for coming over continuing to play not conceding to Duncan this is one of the guys that of course you know so many different players we get to know throughout this just shoot arounds and having conversations with them but this is one of the guys that you root for Matthew Cleveland great young man you know very intelligent young man thought he was going to be you know engineered both his parents of course Georgia Tech grass but decided to take his talents to Tallahassee to go hang out with Coach ham and the Knowles in a great move for him as he continues to become one of the better players in the ACC is now Cleveland pushes the basketball to find the Wally inside picking up his first bucket of the evening Applause goodness Florida State team theyre going to continue to come out and continue to fight in five feet I think the Cleveland the more they get better offensive weapons on the flow with them I think the better his game will be as well Floyds just so restricted with the lack of shooting for the stage a team it doesnt shoot Superman Music this is the one way if you Wake Forest you allow Florida State to get back into the game turnovers even though it was off of an offensive rebound not getting quality looks allowing the nose to get opportunities on the other end of the floor its only 16 point game but Florida States one of those teams that can turn you over you got to continue to take care of the basketball oh thats the second mistake that massanto made with the second turnover he just made how about Miller in the post going against cam Hildreth Joseph of course one of the stronger players you will see at 64 holding his ground and of course this is not a popular call here in the building yeah a little flopped there I thought Music Applause he he seated he knows hes giving up quite a few inches there and just I didnt see his arm play or anything of that nature only the ninth freethrow attempt for Florida State Applause 16 for 19 on the other end of the fourth and Wake Forest Wake Forest has clearly been the aggressor attacking the basket as car attacks once again Tyree Appleby for three unable to knock it down but again if youre Wake Forest you dont mind those possessions as Miller throws it away to Hildreth and do we have a career high yes yes he do it held the 21 points a career high the first time since 2005 against West Virginia in the NCAA tournament Wake Forest human deacons have had three players to score over 20 points in a game dont bring that game up here did that was that a loss no that was a final four team the dicks lost that game dont bring that game a great defense here by Hillsong Hills just Gibson still gets up finishes joins just the third deep tonight with 20 plus 20 points but we cant change history so were going to celebrate tonight Ill bring that one that one up its a little better its the last time that happened though we got to bring it up thats the last time we saw that stand away we dont want to bring that up around here thats taboo here dont bring that up here that was a final 14 now that Dicks had that year that was my guy Jay Gray Jay Gray was on that teamwork Tyron Downey Music Big E man in the middle Squad look at this look at the lead he scores for Wake Forest of course we need Deborah Monsanto to get another bucket so that he reaches a career high Cameron Hill this has already got a twoway career high Andrew Carr care careerhigh 21 points so tying his career high no forgive me Carr has 20 so we need both those guys to get at least one more bucket seeing three guys high that career high over the same game has to be because Randolph circus is in the building Applause things will continue to defending to see play in top 40 minutes you get committed to file you want to do it a little early than that but continue to fight and defend assanto picks up his fourth foul so something to keep an eye on is hes looking to get a career high has to be able to stay on the floor Applause every Thursday night womens basketball takes over the ACC Network this week Diamond Johnson and number 11 NC State take on tonight Atlanta the conference leading scorer at 255 points per game and Florida state has six Eastern Dennis Miami and Georgia Tech from McCandless Pavilion should be a good night for womens Hoops on acc Network and the ESPN app out hey the price of seafloor stage is not picking up just kind of falling back to half court this is that normal base defense to switch and everything but a part of this Im sure a part that has to do with the fact that these guys are playing so many minutes of course you and I have been around in Hamilton a very long time and the style of play Darren Green Jr actually played 40 minutes because David Bills attached the basket once again and it was down with 17 points 14 in the second half for him as he continues to be aggressive cutting the game is a 14point lead Wake Forest has to continue to play Florida state will find a way to get back into it if they dont continue to take care of their business on the offensive board and to your point I dont think everyone understands for Florida State they want their highest guy as far as minutes being around 26 they dont want guys playing 30 35 minutes a game bills with the Miss but gets his own rebound and weve got a 12 point game right now dont go anywhere because of those sure are not as theyve cut to the lead 348 remaining Florida state with some momentum the king whos on the budget three tasty options fries drinking nuggets all for five bucks wait that cant be right just

plus three free gifts hey you its that time of year again when its okay to get a little carried away for football why because this is playoff season Applause there will be no quit in the Florida State Seminoles and the reason for that is because of this man Jay Leonard Hamilton who just won his 600 career Victory and coincidentally his 400 career victory in as an ACC coach I talked to Coach him prior to the game I told him it was convenient of him to match that up together so they happen at the same time but when you look at what he was able hes been able to do throughout his tenure at Florida State now in his 21st season youre talking about a special man and he does not measure his success five wins and losses has had more to do with the men that hes helped raise this is the Hall of Fame folks I dont know I know hes up for Hall of Fame Applause Music thats their Pioneer in so many different ways so well respected about the league he looks great for his age I dont know if anybody paid any attention dont have any idea coach him of course you know won the best and again you know when you think about his wins and losses the numbers coach cam has never taken over a good job when you think about the jobs that hes taken over Oklahoma State of course his first job and people may not realize that it was Lynn Hamilton who gave Hall of Famer Bill self his first coaching job so Bill self apart to learn Hamilton coaching tree but when you think about that taking over Oklahoma State who didnt have much going on in their program and then going to Miami where they didnt even have a conference let alone a building to play in they were playing downtown in the Miami Heat arena so when you think about that and he hasnt ever taken over the jobs that you can walk into and youre able to go out and win 20 games in your first couple of Seasons well lets be honest growing up during the time and coming along coming up during the times of which he did a lot of AfricanAmericans werent giving those opportunities they werent giving those better jobs and put those to him and his wife said hes a pioneer hes plays a trail for so many people and hes still standing strong hes as good as any coach out there and hes one of my favorites Ive always respected and admired him I am Music indicative of how this team is getting better but theyre getting healthy theyre starting to play well theyre just coming across the geek team thats playing a little better than him tonight guys right there the reason why and of course masato misses his first shot on the evening but the offensive rebound by hildred making the play hell just relocating to the corner and wisely turns down no its not wisely its not down the look wait a minute should have shot the previous one no lets see thats what Im talking about time and it pulls up towards his 13th Point puts the lead back to 16 points and Im thinking Steve Forbes is going to agree with me no on that possession and not you no not at all and porn showing off his range knocks down the three makes it a 13point game once again still two minutes left to go on this one this game is not over Wake Forest has to continue to take care of their business so it makes it difficult teams with a lead like this again and thats what they do they spread you out they guards get deep like that they play off two feet they got so many shooters like look at that lineup right now if hell just see the rim theres a car theres a Cassandra just Applebee theres Williamson theres four guys out there shooting nearly 40 from the three if not better and hell just gets to the rim who do you help off of when you help youre in rotation thats why Wake Forest is knocked down 13 threes game outstanding shooting performance from behind New York any teams tough to beat you knock down 13 speaking of tough to beat the Demon Deacons are tough to beat in this building coming in 80 on the season here and Wake Forest has won 26 of their last 28 games here at home so right now an opportunity for them to go to 90 here at home this season as D Forbes hasnt rolled in especially in this building but got their first true role win last night car makes a nice hustle play saving the basketball Applause and maintaining possession for the demons great job out of these continuing to defend when the building habits right now where they ruffled you down your building habits those starters can combined seven to eight points only seven from their bench not so fast Applause pulling up knocking down another 314 made threepoint field goals for the Demon Deacons as they continue to grow in their confidence after Cleveland attacking the basket is able to finish off the nice fine from Caleb Mills now 18 points for Matthew Cleveland 11 rebounds his set his sixth consecutive DoubleDouble yeah 12 rebounds to give me six consecutive DoubleDouble the last time that was done in Florida State Greg Grady had six in a row in 1974 1975 that was like your freshman year here right Im close I might have graduated my freshman year or something like that its 19 points for Cleveland on the evening 19 and 12 again I think his game will continue hes a dynamic player a better scorings around him I think the better hell be he just does everything he puts so much pressure IQ guy cuts well takes the right shots oh the cross Appleby but three unable to finish that one but the offensive rebound to put back from Andrew Carr who goes in career high 22 points for cars weve had two guys get career highs in this game and Carr continues to battle in the defensive end coming up with the block shot great job my car doesnt shoot head shot a great this year but just tax the rum he just figures out ways to score he gets himself involved great job running in hell just actually gets his hand on the ball tips of the car theyre both doing a great job of attacking the glass Wake Forest will run out the clock here Victory on the season here on the home for 314 90 at home just a great job by the digs coming out not turning the ball
