strong performance out of him tonight if they want to end this twogame skid that has them at three and four in the ACC other side for Notre Dame Mike Brays group one and six in conference and he has always been one to be a believer in Mojo right so whatd he do Sunday in the weight room he brought in a box of Krispy Kreme Donuts I wish youd have told me Id have brought us some donuts from Winston you know thats where the original Krispy Kreme Donuts built so I would have brought him a couple he said we all had to do one as well late night beverages you cannot not eat a Krispy Kreme donut who can who could resist that well see how the sugar affects Notre Dame against this Florida State team in black on the road 513 overall for Leonard Hamilton theres Jalen Worley gives it up to the sniper Darren Green and into the corner for Caleb Mills on a Baseline Drive In Reverse for two good stall for Caleb Mills hes a guy Florida State Seminoles want to get going early and On Cue he scores in the first possession game see the starting lineup for Notre Dame Nate lisheskys the leading scorer gets it here from Dean Goodwin and had it blocked by Cleveland go to win cant follow and its cleared by Cleveland no one stops the ball oh right down the lane Matthew Cleveland you got to pick up the best player on the floor Matthew Cleveland doing Matthew Cleveland things going Coast to Coast there and a guy who is normally softspoken and quiet fired up with the emphatic Jam see the different styles in both teams defensively Florida State preciously look how far Notre Dames running their offense and Nelly at the logo and on the other end Notre Dame wants to keep everything in front Trey works on the drive couldnt get it around the length of six foot ten cam Corin it is all Knowles so far the first 90 seconds see how much Zone Notre Dame plays as well they went 5050 man Zone in the first meeting between these teams four weeks ago down in Tallahassee Matthew Cleveland here is just getting off to a fast start no one stopped the ball in transition and he just comes down and just rocks the rim here you dont want to give a great score and open dunk to get him going thats the last thing you want to do but hopefully Notre Dame tights up on the defensive end of the floor what a beautiful sun for Cleveland Corin over the top for two Camp corn from Allen Texas makes his sixth straight start started with that Notre Dame game four weeks ago and he went for 187 in that bowl game he did his season high for the freshman 187 again difficult guard for them his size Nathan chesky likes to guard hes used to guarding bigs on the interior but when youre guarding cam pouring you have to guard him on a perm but he can put it down to make plays you talked about the matchup for Notre Dames offense against the length the pressure and the switching that Florida State always does for today Florida State doesnt allow you to run your place so when youre driven by your your sets Florida States going to make you just play at some point you gotta attack him and theyll make some mistakes switching when they go to their pitch with some of their younger guys theyre not used to communicating but youre gonna have to drive against length and Notre Dame usually has the size and advantage over over the guard play but they dont against Florida State because of their length as you see thats black black shark there yeah thats six foot seven Matthew Cleveland a garden tray Works athletic six foot seven as well and Notre Dames smallest guard is six five but thats also the smallest guard on the floor for another day Florida State as well green he has that type of range missed it back iron and JJ Starling the stud freshman with a rebounded kick Cormac Ryan came up short took a tumble after launching its a midshot there by Notre Dame but thats the way you want to see them play they need JJ Starling getting downhill getting into paint and creating for himself but up more importantly for others Corin on the step through off the offensive rebound and hes got four of the eight for Florida State eight zip early both of these teams struggle rebounding the basketball so itll be interesting to see who wins the war theyre the two worst rebounding teams in the league Music go to and down the lane doesnt get the roll again he felt six foot ten corn on his hip yeah green on the Baseline tough following that is smooth and Mike Bray needs a timeout to Pace just Pace to this game right now you can tell its Florida States getting up and down but Notre Dame cant establish their defense right now Florida State just got him on the heels early 10nothing out of the gates for Florida State here in South Bend the great Leonard Hamilton as his Florida State team on the road theyre coming out backtoback losses like you said including Saturday at home against Virginia 6758 he said postgame I was surprised we didnt lose that game by more the way we played and the way their health has been this season yeah his teams tend to run out of gas if they come out right now theyre coming out all guns blazing and so to speak and theyre just so much energy but their issue has been sustaining that over the course of 40 minutes because they got guys that are just playing a ton of minutes green transition three Notre Dame just looks a step slow I mean one thing about when youre trying to match up Florida States just rebounding the ball and just running they cant establish their defense someones got to get a man you just gotta get a man stop the ball match up figure out your matchups at a later date right now theyre just on the hill you said sustaining energy is at times been the issue for Florida State not this energy first here early on as Nate lasheski gets fouled underneath and will go to the line CC on ESPN told your first meeting between these teams four weeks ago Florida state had the lead at home JJ Starling tried to will Notre Dame back into the game and Notre Dame had a chance down one at the end Randall yeah just tough luck there trying to advance the ball up I mean his team has lost so many close games all year they battle back in those role games and they actually lost a Syracuse twice the first game here they were up one with 14 seconds left couldnt close and its surprising with just so much experience of the you know in the team this team is a veteran group and you think theyd handle leads a little better than they have so far this year Mike Perez said to his team at the end of shoot around today that last week in their only ACC win so far here at home in overtime against Georgia Tech he said you guys dug in for 45 minutes yeah he said you didnt do that for 40 minutes against Syracuse in central New York on Saturday and you got what you deserved true the other thing is we also know whos judging from the 130 start no more Krispy Kreme donuts you gotta scrap that he is a man of superstition push that button and thats it Baba Miller into the game in his second career game 11 in Black came up short from three but another offensive rebound here he is on the reload on a nice step through got the roll he has so much length and size with him that hes going to be able to get his shot off whenever he wants and that time just got to a spot just elevating and finished and this is the end of the fall for Bob Miller hes out to make the biggest adjustments hes level of communicating and moving guarding on a perimeter right now hes matched up with Jane Goodwin Marcus Hammond on the drive and he played really well Saturday against Syracuse with 18 points his most in a Notre Dame uniform hes played really well in the last six games hes up here scoring averages as hes gotten healthier and healthier up to almost 11 12 points a game so expect him to settle this group down because Notre Dames gotten back into the Zone kind of slow Florida State down get back controller to Pace of this game green Snipes another out of the corner Darren Green 40 from three second best in the conference yeah Greens you know hes the one guy in this group you gotta find green with that current group of the players on the floor hes set tied for second and the ACC a threepoint percentage find him when youre in zone offensive rebound and stick back for team good win and back to back Notre Dame buckets after they started o of seven from the floor Applause good offense to rebounding and put back there they just have to continue to control the pace of the game this team struggles but you got to find this guy green connects and hes got a chance at four you gotta find the best shooter in the gym I mean he might be the best in the gym and they go to Zone twice and you gotta find thats just too easy his range is that far you have to get out there I think they were yelling at the guys you got to know where he is he shoots from Deep just going out late and I had to file 263 career made threes now for Darren Green the UCF transfer we told you one of the best in the ACC from long range well hes three for four right now so I think hes hes up Monsanto right now so if he doesnt shoot anymore I think hes second depending on what Monsanto does tonight against Clemson wow its incredible work with fractions and math sounds like he wasnt a math guy he didnt like it vet Allen Lubin the freshman in his second game back from an ankle injury popped it up trying to kick it out to Nate nashewski yeah hes working his way back into shape that time trying to make a play driving and you got to be careful against this Florida State team the guards are coming in there theyre stripping I think they got their hands on that one and forced them to pick it up and he tried to rush it past and lets just ski and threw it out of bounds bring to the bench Chandler Jackson zero in Black the Freshman from Memphis comes into the game for Leonard Hamilton theyre out there with Mills Cleveland Miller and another young freshman six foot ten Deontay green Jackson with a tough shot on the run very difficult shot you can tell theyre putting the big men Lubin and lucchesky in ball screens and of course in rotation and right now theyre either shooting threes or driving Closeouts right now theyre having their way open was battling in the post against Green and the foul goes against Caleb Mills ton of time left right now but you cant you cant Panic they shoot the basketball too well this is one of the best second best threepoint shooting team in the ACC plenty of time to come back the issue is they got to start defending and getting stopped right now theyre not doing that Seminoles with 10 or 13 from the field right now so you got to get stops you want to get it doesnt matter who you play give up those type of shots this is a streaky team because theyre a jump shot shooting team and when you shoot the amount of Threes at the Irish shoot you know youre gonna go through cold spells like this knock down 15 of them against the Syracuse 23 Zone Starling on the drive past three this is thats the one guy that can make to create for himself and others he needs to get the ball into his hand while his team is struggling and do just that put pressure on a rim and force rotation how important is dribble penetration for Notre Dame offensively to open up that shooting youre talking well you have to against Florida State because they switch everything so ultimately theyre going to force you to just make plays off the off the dribble and JJ Starling is the one guy whos gifted enough with the ball against this land and athleticism to not only score for himself but have a high assist game to create for his teammates and theyre going to need that tonight how uncommon is it to switch one through five the way Florida state does not many people do it in Florida State the problem is theyve had so many injuries that its limited to death and when you were you know they just run out of gas they just get tired and then thats when teams have made their run on them right now theyve planted with so much energy tonight but when youre scoring a basketball the ball gives you energy Jackson with the shot clock winding down and everyones getting involved for Florida State wow thats not a strength of Jackson at all this years shooting in the mid 30s up 30 at times and but its a lot easier to take those shots when youre up only his third made three in his freshman season see this is what it does you run a ball screen its just switch and then youre attacking length oh Starling no in the left hand and the rebound Miller to the rim and he draws it foul so if youre wondering things what Bob Miller can do for you when hes coming back he just grabbed the rebound theres a Wing coming down that hurts most teams they dont have a 611 wing grabbing offensive rebounds and pushing the break he just did that found Jalen wardy there who attacked the transition so hes looking to come in hes not scoring but you can see his impact and what he brings to this Florida State team now yeah pretty nice to have six foot eleven and the skill set the smoothness of Baba Miller from Mallorca Spain we told the second career game well documented by now suspended the first 16 games by the NCAA and then didnt play Saturday because of tonsillitis and they increased the strength of his antibiotics they actually thought at one point he was going to need to have his tonsils removed but its great to see that hes feeling better at a guy you see that bottom note the mock draft from the athletic perhaps he has that upside I just saw one of the scouts here before the game started and they watched him practice and they were blown away and and actually said that had he been able to play this year they think hes talented enough that he would have been a lottery pick not saying he still cant but thats the type of respect that they have for his talent and the skill set how about Miller and the Knowles have it all going so far in South Bend they lead by 21 earlier Knowles fans thrilled to see Baba Miller flanking his second game for Florida State because you see all sorts of absences and this is not the exhaustive list but it is extensive for some of the guys who have been missing for Leonard Hamilton this year I mean hes lost three guys for the season Jackson didnt have any preseason he was injured right up to the very start of the season and then Baba didnt start plays one game and then misses wonderful Thompson lies just a lot of injuries and when you play the way in the style that Florida State plays just makes it difficult you run out of bodies Cormac Ryan fouled on the Drive Camp Fletcher he had been playing very well with Leonard Hamilton he just had his ACL surgery on Friday so hes not here with the team wanted to send him our best because hes a fun player to watch he is and his teams hes really messed with these guys I mean his defensive ability and shot making in athleticism hey coming up next over on ESPN well take you to Rupp Arena in Lexington for Oscar Shiba and Kentucky hosting Georgia how about that twogame sequence for Kentucky you lose to South Carolina and then you go beat Tennessee college basketball but theyre tailormade for him I thought Tennessee Brands itself on physicality and its not a more physical player in the country than Oscar shooting voice youre not going to be youre not going to out tough him you predicted that one I did I I called that game I can confirmative its not coming Florida State in control and Matthew Cleveland wide left from three Nate lashesky the rebound and where does Notre Dame go start trying to creep back into this game Id like to see him continue to play like this not so much in sets Starling short Ryan the offensive rebound back out lacheski no thats a good possession I know they didnt make the shot but the Energys there attacking the rim attack paint touches second time Notre Dame has fouled Darren Green from three you know what when you when you emphasize to his God to a team cant give up the threepoint shot cant give it up they just run so hard to take it take it away hes talking about a guy that knocked down three already hes gotten off to a hot start with 12 points and you close out late they didnt switch like theyre supposed to you when you blow an assignment you make those type of mistakes right now and another thing just seems a step slow I mean because technically with their lineup out there now they can switch everything and I think at some point theyre going to have to they dont want to switch Nate lejevski on on these guards but hes hedging but all the other guys one through four they can switch that that was a guard to guard switch you didnt talk Cormac closed out late committed the foul and Darren Green makes all three hes got 15 of the 32 a guy who only had eight in the first meeting between these teams and that was the start of him being a little bit quieter recently from three well hes making up for it tonight I mean hes gotten on tool incredible start here Applause Hammond the Niagara transfer sticks another hes another guy that they can lean on I think his ability to get the paint create and his shot making ability shooting 45 from three so we expect him to have the ball in his hands a little more I mean between him and JJ Starlin off the screen not there for Tom house orally battled for it but it belongs to Notre Dame do you know the name a lot of time here plenty of times 10 10 29 left you want to get this under 10 if you can about a half over 20 point lead dont worry about that keep chipping away at it theyre playing a little more pop a little more energy nothing can smooth the ball against this Florida State team this team will break down and make mistakes like this move them all off the shot pay for Dane Goodwin you dont have to be dynamic with the ball when you shoot the ball as well as Notre Dame does just play off your shot fakes they gotta close out hard and you can drive it just like that Applause Corns got the size Advantage she skips it for house known as the shooter cant connect weak side rebound Hammond Ammon pushes lachesky in transition gets the roll when you get stops you can get out and run like that Florida state has an imbalanced group because their guards go to the offensive glass so if you can rebound you can hurt them on the other end just like that last possession expect on this end to put luccheski in ball Springs for teen and green matched up right now to camcord there is a ball screen lachesky gets switched onto Worley yeah you would have gone back to work I would have gone back the wall he let him drive now youre forcing the Irish to switch ball screens like that even with they do it you want to take advantage of it but when you shoot when youre shooting the ball this well you tend to you start taking quicker shots not the Rhythm shots you were taking early in the game so this isnt a dynamic shooting team for Florida State so if you Notre Dame just continue to keep scrapping keep defending give yourself a chance to play Just execute on the offensive end move the body and move your ball Notre Dame on a 70 run the last two minutes and Ryan has a chance to add to it at the freethrow line great job by quarterback Ryan yeah just turning the corner and challenge the rim using his body to Shield them off so Bob I couldnt block his shot all he could do is foul talk about the experience of this Notre Dame team Cormac Ryan 24 years old threetime captain and you were crunching more numbers on the average age of these two rotations and rosters and Ryan obviously at the Forefront of it for Notre Dame and I think he has maybe the most fundamentally pure jump shot in the league I could watch him shoot the basketball all day he shoots it as well if youre teaching someone how to shoot the basketball you put in the tape of Cormac Ryan and he keeps it high its quick no wasted motion I I think hes from a fundamental standpoint if Im teaching someone how to shoot Im watching Pro Mike Ryan youre bringing him to the oh yeah yeah yes yes Im bringing him to the sit six and seven under youth oh good cut Miller on the reverse nice feed as well Florida States playing really well just unselfish basketball not settling for jump shots and thats easy to do when you got such a big lead but 90 run for Notre Dame Goodwin shut off by Jackson bounces back out for Hammond hes got Corona Hammond gets the friendly roll from three and Marcus Hammond and for the Irish who have it down to 14 yeah great jab step backed off and again you dont want to leave a guy shooting as well as he is on the year hoping for three Jackson steps into the midrange way too strong tipped around and it belongs to Notre Dame when we come back the lead was as large as 24th for Florida State but Marcus Hammond has the Irish on the run back Hammond with the knock down three Dane a couple of teams picked top six in the preseason poll in the conference but this is how the top eight in the ACC looks at this point I think its open for anyone I think Clemson has separated themselves a little with a twogame lead big game tonight and he wins to sell them against Wake Forest gotta shake things up a little bit either bring them back to the back or theyll further extend themselves from everyone else so a lot of basketball left to play even for both teams in front of us that would pick fifth and sixth in the preseason I think theres a lot of time for these guys to catch up how real is Clemson theyre up to 19th in the country they just had that huge win at home against Duke that had the fans storm in the court I think theyre legit I mean I heard today theres a chance that chase Hunter may not play I think hes helped them tremendously and being a guard that can create they got scoring inside balance they defend so well Applause good catch underneath by Greene he got bumps and well shoot a pair another opportunity here Florida State just pushing it up Irish not matching up theyre not stopping the ball theyre not matching up properly yet direct rim run and Green catches and shot fakes and draws a foul and lucky theres not a ham on there just a step slow second foul on Nate nashewski hey college basketball quadruple header for you Saturday over on ESPN in the app it all starts with these two games Isaiah Wong number 17 Miami against Kyle filipowski and Duke in noon Eastern then Wade Taylor and Texas A M theyve won six straight against Oscar shibwe and Kentucky Miami with a win against Syracuse yesterday even though Isaiah Wong was quiet yeah the Zone bothers him quite a bit because he likes to drive and get in the paint so thats a great win with Miami because he didnt play well but again I think that team is so balanced theyre really good theyre not going anywhere but thats when the dust settled in the ACC theyll have something to say about it saw them now its six and two Deontay Green Split at the stripe you see Notre Dame heating up offensively Now by 15 after they trailed by 24 against a Florida State Onslaught here in this first half Notre Dame only has one assist in her seven field goals but expect a lot of that because again as you see Florida State just switches everything great finish there Hammonds having himself a Heckle start here hes up to 10 for Notre Dame Off the Bench for Mike Bray fall back to the 23 Zone Florida State you want to move it around and try to get that ball right in the middle near the ACC then free throw line but ahems in so watch the live in the cloud if they can get it inside try to get it in there turn over take it away by Hammond gets it back from Ryan why not hecheck swells it out Applause misses you often see Notre Dame go back into man but they do settle back into the Zone here theyve had difficulty guarding the ball when the mantoman so I think the zone is just slows and you see now it slows Florida State down but look at him trying to force the ball like they lit last time right there in the middle of the zone make it away now five to shoot Karen green walks with it against JJ starling backtoback turnovers forced by another name defense there again the Zone bothers Florida state is slowing him down hes captured him he shuffles that pivot foot theres left one and slides it back okay lift it yeah great call told you the first meeting Notre Dame played almost exactly a 5050 split of man and Zone that was the second most Zone Mike gray has used in any game this season in the 18 games theyve played so far well expected to be higher tonight he goes thank you I dont know how many more possessions a man hell play and he told his pregame I will ride it if its working yeah I think he needs to ride it a cloud passing out of that post near the ACC logo to Miller Max it out for wardley Midway through the shot clock oh Freds a good looking pass to Cleveland who missed it short yeah this is do you want to see if you Notre Dame you want to get this guy head of steam driving the basketball in transition Lubin couldnt follow the Starling Miss green off the screen no Applause this is part of the game where we talked about with Florida State to let you back in you can see their defensive intensity is dropping a little bit because theyre not used to these guys are long a lot of minutes Hammond comes up short Ryan the rebound and two theyre going to hurt each other on the glass you can see we talked about as well two of them were great mounted teams in the ACC picking and choosing their moments to hurting each other its only 11 point game right now theyre digging themselves back in it well step aside for 30 and then back to South Bend Marcus Hammond has played a key role in Notre Dame slicing in half what was at one point a 24point deficit I mean hes a guy to play starter minutes and hes gotten off to a hot start today taking a little bit of a breather right now but again his shot making ability has been much needed I mean hes playing his MCL in early in the preseason struggled getting his legs on them as the season started but hes in a groove right now like I said averages double figures the last six games and hes already in double figures tonight Florida State trying to solve this Notre Dame Zone here at this end of the floor thats where you want to get the ball to right there but you got to move after you pass it in and theyre standing there watching as well bring two strong Goodwin pumps Miller and convince a foul on the rebounding weak side another thing you see there again with Bob Bob Millers 611 guy plays on a three and he plays the four for this team so this skill set just allows them to do so many different things welcome to store hours there from coach Hamilton getting him back early kicks it out green wide open misses from Deep Corin secures it and Lubin clears it Starling risky pass carry them down to Goodwin and the Irish can reset Applause Starling oh how did pop out tried to jam on Florida State JJ Starling attacking the room tonight is a great idea any chance he gets I just think he put so much pressure on that rims nearly great lefthand finish there Koren off the turn and face who do you want in that ACC logo spot for Florida State I think you always got to put your best player I think you put Matthew Cleveland there but the problem is that when you just you got to flash in there because if you dont theyre just gonna match up against you but you want to get Matthew Cleveland in there Works yes that 23 Zone by Notre Dame has completely flipped this game now Florida state is really tentative against the zone now theyre looking for where their offer is going to come from greens missed a couple of shots and Ryan swipes Miller Cormac Ryan slows things down now Starling wanted to attack slow things down Notre Dame down by eight single digits for the first time since it was eight nothing Starling for two and its down to a half dozen just a tough matchup for any big JJ Starling just gets ahead of steam unbelievable rally here by Notre Dame responding so early I thought getting it under 10 theyre looking to get the lead still two and a half to go yeah how about that Miller on the base lock shot clock below 10 for the Knowles Worley shutout Corinth from the freethrow line a street stopper yeah its a great shot there just catching it at the elbow free throw line and just finishing its not a god known for his shooting so they backed up kind of a dare shot and he knocked it down but this is the end of the floor where things have flipped Applause go to it drives out of Cleveland cant scoop it around him and Florida state has numbers green on the rudder rebound Lubin looks like Mike Perry wants a timeout hes not even going to wait for them to get into the front Court he will take it now Trey Works decided to join the party today we know hes a great threepoint shooter knocking down to three ladies and gentlemen we have a game was 328 in favor of Florida State how has Notre Dame made this game well they switched their defense and when they went to the Zone it changed everything now the ball is not moving as quickly theyve been able to set their defense they got caught in transition early and its led to some transition points and again currently theyre on a 215 run after stuffing this game down 328 now the Krispy Kreme Donuts might be in play we might get those again we might just because the zones work the Zone where its done to Florida State offensively but thats the Achilles heel for Florida State their ability to consistently make shots we know Greens a dynamic shooter they wanted to generate turnovers and pressure with their defense as theyre picking up full court now but Notre Dame has multiple handlers and multiple guys that can initiate offense and create and they dont have to be dynamic with the ball they can just put pressure on you because they have they can spread you out and force you to guard them from threepoint line and then they can see attack the paint like this Works drove against the six foot ten corn and Cleveland ripped down the rebound it attacks and then Lofts it toward the sideline rescued by warley great hustle there by wooly you never want to leave your feet its Cleveland dude short Corin battles for the board and does keep it with Florida State at this end of the floor I think Bill Covington didnt want to call the foul to get the ball should be Notre Dames Ball but I dont think he wanted maybe he thought it was a foul didnt want to call him yeah you see that the ball or foul on the shotgun I think hell just say hey you guys take the ball instead of off corn yeah you dont want the bone I dont want the foul there Cleveland in that mid post area this thats what you want the logo had it roll out thats what you want hes your best player you live with that good shot inside the final minute until halftime Florida State by eight on the road and the game both teams are desperate to win Hammond back iron out of the corner darling nearly stripped corn theres a four second difference between game and shot clocks for Florida State at the end of the half again you want to try to get someone flashing there Notre Dame will have time to get a shot off almost a four second difference and if theyve rebound itll probably be more than that I dont think theyre going to take it down to the end and take the last shot because there is time so well three to shoot Worley picks up his dribble Cleveland tough shot goes over cormack Ryan contested Florida state had a foul to give they do it on the floor with 13 left design play versus the zone to get Matthew Cleveland as were talking about getting the ball to free at the line area three midrange jump shot raising up right there over extended English just a great shot so 13 for Notre Dame with Dean Goodwin to throw it in for the Fighting Irish one little heads up play there by Wally just about Cameron Ryan tried to get a basket in by halftime and just high level played by both teams credit to Florida State coming out strong Better Credit to know the name by responding huge lead for Florida State Notre Dame closes and its a 10point margin at the half in South Bend Indiana observing of everything he gets still as energetic as ever as ever told her shes been hitting the weights legs leg extensions upper body ABS obliques he went on and on yeah he dropped some male bees man hes trying to get his trying to get his abs back hes down 12 pounds in three weeks he told us yeah I could use some of that yeah me too AJs darling to the cup to start the second half as we welcome you back eight point game Florida stayed in front hes Randolph Childers Im Mike Monaco part of super Tuesday here on ESPN now you see The Scouting Report coming into play theyre backing off guys here at New Orleans thought I got a deemed to beat it from shooting Cleveland he has improved his shot a whole lot since last season he has turned down to three gotten more as comfortable Zone hadnt shot it well so far tonight hit the bucket right before half and got to his midrange shot there again Applause 10 rebounds in the first half he is in search of what would be an eighth straight double double last Florida State player to do that Reggie Royals 52 years ago I have him as my I have him as a nominee on my off Florida State team so I I am very familiar with who he is I might have backed out and subbed Doug Edwards in for him at the last minute but he was on my alltime Florida State team were you around firsthand no no no no no I wasnt I wasnt but I did my research on I did my research 10 point lead Darren Green he had 15 in the first half tossed it back for Cleveland back out Caleb Mills he had two fouls only played Seven Minutes in the first half he gets bumped gets gets it to go and Caleb Mills with a chance at three for the Knowles hes just a natural gift of school its not a great shoot hes a really good score to basketball just scores off bound and shots like that takes to make difficult shots and you see heres one right here just off one leg takes the contact Falling Away Music great site for your Florida State fan get him back in the game its a third lead score but hes a really explosive scorer when hes playing and hes interviewed lets see if he can get back into this game have him sit and sat for so long we talked to assistant coach RJ barsh at shooter out today he said Kayla Mills is the guy that has to step up because he can bring other players along with him in a way than maybe other guys on the roster cant do to the same level because not only is he a gifted score hes a gifted Pastor for a long time hes in his more natural position now being at the off guard but the start of the season they had to plan a point so now with warley coming in and his game elevating its allowing him to slide off the ball and score a little bit more and then create when he does that so it takes and you have to guard him whereas the warrior you can play back off and say hey take take these jump shots and if you make them well make the adjustments with his meals you got to guard him Cleveland off the lob Florida state ran that a couple of times in the first meeting against the Irish Zone but a turnover on the Baseline Applause its not a name youre still in this thing just run your offense but at some point somebodys gonna have to make a playoff dribble because they just they switch everything theres a good one hes going off the bounce all the bills to the basket there you go attack the rim someone comes Skippers it up weak side corner if they dont you got to finish just like that Applause foreign Applause just automatically went down you dont get that bump anymore defensive guy has position he cant just run right through his chest like that great call great defense did about picks up the second foul on corn s now on Hammond trying to stay in front of the six foot four guard for Notre Dame Applause Ryan drives on Cleveland Worley switches and Ryan was out of bounds on the Baseline so just the third Notre Dame turnover youd like to see someone else do that I mean Cormac kind of receiving it you know you want to see Trey work so you want to see Hammond kind of initiating when things break down and Cormac with that sweet jump shot kind of finishing things as opposed to him trying to initiate the offense Cleveland on the Baseline against the Zone Mills kept it alive tossed it back out for Worley Applause on the puck for Worley 8 s it down Music great shot by one he coach said hes been working on his jump shot he doesnt take many but sometimes to keep the defense honest you got to take those shots and cant let them just kind of sit back and sit in the paint on you so if he starts knocking down shots then look out hes put a lot of time into his jump shot Hammond is blocked by Cleveland Mills in transition kicks for Cree too strong rebound Greens kind of cooled off a little bit he had 15 quick points missed his last couple of shots here good look there though open three in transition word strives ran into a trio of Knowles Hammond great offense great offense there just penetrated threw back behind the ball its a hard rotation and when a person drives back Baseline and someone feels behind its hard for the defense to recover there and is good offense but I know the name you see 13 from Marcus Hammond hes made three threes Worley works out him Worley to the cup gets the roll so hes made it three and now attacks hes so gifted at that I thought he did a great job at the previous game when I saw it saw him play just kidding to paint and create for everyone hes not a great shooter but if he can make jump shots he keeps you honest and really good on ball Defender Hammond spins one out Cleveland in transition on the Euro gets the roll hes so great at that rebounding him pushing thats the most dangerous thing that he does when he grabbed when he rebounds as well as he does pushing it in transition just makes him very difficult to guard and a timeout Mike Bray Mike Jalen ward he only shooting 29 on the three but he doesnt care white Brave fiery in the Notre Dame huddle during this time out okay hes got a challenge these guys he did a great job of Defending in the first half after they fell down to that 24point lead he couldnt pretended to have Florida States coming right out in the second half they go five of six shooting kill the lead back up to 15 the game is far from over but with this experience group you expect him to come out and start a second half a lot better and he knows what this team is capable of when they defend and hes got to challenge these guys because quite frankly this is a game that is fighting Irish they have to win this game at home so one and six in the ACC thats tied for second to last in the conference only ahead of winless Louisville and you just get the sense that Mike Bray has really spent much of this season trying to push the right buttons with the team that won multiple games in the NCAA tournament last year they did lose some big pieces off of last years Team Blake Wesley one and done first rounder Apprentice of the point guard Paul Atkinson the big but Mike Bray has been trying to find the right recipe with this years group theyre down by 15 here at home in South Bend uh Notre Dame here in South Bend I think the biggest thing that we take for granted with the team I think when you look at this team youre kind of figuring out this team was picked sixth in the ACC they made the tournament a year ago whats missing you know well Apprentice hubs gone then you get Marcus Hammond you think like okay thats a fair tradeoff weve got the same similar production Blake Wesley comes in you make 14 points a game he leaves early you get this High recruit this McDonalds AllAmerican JJ Sterling comes in similar production but the Paul Atkinson production at 137 they just cant make up and you can see that missing his ability to throw the ball inside against games like you need to make games like this or any game that production inside they just dont have and and its a significant blow to this team and theyre pretty much just a preliminary team so hes the one guy theyve been unable to replace and you could argue without a true point guard on the roster as well without Apprentice Hub and for as adventurous as the Prentice Hub experience was at times last year because muscles in for two more he didnt shoot the ball great last year but he showed up in big moments in late games and I think his maturity allowed Blake Wesley you know to to get comfortable in his role with the team as well Mills pushes off the go to win Miss and Cleveland went up for the lob on the Baseline straight flash by Taylor Mills I dont think Cleveland was expecting that just great look and find the transition works no and a rebound Miller he gets tangled up with Goodwin Bob Miller went wrestling for that loose ball Arrow points to Florida State great fight by both teams that you want to see Music teams are going to the bench right now Notre Dame got plenty of time to told us theres nothing to look at there I didnt think there was anything theres two guys falling to the ground with the ball so another name extends out some pressure out of Florida State Leonard Hamilton right now has Jackson Miller Mills Cleveland and Corrin with five on the floor for the Knowles Im shocked to see theyre not in his own right now I think theyre going to have a difficult time containing the dribble against this Florida State team but theyre in that mantoman Mills behind the back dancing on the Baseline Cleveland hoists boy Matthew Cleveland is a star in the ACC he shot the lights out of it yesterday got off to a slow start today and great drive by Caleb Mills no ones shooting it better right now than Matthew Cleveland a little bit is fouled by Jackson oh the offensive rebound Clevelands got eight straight double doubles now just playing as well as any player in the league right now gotten off to a slow start as his team did at the one in our start but theyre well on their way if they can hold on with this game theyll be 500 in any ACC and no one expected that when they started the year the way they did how high can this team still Ascend how much someone that will be with Matthew Cleveland he kind of Caleb Mills is sliding back to his natural position at the off guard because the Ascension of Jalen Wallys playmaking in past first mentality I dont think anyone knows what Baba Miller is going to bring to this team we know what his potential is but as he becomes more comfortable and more productive theyll look out because his versatility in the perimeter and then you can slide him down to the four then look out and this is only the eighth of 20 yeah we got a long way to go were not even at the halfway point in conference I always say when you get into February you know then you know you know what your team is and you know what your team isnt right now you got guys coming back from injuries and all those sorts of sorts of things when you get to the month of February you know a lot about your group Mills is bumps you know with Cleveland as well we were talking to Leonard Hamilton yesterday when they came in for practice last night after they landed from Tallahassee he was singing the blues you know backtoback losses and we said well who are you most pleased with as far as players go and the first guy out of his mouth was Cleveland and what hes done for this demon we set it off the top Leonard Hamilton called him the backbone of this team yeah hes had every reason to be proud of what that young man dance green finally gets it going again but scored 15 quick ones in the first half and 12 40 mark finally gets his gets it going in the second half I think Hammond missed the opportunity there with Baba Miller in the air to kind of get it three free throws lowest entry for the Freshman Van Allen Lubin and hes blocked by seven foot four nahim McLeod yeah I dont think he had a chance to get that off against Newton the cloud 74 Mills slashing tipped around last Touch by Hammond out to Ryan Notre Dame runs works no track down his own rebound he was the last to touch it and its Florida State Basketball City adjustment made by Florida State as soon as Notre Dame goes to the bench and brings Lubin and he comes in breaks McLeod and he wants to keep big on big Papa Miller needs somewhere to go and its a fivesecond count pressure mistake there too youd want him to call timeout if we could but hes Young Hey Olivia miles and the number seven Fighting Irish women play their next game Thursday night against Clemson and then after that Sunday afternoon over on the ACC Network Notre Dame against Virginia at 144 coverage starts at two Eastern Olivia Miles by the way over the weekend at Syracuse she got surprised by her family they came in made the trip to Central New York to watch one of the best players in the country words gets bumped by Florida State hell have free throws on the other side Knowles in control on the road Music and has stepped up hes got an eighth straight double double and we still have 12 minutes to go Matthew Cleveland just doing Matthew Cleveland thanks its almost like just expected out of the mail for a guy hit size he rebounded the basketball at a high level we talked about it and he opened the house improved threepoint shooting to prove a jump shot hes always been a great slash in driving to the basketball but right now hes dominating the glass and I think one of the most dangerous plays in eacc is when he rebounds it and he starts leading the break makes this Florida State offense even more dynamic Leonard Hamilton said to us last night Steve Smith one of the Florida State assistants has done a ton with he had to Cleveland to work with him not just on his shot but also on making him more vocal and the communication piece as well for a guy who naturally is the more studious yeah Ive known Steve Smith a long time hes a heck of a coach and Im not surprised a bit he actually closed it close to Clemson so hes familiar with the league and got an opportunity to come over here and coach Hamilton Raves about him hes just a great teacher of the game relates to his guys and someone that I expect to be a head coach in the coming seasons part of the Great Florida State staff Stan Jones of course long time outside of Leonard Hamilton Music Ryan off the shot pick got Cleveland to fly by missed the shot I think those two guys are attached at the hill when one goes the other ones going team cloud with the catch and finish there finally got his hands on one 74 big man with Florida State on the feed from Cleveland Hammond hits thats right in front of us look so good when he left his hands he someones got to help Marcus Hammond out I mean hes been hes been the offensive guy right now hes got 16 here and whos gonna be the other guy to step up and take some of this offensive pressure off of him nobody else with more than six points for Notre Dame alongside Hammond Chandler Jackson the shot clock below 10 back up top for Darren Green in the logo green looking for some separation and hes hot again wow just like that you can see him just sizing them up looking to get space and when youre guarding a guy like that he can shoot it from the parking lot so you got to get up on him and just a great job there hes hes in the groove tonight Miller fouls works you dont have to jump the dunk so easy for the big guy green just looking for space damn its too far off you know the same hand down man down on my guy Mark Jackson there just Florida State looked just like that back up 21 and just when you thought the Irish had it cut into this lead ahead of game and now Florida States on the Run a 1016 to go here at Purcell Pavilion in South Bend Dave lashesky has to throw it all the way into the backcourt and Ryan Shields from Worley Notre Dames one of their last eight from the field wheres their offense going to come from Ryan is fortunate that that was a kick ball yeah it was Applause I made the wrong read there clay was the opposite side to him and tried to keep the ball in a strong side when you penetrate against the Lambs always look weak side Ryan off the Baseline out of bounds no Florida state has numbers here if they take they want to take advantage of it instead they Now operate in the half court offense against Mann from Notre Dame Edwards picks it from Mills Trey wurtz in transition and green tries it free from him and it will stay at this end of the floor hey weve got a college basketball quadruple header for you Saturday over on ESPN in the at Miami and Duke thats a big one at noon Eastern here in the ACC and then in the SEC Kentucky and Texas A M should be another loaded slate of college basketball this weekend when youre getting to a point of the season right now for some scenes where they become musk wins they become games that you just have to win we felt that way like Notre Dame and I think that Miami Duke game at home I think thats a game that Duke has to find a way to try to win that game we know Jeremy roach is out what else is wrong in your opinion with Duke right now well thats a big what if youre talking about a first team guy and when youre starting all freshmen you need your all ACC point guard there battle final four tested experience point guard in the lineup to help settle things down because hes another Creator and he makes things easier for that crew so getting him back and then being healthy will be enough interesting thing when this game is youre seeing Mike gray is sticking with his uh his mantoman defense I think hes just challenged his group now I think hes hes you could go with the Zone he said the heck with that you guys he challenged him were gonna guard these guys man man I think hes testing his guys he challenged him in the timeout they came and responded I think hes trying to say hey Im not going to fall back in the zone because theres enough time that if they wanted to get back and fall back in the zone to give them an opportunity to get back it worked in the first half I dont think they can sustain guarding this Florida State team in a mantoman defense you know one thing with Notre Dame that I think is interesting that Mike Bray has mentioned a few times this season is how serious this group is especially some of the seniors 50year seniors on this team as words misses and that hes trying to to get them to find the right balance between loosening up and and being locked in and focused as warley scores for the Knowles and now Marcus Hammond down in some pain for Notre Dame thats about the last thing they want to see no you cant you cant lose them just because theyre not a deep team and you cant lose them because hes been their best player tonight so he hobbles off for Notre Dame Cormac Ryan comes back in Now Matt Sona gets up off the Notre Dame bench seldom used Reserve sort of the eighth man for the Irish thats a spot Mike gray Through The Years rarely goes to but anyway were saying that its a really serious group we asked him today and Mike Perry said yeah it is as serious a group of seniors as Ive ever had and thats been something for him to navigate over the course of these I mean it matters to these guys and I know you look at the score now you look at their record and you dont think it I think sometimes when you get in this situation I often say it feels like youre in quicksand because you want it so much and youre trying these guys are working their tails off and you just you just cant feel like he can catch a break were sitting here talking about this one game this is a team thats dropped four games in the ACC that theyve led by double digits or theyve LED late and things could change I think itd be five and two right in the hunt instead in danger of falling to one in seven in conference Works to the cup and then you you know you talk about a team your preseason picked sixth in the country in the ACC and you just havent been able to live up to the expectations right now when you think youve replaced a lot but as we talked about them losing Atkinson is just big zone of the rebound off to Caleb Mills Miss inside of eight minutes to go here in South Bend werent sparrows to the cup for two more great Strong finish there so now with zoning and they dont want to switch they dont want to put a guard on them so now with the bigger bodies they want to change things up lets see let it happen to make that adjustment timeout Leonard Hamilton theyve got the lead seven talk about one of the things thats so dangerous about the Florida State team is this right here where Matthew Cleveland rebounds the basketball he pushes it its just offsets your defensive setup cant find guys cant rotate hes either scoring or hes finding his teammates tonight he has 12 rebounds a couple of assists we already talked about it has eight doubledoubles eight straight double double tonight I dont know what more you can say about him Coach Raves about him hes his best player and hes just I mean hes hes doing it all right now hes playing as well as any player in the ACC its not the end of that play as well thats when Marcus Hammond rolled his ankle saw him sitting on the bench he was getting medical attention and now just sitting alongside his teammates on the Irish bench they Trail big coming up on seven to go here in the second half heres Cleveland again going to work backing down on cormack Ryan sticks right with him and commits a foul on Matthew Cleveland and utters something in Brians Direction hes trying to get to a spot there he loves to take smaller guards get to about 10 to 15 feet turn and Elevate home I thought come back Ryan did a really good job of holding his ground if he just went vertical there competing on a daily defensive man I think hes the best perimeter defender in Ill say this about him I think he has a chance to get invited to someones Camp as a threeandd guy Cormac Ryan I do I do I mean I told you about this shot I think he shoots it as well as anybody else I think hes a underrated Defender I dont know why the last couple of Seasons he hasnt gotten that respect I think he deserves on the defensive end you said best perimeter Defender yes hes the best defender period yeah thats true yeah on his team I dont think they have many Defenders at all so but even in years past I always say perimeter Defender but yeah hes hes definitely the best defender on this team and into your point on the shooting 37 from three that translates and if you play somewhere where he knows thats what it is I think those numbers can improve youll be a guy youll look up in free agent camp and look up and a year or two is on someones roster he is the vocal leader on this Notre Dame team as well because he got size he means a 65 guard that shoots it in defense at a high level look at that lays it in everything with the layup translates hes got to punish you got to punch that down you get out on a break Im talking you up and you make a new place yeah you gotta dunk that baby you cant lay that up but hey it counts as two anyway Applause what would you have had in the bag there windmill oh yeah I would have I would have did the double pump off the glass layup I might have stopped a shot to three to be honest until youve done that too and thats insulting itll pull up three on a breakaway oh my coach I think I even would have got yelled after doing that Starling to the rim its a 15point game just under six to go again theres plenty of time and if they wanted to go Zone they could it turned things around early but I think Mike brace challenging this group like step up and defend and he gets another pair of deflections and now Notre Dame runs lacheski hits there it is all right now Applause theyre capable of this hes challenging on the defensive end and theyve shown they can do it hes not falling back Zone guard the ball guard your man as coach Hamilton says Ive seen enough Applause 131 Run for the Fighting Irish yeah call Mike Ryan we just back on cue there he must know I was talking about him just got his hands in the passing Lane hes making plays in the defensive end Stills gets out Id like to see him Tomahawk that but the lay is nice either way comes down on the other end there I mean its just translates JJ stalling getting strong to the rim theyre making a run back in this game theres no quitting this fight now were taking two experience and the chesky 610 big stretches the floor well shoots it as well as any big in the country and sound that I can run here they got enough for them to do it lets see if they can sustain this defensive effort because theyre not a deep team lead has been as large for Florida State as 24 points a couple of times this season biggest comebacks in Division one mens college basketball this year 23 points its been done three different times BYU in November Charlotte in early December at South Dakota state in the middle of December and now Notre Dame has whittled it down to 12 with 519 to go see I thought they try to sneak a possession of the Zone in there coming out of the timeout you know he was going to drop a man play get one of his guys isolated mantoman so I thought hed try to go Zone but stick to it hes challenging his guys sit down and guard the basketball Starling is battling in the post with Deontay green late shot clock Cleveland cant hit rebound Hammond startling in transition Goodwin short where does Florida State go I think you just run your offense you know if theyre going to stay mantoman they have multiple guys that can attack the pain off the dribble and put pressure on the rim so just run your offense expect to put nashewski and ball screens like theyre gonna do here theyre gonna come back put them in ball screens again force them to switch and then you gotta attack they got green set another screen Goodwin switches on to Green late shot clock again green spinning cant hit wurtz extra pass now Starling with Hammond back into the game for the Irish at some point someones got to put pressure on the rim they gotta get in the paint put pressure on the rim there you go Goodwin off the cut its down to 10 points yeah cant keep selling shooting jump shot you want to take three got a lot of Shooters out there but you got to put pressure in the rim you cant play outside in them sometimes sometimes youre gonna play inside out Applause 90 run the last two and a half and 151 the last five minutes green his foot and a turtle Notre Dame will have the ball and the momentum when we come back ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance its easy to down inside Purcell Pavilion this game has been wild I mean Florida State nine minutes into this game was up by 24 its largest lead of the Season Notre Dames biggest deficit of the season but multiple times when it feels like Notre Dame is dead well they just havent gone away theyve just dug deep got stops and now theyre starting to make shots so talk about game unheard basketball is a game to runs but I didnt know it was going to be the game of runs of this magnitude 10point game three and a half minutes to go Notre Dame you saw on a 151 run to get back into this thing and words Big Shot swirls it out offensive rebound good win a fresh 20 Starling is wrapped up by Worley and had it roll out Applause I think coach Greg got a legitimate call I thought it was a breakaway I thought he had a direct line to the basket and I know it was not that Breakaway but he found it literally rotten from behind you cant say thats going for the basketball it just grabs them Music so just two shots and shots there for JJ Starling we get word from the officials Starling goes to the line just 62 percent there here it is freshman season makes the first coming up next over on ESPN just over 10 minutes from now well take you to Rupp Arena in Lexington for Oscar shipway and Kentucky hosting Georgia its a big game there for Kentucky following a Tennessee game you want to try to try to build on that split it the strike for Starling Florida States lead is nine 3 15 to go thats all right they got to continue to do it on this end and it wasnt an empty possession one or two free throws you got one thats fine its got to continue to guard you and of course Florida State into four minutes without points for the Knowles Cleveland backing down go to win sends it back out for Worley trying to take lisheski off the bounce Worley with a hook shot that goes thats a big time shot there bonuszewski he wanted to attack him in the switches and Wally just with a great move and a great finish coaching staff told us earlier today hes got to be in double figures hadnt been all season until tonight with 11 and startling answers and its back we got extended pressure here you got to pick up now and got to get stops Worley right to the rim and he gets fouled its a block on lashesky and Jalen Worley will go to the free throw line yeah I think he was late getting there great drive by Wally Music slots over there at the last second he tried to get out of the No Charge there he is just got caught moving sliding over there as Jalen Walley went to his left hand to finish 65 and his two years collegiately for the sophomore from Philly misses the first yeah thats a little hitch in the shot I know hes been working on that again we talked about that earlier with the work Steve Smith coach Steve Smith does with those guys and staring into the teeth of the leprechaun Legion splits nine point game 2 23 left with cormack Ryan on the bench for Notre Dame theyre going for the offense here with the five on the floor yeah keeping both great defense keep putting pressure on the rim Goodwin got it back carving out space force one up and well defended by Caleb Mills great job there about Mills and Cleveland coming over to help thought when he spit he saw the defender I thought he could have cooked and kicked it out for an open Defender a teammate for three but didnt see him had a good look foulon works his second Notre Dames last to give before the one and one Applause Florida State trying to get back to 500 in the ACC for all the injuries they have dealt with this season and theyre gonna go for the quick foul on warley put him on the line hes the guy you gotta if you want to file right now the other guys are too good from the free throw line you know Cleveland is the second worst free throw shooting hes 70 percent the rest of the guys here are 80 plus so I think whenever one he gets the ball youre gonna foul immensely almost like Hackensack situation for the rest of the half even the big guy Camp corn at six foot ten for a freshman 82 percent but I wouldnt hesitate to foul him as a freshman here because I dont know if hes been in this situation yet in a game like this on the road Worley makes the first but you got to get it close enough to put pressure on him right now 10 point lead under two minutes to go its not a lot of pressure so you need a little bit help in that aspect because you cant let them milk the shot clock Worley splits two of four his last two trips 10 point game just under two minutes left you got to go quickly here Applause lacheski straight on no offensive rebound again you dont have to shoot a three get to the rim words did now back out Hammond off the shot fake yes down to seven you dont have to take the Reed there put pressure on the rim Force rotation and then find your threes if not just finish at The Rim do you funnel it to Worley and foul him or not theyll just foul Caleb Mills this season 82 for his career yeah hes not the guy you want to foul but the the clock is your enemy right now the ball touches the paint there good kick out I thought he could I thought he had shot right there but hes a lefty lefties like to go to that right hand to get in the Rhythm and he knocked it down hes been in the Rhythm all night one and one and Mills makes the first very early for Notre Dame to start fouling they basically started doing it with two minutes left yeah but the clock will be your enemy you want to string his possessions out and they they look they look at as though you can go two for three so theyre going to drive this basketball again if they rotate theyre gonna look and take trade for three for two they like their odds of free throw line rather than their ability to get a stop because the enemies theyre against the clock now you dont want Florida State now they get one possession they can run a clock under a minute and the time is against you now so now you just got to move quickly and you got to score obviously driving dont just settle for three drive it Force rotation like that and finish shoot go to win bang for three even with Bob Bob just into the game closing out in him at six foot eleven and now you got another guy between Wally and Baba they put Baba into defensive purposes but now you can foul him and now thats what the mistake was made Baba didnt rotate you see Caleb Mills kind of talking to him now and let them know like thats your rotation there big fella so watch 11 in black on the rotation yeah came over to help hes saying I didnt need the help at this point in the game if youre Florida State youre okay with sacrificing two point shots you dont want to give him three like Baba Miller did there theyre calling him over to the bench to explain that because if you make your free throws youre okay with giving up a two youre just trading two twopoint shots and going two for two one and one front end make for warley thats a big free throw right there and this is what Florida said I think theyre trying to tell these guys hey were okay with them scoring the paint too dont help dont rotate so Bob Miller making a freshman mistake there makes both the lead is eight with 109 left for Florida State same thing ball screen attack the switch get to the paint to get a foul that goes against cam core and he got tangled up with Nate lashesky 16 fouls on Florida State for 104 left Notre Dame to inbound on the Baseline at this pace the game seems takes forever but its just you see Mike gray knows the clock is his enemy right now hes just stringing the game out he knows he has threepoint shooting at HIS suspense hes just gotta get lucky and make a couple more a reminder we will get you to Lubbock Texas Baylor Texas Tech coming up five minutes from now Hammond no weak side rebound Worley whos trying to be the closer for the Knowles one dangerous thing about right now you got enough time to make them try to force it to someone else but you put Wally at the line a lot and hes you know hes not a great freethrow shooter but you notice hes starting to get more comfortable hes getting in the Rhythm and its like practice you want to put a guy that had been in the wild and sometimes you get lucky with those guys like I found Matthew Cleveland hes only 70 in a year but double bonus now two free throws for Worley and again we told you the coaching staff said this guys got to score in double figures for us tonight something he hadnt done all season I I think hes been the reason this team has taken a step Matthew Cleveland has been I think hes been really good all year long but his development and taking over that point guard role in creating for himself and others has freed up Caleb Mills to score and freed up Matthew Cleveland even more and I think its why that Seminoles are on their way to being 500 in the ACC orley and Cleveland wrap up warts there on the drive its warley who gets hit with the foul Music still not over yet you know youre still going to foul and you need some help making some free throws or you need a turnover so the one thing Id like to see Notre Dame do here is extended pressure full quote on the ball try to get a five second call they got one early tonight you know when Bob Miller took it out you got a five second count then extended impression try to deny and then if they get it in then you file Trey wurtz makes the first Applause its three for three at the line today 72 percent this season for the fifth year senior thanks both yeah whats your biggest defender on the ball now Florida State here you can run the Baseline Applause Cleveland does Keys it into Corin and the big bodied freshman will go to the line for the first time tonight yes we told the 82 percent this season but you said freshman and a guy who hasnt been there you would like to put that type of guy on the line yeah you got to be careful of warley because again hes fouled him so much you put him in a rhythm nothing wrong with putting the Freshman up there another guy that had been there I know he shot 82 percent but most of that is because he hasnt shot a lot of free throws either guy was in the ESPN 100 had a huge game against Notre Dame the first time and steps up and knocks down the first man cool as a cucumber they didnt think twice about it how about these youngsters for the Knowles hes stepping up here oh wow Orleans stepped in hes lucky Bill Covington has allowed him to get in the free throw line there because thats a violation they could have taken that away Matthew Cleveland and Caleb bills are looking at each other saying whoa we just got lucky like what are you doing and coren unfazed sticks both showing why hes 82 percent 10 point game 50 seconds left words pass Corin eightpoint game 452 seconds left and Mike Bray takes his final timeout again the lead was as large as 24 if youre just joining us right now if Notre Dame were to come back certainly a tall mountain ahead that would be the largest comeback in Division one mens college basketball this season but Florida State at the free throw line is withstanding every Notre Dame push they have they struggle from the field you know doing these runs but man they have stepped up with water in their veins and knocked down Fritos everybodys been pretty solid uh all these missions one of each his first two trips and since then theyve been like so you see the three teams that have done 23point comebacks this season BYU Charlotte and South Dakota State the jackrabbits and Florida State trying to fend off Notre Dame down the stretch here still got a little time here man you got to get a little lucky you gotta hope for a turnover a couple of mystery throws now I cant continue to now youre running out of time to give up two and trade 23 you know free throws and twopoint baskets now so I Notre Dames gonna have to come down and just start running this set play trying to get threes which is difficult against Notre Dame because Notre Dames dealing with me Florida States gonna switch everything so all your plays and your actions to get threes theyre gonna switch you know we talked about they made them by Bob Miller made that mistake earlier rotating theyre not going to rotate it its going to say hey if you want to drive in and finish the rim go ahead youre gonna have to file a little trade two for two until the game is see if they can get a five second count here programming note super Tuesday will continue we will get you to Lubbock for Baylor and Texas Tech Rich Hollenberg and Chris patola standing by for that one 45 game seconds from now Cleveland runs the Baseline its in the Mills they get a trap they try for a tie up instead its a foul they get Nate lisheski for the foul of Mills its lacheskis Fourth and Kayla bills an excellent free throw shooter well go back to the line I was always frustrated with that as a player because I think at times theyre expecting you to file in that situation and youre just actually trapping in I think core Mike Ryan would tell the ref like hey we were trying to tie them up we werent going to file until he passed it out of the track Mills three for three tonight yeah hes the guy you wanted the line there lets have a look yeah see the Trot are you thinking youre gonna file thats about Im good with that of you I dont know depends from a Notre Dame fan I wouldnt be no you can see Kayla Miller saying Hey I want these free throws I want the ball in my hands and you know he makes both 10 point game 40 seconds left Wirtz pulls up spins it out Cleveland another rebound hes got a careerhigh 15 of them trying to put this on ice for Florida State what are streak hes on right now rebounding his basketball at just such a high level and again as we talked about it early in the game his rebounding and pushing the fast break helps his team so much because they struggle at times to score and if you defend 81 points as short enough points to win in a row theyve had their struggles at some points during this game but credit to the Florida State team they continue to compete and play hard I mean Leonard Hamilton was a Leaguer he came limp again he recently had hip replacement surgery in the last year so hes hes on the mend and you said coach how you doing I might need to shoot up tomorrow night meaning here in this game here tonight hes just been beaten down by all the injuries not just this year but last year as well but boy how about the fight in his group on the road tonight yeah well he was not sure if three of his players are going to play tonight so all three guys end up playing playing what enough for these guys to win and theyre gonna leave here with a win Corin ahead of the pack for an exclamation yeah Darren Green and Matthew Cleveland yesterday and Sunday they both did not practice sounded like just some rest for a guy two guys who have played heavy minutes yeah but they were good to go and they were the stars for Florida State to get a road win here in the ACC against Notre Dame and Bob Bob may look unsure he started eating today from his tonsillitis great effort great effort by both teams tonight but Florida state was a better team they just came out with big rounds established it early Notre Dame just ran out of gas credit for Florida State fine got themselves back to 580cc they hang on on the road led by their star Matthew Cleveland that does it super Tuesday continues we will get you to Baylor and Texas Tech Rich Holland
