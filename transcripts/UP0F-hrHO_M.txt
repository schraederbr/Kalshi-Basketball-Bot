Sharpshooter NBA champion as the opening tip won by Cal the home whites for the Golden Bears and mercy Hurst in that dark green as the Lakers are 4 and three as they started their West Coast Swing and the bears attack immediately inside with motty Soko with the games first points I like the ability again of sty yakovich to attack and create an easy score for his teammate and they go inside of the big man Soko Mercy Hurst who played at Air Force on Sunday and that was a close game at the half the Air Force Falcons LED it by seven before the Air Force Academy pulled away in the second half and blitzed Mercy Hurst winning it going away 8248 Air Force shot 65 from the floor in that game against Mercy Hurst Joshua Ola Joseph looks to power his way inside and he flips it up left it short in the rebound Max just the on Kick for Mercy Hurst so the Lakers the new division one team going through this fouryear transition period which theyre ineligible for the NCA tournament for the next four years which is one of the dumbest rules RS by the NCAA but thats a whole another conversation Andre St yakovich the block shot out of bounds eight on the shot clock as he denied Aiden rer of Mercy Hurst here you can see the drive Roxy getting to the rim but you know usually dont expect your guards but stovic has had blocks this year and he rejected his offering here is rert with the left hand and he floats it up and in to tie the game of two thats impressive on short clock to really make something out of nothing thats a big basket by obviously the Lakers Christian Tucker the Golden Bears without three key players tonight as Joshua Ola Joseph called for the travel as Mark Madson has gone the last few games without Javon blackshire Jr DJ Campbell and BJ omad as blackshire and and Campbell are really close and they went through shoot around today and so Cal hoping theyll have them maybe for the Missouri game on Tuesday night and a back door cut and down low it spins out for Jeff plenus the senior for Mercy Hurst and Cal comes back the other way with st yakovich who left the ball behind Shamar Rattan Maye and the laye and mercy Hurst has a lead as Max Jesse onik with the bucket for Mercy Hurst well Roxy you spoke about coach Mark mass and and you know think about it not one not two but three straight games without your starter and youre talking about three starters thats an adjustment that this team has had to make but you know if youre going to have these adjustments better early in the season than late so Campbell and blackshire are really close is Joshua Ola Joseph short on a three and here comes Aiden rer for Mercy Hurst BJ oms going to be a little bit longer hes more of the weak to we category than the other two who are literally dayto day and again went through shoot around earlier today heres the kick and a three that one rims out for Jeff plenas and Cal controls the rebound 42 Mercy Hurst after Cal got the games first points and mty Soko throws it away the double team forcing a turnover but it was deflected out by Mercy Hurst and it stays at this end with Cal there is Gary manshel in his 22nd season as the head coach of Mercy Hurst also nine years as the head coach at Jass L and he has over 500 career wins no thats impressive we spoke with him obviously before the game and you know hes a hes a winner hes a guy thats built programs and hes getting an opportunity now to build Mercy Hurst into a division one program great opportunity for him and while he was with Merc Harris at the division 2 level they were a power 10 20 win seasons as off balance the runner missed by Andre St yakovich and mercy HST playing in the Northeast conference and they were admitted to the Northeast conference back in April the last few years cutting to the bucket and a foul on MAR Soko and that will send Shamar ratton Mays the senior from Toronto to the line for Mercy Hurst but the last number of years at the division 2 level Mercy Hurst was playing in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference the pack yeah well thats now its in Step you know but I think when youre building a program Roxy it doesnt make any difference youre going to go from division two to division one thats a big step obviously weve seen teams do that but in speaking with Gary manchel hes hes going to take this in stride hes with the same program and I think hes going to get this done hes got some division one players on his team and so hes said look weve got some Talent now we can have to continue to recruit to that level but youre going to make a big step up and uh obviously he doesnt mind playing a good schedule and Shamar Rattan May one of those division one talents who just hit the two free throws as Rattan May played three years at Youngstown State as Andre St yakovich missing a three and then ratton Mays played last year at UNCC Wilmington was the backup point guard in a 21 win team and now taking advantage of that fifth year the native of Toronto was a horizon Ling all freshman team member at Youngstown State hes got some pretty good D1 experience and the ball knocked Away by Rus petritis Here Comes Andre St yakovich and hes grabbed by Shamar ratton May and Mark Matson questioning bird Smith that that should be a flagrant one and Mark Matson is a little bit of a I think a case here because that wasnt really a play on the ball Music yeah let let no lets lets lets do that oh were were doing our camera here and then we can we can transition to that okay so they are looking theyre looking to see if it be should be a flagrant one yeah I think it should be cuz that wasnt a play on the ball I mean he just grabbed him yeah well see oh we got time Jeff Jeff Jeff gotcha Roxy just checked I think theres yeah its just a comment and fou okay yeah he didnt put two he didnt grab him with two hands did he close it came close but butan he didnt wrap him up he just boom and I I think that was pretty smart foul never off Music Mercy Hurst the early 62 lead at hos Pavilion over Cal along with the coach Ben Braun and our ACC Network crew Roxy burnson with you and a little bit of a slow start for Cal denight but the Golden Bears 5 one Ben trying to get to six one for the first time since Kano Martin last season when they started seven and one and Cals been doing it lately without three key players no and thats been the key to their success Roxy theyve got really tremendous depth this year and you mentioned not one not two but three guys out and for the third consecutive game you dont do this and you dont get Ws if you dont have depth So Cal really counting on their players that have transferred here and stepped in who have had success in other programs so theyre no strangers to having experience C looking to get on track theyve been scoreless for about four minutes Andre sto yakovich rolls it in ends the drought for Cal you know its interesting Roxy if you would chart all year coming out of timeouts when Cals been on you know needs been on Team thats made a run it seems like its stekovic has come back and kind of broke that drought and it also seems like Mark Mark Matson has specific plays coming out of timeouts also that are designed to try to get a bucket well and they end up in his hands because he not only can knock down shots but hes so good at getting in the basket and if not scoring creating for his teammates and the scoop Jeremiah Wilkinson draws the foul well get to the line the foul is on Bernie blunt the third of Mercy Hurst his first well here you can see the drive and hes really good with pivots I mean hes able to keep his pivot put down hes going to give you a couple different looks but in the end hes going to get the shot that he wants and deliver two shots for Wilkinson 71 from the line for the Freshman double figures in each of the last two games including a career high 23 last week against Air Force and one more shot coming is mallis Ian gets the Freshman from Chicago in the game for Mercy Hurst you know if theres been a bright spot now for Cal its been Wilkinson coming off with with three starters down hes been the one really the one breakout player hes had just breakout games for the Cal Bears and it creates an opportunity look theres for example a lot of minutes to be hat ofon BL blur out right now its about 30 minutes that are available to somebody to go and make the most of that opportunity well hes going to put pressure on the coaches now Roxy to say whos whos going to play and how many minutes are going to get cuz hes definitely earned some time pull up jumper and the Miss for Jeff plenus and one shot and out lead toward the rebound Here Comes Cal looking to reclaim the lead Wilkinson a step back three for Jeremiah Wilkinson well he just doesnt play like a freshman Roxy he just plays with poise hes not you know hes not afraid to play with a lot of confidence a little bit of swag and hes able to knock those shots down hes done it in the minute hes gotten the opportunity six straight for Cal and the loose ball lead Dort here comes the Bears again in transition Andre sto yakovich and he draws the foul and he is so good at that two free throws coming up for sakovich who shot 15 free throws in the game against sack State on Sunday how about the Freshman Roxy just measuring it lining it up and just hitting daggers I mean this teams got got some good young players if you really want to look at a team that you better keep your eyes on the next couple of years this Cal bear team has some awfully good young players and St yakovich 82 from the line and one more coming for Andre St yakovich whos scored 20 or more in each of the last three games and for this Cal team this is a place theyve been getting to frequently theyre one of the best teams at getting to the foul line and theyre a 72 foul F shooting team but so far this year C is 18th of the country averaging 28 free throws attempted a game no theyre one of the tops Roxy top 50 its for sure not only getting to the line but making shots thats thats really been a staple for them largest lead for Cal here in the early Music stages down to five on the shot clock and a corner three hits the side of the backboard from Aiden reer and that is a shot clock violation and a turnover by Mercy Hurst in our officiating crew the veteran Bert Smith one of the top officials in the game working with Jeff pwn and Blanca Burns here tonight in Berkeley well those shots neither one hit the rim those are they may have to check the backboard on those last two shots they see if theres some damage but Roxy you mentioned something I want to get back to the Cal Bears with 20 you know their their free throw attempts uh you know and theyre theyre averaging 28 free throw attempts 20 made thats good for 28th and 20th in the country thats getting it done heres Jeremiah Wilkins in the move and has it knocked out of bounds Jake lemelman The Freshman is trying to signify it should have been a tie up but its out of bounds to Cal 13 on the shot clock So Cal coming off that 8377 win they got a scare from Sacramento State after it appear they had a comfortable lead they were up by 15 in the second half before a late charge by the Hornets made it probably more interesting than it should have been Lee Dort traveled now that was really they got tested Roxy and that happens early in the year you know Mark Manson talked to us today at shootaround he said look we needed that I mean most coaches arent going to say that hes pretty pretty candid he said that we needed that we needed to be in a tight game our players needed to experience that that game was good for us and you always like to learn coming out of a game and was a learn it was a good lesson for this team to learn its a little bit better Ben when it comes in a win than if you had blown the lead and lost to Sacramento State on Sunday yeah well most players dont unfortunately learn with the win they kind of forget Andre to yakovich the rebound but I agree with you I I love the wins and say Well kind of tighten it up from here but sometimes you need to get your teams attention to yakovich the pullup Lee Dort on the offensive glass had it knocked away and Jake lemelman comes away with it for Mercy Herz and a foul will get the Lakers to the line and I was talking to Gary manshel and hes hes realistic when he looked to this game he knows there are heavy Underdog coming in here that things have to fall into place for them tonight for them to have a chance to win against Cal but one thing is they need to control the tempo he needs to keep this game he thinks in the 60s well and hes done that Roxy all year long think about this his defense of average for his team against the competition has been 66 a game and thats thats pretty good if you can hold teams in the 60s and you can score in the 70s which theyve done you know youve got a chance every every night out and your defense has to be your staple you cant rely on your shots to fall every night Shamar Rattan May is now four for four from the line and the calad is two and they play this matchup Zone Ben which youre familiar with and that he learned when he was an assistant coach at Yale for dick cooin and hes tweaked it along the way of course former Cal coach dick coochin who he worked for for a few years as Joshua Ola Joseph hammers at home I dont care what defense youre in you better you better stop him at The Rim because hes not paying any attention to the defense youre in thats just one heck of a but they for 17 turnovers a game no thats again thats pretty thats a lot uh the credit to their defense heres a corner three and the offensive rebound by Max janic and the runner too strong from Bernie blunt thei and Cal controls yeah theyre having difficulty Mercy H getting scores over the much taller Ranger Cal Bear Team theyve missed their last seven shots with the floor and reaching foul against Mercy Hurst fourpoint lead for Kalen Joshua Ola Joseph trying to get him going you like a guy that can get it done inside how about chal Joseph with the big big Jam inside count it the Cal Bears up by four Music a long time outcom and foll us on socialia oh yeah we thank you uh come no I like it I like it a lot because it kind of puts a bow on what we were talking about no I I love those two kids I yeah petrius is hes special Music Olympic Club how come youre not in it I got you I got you trust me I got you seriously I mean come on yeah what up with that well the guy that ran it I dont know whos running it now I I know I know I I dick Greens going to get this done trust me on that Im one phone call its all its got Music to back Im introducing you too thats the only thats the only caveat and Jo and Joes coming good luck with that its in October and watching film now well get that done that you should have been in it come on man its so we talked about the absence of DJ Campbell jovon blackshire and BJ omad and this is an example of two guys making the most of an opportunity well certainly we jeremi Wilkinson has gotten opportunities as a freshman but Rus petritis Roxy is no stranger to college basketball he had a a phenomenal career at Air Force and what hes done for the Cal Bears has been I think huge hes given them a lift in every category on the floor everything from defense to steals to Second shot opportunities I mean hes tough hes just really really a basketball player nice find by Christian Tucker underneath the reverse laye Joshua Ola Joseph for Cal and its a sixpoint lead the largest for the Golden Bears well you know I really like what Mark Matson has done coming out of timeouts Roxy its really important and obviously playing in the NBA getting some time there you have to be good at that but his teams have executed coming out of timeouts so Mercy Hurst has gone over six minutes without a mate field goal left open and a three from mallis ivanow and Cal with the rebound well Cs getting them to speed up and thats a good sign if your defense is tough you often time speed up your opponents make them uncomfortable rattles in for Jer Wilkinson yeah if youre Mercy Hurst Roxy Jeremiah Wilkinson is making you uncomfortable I mean hes just finding ways to just complete drives but my goodness he what a tough freshman 30 second timeout Mercy Hurst Music Music Music six straight for C the Golden Bears defense has forced Mercy Hurst into missing each of their last nine shots from the floor and Cal now with a 16 to8 lead as Mercy Hurst just two for 14 overall from the field Mercy Hurst at four and three look theyve got some okay wins they beaten kesas they won at Morgan State oh those are impressive Roxy but this Cal Bear Team Now is really settling in defensively theyre making it awful touch Applause stepping back and beating the shot clock tough shot Shamar ratton May for the Lakers no thats a tough shot but Ill tell you this Roxy if if youre going to force your opponents to make those types of shots youre playing pretty good defense hes got six of the Lakers 10 points thats a kick and theyll put 20 back up on the shot clock for Cal well Gary Manel call timeout I think he just wanted to settle his guys down theyre not getting good looks theyre just theyre a little bit rattled theyre certainly getting one and done that puts more pressure on you because now you got to you have to shoot it better so uh and Cs a tough matchup theyre just a tough team with their size M Soko off the inbound and the big man drops it in well I think K has been waiting for him to step step up Roxy hes capable he didnt lead d uh transfers that have really had some experience but those guys can carve out space and they can score in the middle of the paint theyre theyre really Adept to doing that Soo the grat transfer played four years for Tom ISO in Michigan State veteran of six NCAA tournament games and a driving wild shot thats pulled out of the air and mercy here the reverse lay in by mallis ivanow the Freshman for the Lakers Cal quickly back the other way and Mi Soko draws a foul yeah Roxy I love seeing Moko run rim run for Mark mson and the bears but you can see when he gets the ball in the paint um hes really good at going over the top you he doesnt force it he just takes what the defense gives him and he can score it I mean hes agile and and like you say hes experien 56 starts over the last couple of years for Michigan State for mty Soko here is Reus petrius Jeremiah Wilkinson to strong on the three and the rebound pinballed around and petrius rips it away and petritis trying to lean in and its deflected out by Mercy HST and willll stay at this end with Cal and our first look tonight at Spencer Mahoney the red shirt freshman from Brooklyn the transfer from Washington State the red shirt for Kyle Smith last year and Mahoney in his first extensive action for Cal played really well against saak State on Sunday I thought he did too it was a real bright spot for the Bears Music had seven points against the Hornets played 13 minutes and in those 13 minutes Mahoney was a plus 19 oh thats getting it done Jeremiah Wilkinson left open and makes Mercy HST pay Roxy I love what Cal can do at the end of a shot clock most teams struggle to find a guy or a team that to get a good look Cal always seems to find somebody at the end of the shot clock that can deliver 2112 Cal with the lead nine for Wilkinson heres a three on the way two strong from Aiden reer the senior from Jackson Center Ohio whos a number of these players that played with Mery Hurst at the division 2 level and part of the transition under Gary manshel to division one money and St yakovich cant control the offensive rebound and its pulled down by Mercy Hurst well Roxy if youre Mercy Hurst now you got to find an easier way to score they have struggled getting good looks and thats a credit to Cals Applause defense nice pass and cutting to the bucket Aiden reer for Mercy Hurst that the first easy one theyve had but that was set up by a really good Interior Drive and Dish Andre sto yakovich had a good look and the rebound by mallus ivanow for Mercy Hurst Mercy HST not flustered theyre going to stay with their system knowing they need to control Tempo and limit the possessions in this game Jeremiah Wilkinson the step through has his shot blocked by Aiden reker here come the Lakers and the reverse laying nice move on the Baseline by Shamar Rattan Maye and a time out for Cal that was a great look Roxy show and go I mean thats what he can do he just tipto but look at Cal and able to knock it back out to Wilkinson he can stock it down and then when you want to get some action how about tiptoe along the Baseline Lay It Up Roxy weve got a good one fivepoint lead by Kell Music sometimes Im not sure that Cal knows exactly where they want to go but then when they get in trouble they kind of do yeah but when they need a basket they know where they want to go otherwise its kind of free for him which is fine um I I think sasoko can give him some things in there hes pretty good when Ive gone to practice hes been really good I it I cant remember does Kell have good popcorn Roxy you would know its okay not best right not as good Washington used to have the best no ringt yeah I remember Washington oh yeah not unless it has mustard but once you get a whiff of the popcorn when you walk by if its fresh yeah but its a lot of times its boxed up thats the problem here yeah its boxed and its not fresh see like hes eating out of box no I cant do that no I cant do that thats tastes like paper tastes like paper yeah no thats good I now youre cooking actually give me some brown mustard I got a little Austrian German descent sorry but Im with you on the soft PR he got me hungry now is cooch in here Rox you see I dont see him Im Music looking I cant think of who he usually goes with but he usually attends with same people but I dont see him Im looking up there I dont see a lot of people that normally show up he said he hasnt talked to him in years though its been I wish I would have told him I wish I would have known that before I I would have called Music Dick getting that popcorn in before the turkey tomorrow tomorrow you know theres always room for popcorn come on Rox youre at a game youre either I got to remember who Im talking to let me tell you either youre going to go with popcorn or a hot dog theres its its I think its popcorn in the first half hot dog youre going with both oh absolutely why its not an either or well that was your ritual you always just to have a hot dog waiting for you after the game every game win or lose absolutely it was a it was a ritual and I I uh I lived on those hot dogs we had some good hot dogs back in the day I think theyre still good open three and Spencer Mahoney knocks it down and he hit a three against sack State on Sunday in the second straight game with a three and Mahoney getting some minutes with the three guys out an opportunity hes cashing in now Andre St yakovich to steal and a foul reaching on mallis ivanowski of Mercy Hurst Roxy again we talked about Kell coming out of the timeouts but you got Mahoney thats gotten spot minutes and hes done nothing but satisfy if youre a k bear fan and youre a cal bear coach hes hes really getting the job done hes been you know just been very calm and very confident well you remember from the police academy movies and Steve Gutenberg Tel Mahoney sent you yeah you remember that oh yeah I was young but so was I by the way speaking of happy birthday Ben well thank you Roxy thank you thats nice it was a couple days ago well I appreciate that remembering the we saw not every day you turn 90 no no no were getting there though lot of candles on you hope to get there Lee Dort at The Rim offensive rebound Dort muscles it back up and draws a foul and the physicality from Lee Dort underneath no hes you know hes tough Roxy what he does for the Cal Bears hes just I like the way he just continues to persevere I mean Ive seen him when hes missed the first shot he just goes up and gets the the miss and goes back up until he gets the line hes done a great job for the Bears this year in giving them an inside presence and Ive been impressed Roxy you know think about this his hes shooting 75 from the floor thats all and hes getting to the free throw line hes got to work on his free throws obviously thats been thats been the one uh Achilles here but uh hes getting rebounds you know for his minutes almost seven and a half a game but a transfer from vanderbild hits both free throws yeah he if he can do that hes really going to I I think uh level out but hes hes hes a present for the Cal Bears second foul on mallis ivanow of Mercy Hurst and on the drive and finish my goodness Jeff plenus for the Lakers I dont think that K beis interior saw that coming I dont think anybody saw that one coming my goodness Jeff plenus with a full facial right there well somebody will be on a poster two time first team all Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference for mercy here in division 2 and now Mahoney does it again Roxy youve got money and Wilkinson youve got some guys now stepping up for Cal Bears and that is just really a welcome sight to find guys coming off the bench earning minutes and and just playing but lets look at this down the middle oh that was over lead D but heres Spencer Mahoney Roxy and what he does he just knocks down shots and plays with extreme confidence Lee Dort I think wants us to delete the tape stepping in thats a deep two and there is Mahoney the rebound and a foul on Aiden reer of Mercy Herz you know I never worried too much about the poster because I figured its just two points but you got a chance to get it back and the lead Dort wants to get to do some posterizing I think hes capable of doing it himself you think hes taking numbers oh absolutely the receipts too I mean hes right there but uh you know good players dont get rattled by that I mean its personal but it its not in the end its its two points what you do though with your minutes is important and I think Lee dorts made the most of his minutes and certainly Spencer money is just giving the Bears as you mentioned plus every time hes been on the floor one and one for Mahoney with Cal in the bonus and there is Lee Dort answering back at the other end Ro he heard the offensive rebound well he heard you and thats what hes done me youre throwing me under the bus well he heard you I and and you know his ability to get offensive rebounds has been impressive hes done that all year long and if youre an opposing team you must keep him off glass Lee it was Ben that said poster I didnt oh hes pretty good I dont want to get on his badat side hell be all right nice drive and finish again Jeff penas for Mercy Hurst Music you you talk about Lee Dort watch him just he keeps his hand up I thats just textbook Roxy he he go he goes over the back without creating any contact with his hands he showed the official his hands used his body and his length and went over the top and got an easy two I I mean thats just textbook offensive rebounding and by the way hes got Mark Manson if youre going to learn from somebody I mean I coached against Mark Manson during his years at Stanford for Mike Montgomery and I we tried every which way to keep him off the glass no chance I mean he was the one of the toughest competitors Ive ever faced as a as a coach foul was on Joshua Ola Joseph Christian Tucker looking to get going and he traveled yeah he knew it he he he just slid on the pivot foot there Roxy and unfortunate four minutes left in the half Cal up double digits on Mercy Hurst Music I love that hes getting the stats but I like when the other person brings it over a little bit better thats between you and me in the F you know what Im saying you want uh lets save the mercy you want to do the mercy HST School capsule here we can talk Buster dougl let lets do that you know lets save that for the second half when it could get a little out of control yeah good call zor Lets uh you said go to the standings lets save the Mercier profile for the second half lets just lets just do the game here I mean will its still kind of competitive yeah okay they got new stats I want to talk about the defense though I think Cals done a good Music job yeah let me talk can I talk about the defense I want to make a point Music Music more popcorn and the fans want more points up by 10 late in the first half here at hospit with Ben Brun and our ACC Network crew Roxy burnsy with you and defensively Im seeing some strides Ben with Cal defending the three had been a little bit of an issue for Cal through the first six games but tonight their length is bothering Mercy Hurst is 0 for seven outside the AR interestingly Rox and as a coaching staff you talk about that youve been giving up on the year 38 thats close to 40 thats not a good percentage but what mark man and the staff had done theyve corrected that and they theyve given respect to Mercers theyve theyve really challenged 0 for seven theyve held a team thats normally 44 shooting to 33 and they held him to 21 points a team thats averaging 70 so thats defensively getting it done one foot step back way off from Malla savonus and Cal looking to push it and Jeremiah Wilkinson stepped on the sideline and turnover for Cal is their fifth Roxy if you were to chart Mercy Hurst and how many shots theyve taken how many have been challenged versus unchallenged I would say that every almost every shot has been extremely challenged so its been very difficult for Mercy Harris to get a good look to the rim Jeff plen is looking to draw contact and here comes Cal and Joshua Ola Joseph inside 320 to go until halftime Cal five one trying to get to six and one for the first time since they started seven and one back in 2016 2017 that was conso Martins last season at Cal as Lee Dort is fouled will get to the line the second on Aiden reer of the Lakers well thats actually a good foul Roxy that was about to be an easy two and now youre making Lee Dort who struggled this year although he hit the last two go to the line but I think Cal really you know what theyre trying to establish now with a couple minutes left in the half is to go in the locker room maintaining the momentum and the lead they dont want to give it up theyve done that the last couple games theyve given up some lead so you know its a work in progress when youre coaching your team youre trying to get them to improve in all the areas that have been a challenge for you and Dort now three for three at the line and one more for the transfer from Vanderbilt Im about to tell you how much better his release looks but then you know what that usually does lets see I do like his release it looks a lot better than it has looked you know its on you right all right see when I when I do you had confidence you had Faith you saw it its a little different rolling off my tongue well see Cal smatch their largest lead take it back they did have a 13point lead at one point but Dort with six points off the bench and four for four from the line thats just good defense Roxy theyre getting further and further out on the floor Cal keeps pushing him out and the driving Runner by Shamar Ron ma Christian Tucker counters back the other way Andre sto yakovich three how about the look from Christian Tucker Roxy they need that Christian Tucker had his head up the whole possession he knew where sto yakovich was and he found him he knew it and he ran back before stovic could knock that down he was very confident his teammate was eight assists on 12 baskets tonight yeah thats going to get done and Cal as we talked about it on Sunday Ben unfortunately near the bottom in the country in terms of assists per game as a club theyre averaging just 10 assists a game which is 338th in the country now thats just putting too much pressure on your offense but look at look at Tucker he has his head up he waits everybody was guarded he found the one player sto yakovich that was unguarded and he delivered and by the way when you make a pass throw it to somebodys chest dont make your teammate reach down to the floor over his shoulder second on motty sasoko and sasoko the rebound Falls to him a cal up 15 looking to extend it Andre St yakovich Jeremiah Wilkinson left open free well another good look Roxy again from who Christian Tucker I mean hes finding his teammates Roxy and theyre congratulating Tucker coming to the bench its always the guy that hits the shot you remember but what about the guy that delivers I love it here it is again I mean thats just good ballman look at that pass I mean over the top thats a thats a wide open Wilkinson and Christian Tucker has had the ability now to find the one player thats been unguarded when they rotate and and hes delivered eight nothing run for Cal as the Golden Bears have made their last four shots and Christian Tucker with three assists making the extra pass even though he hasnt scored having an impact in this game and Cs now six for 10 from three well I like it and again theyre getting better looks Roxy its one thing its amazing what good passing does I mean when you get good passing and good rotation its amazing how much more confidence you have you go to practices you see teams really knocking down shots you you need to chart the passes that lead to the shots and rotations out of doubles a penetration dish uh the extra pass the hockey pass a term I know you know when that happens uh teams are deadly and and Cals now knocking down what I think are easier look threes you liked how I got that hockey yes I did like that Mercy Hurst has a division one hockey team AB rough year for the Lakers on the ISL point out well but theyre in theyre in hockey country they have a really good womens hockey program by the way okay well see youve done your research but youre on Lake Erie and youre out oh Im all over Mercy were going to get to in the second half know I cant wait I did my research as you should but their first season as division one program moving from division 2 and the school located Mercers University in Lake Erie it is a private Catholic University well Roxy I you know I think you know this but my team one of my teams played at Mercy herst so Im no stranger your first stop is a absolutely and they were were good I mean really good when you were at Sienna Heights College before Eastern Michigan and that was a guaranteed game and we went in there thinking we were going to not only get the win but wed come back with a little of the guarantee but they were good and they were strong and theyve maintained ever since theyve been a really good program over the years really good run as a division 2 team and now making the move up and again as part of this transition period to division one they are ineligible even if they win the Northeast conference in eligible to go to the NCA tournament which is the dumbest rule but then again who thinks the NCA has Common Sense Ill let you say that I still got some people there I got to be careful uh but Roxy you know you talked about you know we talked about the transition think about UC Davis think about UC San Diego these teams and they just got through that fouryear well and that was a long wait they had to they had to play games without being able to being eligible it hurts your recruiting so you got to hang in there but look how good those programs are now things can happen if you just stay patient and you stay with it and obviously you have the same coach thats been able to build tradition and build a winning program theres a foul off the ball the second on Joshua Ola Joseph and thats team foul number six the next one puts the Lakers into the bonus I like the way Cal is closing out this half Roxy they havent always done that this year but I think its been a real sticking point for Mark Matson and his staff I can guarantee you theyve discussed this theyve worked on it and theyre theyre showing you some strides here and putting it back Aiden reer the offensive rebound and bucket well Cal worked on a two for one I dont know if theyre going to use it here but they were doing this in practice this week and they had an opportunity there with 40 seconds to come down get a quick win but I think Mark Manson is saying normally well take the two for one because hes an NBA you know obviously player as well but he wants to make sure his team takes his time and gets a good one Christian Tucker down the lane and the first points for the transfer from UTSA I like that that was calm and it was confident thats the way Christian Tucker can play Roxy now Mercy HST can play for the last shot of the half if they Music want Bernie blunt thei Up and Under lost it going up right to Christian Tucker and thatll take us to halftime and you want guys who arent complacent you want them to stay hungry but good teams have it on the drive and Andre sakovich snatches it away from Jeff plenas St yakovich trying to go Coast to Coast has to deflect it out and will stay at this end well he started the game with a block and he start in the second half with one thats an advantage of a six s guard you talk about the big guys inside that can block shots uh in petritis and Soko you got to add sokovic to that list as well Music stepping through the double team and powering his way up is Joshua Ola Joseph well I dont know how he got through that double Rocky that that that door seemed to have been closed and he just said look Im going to open it Im Im going to find a way to get through a double team those Force sets of hands second half was the problem for Mercy H their last time out against Air Force again it was a sevenpoint game in Colorado Springs as the runner goes for Max cic well they need then in the second half Air Force just blitzed him well they need to put some points on the board try to chip away but they got to defend Cal too Roxy there thats been a problem just to keep Cal off the off the glass A little bit and a steel Here Comes Bernie blunt thei blunt steps into a three and knocks it down and the senior from Morgantown Pennsylvania the transfer from Edinburgh University which oddly enough played against Merc Hurst in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference last year and one of Gary manels assistants played with an older brother at Florida State of blunt therefore they had the connection when they saw him in the portal they went and got him knowing how tough a competitor he is when they played against him last year Well Roxy relationships relationships relationships you you always keep the doors open and on the drive Shamar ratton Mays will get to the free throw line for Mercy Hurst well watch the transition you know if you want to play against a team that youve been struggling to score and try to get down the floor and before defense can set up score in transition thats really one of the easier ways to score thats why you see so many teams playing faster now dont let defenses set up his dad was nearly a 2000 Point scorer Bernard blunt who played at St Joes and Bernie who played his first two years at Quinnipiac then went down a level to division 2 average 20 a game last year at Edinburgh before coming back to division one and out of the portal being snatched up by Mercy Hurst well and he was shooting a cool 96 from the line and till he missed that one he was 24 out of 25 on the year Rex thats thats getting it done Andre to yakovich off the window and using his 67 frame against the much smaller Shamar Ron may now it looked like there was absolutely nothing there and all he did was pivot kept his pivot feet down and used his highs his size to get an easy window Bank nine for St yakovich Bernie blunt the Third aen rker throws it right to Reus petrius oneonone petrius takes it strong first points for Reus petritis you know he has a knack Roxy he knew exactly where to be when there was a drive that took place all he did like a middle linebacker he just went out and he got to The Logical passing outlet and he was right there left open Aiden reer three and thats what he can do if you give him some openings hes struggled in the first half but if you give him an opening Roxy hes a 40 plus threepoint shooter so uh thats thats a direction I think Merc would like to go and see if they can revisit so after going 0 for seven from three in the first half Lakers have it each of their first two threes here in the second half five to shoot Rus petritis and a good box out by Max jainic for Mercy Hurst and a foul its on Joshua Ola Joseph his third yeah that was a little bit of a delayed call I thought it was a foul earlier on The Possession and then they just got tangled up finally official said I got to call this he was trying to give him a little bit of a break uh and now hes got to come out of the game but now you mentioned the threepoint shooting and mercy HZ has now gotten on the board and Cal as you said has been so so good in the first half they dont want to revisit early patterns this season that start giving up threes is steel Jeremiah Wilkinson races up the floor in the throw down he again as I just mentioned betrus did all he did was beat his Defender I mean his offensive player to the spot he just said look I know what youre trying to do I know what a handoff is and he jumped it I mean he just cheated it which is fine on defense you can cheat a little bit and that was rewarded in a twohanded slam GRE is petrit as the block for Cal Andre sto yakovich Mar Soko underneath misses the putback slam and its out of bounds to Mercy Hurst 17point lead and Jeremiah Wilkinson again B you like dunks you like action you like defense how about Wilkinson on the break for the slam the Bears up big bowling for dollars okay I bet you were a good bowler no you didnt no really I thought you would be Im very mediocre do you see Joe at a bowling alley no hed Bowl in the wrong in the wrong lane hed be the guy that would piss off the guy in the lane next to him because hed just get the ball and go no and wouldnt no he would wait no there was be none no thats funny is he coming up for Peters you know yeah CU they played Davis the night before thats why I asked him he said he wasnt sure what he why didnt he tell me he does I said are you coming and he wouldnt answer he asked me if I was coming to the game I said I dont think I can come to the game but Im I think Im coming to Peters yeah we can do it now I think its good start to have some fun with this where is Peters at again you L mer said yeah thats great I mean thats thats going to be fun but its early right Rox its like a yeah okay I I think I can get away I I yeah I really want I want to be there hes doing well though looks like oh yeah got turbody all whats the dress you know its a good question I do not know the answer to that I mean its casual its not like dressy right I would think yeah you know just khis and a sht thats my guess yeah yeah its early to you have a beer but Im having one or two youre not working at all right theres no game no I have a game the night before okay youre good going what about Jo huh Im coming home theres why my games at 430 in Houston Im on an 830 flight uh whos the game Butler against Houston at at foron really yeah dang well the school profile for Mercy Hurst we told you they from Lake eie area so Erie PA and just a mile or two away from Lake Erie and they making that transition to division one and the notable alumni Brandon Staley is currently an assistant for Kyle Shanahan with the 49ers the former head coach of the Chargers but James Buster Douglas the former heavyweight champion of the world went to Mercers in fact he went to Mercy Hurst on a basketball scholarship he was a basketball player Roxy thats doing your homework I would not have known that now he was only there for one year and then would go on to be the heavyweight champion when he beat Mike Tyson at that fight back in 1990 James Buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson in Tokyo well Ill never forget that that was mean that was an amazing amazing fight a stunner no but a stunner also was finding out that he played basketball he could have played for me I I think hed have been pretty tough you like him under the boards oh anytime just you know come on Buster give me a couple but then after he beat Tyson in February of 1990 at the Tokyo Dome to win the World Heavyweight Championship he then lost later that year to Evander Holyfield thats right I do remember that it was a big chapter in boxing uh Lord that was in October and Buster Douglas was a 42 to1 Underdog going up against Iron Mike Tyson Andre St yakovich three and its Andre with a little bit of a gesture just to let folks know Im Im back I still got it now interesting uh research Roxy on on Mercy Hurst and Buster Douglas thats but a basketball scholarship brought him to Mercy Hurst yeah how about that and then also Mercy Hurst is in a little pop culture movie theme as Bernie blunt the third with the Layin 5234 lead and do you know what movie Im referring to Ben I actually do but Ill let you go and its might be Bob Melvins thats what yeah favorite movie thats what Ive heard Jeremiah Wilkinson a three eight threes for Cal the Bears are now eight for 15 from downtown and that might be one of my favorite freshman Roy hes just really showing you his ability to belong you do not think hes an underclassman the way hes playing largest lead for Cal and the drop off of Monty Soko the foul after he thought he blocked the shot cleanly and that will send Mercy hers to the line I watch the hustle I mean thats just a good job getting the ball over one more Wilkinson gives up a shot for sto yakovich who knocks it down down I mean look at the look at the pursuing of the offensive rebounds finding your teammate another three I mean thats Roxy if Cal can start knocking down threes with their ability to attack the rim I mean thats gives them a whole another dimension thats good to see shots falling if youre the Cal Golden Bears first one missed by mallus ivanow The Freshman from Chicago is Dad toas played for manchel when he was the coach at UMass l so Dad played for him and now his son is a freshman playing for manshel too no and thats a big reason why hes here and Coach told us that in you know in the pregame uh just that thats a big reason they got him and you know again relationships are huge in the game of basketball and in the game of life but the movie Tom Hanks I was waiting for you to get back to that that thing you do was the Wonders were the band or the oners but just to make it less confused they put the W in well Bob but they were from eie paa Bob Melvin was my neighbor for a number of years as you know yeah but he never shared this with me how come you know this and I dont I spent a lot of time with Bob well I did too I thought of course you did you worked his games a little bit different I just stress passed but also when the Wonders kind of leaped into Fame were taken notice of when they would go play at the Italian restaurant down by the airport filipos they won the talent contest at Mercy Hurst College right that was famous I I Music remember suffocating defense and Lee Dort forces the turnover theres nowhere to go Roxy I thought Lee Dort did a good job just staying patient keeping his position not reaching uh hes got defensive discipline which a lot of big guys dont have and they often get in foul trouble but I think the coaching staffs done a good job with lead Dort hes big hes strong and they just got to make sure he stays grounded and stays vertical little did you know youd get pop culture that Thing You Do references tonight Jeremiah Wilkinson again his second 20point game of the season can you spell and Fuego and Fuego I mean Roxy a freshman is lighting up H Pavilion he just hes done that the last several games now the opportunity that hes making the most of in the absence of Campbell and blackshire and Jeremiah Wilkinson regardless of when they come back and theyre hoping to be back from Missouri again they went through some shootaround stuff today with the team Wilkinson the heat check and the rebound grabbed by James Thomas in the game for Mercy Hurst but Jeremiah Wilkinson is going to factor in and be a key part of the rotation regardless of whos on the floor whos available for Mar thats a problem but you know what that is its a good problem its a good problem for Coach to hey but lets go back Roxy how about the freshman jeremi Wilson his name keeps popping up there goes that man here he is from three measure it aim deliver count it okay I mean hes just been something hes been a story I mean hes been continuing to be a story for Cal I asked assistant coaches I said did you know they said yes but hes proving it we thought but now we know I mean thats how good hes hes been I mean you you see it in him when you recruit him but I dont know if they expected him to do this this quickly and he is going to present a you like that knowledge there of that thing you do oh that was huge that was huge roxxys up got a lot of tricks up the sleeve by the way you know how a lot of people stay under pseudonyms on the road so if you call the hotel you Melvins registered name yeah its one of the no really thats pretty good he still does that no yeah I got to remember that I might have to get a soon I might have to getet a name never know text him actually might hes in New York right now yeah tell him we gave him some air time you did but I I gave him some love too I mean hes a good guy what he did for my son and you when you guys did in Houston well never forget that I mean my son Julius always remembers that we have pictures you guys were great by the way the food there was pretty good better than Oakland all right we got some stories now we better get him going its about to be a 30p pointer well Roxy we mentioned Jeremiah Wilkinsons name but you watched him play this young mans a freshman I call him a young man because he is but he does not play like a young man I mean his Poise his ability to get his shot going his confidence level he knows where to be on the floor he separates he can get out to the threepoint line gets you on skates and if you dont guard him hell nail freie if you guard him guess what hell just take you to the basket at will look what hes done Roxy in his last in his three game or last two games I mean prior and what hes doing hes just keeping up from where he left off 20 tonight five for seven from three for Wilkinson he also has four assists and a couple of steals and call is opened up a 23point lead their largest of the night Bears it 54 from the floor nine of 17 from three and theyre holding Mercy hers to 34 shooting and going out of bounds Bernie blunt the Third and a turnover by the Lakers its their ninth you know Roxy Ks had a little bit of success down in Georgia recruiting I dont you think um Jaylen Brown Shar Abdul they might want to continue going down there they found something the late Kenyon Jones yeah oh my goodness yeah I coach Kenyon so I know a steel Bernie blunt takes it right back and he darts up the floor and draws the foul in Wilkinson and Bernie blunt the third will get to the line was a good job really good job Bernie blunt but you know you talk about Cals pipeline into Georgia Roxy and thats pretty good pipeline yeah Jaylen Brown Sharie Abdul Rim pretty good not bad Ill take it so blunt at the line two shots 96 from the strike not even I can Jinx him Ben well you know I people talk about Jaylen Brown obviously the career hes had now in the NBA but I got to tell tell you you know it was been so impressive following Jaylen Brown and you know weve covered him and watched him practice is just how much better he hes gotten hes been a student of the game hes gotten better and if Wilkinson gets better watch out cax breaks the press and one Spencer Mahoney the finish for Cal Roxy we highlighted two guys Wilkinson and Mahoney so Mahoney must feel a little lonely right now because now hes getting back in the ACT watch him on the break his size his agility his ability to finish what a lift hes given the Cal Bears in his last two games again with Cal down three starters hes gotten some minutes and I believe hes going to continue to get minutes Roxy thats thats what you know playing uh it labels you to do you just you never know until you get opportunities missed the free throw hes now 0 for three at the line in his limited chances this year Callas match that largest lead inside 11 minutes to play and Lee Dort got him with the body and its the second on Dort putting Aiden rker to the stripe well I hope nobody gets Wally pip Roxy thats thats what happens sometimes and people say whos W Wally pip right you know what the old adages oh yeah you you didnt know who he was of course I know who he was okay I want to make sure gck what come on Ben all right I got to make sure please give me some credit all right well maybe our listeners didnt know and our viewers didnt know but but you know Roxy its just again one opportunity you know you never know somebody gets an opportunity to play they prove themselves and its funny how this goes uh sometimes somebodys out of a little bit of a rotation and Im not wishing that on anybody at Cal nobody certainly deserved to be pushed out of rotation but thats a pleasant problem to have and Cals going to have 10 11 guys that they can comfortably play as this season goes on Here Comes Wilkinson Mercers luy now to extend the pressure see if they can speed him up a little bit fors pass and a turnover and Christian gamble comes away with it for the Lakers pull up floater Bernie blunt the third now with nine yeah Ive been impressed with him Roxy I mean thats a goodlooking player for the mercy Hurst Lakers hes hes played well Music nice find and Lee Dort cant convert on the reverse land and here comes Jake lemelman for Mercy Hurst but they throw it away and it goes back to Cal well Gary Mitchel just kind of looking out there you dont want to get on your guys too hard but they had opportunities Roxy they had numbers and you know not that theyre going to come back and maybe close the gap retake the lead but they were on a little bit of a momentum slide there and those are the plays that kill you you just cant turn it over Jeremiah Wilkinson gets inside and Wilkinson off the window I like the direction that Kell has three four touches then a quick attack you get the basketball to move side to side you get the def defensive move suddenly now youre attacking thats just great execution the fly by thats a two and the Miss from Jake lemelman a Soko in the kick out Christian Tucker nice move into the KE rattles in for Christian Tucker thats a good basket for Christian I mean hes a capable scorer he did it all last year at UTSA and so hes getting opportunities now but he can score hes just more of a setup guy but he definitely can score and that run pinballs out for Shamar ratton Maye and a foul will stay at this end going for the rebound and its on Spencer Mahoney well watch Wilkinson again we talked about his outside ability to score but he just gets inside but watch Christian Tucker I mean he gave his team whenever this team needed it last year I mean he brought his team back on a number of comebacks and he was instrumental in in every one of those so uh what what a luxury for Mark mson the staff to have veteran guys that have played and put and put some miles on by getting some experience at some programs so uh again depth has been a real real Plus for the cell Bears second foul on Spencer Mahoney the front end of the one and one miss by Aiden rker and this game part of the Cal classic which also involves Air Force and Sack State and Sacramento State after they played Cal tff on Sunday won at the Air Force Academy today Andre sto yakovich with a finish plus one well hes been quiet and I had a chance to talk to Andre today and I was supposed to deliver a message for his dad which I did I think his dad will be pleased right now because thats one of the messages to stay aggressive get to the rim use your size use your body you know hes a very unselfish player and obviously you dont want players to be selfish but sometimes when youre one of the best players if not maybe the leading scorer you know you got to make some things happen and hes capable of doing that almost at will and now St yakovich has scored 15 or more in each of Cals seven games and the bear is speaking of seven on a seven nothing run right now well thats a good to see Roxy theyve got some guys that can take over a game but theyre really unself team and so they dont really step up unless their team needs him but Andre sakovic can do it when his team needs him hes always seems to be around the ball underneath and the footwork and it pops out for mcis ivanis of Mercy Herz I like the defens of Soko he made it difficult with the hand up Jeremiah Wilkinson three 10 straight for K Wilkinson a new career high 25 points and Cal on a 10 nothing run and a 30point lead roxia we said there goes that man there goes that man again and again how about the corner three how about the te up how about the delivery counted Wilkinson for another Music three remember when mercy Hurst had a fourpoint lead no its been that long it seems I dont know well we said it was going to get here and it did but Cals I mean my God holy smoke lets lets wait till the next one yeah okay thank you holy smoke I mean Wilkinsons just look at this kid yeah it doesnt stop I mean my goodness how tall is he legit you know six I know he doesnt look tall and hes they list him at 61 but he sure plays bigger I mean thats impressive man not sure black is 511 either but who cares right they this kind of makes you forget about black and how good he was Melvin so good oh he did did he text you yeah is he watching I dont know but I told I told him tell him I said hi well too late Ill I have his number I can text him Music yeah I I I can what can just come back talk I can say something about Wilkinson I think I think we need to talk about him Ill say something if you want yeah I just yeah let me just I mean hes just too good you have to say something I want to I got I got something I can say Applause Callen firm control of this one now have opened up a 30point lead on Mercy Hurst and trying to get to six and one well Roxy this is Thanksgiving and you know many families acknowledge what they could be thanksful thankful for at this time of year How about if youre the Cal Bears how about being thankful for this young man this freshman has delivered just performance after performance and has done it in a big way Roxy I mean his performance tonight I thought Id seen it all in the first couple of games how about 25 points with still seven and a half to go 750 to go Cal 10 for 18 from three theyre shooting 58 holding Mercy Hurst to 33 shooting two for 10 from three and Cs bench even with the injuries and the guys out outscoring the mercy Hurst bench 393 no way in the world you could tell me that Cal was going to score 39 Off the Bench with three starters out Roxy I thats amazing and Cal takes it away and they had an advantage thats why they didnt blow it dead in a shot clock violation andr yakovich draws the foul will get to the line but that you know that stat alone if you look at it you want a bench production but but my goodness 39 Off the Bench the Cal Bears rolling big lead they lead by Music 30 I wish theyd change this this rule this boom boom back to back I hate it I just I mean to me it should be a timeout if its called that is your TV timeout you dont get two now back to back I dont that doesnt make sense it used to be that way they change it back oh well got to pay for sponsors okay cool were going to talk Cal football yeah yeah I want to yeah I want Id love to say something I mean after you say it is I mean as wi in the real deal or are we just seeing I mean whats going on here have you seen a freshman step up like this I mean I know its not the greatest but if he can play like this in the in the in the league my goodness I dont think hes scared you he plays with no fear there we go whats your over under by the way did you cover were under theres no way theres 1500 people in here no how many I said 500 I think theres about 800 to 900 yeah thats about right got stats not much changed no thats it thats incredible that stat you you got Music it justice suing what happen most points by a freshman okay good good stuff well how many 25 hes going to pass that I Music posters and a 30point lead for Cal the night before Thanksgiving not so sure about the red jacket but well move on not a k so Andre sakovich at the line to shoot two a note on the 25 points by Jeremiah Wilkinson that is the most points by a cal freshman in a game since Justin suing dropped 25 Justin suing dropped 25 on Washington State February of 2018 yeah thats stood for a number of years but I I think odds are that thats going to go down that record is going to be broke well its its not a record for points no but by a freshman its the most sense yeah the yeah the Freshman yeah youd have to get to Sharif Abdul Rahim another level another level I hear you fumbled recovered inside Jeff Music plenus spinning into the key off balance and the fourth foul on Joshua Ola Joseph and that will send Max jic to the line for Mercy HZ now youre youre hard pressed to go back and find any freshman that accomplished what share did Roxy in this school Pack 12 freshman pack 10 at the time fresh you were here I missed him by a year I you know he tried to get him I just theres no way but you know he was that good and uh you know one an ambassador hes been for a game obviously big tragedy in his family but uh hes just such a good person and uh comes from a great family but um thats that those records those performances I dont think will ever ever be equal both free throws knocked in by Max juic and a junior has got six at what point Ben do the walkon start to loosen up the stretch well I think knowing theyre going to get some run know after the last you know probably TV timeout at that time I think in the meantime Joshua Ola Joseph trying to get his well you want to give the other guys a chance you know that havent played and you also want to get your starters out you dont want any more injuries and and so I think youre going to see some guys coming in probably after the 4 minute theyre starting you could see them to move around Fired Up R I mean you know they Tak well three guys having been down in a 30point lead helps their cause and the pull up jumper Bernie blunt I third with the bucket you know again Roxy Ive alluded to this but I I Ive been so impressed with Cals unselfishness I mean for a guy like Jeremiah Wilkinson to get going other guys have helped him set him up given up their opportunities of their own to get to get the Freshman Wilson going look at that pass darts it inside and Joshua Ola Joseph Miss missing the reverse but draws the foul F Max juic here you see the drive here and the finish I mean thats a great pullup thats what you have to do against Cal I think if you theres any recipe youre not going to get all the way the rim against Cal Your Best Bets to pull up in that lane its kind of a lost art most people are threes or finish at The Rim but you got to play the midrange first appearance tonight for Devin Curtis the 611 sophomore from Mark Madson and also mercy here is our first look at Kadir Martin The Freshman from Staten Island for the Lakers Deshawn Jackson Jr in the game for the first time yeah Deon Curtis had some minutes last year Roxy so again theyre able to go to their bench even when their bench goes out of the game Cals got some bench guys so they are a deep team we talked about that in practice today how many players they had on the sideline and last year the plan for Curtis was to red shirt him yeah but then because of injuries in a depleted front Court he was needed to play and burn the red shirt so got some key minutes last year as Reus Petrus spinning into the lane and the rebound grab by Kadir Martin Martin whos got three brothers that played college basketball Phil played at UC Riverside Hassan and Malik both played at Rhode Island for Danny Hurley and the lay in by Kadir Martin and one of his older brothers on staff for Danny Hurley at Yukon yeah thats a good basketball family Ola Joseph drops it in well Im really again impressed with his footwork Cs big guys Roxy do a really good job avoiding the travel and keeping their feet down the pivot P Pete n would be proud I can tell you that the master of of footwork was Pete new Pete new big man no question and he improved a lot of players for sure help my teams I can tell you that sha Jackson Jr tough off balance floater Joshua Ola Joseph skies for the rebound as Jackson by the way lost his shoe in the process of the other end for the Lakers Andre sto yakovich on the weak side Joshua Ola Joseph has his shot blocked will get to the line here you go we talked about the footwork Roxy theres the the the the show the go to the basket the freeze how about just freezing your Defender into the air again by keeping his pivot feet down thats just Clinic I mean thats thats textbook pivoting in the post one more for Joshua Ola Joseph now a season ey 12 points his career best is 17 twice while playing for Minnesota as Andre sakovich is night is probably done and hell depart with 15 which matches a season low thats all and Joshua Ola Joseph converts both the good thing for Cs Buster Douglas aint walking through that door not yet although he is 64 now yeah well it didnt stop Tyson did it well 58 did stop him well it didnt stop his bank account very good point inside 345 tough step back shot from Jake Luman and it goes out of bounds last Touch by Spencer Mahoney will stay at this end 333 to go Cal putting the finishing touches on win number six okay yes okay 1 look she courtes Music for Music Music Music well there were plenty of Big Game Heroes on Saturday certainly Fernando mandza stole all the headlines but the internet sensation right now making its way across social media is Trevor skogerbo who is one of the equipment managers for Cal football this was the reception that he got from the team and Justin Willcox after they showed the highlight of him saving a helmet somebody tried to steal a helmet when the they stormed the field post game at the big game and he went maybe made the best tackle of the day uh unbelievable and Roxy what a game by the way that was an a finish if you want exciting finishes Cal coming back 98 yards

de Curtis you love to see guys you know get their teammates behind him and the fourpoint play a rarity for dein Curtis who hits his first career three and now a career high four points yeah well how

goal 10 give the hoop to Jake lemelman his first points of the night now this is the third unit thats in right now Roxy and Im telling you this third unit is not not bad I mean youre keeping Wilkinson

first run of the season and play at that prep Powerhouse down there in Orange County modern day well thats a Powerhouse indeed in and out for Deshawn Jackson Jr and then Jeremiah Wilkinson lost it out

Newton Mass for Mercy Hurst well Roxy we always measure players in their shoes some with lifts so if Im on my tippy toes some with lifts some have bigger shoes than others theyre still running their offense Roxy I never had a team do this to run their offense we had some WalkOns that actually got some big minutes for you over the years whether it was Ryan foran Kelly Robbie Jones Conor absolutely we had some very good walk on players but you got to remember walk on players were were stars in their high school teams Roxy true they they were theyre not you know to be taken lightly and the loose
