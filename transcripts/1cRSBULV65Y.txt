they hope to be but yet theyve got a lot of basketball yet to play and I think this Virginia Tech team is very very capable everybody remembers what they did last year and so theyre really well coached and theyre really excited about getting ready to get into the tournament final game of the night in the ACC we just saw Virginia topple Clemson in Charlottesville opening tap control by the home team the cards in red tonight once again L Ellis has it and Louisville goes to work four wins on this season the upset against Clemson two weeks ago perhaps the Highlight up to this point Curry outside to Ellis nine to shoot Alice the fade away and hes short the rebound by Padula Sean Padula in the starting five again Hunter Couture MJ Collins Justin Muntz so Dynamic operating in that high post area leads the Hokies and assists Grandpa silly who he told you about almost 22 per in the last 10 medulla in traffic no in the rebound controlled by Jalen Withers one of the things Louisville has really done to help themselves is cut down on the turnovers they have been able to execute their half court offense a lot more efficiently I think Ellis has gotten better in that department too over the course of this season yeah I think early he tried to do too much and now hes understanding what he can and cant do trainer Off the Mark put back something in for Cindy Curry is a big strong guy underneath and theyre really going to try to hurt Virginia Tech on the glass they think they can have some success against them with their offensive rebound and the DoubleDouble in their previous meeting good cut by Justin mutson were tied one of the things this Virginia Tech team does because of Mike young they isolate guys and they put guys in situations off of them offensive execution to get easy looks saw the number there much just six boards away from a thousand in his career Withers lost the handle two on one Couture fancy bounce pass the layups Good by Padula Padula and Couture seems like they were connected from birth they really played well together they play off of each other extremely well they both are extremely top competitive guards they give your head coach Mike young you would love to have the tour back for those four games that he missed where Tech really struggled and that certainly has been a consistent theme this year just trying to find consistency in the backcourt and again maybe if you reach full strength in the health department in Greensboro you know Tech could be that surprise team trainer no Curry tracks it down turns it over Applause and an open look wide open short Applause S I will say this is my first look at Louisville this year coach we were at shoot around practice and the energy with this team is really good despite the record Curry connects down low well one of the things theyve done as a season progressed is theyve gotten the ball in the hands of God where they can make plays I thought earlier in the season they operated too far away from the basket and tried to make individual plays instead of letting the system get them better shots quick spin by much outside like James no lets check if that was Collins Applause it does say something though about Kenny Payne he talked to him hes smiling hes not worried about himself hes worried about this team you looked at team in practice and shoot around high energy listening being coachable I think theres a lot of boxes checked behind the scenes that fans dont realize well first of all Kenny Paynes a winner sure I mean every place hes been hes won hes coached under John Calipari he was picked up by the New York Knicks the coach there so he understands and he comes with the confidence level that hes got his team to understand its not about him its about them its about their growth and development and theyre starting to understand that better and trainer the easy flush Parts back in front well again what theyre trying to do is go inside on this Virginia Tech team they think theyre a little soft there and they think that their strength and low post play can be an advantage Music the tour high off the glass at home Couture is awful tough this Virginia Tech Team and this is why missing Couture hurt is executes off of continuity executes off of skill sets and so when a piece is missing it throws a lot of things off and now getting him back theyre back in the flow Ellis from the logo not this time were tied at six at the first median timeout oh JJ trainer coming right into your living room the pass somehow got there the easy bucket be waiting for the next two hours all eyes on Greensboro next week for the start of the ACC tournament Music and an interesting start here so far tonight Mike young youre number four in Blacksburg after a stellar career at Whopper upstate South Carolina Kenny Payne of course year number one won a national championship here in Louisville back in 86 as a player and a long time assistant coach at Kentucky you mentioned coach for the Knicks I talked with him today I said look I want to know about the seasons first time Ive had a chance to sit down with Coach Payne its like you know its not about me its about these players its about growing these players out making sure that they make the right decisions as they grow up in life and I said I hear you I understand that but I want to know who youve leaned on this year when things have have gotten tough and I mean hes got a Rolodex coach he first name out of his mouth was Coach Cal of course at archrival Kentucky but you got Larry Brown and he went through a whole laundry list of names of people that have reached out that have offered you know their assistants are just an ear perhaps everybody that ever met Kenny Payne likes Kenny Payne theres nobody in this business that doesnt respect KP so thats natural but Mike young was exactly the same way being in South Carolina having an understanding of what he did at Walford is tremendous uh great coach better human being Mike James Off the Mark Hokies get it back heres Padula off the bounce its bottled up somehow gets a shot away much gives him a press 20 bizilli short and he goes back to the cards part of this Virginia Tech DNA is their ability to shoot the basketball when theyre not shooting the ball well then they get sometimes they get in trouble because they try to over penetrate they try to create a little too much off the dribble as opposed to letting their system by their system I mean their staggers theyre pinned down their curls get them good shots heres Kamari lands his first touch and a basket to the midrange he is playing extremely well he picked up his play from the beginning of the year till now theyve been able to go to him on some isolations type of situations and hes really delivered tell you what I love its not sexy but he shoots 94 from the free throw line basically leads the country in terms of firstyear players that tells you and shows you hes a great shooter very bright future silly with positions swatted Away by Ellis out of bounds well Kenny Payne told L Ellis this morning to shoot around you have to play the best defensive game of the Season tonight we need you to do it working against Padula working against Hunter Couture yeah these two guards are tough competitive guards and theyre really smart and theyll take advantage of mistakes so what he was telling Alice was you got to mentally stay in the game not easy to do with all the cuts inside to Lynn Kidd and thats what Im talking about thats Virginia Tech basketball at his best getting baskets off of assists getting baskets off of movement Applause Ellis over to James and the runner not this time definitely Hatfield to Rouse it a fresh 20 James an open look thats a three trainer theres Alice open for a minute with three opportunities Louisville comes up empty Virginia Tech has to do a better job on blocking out and keeping Louisville off the offensive glass coach give me your mentality final day of February youve been a part of final four teams you know what it takes to get there as teams start the eye conference tournaments how do things start to shift and how you go about practice and how you go about your business and trying to make sure were best positioned to make a Deep Run well youre short in practice because physically you should have a lot of the stuff in it becomes more mental and guys understanding their roles at this point they should know what works and what does not work through through experiences and so you just really emphasize that a lot more film work a lot more walk through getting them mentally tied in what we can do and what we can if I was called on Huntley Hatfield thats his first I think thats the first foul that weve had called in this game tonight almost eight minutes in whens the last time you saw that coach well this is a good officiating crew and the thing I say about officiating Crews good officiating Crews understand the difference between activity and valves whats amazing how much uh former coaches now in the broadcasting realm appreciate veteran officiating Crews like what we just heard from one Mr Perry Clark 108 Virginia Tech and in front of Louisville nine minutes in almost Dallas Senate LeBron for Smith I mean Jerry Eve it goes on and on and on and probably would have got another one if Wade Houston hadnt taken his son to Tennessee with him Alan Houston he turned out to be a pretty good player too he was pretty special out of the time 108 Tech leading Louisville and it goes back to the Hokies Perry Clark Roy Philpott here at the Yum Center on a Tuesday night the regular season winding down how about this the final day of February today Im not sure what happened to the first two months of 2023 its gone by quick its gone by awful quick but the fun is about to really start now thats right we get you in champ week coming up next week that countdown is on ACC tournament in Greensboro coming up next week everybody trying to get the elusive double by at the top and a foul called as mutts try to attack the left side you mentioned the officials tonight Lee Cassell Bill Covington Jr AJ Desai leading this veteran ACC crew Jalen Withers picks up his first person but Id say thats where mutts really I think operates extremely well on the elbows why he operates so well on the elbows is because he can pass he can shoot from there and he can create scoring opportunity when you get the ball in that slot area you cant get any help from the corner where he has the ball now to get help from the corner you got to shoot her there so he wanted to see him there he gets to the rim so thats a very effective area for him to operate now when Couture was out you didnt have that shooter in the corner so they could Jam him and he wasnt able to dribble drive as well as he can right now showed you the quickness there and then trainer recovered for the block that went off of much out of bounds cards get it back down too Louisvilles trying to play everything inside the paint if you notice most of these shots are inside the paint which forces Virginia Tech defensively to collapse and they dont get as many run outs heres kid inside a nice move but back out space for Padula whips it across and thats a three and Rodney rice now is playing in game number four for Virginia Tech fans thats a welcome sight hes a very talented basketball player I coached his dad Ive seen him grow up he is as advertised when he gets some reps and get his sea legs under him hes going to be a really great player for Virginia Tech Applause injury surgery back in August he comes back then he breaks his pinky finger midJanuary in practice miss about five and a half weeks as a result we saw him on the floor against Duke had a couple of Threes that was impressive inside kidno and a good box out by trainer see I think when they throw it inside theyve got to give kids some action so he has some options of where else to throw the ball mutts comes away with it and ahead to Rice it was fouled Rodney rice to the straight 23 this season and you can tell how much confidence they have in rice hes this is only his fourth cut game coming back to play a lot of guys with red shirt but they feel that his best basketball is ahead of him with this mixture with Couture and the rest of the guys on the team he really can get better and improve himself freshman out of Maryland one more coming for rice and we remind you the Ally ACC womens basketball tournament starts tomorrow Greensboro Coliseum every matchup with the championship games right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app our first round coverage starts at 12 30 Eastern with the nothing but net crew and if youre a Virginia Tech fan watching tonight I would encourage you to watch this week womens shy Kenny Brooks done a remarkable job with Elizabeth kitley Georgia a more and I think the team thats going to win the ACC championships Music health of Olivia miles the standout point guard for Notre Dame front and center in everybodys mind right now see if she can play and a foul caught on a Nifty move by Kamari lands youve mentioned youd love 22 in red and his potential yeah hes hes got an active body hes skill set is good he puts the ball on the floor well and then he can Elevate and go get his shot hes a very talented basketball player 94 at the line this year you know some guys just walk in the gym and they just after youve done it for long enough you can just say okay he can play you know his poets and the way he carries himself hes a good player now you were an assistant at South Carolina and I forget the name of the player but one of your guys about six seven years ago shot around this same clip and he had made like 70 in a row at one point in time and I mentioned it and sure enough he missed two free throws in the game I called and we just saw Kamari lands my question did we win or lose the game so I know whether that we can be friends the rest of the night I think you won I think you won rice left open for a minute boy the leg kicked out and a foul caught on the threepoint shot Applause thats a very effective move that coming over the screen and then then refusing it and then fading on it and again when you work around the elbows it just gives you better floor spacing and the ability to do more offensively I think LL has thought the same thing that I did as he came down that leg kicked out ah nah thats a legit thats hes got to come down right that thats you got to give him space to come down sure one more coming for Rodney rice you know one of the things that I think is hard is to get yourself in sync when youve been sitting out and get your Rhythm and and its different than playing in practice and playing real games in front of people real time I I think you got to get your timing back your continuity and I just think that takes some time eight nothing Run for the Hokies over the last four plus minutes no team struggling from the floor heres Mike James left hand off the glass its obvious what Louisville is trying to do theyre trying to drive the ball and finish everything at the rim and put pressure on Virginia Tech to keep them out of the pain silly still found a point leading scorer for the Hokies rice thats a three no Lance has it Applause Alice is doing a really good job of getting Louisville into their offensive sets mentioned that first game earlier tonight Virginia feeding Clemson thats a foul as Poteet picks up his first Applause yeah and again I mean this is where I think Louisville has grown instead of settling for three theyre looking to see James hes attacking using his body as athleticism and putting a lot of pressure on the defense and when they do that then they dont turn it over and when they do that they get higher percentage shots when they do that they get to the foul line so its a lot of good things that happen and last foul on Couture who prevented the pass from being caught under eight to go in our first half definitely Hatfield the spin but Doula has it for the Hokies Virginia Tech has not gotten any or not many easy looks about that one for basily and splashes it on because thats what happens when they get easy looks you know but because they havent been able to get a lot of run outs because again logo has driven the ball and most of the rebounds has been done in the paint and an offensive foul Huntley Hatfield just picked up his second now coach this is the first main three of the game I tell you what brazili does a good job on the pick and Pops in Virginia Tech is playing their Style attack Over Louisville coach Perry Clark Im Roy Philpot we mentioned Virginia beating Clemson earlier tonight in Charlottesville coach that gives us a moment to reflect and certainly extend our deepest condolences to our friends in Charlottesville after learning the news Sunday night the passing of the great Terry Holland the former Davidson basketball player led Virginia of course as a head basketball coach for 16 years took the Wahoos to the final four twice and then later as an athletic director I mean one of the alltime greats in the conference I grew up watching him as a basketball coach and those great teams with Ralph Sampson and so many great players that uh matriculated through Charlottesville VA and where the news was stunning when we found out about I know that you knew coach pretty well didnt you yeah Ive met him in 1981 I interviewed for a job there uh before I went on to Georgia Tech and we became friends and just an outstanding coach in a better person as far as even back then with diversity and understanding and trying to make Virginia more Progressive in a lot of ways and he had a great staff with Craig little page and the great Jim Marine was a Youngster back then and heres a little thing they used to play softball when I came from my interview I had to go watch him play softball wow and all like that and they thought they were pretty good softball players but it was a very closeknit staff a very closeknit community and uh Terry did so much for the growth of the ACC and his competitiveness uh its diversity its understanding and if he was just a forerun and then ultimately became an administrator so its a tremendous sad day for um the the league and he meant so much to so many people Applause yeah Ellis the threepoint play his first bucket it was 24 per game the last five the tour made it three a moment ago that was the second triple by the Hokies in the last two minutes zilly inside a Nifty finish and thats where the spacing of Virginia Tech gets to be really effective theyre really good when much can pass the basketballs brazily can move around and they can space them with three really good shooters Hokies lead by nine thats a three by James trainer tried to save it could not Louisville cannot fall in the Trap of chasing three I think they have to continue even though theyre behind they have to continue to try to get the ball inside deep three bezelli all net and just like that he scored eight the largest lead for the Hokies in a Timeout called by Kenny Payne yeah Kenny Payne saw that what they were doing was not going to lead them to success so he does what good coaches do timeout back at 30 game now with their largest lead and bazilly and Couture getting it done so far and really bulk of that production coming here in the last three minutes coach yeah and a lot of it again has to do with Virginia Tech stretching the floor their Concepts and how they move the ball and their skill set of the things that make this team really special I think Ellis bottled up shot clock under 10 Mari lands the step back trainer Mike James a couple of pump aches and off the glass it drops but this is this is where Louisville has really improved they take the time out because they go away from what theyre doing after the time out they come right back and they execute attacking the basket getting in the paint thats why this team has gotten better over the course of the year Applause look Rodney rice buries it thats what he can do he is a really good shooter but also a very smart player tokis have made for their last five from distance Mike James Strong finish Again Louisville theyre much better when theyre slicing and attacking the basket as opposed to chasing threes thats the biggest difference and thats the biggest growth in this team my ball scream for Padula oh sweet pass mutts couldnt finish Here Comes Ellis Applause midrange for Lance is there and Kamari lands The Freshman out of Indy see earlier in the year he would have just shot the three he took his time he understands what coach Payne wants he attacked the basket Louisville fans in attendance here on senior night trying to provide a smart bizelli double team on the Block gets it back up and in hes got 10 hes tough you know that was a great isolation they removed the weak side help and got the ball inside Applause James against Padula bowls him over Smash Mouth basketball Louisville has found a way to play that allows them to have a level of success one of the things coming into the season this Louisville team was very inexperienced they didnt have the experience of a lot of team they have grown over the course of the season off the Martin Lance thought about it you mentioned that a few minutes ago his patience there you know coach Payne theyre going to add some pieces theyll get uh you know better talent and as this thing grows but hes got them playing in the system where they can have some success well step aside less than three to go in the first half Hokies by nine along our condolences to Virginia the late Terry Holland weve been about his passing Sunday night you told me during the break you got one Terry story were recruiting Brian Stitt only Georgia Tech in Virginia really knew how good he was on a Saturday night he came in on Friday we got a basketball game with the Hawks that were taking him to and all of a sudden his mom and dad show up and they show up at the game and after the game they take him home and so hes been Saturday night and everything they just said they were missing him I saw it and they wind up signing that Virginia I saw Terry later that summer I said I know you didnt have anything to do with the Stitch showing up and taking him out of there he said parody you think I was going to let him spend the whole 48 hours with you and criminal in Atlanta he went up to that time coach he got you but he was he was the ultimate competitor he was a great guy and I tell you what he did he raise the level of play in the ACC getting to keeping Ralph Sampson in Virginia at that time he was being recruited by everybody and uh keeping Ralph there not only keeping him there but keeping him there all those years and everything really just changed the dynamic of the ACC I certainly did the foul was called on Wheeler thats his first a couple of free throws by Collins and the Hokies back in front by 11 this same Louisville team will be in Charlottesville coming up Saturday two Eastern on ESPN2 for the great 30 for 30 survive in advance and listening to Ralph Sampson talk about what it was like in those days playing the ACC and each and every summer red R back from the Boston Celtics would show up at his house and say Ralph we want to draft you number one no sir Im going back to Virginia Ive got unfinished business I thought it was great interview that they did with him reflecting on his time in Charlottesville but Ralph Sampson at 74 who could move the way he could we didnt see anybody like that at that point in time anyway no I used to say back then there were guys that only God could stop and we dont see a whole lot of those guys like that can you imagine worthy and Jordan and Samson and Baez and I mean the league was just absolutely loaded and Tim Duncan and I mean that kind of talent and everything but I tell you what right now I just think teams that execute and are able to win off of their team concept and execution has an advantage thats why I think this Virginia Tech team has a chance a real good chance in the ACC tournament because they do do such a great job with their execution in their style of play cards have made their last five field goals lead is at nine Tech is led by as many as 13 at 2815 in fact in this first half and we used to have some recruiting Wars now it was fun I mean everybody knew who everybody was recruiting and everything well your Georgia Tech teams I mean you you recruited Dennis Scott Brian Oliver Kenny Anderson coming in that pipeline in New York City back in the day uh you know we got Tommy Hammonds we played about 10 years in the NBA it came down to us and wait and that was an interesting recruiting Because we both didnt know where he was going to go and were both sitting around Crestview Florida trying to for him to make a decision Alice for three tip in no and the foul caught on much over the back this is where I think Virginia Tech has gonna have to work and do a better job rebounding the basketball and being more physical on that blockouts theyve given up a lot of second shots to Louisville and as they get into the tournament to make their run theyre going to have to be able to handle their defensive glass Jalen Withers 77 percent at this strike get one more scoreless so far tonight but hes been pretty solid the last 15 games or so nine times in double digits averaging about six rebounds per game over the course of that same time span over two here the rebound and a sweet dish board then dropped the dime for the two Applause of the cards hanging around trailing only by seven approaching a minute to go torno mutts on the offensive glass Elli up and in boy some great passing by The Bigs for both sides well thats what much does hes really skilled I mean whether or not hes a three or four his skill set is really good he can turn Face Pass Drive Music I mean lets look at it from both sides because first it was wheeler then it was spice right there you saw Quick Pass right there great finish and now you see much give it the pizzelli but you see how well they play off of each other and thats one of the things that this Virginia Tech Team really does but again Im really impressed with Louisville their competitiveness on the glass but more important Roy is theyre understanding how they want to play I mean I think you can look at a team and you can see what it is theyre trying to do you know when I used to coach I used to tell my team if somebodys looking at you they order at least have an understanding of what we practice I said theyve been looking at you and have no clue of what we practiced then Ive probably done a pretty bad job so at least you understand what Louisville is trying to do and this is why I think theyve gotten better over the course of the season cards with two conference wins like James operating again on Couture check that on Padula James will get it back Pub fake muscles it up it is one of the foul call didnt get it James in double figures hes got 12 points in the first half hes attacking the basket hes big hes strong hes using his athleticism to finish James with 12 zilly with 12 for the Hokies Applause well Tech may try to go two for one instead they get the long three now they can perhaps play for that final shot about a two second differential between the clocks Applause Music Mike young is talking to officials coaching his team talking to his staff got a lot happening uh thats when youre a heck of a coach hell shoot two and he gets the call at the end of it that he wants thats a heck of a coaching job right there in that possession second personal on Roosevelt wheeler the muds you see there just one board away from a thousand thats a lot of rebounds its a lot of glass cleaning it is and hes a very talented player and its so instrumental in what Virginia Tech wants to and how they want to play Applause but 62 percent at the strike try to make it a nine point advantage cannot desperation Eve time Kamari lands 3527 our score at the break Mike chains with 12 rampazilly with 12 to Pace the Hokies here on senior night at the Yum Center carts trying to go out said a lot of times being done because theres a lot of different ways you can do that you can do that by cutting practice back some some coaches believe you got to go harder now um and you gotta just make sure I think you have to really execute the things that you feel are allows you to have success pokies have it first and the road whites contour for three no Smackdown of bounds itll stay on this end see thats the tight fit execution at Virginia Tech does Mike young is great growing up plays to get Guys open looks but now Virginia Tech needs to start knocking down those open looks that they get well Justin mutz has now reached the 1000 rebound barrier needed six tonight he has achieved that and Couture grabbing his left ankle that is not what you want to see now in clear pain it looks like he was trying to make a cut and normally in traffic I didnt see exactly what happened a lot of times you step on somebodys foot its four games earlier in the season least good to see him put a little pressure on it walk under his own power even if its wincing somewhat normally with me with my players when they were in pain right away it normally wasnt that serious when they seemed to be okay and kept saying they were okay and we took them back it was a lot more serious so hopefully thats not very serious 100 Couture back to the locker room but silly triple team turns it over heres Kamari lands lands effective in the first half had four points two of three from the floor for the freshman just underway here in our second half carts trailing by eight their first possession now Justin mutts weve talked about his vision we mentioned now the rebounding second active player D1 with a thousand points a thousand boards 400 dimes in a career very impressive well he is and I think the way theyre able to utilize him because he can play inside outside in his versatility makes this Virginia Tech Team a really difficult team to play coach you want to see L Ellis get more involved maybe launch a couple of deep threes try to find a rhythm only if he gets them wide open in transition I really do like the way that this Louisville team is playing and how theyre trying to attack because theyre not turning it over theyre putting pressure on Virginia Tech at The Rim I think if they start shooting threes I think that that they can shoot themselves out of the game cards over eight from downtown to start tonight too last game in which they did not make it three was 2015 against Pittsburgh game that they ironically won silly misses from Point Blank Range scoreless here in our first 90 seconds to start the second you know early I think Ellis felt the need to have to score every basket right you can put a lot of pressure on himself good defense by months a couple of blocks Hoagies get it back you know Sydney Curry had nowhere to go with those two shots well Kerry has to use his body to create angles hes not going to jump over anybody but Doula jumps over his Defender and the sophomore out of Edmond Oklahoma first points in the second half for either side Ellis hit the deck and a foul call Couture was back on the field or back on the floor excuse me reinjured perhaps that same left ankle again again though I tell you when normally when theyre in pain they wind up being able to play through it is when they think that theyre all right coach he snuck back on the floor hes moving around pretty good on it right now we all kind of held our breath there for a moment yeah hes very very important they cant afford for him to miss games trainer tied up by months stays with the cards see I think Lance can drive it I think that um if James can drive it I think Ellis can drive it but I I think theyre the only guys that can really beat guys off the dribble that Louisville has hokeys attacking the pain again a good look much gets it back up and in lead us back to 12 Ellis attacking drop hes got five and you know but hes playing a really good floor game and hes hes given his team a chance to win by Distributing the basketball and not turning it over cards just three total assists tonight on 14 makes from the floor lead is at 10 Virginia Tech has not won at Louisville since 1991 its been a while Collins open Cardinals get it back that was Trader correct me if Im wrong coach 91 Im thinking about the old Metro conference days thats the long yes it was spin by Ellis a teardrop is in and out Applause and Couture back outside MJ Collins well he was in the air forever a late whistle and a foul call thatll put two in white in the strike Virginia Techs got a guy on that Ace Customs that I might have been playing on that team that won here because thats when they were pretty good there you see the drive and again it looks like all ball right there thats a tough call thats a clean block that that thats a tough call trainer picks up his first set the line 73 percent Applause great kid back on the floor for the Hokies and thats one of the things that they hope with kid he gives them a more physical presence I think coach young understands as you get into the tournament you got to have some physicality in the low post area much really doesnt give you that because thats not really what he does uh so hes got to use kid I think to come in and be kind of a space eater and give him some physicality in the post Hokies do not win the ACC tournament you have to think that they would be a prime candidate get into the NIT and maybe host a game or two in the NIT not ideal by any stretch but you know your season to end without any postseason kid the rebound Hokies have been a Mainstay postseason play Applause go back to Buzz Williams now Texas A M great job that Mike young has done his team is more than competitive since his arrival Applause and a foul call gets us to our first media timeout pokeys trying to seize control hows it going to the same Barbershop and so they would go to the barber shop and they had to hear it and its really a competitive thing and its a real rivalry and I think real is a bit of an understatement Fabio pacilli checking in and he connects 11 in red his first points well he averages 16 per game his 15th game Off the Bench this season here tonight and perhaps a spark that head coach Kenny Payne is in search of lead down to 10 five minutes into the second half kid inside patience see hes got to finish that yeah thats what Virginia Tech needs they need a big inside that can finish that that will open up more shot opportunities for their guards on the perimeter James had 12 in the first half as yet cracked the scoring column in the second and that should change here two free throws coming James has just been Relentless and attacking the basket one of the things that Louisville wanted to do was give Virginia Tech a lot of different looks and try to be disruptive to them offensively so they couldnt get in any sort of offensive flow Cardinals just 15 at the line tonight first free throws of the evening for Mike James 76 percent at the line this year ACC rookie the week back in January after averaging almost 22 per a couple of games against Syracuse and wake forests LL is trying to get going tonight as well off to a bit of a slow start at least by his standards recently Miguel Ellis has an interesting decision to make in terms of next season hes got a chance to come back if he chooses but he was recognized on senior night tonight you got to think that head coach Kenny Payne going to hit the portal pretty hard especially in the backcourt what would that mean for number three in red in his production next year after almost 19 points per game this season you look at the names on the walls here that it played here at Louisville this program is going to get back to that level the tour opened buries a three and thats what he does real well you look at this building you look at the type of season they had they have a great crowd theres people in the suit in the Suites they love their basketball here uh the history of this place Louisville is going to be back its no question about that this is a basketball Mecca you walk in the Yum Center it feels like youre walking into an NBA arena Ive been here in a while I was first time Ive been here in a couple of years tonight and I was reminded of that very fact that theyre serious about Hoops here its no question about it and uh they understand basketball they appreciate it and uh this city thrives on this and Kenny Payne understands what this program means hes rallying the troops and this program is going to be back to the level that its used to being at Sean Padula gets basily to spin short James will track it down Applause you know you just wonder if the Cardinals have enough Firepower to launch that run thats needed to really make this one close down the stretch theyve been close at times and defensively I think theyve been pretty good again trying to be able to score and James still attacking the basket theyve not done what they should do at the foul line theyve missed some several easy baskets uh but at least theyre attacking and I think theyre playing within themselves and not just shooting threes because when they shoot threes Virginia tacticals can get a lot of run out and thatll be able to stretch their leads Alice against Couture puts it up and in see he Alice is playing good basketball and I think a lot of people early expected him to come down they wanted to see him jack up threes and play at a pace thats the rest of the Louisville team couldnt play at over the ball so much right but hes gotten better lately right coach yes because hes listening to Coach and hes playing for his coaching not the fans not always easy to do with this social media age that we live in James left open well that would have been huge motivated two possession game instead Hokies get it Applause zilly with 12 so he just got to turn to shoot the ball over the defender hes bigger hes stronger basilys not a guy thats going to back you down like that Rodney rice wide open but silly has it down for Louisville and a blocking foul called on Padula thats his first 14 pounds pokeys now with four team fouls just two called on Louisville yeah so feisty he got back there he thought he took the charge and everything but you know hes the ultimate point guard and uh he does such a great job for this Virginia Tech Team tell LL is trying to generate some sort of spark pop it right off numerals hero and Hunter Couture I dont think appreciated it hell save The Possession Series dates back between these two to 1979 we mentioned those Metro conference Glory Days in the 80s early 90s where conference realignment changed everything shot clock down to 10 Sicilian rice lobs it nearly out of bounds saved by trainer hell put it up and in right over facility all right dont look now the lead down to seven Mike young will grow up a play right now bazilly wide open there it is Money in the Bank thats what Mike young does Im telling you nobodys better at drawing up planes and just like that the lead back to 10 no they ran the set Vasily was wide open Ellis slashing and slicing right to the rim and thats a better mindset than him chasing threes thats the type of offensive execution that will allow his team to win this games picked up a nice Rhythm the last two minutes and a turnover Cardinals get it back and hes looking at Brazilian like why did you pass the ball Mike young is there five guys thats not the way we Brew it up Music and we remind you fans to download the ACC threepoint challenge champ presented by New York Life to help benefit the local Boys and Girls Club score points for your school and after the tournament the local Boys and Girls Club will receive a donation from New York Life based on their Affiliated ACC teams final ranking the QR code is there right now the threes are dropping for Mike Young and the Hokies tonight theyre six of 20 from Deep a lot of those coming here in the last 10 or 15 minutes of game time Louisville so far decided not to participate in said challenge cards are 0 for 9 for mine to three point Arc well see if that changes coach well you know I think theyll start to get some because theyre really attacking the basket hard but its funny when you look at coaches and see coaches reactions in certain plays and you know thats not the way it was drawn up with the way it was executed and thats what happened on that turnover Perry Clark Im Roy Philpot weve got just under 11 minutes to go in this one Cardinals trying to Spring the upset Ellis puts it in hes got 11 and number three in red starting to heat up thats where hes off with uh hes attacking the basket hes taking good shots you can feel pressure starting to shift a little bit towards the team in white big possession here mutts high low seven to shoot again what Virginia Tech is doing right now theyre spreading the floor theyre putting much on the perimeter and and theyre trying to play with one post guy and being able to drive the basketball but theyve got to have a post presence Couture off the screen quick trigger no Poteet the rebound outside to Rice and a foul called on the floor this one against the Cardinals Applause lead at six Withers just picked up his second L Ellis second half has been much more kind up to this point well hes being much more aggressive now tour again this time its all that well that release is quick he just needs an inch to get that shot away yeah but that was all Grown Up by Mike young the isolation right there coming off the big he faked like he was going over cow cut and came back off of backstream L is from downtown response first three of the night for the Cardinals Applause but hes doing it within the Florida offense youve been youve been asking for that all night its coming I like dumpster threes you know Im simple Couture heard me couldnt get the shot off the lob I thought Mike should have shot that here comes Alice one on Three wise decision Mike James bump Mike James on the floor no bucket now Ima tell you Virginia Tech does not play zone and so they just keep coming at them there you see Couture on a pot right there and then Alice comes right back you see him attacking and now obviously they got him backed off and he knocks down a three Applause but Virginia Tech does not play zone and so look the Lord will continue to attack and try to get to the fouling trainer open for three one possession game JJ with a little deep sauce Virginia Tech needs a timeout 50 to 47 the cards in the midst of us movement right there knocked down with three thats Louisville and this team has some abilities got some talents but Lord was used to first round draft choices on their team Kenny Payne gonna get him back to where they have first round draft choices with this atmosphere a team with this kind of record and this kind of support they love Louisville basketball here this will be a tremendous boost to the ACC when this place gets rocking and rolling like again I think I just saw Jack Harlow somewhere as well maybe that was a fat head in the stands Im not sure but you get the picture its a threepoint game Louisvilles in the midst of a six nothing run cards have made their last five field goals we got a ball game right now its important for Virginia Tech to get a good luck theyve got to go through one of their guards Petula or Couture to set out the play pokeys trying to notch their seventh win in the ACC this season Couture double team Couture couldnt finish and a foul called who was it on its all Louisville but theyve been banging and bumping inside the whole game second on trainer Applause much left wide open thats a three 25 in white 33 percent on the season that was money and thats what he does Im telling you hes really skilled hes able to step away and he can do that to critique now is in the game as in the low post Ella short one of the foul you know but hes got to keep playing thats what he used to do earlier in the season he didnt get a call but now you just got to keep playing because hes going to get other opportunities mutts attacking and mutts was fouled so in a night where Justin butts recorded rebound number one thousand to match 1 000 points in his career 400 assists in his career arguably hes hit the biggest shot of the night with that three moments ago and now free throws coming after the under eight media attack those first two days and not having to play and with the double by allows you not to put yourself in that situation so I think its extremely important well you cant wake and Duke and NC State all playing that second day well theres going to be some drama you can feel you can feel it cooking here tonight you can feel it cooking next week in Greensboro you got Duke Carolina this weekend every possession matters every play is big Music James just two points so far in the second had 12 in the first half and he wants it here against Petula James lefthanded trying to spin it off the glass and it was too strong yeah he should have high jumped that he should have gone one more hard dribble high jump and put it on the top of the uh white square only mutts caught one right in the face and he wants it back trainer on bazilly and a foul called that that thats the foul uh Louisville doesnt need third on Lance a freshman out of Indianapolis remember the ESPN 100 my guy Paul being cardi getting those rankings done all the time at such a high level shout out to coach hope youre watching tonight doing well mutts gets Withers gets it back another rebound and another bucket another double double two and thats just a breakdown on Louisvilles part they defended the first action and then didnt get the rebound so on that rebound and put back 11 points now 10 boards for Justin months under seven to go the lead back tonight it was three less than two minutes ago James double team tried to sneak it up and in couldnt do it and bazilly will slow it down James no one is challenging his shots hes hesitating in double clutching when all he really needs to do is go straight Out Boy mutton takeover mode hit the deck hard heres Alice well you can see that three coming Applause and it touched the shot clock Kenny Payne didnt like that sequence no but but thats where he can take the three okay and the transition that gives him a better opportunity hell give credit to the Hokies its getting loud timeout was called one possession game since then six straight points Lowes done a pretty good job on the silly this second half and limited his touches Petula the dump off pizzilli was bumped James pushed him in the back his first and again when the guards are able to drive the basketball it caused the defense to collapse and both guards Ive done a Couture and and Padula have done a good job of driving and dishes Grand pizzelli will shoot the one and one Hokies in the bonus rest of the way Applause coaches will always tell you guard play makes the difference and you know theres Mike young and hes got good guards they understand what he wants they they understand the concepts of his plays more than anything else thats why they wind up getting good shots in critical situations another rebound for months he nearly turned it over Padula retrieves it finally how about the passing Couture bezilla with the bounce thats the toughness thats the mental toughness that this Virginia Tech Team possesses a nine nothing run by the Hokies the lead back to 12 Mike young loves it the Hokies again asserting themselves grandpa zilli with 18 a couple of big buckets and a free throw here in the last two minutes after Louisville had tripped the deficit down to three and heres the thing its not physical ability its mental toughness to be able to execute Louisville and got in the game in a really good situation Virginia Techs mental intensity to execute in the Run what they wanted to run has allowed them to spread this lead further out and this is the problem Louisville has had they get close and all of a sudden they go two three minutes and miss some easy shots have defensive breakdowns theres a turnover just like that and it cost them thats mental thats not physical turnovers havent been that big of an issue just nine tonight give the Cardinals credit they were out rebounding Virginia Tech by 10 moments ago for the Hokies now tied it up at 34 boards a piece muds patient and the flush and a poster perhaps but again Virginia Tech right now theyre executing their plays excellently much with 13 Points 11 boards three assists as well hes done a little bit of everything pokies get it back Jay Collins will hand it off to Padula once again theyre gonna melt the clock theyre going to take their time theyre going to get the shot that they want Music the Hokies needed this win it looks like theyre on their way Petula making a 14nothing run in the last four plus minutes and the lead swells to 17 the largest of the night you want to know how the league goes from three and spreads of South mental mistakes hobo jumpers there for Withers thatll stop the run more than four minutes without a point Virginia Tech Will execute every time down the ball will touch the tours hands the tulas hands as far as initiating and getting a good look they play through those guys and those guys set up everybody else and for just tuning in Hunter Couture went out for about 20 seconds in the first half what appeared to be a lower leg injury looked a lot worse than what it actually was he snuck back on the court for the next media timeout appears to be okay Petula is quite nice a couple of quick deep threes those two guys they were joined at Birth they play so well together they understand what coach is trying to do when he calls to play he knows they know what options that hes looking for Applause its nice to have guards guarding you as a coach and can step up and make buckets when you need them as the tooler and send the Virginia Tech on a winning moment of tonights game well if a little Justin bunch is good more is better went over the 1000 rebounding Mark tonight and a couple of Big Time plays including right in the grill uh Brandon Huntley Hatfield moments ago in a critical moment in this game get your biscuits ready for 25 in wide he got it done tonight coach he did when they needed him he stepped up another double double I believe that is his eighth of the season if I read my note card correctly a few moments ago Louisville out of the timeout Ellis for three and once again has it well the last time cards won at Louisville we mentioned the Metro conference you coaching the Metro you were the twotime Metro conference coach of the year back in the day at Tulane man thats that was a great basketball league and you had these two teams a part of it you had South Carolina you had Florida State you had Cincinnati you had Southern Miss and they said if Perry Clark could do that we need to break this league and thats what they did about three years later but there were some great basketball there it really was uh especially in the 80s but Bobby Huggins was just getting Cincinnati rolling uh Bill Foster had done a great job at Virginia Tech Applause with Penny Hardaway and you didnt defeat Benny Hardaway you just survived him Elliott Perry with the with the glasses the goggles it was a player a lot of players but the thing that helps him prepare for that was being in the ACC and at Georgia Tech and having to go against all the different talent that you had you had Mugsy Bogues at wake you had Lynn Baez at Maryland hes in love for Adrian branch in Maryland too I work with him for a number of years great I coached him at the Matha thats right you were an assistant I coach Mike Gray Applause now Mike gray in his final season at Notre Dame silly claims a rebound under two minutes to go be a nice win for the Hokies tonight they were tested it was a threepoint game about five minutes ago and inside to MJ Collins yeah certainly a tip of the hat to Mike brays he knows coming down the stretch in his final couple of games in South Bend tremendous human being position shine Percy Miller sand Payne on the floor son of the head coach good to see her on senior night as well for Louisville 23 in red approaching a minute to go yeah the demise of the Metro conference was unfortunate for us that grew up in the South watching all those games in the 80s and watching what Louisville was able to do and winning championships building a superpower in college hoops with pain the last second block but about well Denny krom is a very very special man I mean he did so much for college basketball when I came in and he dominated this league and uh you know he never ever uh did anything but be gracious and uh Ive got so much respect for him and what he did with this Louisville program Im just telling you what this was this place was a monster you used to get off the airport Freedom oh the Freedom Hall and Im just talking about it was massive and uh you know Daryl Griffin and Jerry Eaves and Purvis Ellison and I mean they had some horses Danny Crum I remember those teams I remember the run in 86 Cool Hand Luke he never sweated he had two big police theres Milt Wagner he had two policemen that used to walk behind him all the time and uh you know it it it was an event Im telling you well I just remember 1986 in the run the Cardinals made that year purpose Ellison coach Payne of course was a part of that crew thats when I first started following college basketball and it was Louisville Duke in that championship and so many great memories from that stretch and obviously even before that with other championships run Championship runs rather made by this program and Im with you they care about it too much here hes too good of a coach and recruiter I think thats been proven across multiple levels for this not to work for this not to bounce back and come back now its just a very very special place and uh you know and the players still live here everybody they still live here but that shows you the type of community that this is and how abrasive it is uh to this team and how much support they give now with that being said still a big win for Virginia Tech itll be the 17th of the Season seventh win in the ACC and the Hokies will get Florida State at Castle Coliseum this weekend will that be rocking pretty important game there and just to try to keep momentum going after this dub on the road before you head to Greensboro ward off with the three hell get it back could be the final possession for Tech and swatted out of bounds by wheeler look The Hokey survived this one lets call it what it was it was a threepoint game with five and a half minutes to go they closed strong which is what they needed to do today find a way to get the win you move on try to close out the regular season Saturday at home yes but they did that by executing and thats the thing thats going to allow them to have success in the ACC tournament is their ability to execute John Camden with a mess shot clock is off and that should just about do it Percy Miller and the Hokies get it done 7154 our final score Mike young says thatll do it Ill shake hands with Kenny Payne and mid Court s fall to 4 26 2 and 17 in the ACC one more game left as well for Louisville itll be a road trip to Virginia coming up Saturday on ESPN2 coach this has been fun enjoyed working with him Im telling you
