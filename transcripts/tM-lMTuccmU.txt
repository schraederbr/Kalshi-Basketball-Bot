ready to go Longwood in the dark blue and SMU in the white the tip is won back by this Longwood program Elijah Tucker an outstanding jumper a bouncing forward but Longwood as a team not very big but on the pick and roll Tucker leans in lays it home on the assist from Kobe Garland now Tucker showing his great athleticism right there quick move quick release for the snu Mustangs their starting lineup BJ Edwards Kevin poy Miller you trayor C Yu and Matt cross theyve settled on this lineup here lately its paying dividends 86 points per game that 16th best in the country an early Longwood Knock Out of Bounds this is a very good Longwood defensive team theyre going to get after you well they play manto Man both ball clubs today tough halfcourt manto man D cross going right and it runs into a blocking foul of Elijah Tucker and Tucker goes down hard Tucker getting peeled up off the court as cross goes to the line both these teams get to the line a ton coach Hower well this is going to be very interesting today John Longwood averages 26 free throws per game SMU 24 folks were liable to have a long game here today so get ready if these teams meet their averages were going to have 50 charity tosses Now Matt cross chemistry with the team has been improving hes been so much more consistent lately and you know hes not a very vocal guy by Nature kind of quiet but hes stepped up gotten more vocal as hes been more comfortable well hes may not be vocally aggressive but hes certainly aggressive with his play I like that drive to the bucket to open the possession for SMU one of two trip for the Mustangs Longwood starting lineup theyve settled on this the last four or five games kyell luk Kobe Garland Angelo Grizzy as the guards Michael Christmas and Elijah Tucker are the forwards Christmas their leading score almost 12 points per game Garland goes outside Grizzy into the paint deep outside for Luke is the transfer from St Bonaventure lobs it up high and Elijah Tucker lays it in how about that extreme quickness right there by Luke on that drive to the bucket SMU had good team rotation but not quick enough thats one of the keys you will see that I highlighted today for R SMU lets look at those keys to the game well SMU has got to handle the quickness of long wood and theyve got a dominate the paint Longwood theyve got a block out SMU much bigger 72 611 inside to 6866 for Longwood and then Longwood has to force turnovers theyre 13th in the entire nation in forc turnovers per game thats going to be something to watch closely Griff Aldrich the seventh year head coach of the Lancers again Longwood in the NCAA tournament two of the last three years winning the Big South championship and tournament each uh in 2022 and 2024 as Yan trayor heads to the line trayor 67 from the charity strip this year now he started all 12 ball games for the Mustangs one of three SMU players to do that boopy Miller and Edwards and treor all three have started all 12 little up and down this season for treor looking for him to become a better rebounder but obviously brings a lot of length at the four spot at 611 while you mentioned how small Longwood is according to kenpom they are the ninth smallest team in the nation average height for as who plays Tucker comes up way short and this is where SMU is so good is getting up and down the floor in transition yeah but that was good transition defense by Longwood dror offensive rebound and Spins it back in and thats what Griff Aldridge was concerned about SMU on the offensive glass well youve got to get a body on a body and the long wood did not do that that time on the defensive board effort Elijah Tucker inside nearly traveled but instead skips around yigu he has six points all of them for Longwood well Tucker did not get close on his outside shot but very effective in the paint coming off of five for five game against NC Central you can totally throws it away a steal for Angelo brzy he aage two steals a game in his last seven flying to the glass L comes up short but L continuing to show his quickness though just blowing by the SMU defense once again wow somehow Miller Tribbles out of traffic out to trayor behind the back down the basine little triple turn and his Fade Away goes five early points for Yan trayor well that was great defense that time by Elijah Tucker for Longwood treor just made a fabulous move great execution by the 611 forward for SMU correction six for trayor he and Elijah Tucker doing all the scoring for these two teams Garland with the left hand it in Kobe Garland hes really good from the midrange great at that pullup game yeah he certainly is as I mentioned earlier hes their second leading score leading assist maker big card on this team good quick Hands by Christmas to dislodge it from poopy Miller who is been so good assisted turnover ratio wise 23 one of the best in the ACC in that respect you can see this Longwood team four players out only one inside how about those drives can Contin into the bucket John great move right there by Kobe Garland Garlands got backto back buckets hes from the state next door from Magnolia Arkansas so far SMU has not adjusted to this quickness of Longwood those easy drives to the bucket but Longwood on the other hand they have not adjusted to the size dominance of SMU in the paint SMU is going to average about four Ines taller across the board than Longwood is in this game still its been a good back and forth effort between the two teams gets a little Zone look its around and off from the Baseline nearly got knocked back in for Tucker and here come the Mustangs they want to push it up the floor in 7 seconds or less and Bo B Miller is fouled By Angelo brzy who did not agree and Miller heads to the line on the other side a back and forth seesaw start after Christmas they stressed getting down the floor in 7 seconds or less and its worked for the Mustang they currently lead the ACC in AC in scoring offense averaging 86 points per game thanks so much Bri and Coach its really hard for teams to keep up with that kind of offensive Pace well its very very hard and its something that you dont see all that often and I like the way Bri brought that up coach Enfield NBA style of play most college teams do not get the ball up the floor every time in 7 Seconds like SMU normally does meanwhile after the poy Miller free thros SMU changing it up defensively a little bit well Im very impressed with that I like that strategy by the SMU coaching staff now Longwood did a great job coming out of that timeout to attack the Zone properly get the ball in the middle of that zone Christmas did a nice job of finishing the effort leads the team with almost 12 points a game but hes been on a tear recently cross outside buy Miller left alone and cans the three he has not been shooting the ball out side well of late but hes so capable well great spacing by SMU on that possession good ball movement nice job by the Mustangs both these ball clubs playing very very well here after the Christmas break normally it takes a little adjustment not so with Moody Coliseum today they get it to Christmas midrange again coach boy this is a very disciplined long fo blog Club I like the way they move the ball against that zone twice in a row getting it to their best athlete Michael christas love this matchup cuz its two teams come in playing very very well Longwood with a lot to prove playing the toughest team on their schedule so far this season and probably all year unless they make the tournament as the pass for yugao gets knocked away Longwood scores three SMU turnover Bo a good offside defense by zami that time for the Lancers in for the first time ring number five KJ mcer hes a division two all Amer in his first year at Longwood but Colby Garland again stepping inside finish in with the left hand hes got six this Longwood team well prepared for anything smus throwing at him defensively so far I am very very impressed W Garland has been responsible for three buckets and then hes assisted on four of the other five for long look trayor out of the corner Reigns home at three for SMU well Im just amazed how well both ball clubs are playing here shooting the ball well moving it well tror already with nine points he had 12 combined in his previous three games Garland out front Emanuel Richards comes inside the sophomore blobs it up off the glass follows his own Miss never hit the rim tend to shoot it off the Jump stop Christmas catch and shoot hes good from here and knocks down a three Michael Christmas has been on a tear from outside yeah three straight possessions for long wood Christmas has been the answer great job back and forth fun here in Dallas first game after Christmas inside the lane trayor out or it gets it from yatu misses on the three and yatu is called for the loose ball foul going after the offensive rebound thats his first well Longwood doing a great job that time defensively moving their feet SMU moving it well good look at coach Griff Aldrich in his seventh season at Longwood as you have said a couple of times John theyve been in the big dance too out of the last three years how about 67 wins the past three seasons lots of coaches would like to have that number beside their name absolutely he starred at division three Hampton Sydney thats very close by to Longwood so he knows the farm bill Virginia area very very well and now 7 years as the head coach at Longwood and has taken them to some incredible Heights McClurg calls down and turns it over McClurg has been absolutely on fire for Longwood to start the season he averaged 16 points a game over his first six but in the last eight thats declined down to about Five Points a game yeah M cler who we saw handle the ball inside that time hes taken the second most threes for this Longwood ball Club at 59 on the year that cross never met a physical game he didnt like thats out of bounds last touched by Johan zami zami the backup center and it stays with SMU 20 to shoot Longwood actually blocked out pretty well that time on that SMU shot attempt this the bigger body took over trayor on the love and he throws it down past Emanuel Richards a love out of bounds execution and SMU did it as good as you can do it right there great pass by Boy Miller the transfer from Wake Forest University fifth double figure game for trayor of his early SMU career Lancers looking for the lead back weve been in a back and forth situation 10 lead changes already Luke off the Jump stop knocked around in the air tror finally reaches it for SMU Here Comes Chuck Harris for the Mustang second leading scorer but he comes off the bench 12 points a game setting up MCL and Ls up a deep two finding the botom how about that by Harris coming in off the pine that time that young man started 32 of 33 games for SMU last year I love the adjustments hes made this year mclurg too hard on the open three another rebound for treor to go along with his 11 points hes got five boards all the way up the floor to Colbert and Colbert lays it in but its not going to count hes fouled on the floor Joan Joan zami well they are been phenomenal in All Phases of the game Im very impressed one note that we didnt have on there this team also is 13th in the nation in turnovers forced per game thats a big big stat to watch here this afternoon well absolutely as SMU has given it away a few times early on the pull up by Harris rolls off SMU shooting seven of 11 from the field theyre up by two the Lancers hanging in there thanks to some efficient offense reverse it out to Michael Christmas nothing inside as SMU smus gone back to their mantoman defense on the last couple of possessions rotation for three to give Longwood the lead for DJ Jefferson well that youngster from Richardson Texas just north of Dallas here near the M campus hes a transfer from T Tennessee hes a good one firing right back Matt cross who has been money from outside lately he was three for three against Boston College oh what a great game weve got going here John this is impressive both teams playing so well shooting the ball well handling the ball well pull up jumper by Tucker way over the top rebound on the ground Tracked Down by buy Miller blink and you will miss it this SMU offense getting up the field Miller has the iso against Luke beats him with speed well how about that that was speed against speed rouy Miller against Luke for the Lancers what a matchup incredible start Luke at the point guard spot right now and Garland who already has four assists shadowed by Chuck Harris nice step out kick out Christmas extra pass to Luke sees some space and hes fouled by Colbert too on the close out two free throws the first two of the game as Colbert picks up his first foul another example of that speed and quickness I keep talking about with Ty Luke right there using that left hand for the quick kiss off the glass Colbert just a little slow getting over on helps side defense for SMU look like CYO Luke had an open three but hes only been shooting 19 from there so decides to get to the line where hes 76 and again Longwood as a team 25 of their points come from the foul line thats top 10 in the nation according to kenpom Matt cross out Yan trayor such great starts back in well Luke has advertised a great leader for this Lancers ball club play that Holy Cross before coming into this Longwood program fun to watch started at Holy Cross and then on to St Bonaventure was the starting point guard his first year at St Bonaventure before Micah Adams Woods came in and took his job wanted to play his fifth year somewhere else and hes paid dividends at Longwood treor hes been on fire early no good here rebound knocked around and Jefferson out of Richardson comes down with it ahead to luk good block out by Jefferson that time getting the fast break started for the Lancers Jeffersons backhanded rebound blocked Away by Colbert and then aggressive defense by kyell Luke the 15 foul on Longwood well Co known for blocking shots the transfer from K State coming across the floor there getting the good SWAT for the Mustangs 15th block of the Year leads the Mustangs in that respect as Miller takes a seat seven early points for poopy Miller including an early three both teams shooting over 50 early on a combined six of seven from the threepoint line between the two teams heres k a quendo has the advantage and he is fouled Jefferson says thats mine and a quendo bouncing to the rack goes to the line for two well nice job by o quendo reading this Lancer defense right there he saw the navy blue shirt split he said I think Ill take it quickly on the drive to the rack putting the Mustangs back at the free throw line smus five out of six so far from the charity strike a quendo one of those bench scorers for SMU the Mustangs averaging almost 34 point point a game off the bench top 20 in the nation in okendo with 103 points a contest off the P this Longwood team also do does very well with the use of their bench theyre averaging about 30 points per game with their reserves so a lot of depth on the floor for both teams today fantastic matchup lancers team that was playing really well heading into the break winning five of six but especially their last two victories over NC Central and Campbell as well SMU winners of six in a Music row Camy backing in yigu Up and Under comes up short and SMU has numbers with zmy down hes getting back into the play Edwards dis latched by Jefferson he comes up with a pick two on two Jefferson leans in and hits it oh nice discipline there about Jefferson did not try to force anything let the defense Slide by up and over got a nice roll off the orange Rim Jefferson a really talented player fourstar Prospect in the class of 2022 like you said coach started his career at Tennessee quendo knocks down a triple behind the screen ker Endo his 21st three of the year yeah hes done a great job since transferring to SMU from Oregon where he was a standout last year and SMU is needing this hot start from the field to hold off Longwood heres Christmas going left against against trayor tried to fire it out but agendo comes up with the anticipatory seal banging his way to the bucket now about that the young man aqu quendo getting rewarded for the great defensive play on the offside for the Mustangs taking it 94 ft for the easy bucket boy quendo is coming in and making a big difference quickly for the Mustangs L getting it back in the corner around the screen fires it out for a base line drive by Christmas and on his reverse pivot its off the mark foul is called against CET igu who also got into foul trouble against BC s points thank you so much Bri and Christmas in this five for six stretch of winning for Longwood hes averaged 15 points a contest and you mentioned that great start with seven early ones here Garland with the speed to the cut misses his first shot cross brings down the rebound for SMU their leading rebounder this season awendo knocked off his pins he was looking for a foul call but instead to travel in turnover number five on SMU well that last possession for Longwood Colby Garland made a great move great drive to the bucket just did not get the easy finish probably rush rush the release a little bit were talking about Michael Christmas and his offensive efficiency but I read a publication that picked him is the defensive player of the year in the Big South Conference so this young man can literally do it all always great to have those guys that have played 131 games in their career on your rosters as the hook shot doesnt go for zmi and ASU is five better on the boards than Longwood at this point heres BJ Edwards and taking it to the glass hes blocked out of bounds by zmy well both ball up so impressive taking the ball hard on the drive to the basket here this afternoon both teams Ultra aggressive Music treor game clot didnt stop so working on adjusting it there SMU had great execution on their last out of bounds play under their own bucket where trayor scored someu the largest lead at seven and looking for more Harris for three trayor the offensive rebounded footb Yan trayor is dominating 13 now hes dominating cuz hes playing very very smart when that ball went up he moved quickly to get position for the putb hes got seven rebounds too and thats SMU ball great job by Harris to chase it down and knock it off of Cairo Luke right in front of the SMU bench oh SMU with the possession again what a start offensively 12 out of 19 field goal attempts partner thats pretty darn good coming back from a Christmas break havent seen that very often over the years and remember they were coming off of that win over Boston College where they shot over 60 for the game as well yeah good look at coach Andy infield there they scored 103 points up in Boston what a way to go home for Christmas only the fourth time or 10th time on the road all time that snu scored over a 100 good cut by poopy Miller with his quickness and hanging in the air he gets Emanuel Richards to foul him well I love the way bopy Miller moved without the basketball that time so many scouting reports emphasized with his hand on the ball making plays off of screens that time with the quick back door cut to the bucket 70 run over the last 213 the first big run of the Game Belongs to SMU and as they say its a game of runs coach well its a game of run and its also a game of size and SMU size is starting to dominate now only have 6 minutes to go in this first half of action Ive been very very impressed with Longwood but you do not match up with 72 and 61s on the interior when youre 66 and 68 tough assignment for the Lancers again Longwood the ninth smallest team in the nation according to Ken pom an SMU in the top 40 as far as average height goes one for two DP for poy Miller and SMU that ball is off the foot of Luke good job by trayor to realize that and let it go out of bounds all of a sudden Longwood turning it over with a little bit more regularity their fourth giveaway also you can see smus defense continues to improve and adjust to this quickness that Longwood brings to the floor second turnover by Luke he had not turned it over in the last two games they tried to front Trey or it didnt work hes going to the foul line for two yeah how about that pass by Matt cross popped up to the head of the circle and got that high post to low post pass this is a nice job by SMU good Vision by cross getting it inside to trayor who has been the dominant Mustang so far this afternoon and lets go to Bree senson coach Enfield said if theres one thing about Johan trayor is that his work ethic is unmatched every single time you walk past the practice facility you will see him in a shooting he said his work ethic alone allows him to feel confident that hell continue to improve and get better game by game hell be someone that the team can rely on and we can see that potential here hitting from the corner what an afternoon for trayor hes up to 15 points and seven rebounds already and trayor right now playing the five spot for SMU with a Yugo in a little bit of fou trouble and cobbert also getting an early foul as well and you can afford to play a little bit smaller against this Longwood team thats amazing SMU has prented long wood from getting many threepoint shot attempts John this Longwood team averages 20 threo attempts per game here this afternoon SMU has held them to only three shots from threepoint land yeah they obviously the focus of the SMU defense coming into the contest Music Elijah Tucker going to the line a real special athlete again another one of these Lancer teams that or lancer players that get to the line a lot and I asked Griff aldrid if that is one of his Specialties as a coach making sure his team gets the line or if it just happens to be how things are playing out this season for his team and he said just got a team thats really physical and tough and this year theyre really aggressive at getting to the hole Yeah we can see every player for long wood so far has had opportunities to drive and when they do they take advantage of it very tough going to the rack Tucker has eight for Longwood Longwood doesnt have a field goal in the last three minutes Caro Endo down to the Baseline stays on the dribble tend to shoot Miller back to Endo in Rhythm for three over the top good board on the Baseline by Christmas to start the break for long witht Luke sets it up to the corner Garland blows by Kicks it out to Richards and he hits the twine what a perfect possession by long wood that time draw the defense to the Baseline kick it back out and knock down the three offensive foul on Chuck Harris and nice job that time by Garland cutting off that Baseline Drive by Chucky Harris two quick terrific plays by Longwood to pull back into this ball game look at this cut the Baseline off Harris trying aggressively to drive to the rack couple of them set up by Garland he had the assist to em Manel Richards and then takes the charge as well so along with making a push after being down by as many as 12 a good on ball defense by Matt cross but poopy Miller comes away with a steal crossover in the open floor couldnt lay it in no basket a late foul call and Miller goes to the line well SMU once again doing a nice job on offside defense jumping into that passing Lane Miller taking it the length to the floor he will go back to the strike Kobe Garland whistled for his first foul 19 foul on Longwood and Kevin bopy Miller the transfer from Wake Forest within the ACC its averaging almost six assists per game third best in the conference in assists per game right now so even when hes not scoring efficiently he is just controlling the game well hes using his quickness just like Luke is for Longwood this is a matchup of two terrific point guards but boy Miller as you said John making things happen in different ways for the Mustang success so far Miller becomes the second Mustang in double figures with 10 SMU as a team is 12 of 14 at the foul line and got a ninepoint lead well I continue to be amazed smus only tried seven threepointers long wood only only three miscommunication between Garland and Richards the first turnover for Garland Lancers down by nine hanging in there constantly preach that in order to go from good to great its all about those small details but Jim what details does longw need to execute better to jump back into this lead well theres a big 611 guy that they need to figure out right quick named Johan tror hes got 15 in the Mustangs FY Longwood has got to do a better job of controlling him and then I would say execute their transition defense a little bit better SMU continues to get shots and gets to the foul line because of their transition game ASU out scoring Longwood 8 to2 in transition in this first half under four minutes to play in the first half its a back and forth game 13 lead changes and three ties but right now SMU in front by nine good job to ISO Elijah Tucker and he goes to work on cobbert Elijah Tucker is in double figures yeah first double figure score for the Lancers Elijah Tucker SMU has two in double figures Trey or and bopy Miller the fifth double figure game this season and Luke takes it away strifing it from cobbert On The Run Christmas spotting up for three a little strong offensive rebound by Richards swings it inside Tucker triying to stuff it Richards the offensive board doesnt roll down but he heads to the line well theres that aggressive nature of Longwood paying dividend right there two offensive rebounds in a row against the much bigger Music Mustangs a great move inside you got to love the efforts a good defensive block by SMU coming across the Music paint that was Colbert of course the leading shot blocker for the Mustangs coming over for the Music SWAT so Tucker to the line and Nas the first one a physical guard out of hermo South Carolina as you see smus trayor a quo Yu coming in SMU will play more of their traditional two forward alignment now but Richards a real versatile Defender part of the big Southall freshman team last Music year had a nice game against Houston in the first round of the NCAA tournament last season it knocks down both boul shots its a fivepoint game long would continues to hang around only six free throws for Longwood 14 free throws for SMU big difference in this game so far Au quendo nearly had it taken away Edwards on the wing double team cross fakes a pass makes a drive Scoops it up and a good touch by Matt cross and one of the foul call too oh he got the favorable roll off the grass great job of driving to the rack by cross Darins been on fire yeah dumping it off to Emanuel Richards and Richards lets the skies clear for two good Patience by Richards on that drive didnt try to force the finish too quickly let the SMU defense Blow by he lays it up heads up play Gs already got six assists treor stepping to the hole thats swatted by Christmas and then trayor makes the grab but out of bounds great stop by Michael Christmas Longwood very effective after that L last timeout by coach Aldridge adjusting their defense all of a sudden back to a fivepoint ball game what was the biggest lead John I Believe by 12 yes Longwood coming in with a net of 178 two of the last three years theyve been the rep out of the Big South to go to the NCAA tournament Garland on the pouette fadea away and the emotional leader the transfer from Drake gets long withed within three yeah L second leading score for the the Lancers nice reverse move there for the bucket in the paint cross left alone for three rolls around and out Christmas tips the rebound down to Luke and Longwood can tie on a Applause triple Garland 86 assists pocket pass inside to Tucker and hes fouled its on yigu or no instead its on boy Miller on the region it would have been the Third on yigu instead watch the region by Miller yeah thats nice execution by Longwood right there off the pick and roll near the Baseline tough to adjust tough to defend this young man Elijah Tucker 68 237 Pounder from Canton Georgia when he goes Full Throttle rff aldri says when he kicks it into sixth gear he is a special athlete can really impact the game well he talked repeatedly about Tucker being such an elite athlete and that become a vocal leader for this team hes certainly leading with his aggressiveness so far this afternoon hes shown his Dynamic nature around the rim but misses on the two foul shots SMU retains that threepoint lead about 80 seconds left first half Miller to the cup more foul shots on the way as he turned the corner and ran into the body of Jaylen Bernard Bo were seeing a great battle of point guards here this afternoon bopy Miller for SMU and Ty Luke doing the same thing for the Lancers of Longwood both both players aggressively going to the bucket poopy Miller a special score coming out of Wake Forest and had three 20 plus point games in each of the first three games this season for SMU and while his scoring has receeded a little bit his playmaking has not SMU now 12 of 15 Dean at the free throw line Longwood six of eight mcer back in for Bernard SMU still shooting a phenomenal 13 of 22 from the floor and how about Longwood 15 of 30 both teams hitting 50 or better Miller has 11 and then double figures all that two games in an SMU uniform Miller the pick from behind on zmi but Miller has it stolen right back by Kobe Garland for a quick Hands by both teams Christmas up the floor a minute left lets the skys clearest blocked initially by Edwards but grabs his own Miss to backand the lay how about that quick reaction by Christmas right there to get that put back in what a play by Michael Christmas and forcing to use it or lose it timeout by Andy Enfield with his team clinging to a twopoint lead late in the first half Music Music Michael Chrismas on the verge of double figures again with nine first half points well hes also been so instrumental defensively all all parts of the game but right there how about that toughness miss the shot go right back up challenge the SMU defense good play by Michael Christmas 66 athlete that just play so hard had a tough Offensive start to the season but he really turned it on of late and hes shooting 50 in this one four of eight he knocked down a three game clock to shot clock difference about 24 here late in the first half John Little Jim Hower gree senson and our whole ACC Network crew SMU spreads the floor Edwards dribbles it off of his foot but it falls right to Miller here goes a quendo no call a quendo lays it off the rim and no and on the rebound its knocked out by Kio o quendo give it back to Longwood with a chance to tire the lead well Michael Christmas once again making the nice defensive play on the blockout right there o quendo fortunate didnt get a foul on the back that time and the infield of course concerned after seeing his ball Club build the impressive 12point lead but now down to only two with 33 ticks left on the first half clock Miller out Harris in for some more size defensively two second difference game clock to shot clock as we play late in the first half and the Lancers we three and0 in true Row games this season looking for an enormous upset here in Music Dallas Garland comes to get it again against Edwards crosses over low deep to its smooth Colby Garland makes it what a tie game with 5 seconds left in the half now heres Harris trying to give SMU the lead back and he does rolling it down with a buzzer Peter at the end of the first half SMU going in front thanks to the floater that rolled down at the buzzer by Chuck Harris Lets go to ree senson she talked to Griff alich the head coach of Longwood yeah coach aldrid said they just need to have better intensity he said he saw that spark in the beginning that they needed but then he said we cant play down if the other team starts playing differently and when they start switching things up if one thing is consistent he said he wants it to be their intensity in second half thank you so much Bri and how about bopy Miller he had only hit two of his last 19 from three hes two for two in this game Tucker yeah they had to play off of boy Miller because hes been hurting him with the drive that time just pulled up at the head of the circle on the Mustangs last possession Miller locked in with 14 points Yu has a Ricochet back to him Edwards the extra pass cross Corner three yes well you learned to depend on Matt cross quickly and muu starts the second half beautifully score they have 86 points a game five players averaging double figures and then Matt cross right on the verge Co taler this is a balanced team who do you stop well it is a balanced team but I can tell you something right now yulu is averaging 10 points per game he is not scratched here this afternoon against Longwood SMU needs to get his 72 body in action on the offensive end kby Garland has an edch hes scratching it with a dozen in this game his eighth double figure game this season to go along with six assists and Longwood scores for the first time in the second half to get back within six heres Matt cross aggressive start to the second half right to the r what an intelligent player Matt cross is drills one from the left corner for the three ball then he sees the crack in the defense and drives it all the way terrific play by Matt cross the current ACC player of the week after his great game at Boston College a two run for SMU to start the second half SMU had a 100 run in the first half that was their 13th run of 10 or better this season showing how streaking on the positive end this SMU team could be yeah this SMU team does play in Spurs a little bit too much pocket pass right back to Tucker but hes met in midair and heads back to the line more fouls on so U its backto back games where he is struggled with foul trouble yeah this is third foul on him and it was just a great great play that time by Tucker going tough to the bucket 72 in yulu has to exert his height assistant coach Eric Mobley works a lot with the bigs said that was going to be a f avoiding foul trouble coming into this game against a longwood team that forces his opponents into the third most fouls per game in the nation Tuckers missed three straight free throws though yeah yulu is coming out of the ball game now averaging 10 and a 12 points per outing for SMU the only had uh he had no no rebounds and no points in the first half he came into todays game averaged 10 1 12 points and six rebounds per game oddly ineffective game its going to be a lane violation on SMU so Tucker even though he missed get another shot you saw cross way into the charity area trayor was as well Longwood now six of 10 at the free throw line SMU 13 of 16 as coach Andy in field looks on had those 11 great years at Southern Cal before coming to revitalize this SMU program boy did he 220 wins his head coach at USC and after four straight misses basically Tucker gets the second one to go ly Miller so great at controlling the speed for SMU cross is met by the big guard Richards Miller out to trayor Corner three ring it up for Yan trayor hes on fire today how about tror thats his second three ball out of the right hand corner in this contest the Frenchman with 18 his season high was 19 back in the second game of the year you never know who its going to be for SMU Christmas outside Luke catch and shoot comes up short for three onehanded rebound by Tucker spins on culbert cant finish tror the emphatic rebound oh nice move great effort continuing for Tucker for the Lancers last noncom game of the year for SMU same story for Longwood as Edwards gets into the paint for the baby hook yeah thats BJ Edwards first two points of the ball game came at a great great time for the Mustangs putting USU back up by a dozen equaling their biggest lead of the game the average is 10 four and three and 1 half for SMU little banging from Richards sends it inside Tucker grinding Christmas catch and shoot for three three comes up short long rebound and Miller tracks it down with the pouette up high for C water reverse oh my goodness how about that court awareness by poy Miller and the great Hands by Colbert on the Finish terrific transition basketball by SMU hes not just a big dude thats going to force his way with the body hes got touch as well and SMU has their largest lead well talk about hand control whats his pass Now by boofy Miller to cobber Great look by Boy Miller but how about the quick hands the quick reaction by the transfer from Kansas State Jerel Colbert doing it for SMU already the second timeout called by Longwood yeah were only three three minutes here into the second half SMU was only up by two at halftime now theyve outscored Longwood by 12 to start the second half it can happen so fast and Lancers head coach Griff Aldrich wants to stop the bleeding now before this game gets away from his team theyve done a great job of scoring in bunches today shooting 47 from the floor but in the second half just one of five well the story for SMU say so far Johan treor who came into this game averaging 18 points per game how about this 17 minutes to go in the ball game he already has 18 wow exceeding his point per game average by 10 like you said we got 17 minutes to go downhill Garland sets up Christmas shows and goes leaves it for Richards now in the paint heres zamy zamy punishing inside against cobbert and one and a big bucket that Longwood really needed from Johan zmi well he just did a great job here with body control look at this streak going look at the strength he shows going over cobbert at 610 he just powered that ball up and took it through to the bucket second foul on Colbert zmi scoring for the first time in this game he had 13 against Campbell and a season High 14 against Milwaukee but he is just so strong and its amazing how well he finishes around the rim at just 66 and he averages 84 rebounds per game so hes been a big part of this Longwood team coming into todays contest and one and the officials going to stop it here Kip Kissinger see some perspiration on the floor after the well Andy Enfield didnt think it was in inverted contact well thats good officiating weve got a great crew working here today Kip Kissinger Brook Wells Ben stur Kip Kissinger of course has worked several final fours in recent years great officials here in the ACC Christmas out and Jefferson the Richardson native from just about 15 20 minutes up 75 is in for Longwood yeah Jefferson did a great job coming into this contest early in the first period sure did goopy Miller out front against the bigger Garland t p gets through to Edwards 14 to shoot big screen by cobbert but its offensive and its is third thats the two fives for SMU who have both picked up three fouls you cobber yeah not only a foul but that goes as another turnover against SMU they had 10 turnovers in the first half and that was way too many in a game this tight but doing better this half but certainly that was a moving screen by Colbert right there nice job on the call by Brook Wells Longwood with 14 points off the previous 10 turnovers first appearance for Keon Ambrose Hilton who has been playing more of the four spot this season for SMU look like hes at the five which he played a lot of last year another and one chance for Longwood kby Garland hits the fade away plus the little bump and Garland goes to the line to try to complete it well Garlands played a terrific ball game so far we talked about him in the feature today second leading score leading assist man for this Longwood team how about that reverse move right there to use that left hand over the SMU defense they caught Yan trayor on the elbow its the second foul on trayor Garland up to 15 points it was a 14point lead for SMU moments ago but backto back threepoint plays its down to Music eight and cross with the turnover giveway number 12 on SMU the second for cross you know so many times we talk about the exploits of great offense how about that defense right there by DJ Jefferson slap his feet to force that turnover on Cross very good on ball defense a tough matchup this Lancer coaching staff including Griff Aldridge really pulling all the right strings to keep Longwood in it on the Baseline quick spin cm revers is pass treor great move well thats two times in a row now that trayor has gotten burned defensively great move by Longwood its an 80 Longwood Run sixpoint game Edwards in traffic sets up Ambrose Hilton out of the corner 43 extreme music boy when your numbers call be ready Ambrose Hilton he answered that perfectly coming in and doing the job quickly for SMU zami adjusting at the hole hes got seven of the last 10 for Longwood well both ball clubs just continuing to play so well trayor knocked away from him got it back and hes got a season High 20 how about that good hands good recognition of the Longwood defense let him go by and put it back up easily efficient and effective for Yan treor 20 points seven of nine from the field two of three from deep four of four from the free throw line in his best game is a Mustang John little alongside Jim Howard and others and its knocked Away by Edwards flying to the r how about BJ Edwards up tight in that passing Lane coach aldrid looks like wanting to take another timeout but no hes going to make make a substitution here both ball clubs capitalizing on weak passing occasionally now SMU how about this back to his own defense we saw it a couple of minutes in the first half I love changing defenses its work up this year just the length that SMU is able to bring Richards was not ready to shoot he is this time and rolls it down Emanuel Richards has n well long wood so effective getting that ball into the middle every time SMU goes to Z Zone long wood has adjusted perfectly SM SMU firing from outside cross right back at him scampers after the rebound keeps it alive for Edwards Miller to run the show for the Mustang bo be Miller Big crossover pull up from the elbow oh its beautiful yeah beautiful is the perfect word for that Richards had good defense on him but boy Miller thats almost impossible to stop the Quick Stop on a dime and using his vertical jump just over the defense some guys play at five different speeds he plays at about 12 a good description John little that was speed five and a half short on the three by Jefferson Miller skies for the rebound SMU leading in the rebound count today by five Ambrose Hilton whips the pass down to cross its kicked out by cross taking us to a timeout it has been a show in Dallas WI as they elongated their lead out to 11 and look at that second half shooting coach Hower well Ive never seen anything like it really because this Longwood team is playing tough tough defense but for SMU to start 10 out of 11 on field goal attempts and an even more impressive four or five from threepoint land thats how you build that lead back up Mustangs ahead by 11 after it was a twopoint game at the half and six assists in the second half after only seven in the first half Andy anfield wanted to share the ball better they have done that and SMU back to an 11point lead but every time SMU is elongated the lead Longwood has come back can they do it again Kobe Garland 15 points to lead his team into the lane throws it up way short of quendo there for the board well that was a great defense by SMU once again on ball defense so important in a game like this DJ Edwards just makes winning plays and he was on the defense there Edwards with five assists pounds it out high tror high post instead its Edwards with 10 to shoot long possession for snu Chuck Carris Baseline Drive hanging banging cant hit and Luke comes out with a rebound Christmas goes down behind the play heres Richards relocating Garland X for pass Luke short Corner money nice job by Luke using that good quick First Step just his second basket of the ball game but it was a big one for the Lancers pulling them back within single digits and SMU shooting great but the Lancers are six of their last eight from the field again to hang around down by nine here in Dallas final nonconference game before between for these two teams SMU has already started 2 and0 in the ACC they get back to it next week against Duke a takeaway by Longwood kobby Garland skipping to the hoop no good but Elijah Tucker there to poke it back in thats just one two by Tucker right there use those long arms to go up over the bigger Defenders of SMU Longwood has nine second chance points SMU only has eight kick ball out of bounds taking his two a timeout so long with firing back out scored them in the paint 523 here today theyre just ahead of Longwood 30 to 28 in the paint trying to get on the board for the first time been fouled from behind by Tucker yeah and SMU needs to do that more I was just emphasizing the point that SMU only has a twopoint advantage in points in the paint yet theyre so much bigger than this Longwood ball Club but nice job there getting the ball to yulu quickly a big part of the reason that SMU has struggled in the paints at at least stopping Longwood is the foul trouble by eatu and Colbert and give Tucker and zmy a huge credit for that the first point of the ball game for yulu hes averaging 10 a half per game coming into todays contest he went scoreless against Boston College played only seven minutes got in foul trouble there of course Trey or has made up for his lack of scoring inside Trey or the leading score in the game with 20 points Ill say hiu grabs his own Miss and then hes fouled on the floor by kyrell Luke the second on Luke as SMU comes out with a no board well nice heads up play by Gulu he just reached over the much smarter smaller Luke that time Luke I am your father 72 versus 51 that was no contest there KJ McClurg back in for Longwood hand off to bopy Miller out front SMU an eightpoint lead Harris lost the three rebound kept Alive by cross but kobby Garland retrieves it for Longwood hes got 15 try to lead a comeback now the spin move on Miller outside to Christmas the three well short but mcer tracks down the rebound gets it back into Tucker and no foul its just knocked out of bounds and SMU ball SMU with four turnovers this half first one of the second half is going to go here against Longwood but I guess thats not going to be that was a missed shot and SMU feels like clinging to an eightpoint lead at home against Longwood out of the pig South offensive foul on Miller nice play by Colby Garland the sophomore to get the fourth year player Miller into some foul trouble well kobby Garland continuing to play great here this afternoon look at that play just jumping up bopy Millers been coming relieving ball pressure by going over the top and he just jumped into that moving Lane of Miller great play by BBY Garland second leading score leading the sth man transfer from Drake Drake having a great game here today Garland one of the new faces on the perimeter for Longwood and theyre finally clicking now Christmas 43 comes up way short offensive rebound as Tucker goes over everybody but leaves it short and yigu is fouled did you see that vertical jump by Tucker that time Im telling you that young man went really really high lets watch this offensive re rebound well this is just showing the foul on igulu quick hands of Emanuel Richards trying to get another steal but great effort continuing for both Bowl clubs here theres Tucker hes had just a terrific game 13 points five Music rebounds doing that in just 17 minutes of work yeah hes doing it against 72 61 hes 68 he combined the production of Tucker and zami the two centers theyve got 20 points between them EO doubled Harris know somebodys Open Over the Top cross couldnt pull it up cross inside to Miller lost it got it back finds the bucket for two what a calm reaction by Boy Miller actually let the ball just go right through his hands but got the quick retrieval stay calm hit nothing but neet poopys got 18 in backto back game the averages nearly 15 flying to the r Tucker short but eatu is up in the air again and whistled for his fourth foul well I tell you all young players can learn a lot watching this young Longwood team they are great on pick and roll basketball they set perfect picks they know how to hold their position they roll strong and aggressive to the basket they are well well coached in that phase of the game two great coaches going against each other here today and the infield for SMU and Coach Aldrich for Longwood obviously Tucker going to the line but I love the game of Colby Garland today talk about 15 points hes got nine assists coach and the way that he delivers those pocket passes on the pick and rolls I mean just absolute Beauty well hes been very effective defensively also just a great great player Elijah Tucker stepping up to the line and knocking down the free throw he has equaled his season high with 14 as DJ Jefferson comes back Music Applause in dror off on the second one trayor pulls down the board SMU still leading by nine their final tuneup before the rest of it his conference play and cross gets held up by Kobe Garland Kobe Garland Garland and now theres a technical foul Carl D Garland lets look at the replay first well I tell you Matt cross just did a great job of recognizing the defense and taking it tough putting SMU back at the charity stripe couldnt see what Colby Garland said but thats very unusual for this highly disciplined Longwood ball club for that to happen I think he just kept trying to prove his point looking for a jump ball and the officials had just had enough of it so for Garland its a personal foul and then after that the technical as well thats three personals on Kobe Garland well a tough situation for Longwood after playing so well now the test is holding their composure bofy Miller getting the job done once again for SMU for bofy Miller that is his fourth 20 plus point game in an SMU uniform he had 20 plus in each of his first three you see Griff Aldrich talking with Colby Garland about the situation and as SMU grows the lead with Matt cross at the line lets hear more about The Talented Mr Cross from Bree senson yeah its some yous assistant coach coach Moy said that Matt cross is just starting to get into his Groove after last game against Boston College where he scored a season High 20 points he said hes really building chemistry with his team now with more games under his belt that hes just going to get better and better each and every game he said that the team has a real high expectation for him and hes starting to fill those expectations agendo over the top trayor has a double double cross thought about the three agendo backs his way in and another foul this time on Luke reaching in no shot and rather than Luke they will give it to a Manuel Richards his third yeah nice spin move by quendo turning away from the Longwood Defenders there nice job of reading the defense probably took that threepoint shot a little bit quicker than the SMU coaching staff would have liked with a 13point Advantage with nine minutes to go in the game but came back and night made the nice move to draw the foul Quick Clip inside Harris goes up and scores look like it was going to be an and one I believe so count the basket no its going to be on the floor instead on Angelo Brizzy so it happened before the shot and it puts Harris at the line for a one and one no basket well SMU continuing to do a really nice job on their execution of out of bounds plays under their own basket seven team foul on Longwood both teams will shoot free throws the rest of the way so this is a one and one Chuck Harris 86 at the line this season but spins out a rare Miss Longwood down by 13 do they have a final spurt Luke in the land of the trees pass trayor couldnt hit but zami attacks the offensive glass sticks it out for a captain shoot three by Bizzy no zi nearly had it kept it alive to luk no again but its going to stay here with Longwood tireless work on the offensive Glass by the Lancers well youve got to appreciate the great effort long wood has on the offensive glass we heard the SMU Scouting Report have to keep the Longwood Lancers off the offensive glass you can see why thats a point of emphasis they crash the glass hard Longwood shooting percentage dipping down to 46 SMU still shooting 64 from the floor darland comes back to get it hes sitting on nine assists pocket pass back to zmi blocked Away by cross and here comes bopy Miller out to okendo watch out comes up short Christmas stands in for the rebound and now were going back the other way with Richards hanging offensive rebound zmi comes up short look at the contact all the way into the Longwood bench to keep it with the Lancers boy both ball clubs continuing to play so hard here boy Miller made another great pass and transition for SMU probably got robbed of an assist he should have had both teams running the floor so well how about that block by Matt cross getting this all this flare of activity started coming across the paint but can see the great effort continuing for both teams on the offensive glass for both teams what a great tuneup before conference play as Garin misses strong tror adds to his season high in rebounds Miller underneath cross has the mismatch and takes it past Christmas for two well congratulations to treor on the double double here today with 20 points and 11 rebounds 22 points and 11 rebounds continuing his great play Garland gives it up side step three by Richards over the top and last touched by Christmas SMU has their largest lead 786 defensively theyve been much better in the second half fact Longwood has missed their last 12 shots and no field goals in the last 4 minutes for the Lancers while SMU has gone on a run to go up 7863 with brie senson and Coach Jim Hower on John little at Moody Coliseum in Dallas Duke is the next team that plays here in Dallas as SMU reopens ACC play Ry Miller twoman game instead throws it outside the cross backs his way into Christmas cross the up bake and earns shots Matt cross the fifth year player against the sixth year player two guys with a lot of experience going against each other there well I tell you Matt cross is a great example of a very very disciplined well trained basketball player he does so many things well at 67 good outside shooter puts the ball on the floor well good rebounder tough on the defensive end really really admire his game hes just outstanding of course Ive said it twice hes the current ACC player of the week because of that great game he had at Boston College 20 against Boston College 19 today and SMU is on the verge of having three different players score 20 or more in this game going to put Herman Hudson to work to see when the last time that happened right Christmas extra pass kyell Luke loads up rebound poked around and yo gets it right down to Miller ly Miller looking for some points in transition lobs it out to cross 7 minutes left SMU enjoying their largest lead after a back and forth start just a twopoint lead at the break crosscourt feed Harris wide open and he Rings it up well you got to admire Chucky Harris started every game but one last year for SMU here he is coming off the bench this season and still contributing in a big big way youve got to love his attitude and powering an 110 run over the last 3 minutes for SMU Longwood really feeling the pressure now down by 20 Tucker keeps the pivot foot off the ground and feeds it through yigu for two oh I love Tuckers aggressiveness his strength the way he plays just such terrific determination really it was his efficient first half that kept Longwood in it for so Music long crosscourt pass is knocked out of bounds by Christmas 11 to shoot SMU had yiga Tulu that time being guarded by goldby Garland at 62 SMU has got to find a way to get those mismatches identify him quickly and get the ball inside again if youre joining us late SMU one of the tallest average teams in the nation and Longwood one of the smallest yolu a few inchide Advantage tries a hook pass and its stolen away by CYO L Luke up the middle of the floor skipping to the cup with his speed knocked out cross the rebound for SMU finds bopy Miller transition to the bucket for two and the foul for boopy Miller who goes down hard underneath the basket standard another great example of smus excellence in transition Matt cross getting it out quickly bofy Miller taking it hard thats dangerous the lower body getting cut out Music absolutely and the officials are going to take a look at this count the basket for Miller to give him 20 two points and well get a couple looks here on this foul previous play is on review originally whistled against Jaylen Bernard and the question is coach is this flagrant contact on Longwood well were going to have a chance that uh the officials are looking at right here I dont think so I I think that was just a late getting back in transition defense and yeah I dont think that was done until intentionally young player trying to cut in a little bit late Jaylen Bernard out of Houston S Ranch High School wow that was a no doubt about it it was a tough hit but I do not think it was a premeditated or done on purpose we got one of the looks where you could see really Bernards eyes and how he was really hes looking at after review the foul has been upgraded to a flagrant one foul oh theyre upgrading it they just said upgraded flagrant one so officials certainly continuing to try to protect the players here in this very very aggressive ball game it may not have been one of those where it was the intent it wasnt intent as much as it was this is just kind of a dangerous play well thats why we have the rules in place that we have and boy Miller now going to the line for SMU looking for points number 23 and 24 for you know as much as Ive talked about the tough Longwood defense here today how about the SMU offense now 86 points thats what theyre averaging on the year leading the ACC in scoring and this is just a good example as Andy infield looks on there of the the explosiveness of this SMU attack they can just hurt you in so many ways listen to this John SMU leading the ACC and scoring their first and assist first in offensive rebounding first in rebounding margin and first in points off the bench that says a lot about what this team is doing this isnt just another conference either and its a its a huge conference with 18 teams and remember SMU has picked 13th out of the 18 teams yet Andy anfield has brought in this heavy transfer class and held over three guys and put together an outstanding ball Club they are dangerous well Im really impressed not only SMU but this Longwood team they fought their hearts out here today against a much bigger and stronger physically SMU team and Harris from outside dont forget about last years second leading score Chuck Harris well there continues exactly what I just said leading the ACC in points Off the Bench when you have players like Ambrose Hilton and Chucky Harris coming off that is very impressive M cler unselfish pass little too unselfish and Edwards coming away with the steal but runs it to Kobe Garland Kobe Garland and going to give it back 20 to shoot John while were waiting him for throw it in I want to acknowledge somebody thats a big supporter of this Long View Longwood program John Feinstein the great author the man that wrote the book season on the break I mean how about that he does the color on their home games lives in Farmville Virginia and players and coaches are talking about him before the game and I dont think we can say enough about his impact if youre a basketball fan youve read a John Feinstein book Im Im reading the the good ones right now called backw roads to March so anyway hope youre watching John cross out of the corner tough one in and out eatu is fou you want to know a little bit more about the Longwood lancers and this is the first ever matchup between SMU and Longwood Longwood University is in Farmville Virginia as you mentioned population of just over 7000 its been around for a long time but a relatively small tightknit University and just got a beautiful campus and Coach Aldrich says when he brings recruits on campus theyre just like blown away at how much nicer and bigger it is than they thought it would be in such a a small Virginia Town well I respect coach Aldrich and this ball Club a great deal today smus played exceptionally well great great shooting day for the Mustangs and Longwood held hung in there a long long time only a twopoint game at the half well you cant argue with the success in the last three years for Longwood aldrid piling up 67 wins and picks out tournament championships in 2022 and 2024 Big South coach of the year in 22 Jefferson hands it off flying finish by Elijah Tucker he adds to his season high with 18 well how about that nice quick move into the paint by Jefferson good drop pass trayor is back in hes had a season High game with 20 off the mark on his three rebound for Garland he has been huge with a 17 point 10 assists double double looking for another assist and hes got it to DJ Jefferson the local kid on the reverse oh a great move by Jefferson mentioned early your transfer from the University of Tennessee Harris rocking the baby out front trayor awendo its about the only guy that hasnt gotten into the act in the second half and agendo is called for the offensive foul here running through Emanuel Richard but the Mustangs able to build on a twopoint halftime lead and surge it out to 21 in a tough game at doubt Music family we got destiny right here shes 2018 school and she is here from she is ready to take your shot at 10000 youre going to get one chance take as much time you up

blue bloods in backto back game I going say how about that to uh make a statement when youre out recruiting son you want to come play Duke in North Carolina and backto back games here you go yes sir and of course SM posting their best recruiting class ever top 10 recruiting class in the nation here we go here we go so its not going to stop this year with SMU what do you think about smus NCAA tournament chances right now theyre 30 in the net and starting to get some looks as far as those final four teams in to the NCAA tournament if the season were to end today which it doesnt well certainly theres so much basketball yet to be played when you play in a league like the ACC youre going to get great consideration if you have a respectable record in conference play but this SMU John does a lot of things very well we keep talking about their size but think about this this this is six out of 13 games now where theyve hit 10 or more threes in a game thats very very impressive that this ball Club can hurt you in a lot of different ways both on the offensive end and the defensive end this longl teams a good example they played well today but here SMU is by up over 20 very versatile they share the ball well you cant just stop one guy theyve got Five Guys averaging double figures and another guy after today that will in Matt cross hell push his average past 10 Chuck Harris has 12 by the way eight in the second half and off the pullup goes down for KYW Luke well Kyle Luke very very impressive I love the way he uses his quickness Ambrose Hilton back in Luke took it away but only for a moment SMU by the way up to 94 points theyve scored 100 plus four times this season and that is the most since they did it six times in the 9293 season so not even the teams going to the NCAA tournament under Larry Brown were scoring like this as BJ Edwards LS a three and comes up short samun now 10 of 20 from threepoint land started this second half making four their first five this team loves to get out and transition a quendo get out of the way the freight trains coming in now see there was one of the points of emphasis for Longwood got to get back quickly and defensive transition didnt do it again there this SMU team as you said they want to get the shot up within 7 Seconds they do it much quicker than that many times Garland comes up short Harris M clerk comes away with a steal pushes it up to Luke ahead of the pack heres Tucker for two yeah Tucker deserves to get those easy kind of baskets ran the floor well but he has been the Bell cow for this team here this afternoon so tough inside another look at it for Tucker hes got 20 points his season High his career high came last season as a sophomore red shirt sophomore at Longwood when he had 22 at High Point so the bouncy forward has had a big game against SMU well he came out of a very physical program at Xavier before he transferred to Longwood so hes a hes been tough for a long long time he still got another year left at Music Longwood 20 points and six rebounds in this one and Tucker is going to sit down smus done a nice job against longwoods leading scorer Michael Chrismas who had scored six uh double figures in every game in the month of December so as did a good job of limiting him so far to just nine yeah he had all nine of those points in the first half didnt score in the second half SMU gets cobbert back in and also tiet gner wearing number five top corner of your screen is in for the first time for SMU another guy thats been a leading scorer on his team in the past and heres AJ George yet another transfer he from Long Beach States leaves it a little short nice job using that left hand by George p trading into the Music paint set shot for three money for Emmanuel Richards he has knocked down two threes in this game hes got 11 points yeah beautiful kick out there by Ty Luke use that quickness to get into the paint got the kick out beautifully correction hes got 12 thats a new season high as Edwards the Skies part for BJ Edwards as he smoothly takes it to the cup now this SMU crowd clamoring for 100 points weve got one minute to find out if theyll do Music it as Longwood will spend a time out to get Trey Hicks into the ball game he hasnt played in three of the last five and also Leo nordberg from Helsinki Finland a backup point guard is in with a minute left Lancers gave it just an awesome effort this afternoon twopoint game at Halftime SMU thanks to their huge shooting second half shooting 65 in the second half including a blistering six of 12 from Beyond The Arc youre going to win it going Music away a lot of positive things to take out of this one for Longwood including their offensive execution against a tough defensive team now this is a tough Arena to play in John theres no doubt about that and I I think Longwood is more than held their own here this afternoon good look at coach Aldridge there very intense and aggressive coach obviously done a great job what was that 67 wins in the last three years thats right y a lot of folks would like to have that giving up a season High 98 points SMU trying to make it 100 Edwards whips it outside George culbert from the basine cut off doubled tough defense even late here and hbert has it roll off of his body and out with 338 to play as his Longwood team continuing to play very very hard thats tough you come back from the Christmas holidays didnt have to come this far to play a game in a very tough Arena to play in Longwood has more than held their own now bright future ahead this year for Longwood they were 11 and3 coming in including 8 and three against division one opponents yeah had a really good win against Alabama Birmingham earlier in the year that I was impressed with absolutely zami hangs and hits yeah UAV has been such a power Conference USA and now in the AAC but the SMU Mustangs after a slow start defensively power their way in the second half to a 90 8 82 win over Longwood it is win number 11 of the season for Andy Enfield and now they turn their attention
