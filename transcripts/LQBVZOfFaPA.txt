now leading Duke and points per game and rebounds and he has become a matchup nightmare his ability to knock down the three ball but I think what makes him a problem is this right here his ability to put the ball down on the floor thats a guy that goes 611 with footwork like a two guard uh he is really difficult to match up with and I dont think many people thought at the beginning of the Season Kyle flipowski would be the guy to lead them in rebounding end points other side look at this Bellarmine offense its a lot of passing its very little dribbling this was Friday against Clemson any Sports organization basketball should watch Bellarmine run offense its a thing of beauty a lot of movement a lot of back doors a lot of passes and when we spoke with John Shire and asked him about this offense he just smiled said what am I doing playing Bellarmine but he knows his team his defense is going to be tested theyre going to get deep into the shot clock they have to be disciplined and theyre going to have to go the full shot and be disciplined with all their communication and weve seen that play out early on Kyle filipowski has knocked down a couple of Threes thats all the Dukes scoring and then for Bellarmine with a onepoint lead here early on in the first five minutes they have flowed offensively and they havent turned over the ball and thats good the key when you speak uh to Scott Davenport this afternoon in shoot around you look at his uh story career he has really one of the best Minds in college basketball we talked about the offensive movement he coached with two legendary guys uh Rick Pitino Denny Krum but right now this Bellarmine offense is really difficult to match up against 18th season at the helm for Scott Davenport John Shire meanwhile with a 31 record so far at the beginning of his tenure and yeah he was so excited Thursday walking into practice because he had the full group Tariq Whitehead who is going to play the next day against Delaware ended up being a win for the Blue Devils as Whitehead comes back from the fracture in his foot and Lively back from the cap issue his second straight stop yeah and he really has the luxury of going nine or ten deep you look at the top recruits that he brought in obviously the number one overall recruiting class but I think the other guys uh the transfers he got in it gives him the luxury really to go with multiple lineups and theyre talented and I think the big thing that he told us this afternoon theyre sharing the ball when they share the ball he thinks they really could be a really good team talk about the depth early on Whitehead came in earlier along with Ryan young theyre out there with Blakes and brandison so going nine deep in the first five minutes for John shires group Erman offense that weve talked about sooner turns it over roach the pick White had the stop as much as we talk about all the new faces to me though Jeremy roach is the most important player on this Duke roster Steele something you cannot do against this Duke team and then one of the best league guards Jeremy roach with a beautiful dime for a dunk Peter sooner matched up with roach shooter the freshman and the leading scorer for belarun a call away that didnt go and a foul on the rebounding action goes against the knights and Coach Davenport said this is what we cannot do against this team theyre just too good in transition off of turnovers uh set up by Jeremy roach with the overplay and I cant say enough about what he means to me one of the best guards in college basketball you said it do you think most important player John Shire said the same thing to us at shoot around today foreign against Delaware Off the Bench Applause stroke it from three thats an excellent offensive possession uh unselfish play that time and Ryan young with the kick back out excellent spacing by Duke and patience fourpoint lead just over six minutes in for the Blue Devils came up to get it he takes the bump and the foul on Whitehead thats a sixth year senior number one in Scotland for Bellarmine boy it was fun chatting with him today what an impressive young man yeah they really uh so much energy and again watching them on film uh they are its been a long time since Ive seen a team run their offense the way that they do ball movement a player movement pinpoint passing the other thing John Shire said watch out their guards they practice a lot of post defense uh the Duke guards did because they will post their guards off of these back door cuts sooner gets a friendly and elongated role on the midrange jump shot Applause Music Applause first step and he Patches at The Rim Jeremy Roach Applause heres Ben Johnson he can shoot it from Deep extra pass sooner the mark and the rebound wrecked Away by Ryan Young lakes also against Delaware on Friday Applause on the region Music how fun was it talking to Scott Davenport as well I mean its like the Jim Valvano approach you might cry you might laugh you might yell also in a conversation with him he is a really uh entertainment and obviously uh one of the best coaches in college again the way that they run their offense its really a thing of beauty comes up short from three yeah the story well told for Bellarmine well get into it as well were going to hear from Justin Betts on the topic but of course ineligible last year and still this year and next year for the NCAA tournament this is just their third year as a D1 program transitioning from D2 uh you know theres a lot of rules I dont agree with with the NCAA and this is obviously one of them and Ill tell you what right now some coaches and programs are probably happy that they do not have to see the likes of a Bellarmine uh come NCAA tournament time for the next two years hopefully that changes but they are no box of chocolates to match up against and their third ACC team already in their first five games down four first eight minutes six foot ten transferred from William and Mary working on Tyrese Proctor and hadnt walked with it and its a turnover on the knights Applause not something we saw and shoot around this afternoon thats excellent post defense by Lively again everybody was working on it including the guards he said look we must hold our ground were not going to double off then because they passed too good youre gonna have to make some individual plays defensively in the post hey you mentioned that a couple of times and Chris Carroll said to the team today during shoot around stay down on face so concerned with that post defense including against guards its a bump on Suitor and picks up the foul well coming up a message to the NCAA straight from the mouth of Justin Betts Auto Owners protects your home earn that opportunity and just the fact that times have changed since the rules in place in 95 and that we think that maybe they should re reconsider that rule um since its been 25 years and no one has exploited it yet so kind of a culmination of things that drove me to write the letter um and it may not have changes the decision right away but our hope is that it does change the decision for people in the future for teams that do win their conference and and should have the chance to play um but yeah I mean it wasnt really about me at all and more stuff about my teammates and the people that come and uh the team in the next two years because Im going to be gone after this year but I think that it could uh serve as a benefit for people playing in the future and Justin betz wrote a letter to NCAA leadership trying to get that rule change the transitional rule from D2 to D1 a fouryear process for future teams if theres ever another team in the situation that Bellarmine found itself in last time and when we spoke to coach Davenport about this he was emotional uh again they knew this coming in uh that if they were did have a chance to go they werent eligible uh does it make its right but uh he got emotional talking about the conversation he had to have with those young men in the locker room but knowing obviously all the work that they put in and its a shame that they were not able to participate and I can tell you right now though a lot of teams would not want to see this Bellarmine team in NCAA tournament time finally with a good block John Pete Suiter and Duke runs with Blakes Applause Jalen Blakes is coming on for the Blue Devils the last few games well John Shire told us this is how he wants his team to play sharing the ball excellent spacing and that right there another possession I credit Mitchell not settling for a jumper making an extra pass they had excellent floor spacing and for finish and concentration by Blakes when John told us pregame affectionately is and he said hes really turned around games for us with what he has brought Off the Bench winning plays thats what he said look he impacts the game in ways that land it may not be points his defense uh he really said he is a key want to do this year by seven Midway through the first Tipton cant connect on the Baseline Runner hes had a lot of shot opportunities so far he had 21 in the win at Louisville to start the season for bellarmac foreign Applause another very good performance for him against Delaware swells in a three something to say looking at that Bellarmine bench well thats twice now or Mark Mitchell has made a dribble drives extra pass that have led to wide open jumpers yes Proctor gets credits for the three but thats all set up by Mark Mitchell excellent uh basketball decision Applause said that here these last few possessions the lead is 10 for the Blue Devil Whelan working on Proctor now back out for bets spinning on Mitchell stay down on those fakes and got the block its a NATO run for Duke they want more its into a three comes up short Mitchell to the loose ball extra pass Mitchell from the quarter Mount Bellarmine Applause sugar just does everything it feels like for this Duke team winning plays defensively stayed down on his feet the previous possession and then right here extra pass sharing the ball uh Duke right now their defense solid but then offensively Ive been impressed uh with them all making the extra pass that was an emphasis for John Shire he repeated himself multiple times and shoot around share the ball thats my message to these guys offensively and then defensively in particular gets a team like Bellarmine stay down on the shot fakes and be uh communicating uh any ball screens see the six assists thats on eight made buckets for Duke seven different players score already in this one bellerman four and a half minutes without a made bucket until that from Justin Betts from the outside Applause you set it off the top Bellarmine does not shoot a ton of Threes but they are efficient a lot of different guys who can make a three but it feels like theyve had to rely on that so far the shot from the perimeter yeah and youre right you know people think all right does Bellarmine offense uh their team that shoots a lot of Threes that is not the case they get a lot of their scores off of back door Cuts their threes though when they take them theyre efficient like that last one right there but certainly you have to be aware of all the motion and movement with post entries for lively passing out of a bubble just gorgeous offense again Applause a couple games in a row he has passed out a double change and throw darts as Alec free scores at The Rim hes had a cover of buckets playing through some backend hit pay and thats whats impressed me a lot about Derek live with his passing that last pass that is a very difficult skip pass a lot of guys might have tried to Jack this shot up right here hes got two people on him very unselfish thats a difficult pass he made it look easy and I think the key thing hes a willing passer out of those double teams in the post yeah throughout the high school process with lightning had those couple of early threes and an offensive foul on philipowski drawn by bash Whelan hey Saturdays rivalry week at college football match up a series that date backs to 1950 its Miami trying to get bull eligible against Pitt at seven and four our coverage starts at 8 Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Music Applause Ash Whelan being tended to by the Bellarmine training staff making the brunt of that how about Ryan young last game for Duke he was putting his contacts in like as he was walking back up the floor and he is going to be another guy again coming off the bench for John Shire brings that experience had a funny conversation with John Shire about the conversation he had with Coach Collins at Northwestern and he said look you can say it on here he had four years of bad coaching at North Boston but certainly this is a huge pickup for Duke having his experience in the lineup to go along with these young talented freshmen Dave is 11 for Duke up on eight to go in this first half with the younger flying pressure on Kurt hope Applause free for Hope and the past too strong for Suitor and turnover number three for Bellarmine well Duke is clicking so far in this first half here at home against the knights nine Blue Devil buckets and assists on seven of them its been beautiful offense early on Esther passes right here Mitchell has been impressive dribble drive hit unselfish basketball again Mark Mitchell heads up play and theyre getting quality looks seven assists so far an in the first half and its been awful Great Wall all of them have been willing passers whether its in the post or off of dribble drives John Shire has to be pleased with how his team has started this game off and again with newness for this group second game with the full compliment of the Freshman phenoms with the whole gang able to play and feeling their way through that so looking pretty rhythmic offensively Music Defensive Player of the Year in the AC clock below Tech Proctor out of jab step triggers Music bounces out offensive rebound Young and the stick back right now Duke dominating the glass that time uh Ryan on the offensive glass that was a huge concern for Bellarmine and their staff attemption couldnt muscle it up yeah Scott Davenport said this weekend that Duke might be the best offensive rebounding team hes seen in his life hes afraid of hyperbole hes been around the Wild and certainly their length and then the activity of their guys a roach hits a three thats thats full for Duke this half thats right foul away from the ball goes on Mark Mitchell and thats his first Applause number Music those are the files that John Shire said we cannot have away from the ball you dont want to over commit and he said look its easier said than done but the reality of it is Bellarmine they do not take a lot of Threes so you dont want to get fouls uh out Beyond a threepoint line you want to be in good position but do not foul them when they get into their Cuts those teeth accounted for on the Duke bench Young Applause I mean thats a great defensive possession I wont say great but its a pretty good defensive possession but thats that time well somehow got that three to go and then an offensive foul on Tariq Whitehead sooner takes the charge all right here again Ryan young you dont want to leave your feet but again thats a tough shot he was able to get that goal again theyre going to get the shot clock deep bellarmin thats what they want to do slow the pace of this game down they were able to make that three but if youre Duke I think youll live with that a defensive possession second three defense he told his pregame his first Collegiate start was here two years ago as sooner finishes at the rim on a nice drawn up play and the delivery from Dash Wheeling thats his first start here two years ago remembers looking up across the court ready for balls being tipped and staring right at Coach K welcome to uh college basketball young draws a foul inside Music second foul on Garrett Tipton Applause Youngs get on the first ACC PM with Pac Trey and Taylor they talk football and a lot more from around the conference weekdays four Eastern right here on accn and the ESPN Music young makes whole the Greek Whitehead by the way on the bench with two fouls himself for Duke in this first half Music Applause sooner its not the size advantage on young hes Super Bowl in the mid post freshman bounces out for Wheeling working out of grandison sooner on the crossover boy he is impressive for a rookie but thats the matchup you want to go to if you get switched off sooner in that situation obviously has a speed and quickness advantage over Ryan young again thats excellent offense uh Five Element half thousand pursuiter The Freshman for Carmel Indiana grandison another three eight of them for Duke in the first half thats what he is here for provides that four spacer again cant ask for a better look if youre John Shire ball movement extra pass three Applause now on the face up on Young Applause that bounces for Wheeling great cut great feed Applause back and John Shire will take a timeout this is pretty offense from Bellarmine if you sleep for one second against this team they will make you pay Dukes still up the Sport Clips MVP haircut experience hes talking about Louisville uh somehow bellarmid comes up and uh Scott Davenport said to us today a shoot around Eric Musselman wouldnt know who I was I walked into a closed practice yet bellarmint elicits that kind of response I I tell you right now I mean you watched them play and Ive seen a lot of basketball um Ive yet and I would agree with Eric Musselman Ive yet to see uh somebody run their offense the way they do I mean its almost like hockey your cant keep up with uh who has the ball and all the movement uh really when they get it going its a thing of beauty and certainly a very difficult to match up against Granderson eight first half points for Jacob grandison Music shots cut that got Wheeling free behind roach before the timeout Applause Duke though early on theyve done a nice job containing uh dribble drives and then theyve contested shots Corner jumper doesnt go for Langdon Hatton he hears it from The Crazies Granderson feeling good wanted another and then Lively battles on the boards and lets see Ted Valentine reverses course and gives the ball to Bellarmine well I think defensively John Shire has to be pleased with how his team has communicated again he said thats going to be key post defense and then the communication when they do get beat he said look we know were gonna get beat at times the rotations on the back end have been very good for Duke and theyve negated any open looks really a lot of contested shots for Bellarmine thats shut off by philipowski who again stays grounded defensively inside of three minutes to go until halftime Whelan going to work get it to go over Roach Applause grandison Cross Court for Roach he is so sturdy defensively Applause theres the Passover Johnson on the Baseline Drive slips it for Hope for two beautiful interior passing oh all that time opportunistic in transition now thats not something they didnt they wanted to do with this new team but when they get opportunities uh they are so good passing the ball excellent transition offense that time by Bellamy Applause pig from philipowski and he got found so well go to the line for two dollars on Kurt hope this is something coach Davenport talked about being opportunistic uh in your break right here nice little interior pass uh the help is late thats one of the few times Duke was late on their rotation Bellarmine made them pay thats about as fast as bellarmint will go they play at the seventh slowest Tempo in the country according to kenpai Saturday college football its rivalry weekend pit Miami right here on acc s coverage starts at 8 Eastern on accn and the app OBrien Tim Hasselbeck Kelsey Riggs the entire crew Coral Gables the lebowskis good on both and he has eight here in the first half for the Blue Devils Applause thank you Whelan spinning on grandison for a tough two for bash Whelan hes got a half dozen for Bellarmine thats a tough shot uh live we came over on the outside too he still was able to get that to go up and over off the beautiful spin move playing with a lot of confidence early on this season roach Rises Off the Mark offensive rebound phillipowski and then he lost the handle to Wheeling Applause is it a dozen for Bellarmine inside of 90 seconds to go until halftime and a chance to pull closer Applause Johnson cut off by Roach Music thats comes to get it driving on Proctor off the hesitation and thats no philipowski driving to the cup and hes fouled filipowski and roach do an excellent job with their shot plates again you have to honor it because philipowski has shot the ball well started the game off with two threes but their footwork off of the shot fake really impressive and again thats a guy thats 611 he is going to continue to be a matchup nightmare for opposing teams he can go down low on smaller guys hes got great footwork but speaking with John Shire he said the thing about him that hes been impressed with his commitment to defense he said look he is slit his feet really well on the defensive end something that theyve been working with him on to challenge him and defensively he has been solid for Duke as well too and he said hes got an edge to him as well which you watched Duke early on the first four games of the Season you see that a lot of skill with Kyle filipowski Im not sure too many people at the beginning of the Season would have thought Kyle would be leading Duke in points per game and rebounds but thats what hes doing right now an impressive start for the freshman number seven in our ESPN 100 hes got 10 goes to the bench final minute first half the lead at 14 number eight Duke trying to muscle in on Proctor plus the foul for Pete Suiter you can see why John Shire and staff were working the last two days on post defense he said yesterday thats what they like doing that they will try to post their guards up big boy move right here and Proctor will learn and it has to be better when that first bump they cant let him get two feet into the paint thats what China talked about you must try to contain them and keep them out of the key and some suitors got nine and some quieter games against Louisville against Clemson but did have 24 and their loss to Morehead State earlier this season Proctor initiates kicks for grandison and the rebound bats and Bellarmine can hold for the final shot Applause the first half into its Duke is led by as many as 16 Bellarmine trying to get it to single digits thats Justin bets ahead of the horn his third three of the half and its an eightpoint game at the break you cannot ask for a better end right here thats step back contested Big Time Jumper after buzzer Music in eight minutes for Kyle filipowski whos out there with the other four starters who began the game for a second consecutive game for John Shire now to begin the second half human nearly poked it away from Proctor that Suzanne phillipowski another good shot picked into a Mitchell three from the court second triple for Mark Mitchell and now nine main threes for the Blue Devils philipowski has some of the best footwork again off the shot fake 611 guy dribble Drive kick out to a three shooter walked with it and you just have to respect philipowski so much with the outside shot that weve seen already and then the skill and the footwork to go chop fake kick out well you knew he was talented again one of the top players coming into this year freshman but its how hes scoring again hes doing it within the offense that time making a play for his teammate and on 611 now hes going to be a matchup nightmare for opposing teams he rises and hits 13 for philipowski slow shooting first half just one of six from the floor both got Lively in the air and then Betts nearly lost it oh he can step out and shoot it six foot eight the sophomore from Montgomery Indiana following the southern part of the state allconference all freshman team last year yeah and any mistake again thats a couple times weve seen in this game Applause 50 ball somebody slips they will make you pay anytime sooner Applause that Suitor has played really good both ends of Fort ballerman that time lazy pass just shot the Gap uncontested layup off the turnover Proctor got tangled there with Garrett Tipton and Proctor went hobbling to the corner top three and still bremacing and hunched over there now on the rebounding action goes against fellerman right now Bellarmine eight to seven in favor of points off the turnovers theyre doing a good job creating some offense with their defense that right there he just read the eyes of the passer of the entire time shot the Gap and you cant ask for it better or easier juice that time if you like Pete Suiter has a very bright future its not often that a freshman is starting from day one for this program Idris pick up his third foul Applause dupine nine on the inbound for filipowski roach is fouled by bash Weedman and thats two on wheeling Applause Music hanging into this game yes weve talked about their offense but I think taking care of the ball in that first half only three turnovers and thats something coach Davenport talked about we cannot give do those live ball turnovers Applause the offensive rebound Roach season High 11th three for Duke Applause Oak drives on lively back out for bets shot clock at 10 a pursuiter out Wheeling off Target in the midrange on the head ahead from Proctor I believe this stuff well thats what you want your captain to do Jeremy roach Ill say it again the most important player on this Duke roster in transition unselfish play at that time to Derek Lively 23 minutes into this game has not just his first points his first shot attempt in this game but a counter from Bellarmine the lead a dozen for Duke early on second half why do so many businesses use stampscom they save time Music wiping Duke by 12 theyve got 11 made threes in Kyle philipowski Jeremy roach been involved I think similar to last year when Wendell Moore Jr was their most important player maybe not their most talented I think Jeremy roaches the clear a leader of this team right here in transition uh he brings so much experience you look at the Run he had last year in the NCAA tournament uh so much is uh on his shoulders this year I think the direction of this team his leadership hes shooting the ball really well I think the big number though that four assists getting guys in position its so key to have a floor leader like him out there in particular with this young but talented group John Shire told us to shoot around today Kansas game the Champions classic other guys were nervous he said Jeremy wasnt from the getgo he had that effect on his teammates enchilada Baseline Drive got his own Miss and then he was the last to touch it a lot of contact and John Shire not happy with the no call Applause first three and a half minutes out of halftime government hanging around Music sooners got a lively on shot clocks below 10 back out Tipton shadowed by Proctor hold Pop the Shot pick and of the midrange basically done got Mitchell in the air thats something the coaching staff was talking about any shoot around you must stay down on their ball fakes again Bellarmine not a team that takes out makes a lot of threes discipline in your defensive philosophy dont go for the ball face Applause theyre spinning Applause has a weedland foul Fowler foul on bash Wheeland so just over four minutes into this second half weve got a 10point game at Cameron Music why do so many businesses use stampscom Feels Like A change is coming Music back cuts are concern for John Shire and that was one of the teaching points that shoot around today break it down on film yeah understanding The Scouting Report John Shire Chris carewell they said if they dribble at you theyre trying to set up a back door of that time philipowski understanding what theyre trying to do uh Bellarmine and their offense not biting uh for the overplay there and then getting set up for a back door that is so key for young players and John Schneider said thats the big reason why hes happy to have all these guys back those little teaching points uh that right there excellent job of understanding the Scotland report by philipowski grandison comes in Off the Bench and cans another three thats his third and Jacob grandison has 11 as much as philipowski maybe wanted to bite almost had a Flinch there and then remembered the teaching point and thats why Shire is more impressed than not just with the offense but he said really his Improvement defensively in his commitment to be good defensively thats what he is very pleased with four slips it for Hope and it Rim down battle on the boards Lively wins it Blakes kicks Mitchell Rises and a line drive three doesnt go Music thats the one area with Mitchell getting a little bit more arc on his shot and now he shot the ball well at times I think thats an adjustment in his shooting mechanics and also the trajectory on the ball shot seems to be a little flat at times 1010 drives on Blakes rebound Lively again Music roach pushes floater short Applause six minutes into the second half Dubai 13 picked off by Mitchell Mitchell with a flush Applause Johnson on the drive plus a foul what the time counter much needed for Ben Johnson after the mark Mitchell slam well this right here though excellent defense uh by Mitchell hes so versatile can play multiple positions and then in transition nice little Euro Step and finish with the dunk all set up by great denial um and Johnson will have one shot at the bottom so Mitchell to the bench to wreak Whitehead in for the first time this half a couple of fouls six minutes for him in the first half and Ben Johnson at the strike the redshirt freshman from Lexington Kentucky stamps a threepoint play Applause they continue to hang around in this game uh Bellarmine theyre doing an excellent job not turning the ball over and then theyve been opportunistic whenever theres been an opening in this Duke defense they need to stop offensive foul will get him that you can pencil in Justin Betts for a few of those it feels like every game for Bellarmine defensively and John Shire and assistant coach Chris Carroll must have mentioned that at least 10 times and shoot around look if you drive out of control uh hes going to try to take a charge every time Applause country here to Nick thielen Applause swings it over for sooner rolls him off Applause short from three rebound Proctor and a foul on feeling Duke has dominated the boards as well here in the second half yeah thats a great job of blocking out that time by the Freshman Tyrese Proctor we had a doubledouble on Friday John Shire and staff really just Rave about his potential all the first game didnt have a great game offensively but the thing that popped out he was right there with his teammates cheering on Coach Guys first win and said he is a great teammate and just love the energy that he brings Whitehead thats short from three bets runs it down Johnson skips it sooner cant connect Reebok nearly went in off the deflection and then hope is found and its on Tariq Whitehead its three on him hey weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC now we need your help this winter AC n wants to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pic or take a video and tag it with the hashtag all the devotion and post it to your social you might see it here on acc Network Johnson on a pivot he came up short after he dropped Ryan young does stay with Bellarmine foreign where do you feel most confident in Bellarmine getting its offense from well right now theyre getting some good looks from the threepoint line theyve been able to break uh this Duke defense now they havent turned it over uh their guards continue to need to keep doing what theyre doing and by the end theyre right within Striking Distance only about 12 hope drives Radisson helps back out Johnson keep on short rebound Young Applause Lakes why not he hits The Suitor gave it to him and Jalen Blakes connects with John Tire Raves ball Blake said look he is going to be key for us defensively solid but offensively thats a big three to push this thing to 15 were from New Jersey hes already scored more points early on this season in five games that he did all of last year in a limited role young the rebound off the hope Miss Applause grandison flakes the extra pass for Proctor the rebound down to Johnson and as for a better look a nice extra pass that time by Blakes rocker wide open you cant answer anything better if youre John Shire hes like Kellerman really needs a pluck it here Duke hasnt made that big run yet in this game but that threat always looming stays down with Johnson forces him into a tough one Whitehead two strong rebound sooner hes running the floor Music sooner left alone Applause only five threes made from 36 and theyve had some opportunities on this end right here if youre Duke you dont want to fall in love with the three thanks misses that one but Dukes got 13 of them and go they have two huge wins just this past weekend Baylor and Illinois it somehow it feels like theyre kind of under the radar were not talking about them enough uh for me uh that team obviously you know theyre going to defend and they have one of the Premier floor leaders out there Tony Bennett again would not be surprised to see them go on another long NCAA tournament run 10th in the country and the pole that comes out today North Carolina stays in one they had a win yesterday against James Madison part of four games at home to start the season they will be out in Portland as well just like John shires team which will play Thursday against Oregon State Applause a lot of pivoting Midway through this second half tenuous spot for Bellarmine left hand doesnt get the roll offensive rebound and hope is found Applause second foul on Derek Lively and just the fourth offensive rebound for Bellarmine Music Applause Music Applause has been really good on the glass three rebounds and again just another one of those guys within their offense that seems like hes constantly in motion very difficult to match up against up to nine points in tile trouble at Clemson on Friday we told you that was a onepoint game at the under eighth timeout in the second half both late in that game went out of it and thats when Clemson went on a run they scored a lot on the interior as Bellarmine went small and hope was out of the game foreign Applause that has become a patented move for Garrett Tipton and thats what John Tire talked to his guards about and shoot around well theyre going to put their guards in the post uh you just want to make sure they shoot contested twos you do not want to try uh to put them on the freethrow line he talked about this all of them very good threetoe shooters oh Proctor in pretty good position right there just came down with the hand and thats not what you want to do in post defense right there 17 its down to 12 still nine minutes to go in the second half Applause slips it for lively couldnt finish through the contact from Suitor and Lively gets to his feet Bellarmine with numbers thats bounces for a cutting Wheeling wasnt expecting it and thats a little bit frustrated for Bellarmine with the turnover yeah thats a break for Duke Wheeling uh not realizing nobody was on him hes making his cut through the basket all he had to do was stop and he had a layup and then right here hard to see from that angle if there was any contact and then on the other end thats a break though for Duke again if he stops hes got a layup Applause he only sets the screen for Roach a proctor three short offensive rebound Brooks to the win for two all right 10 points for Jeremy roach just one turnover Wheeling and the passkey stayed down roll them all the way thats the key thing thats great individual defense that time and going for those chocolates Mitchell battles it out phillipowski again on the boards for Proctor Duke is getting fantastic looks all over foreign in the first half on three triples Tipton elbow jumper no suder keeps it alive fresh 20 for Bellarmine Tipton lost the handle and it goes back to Duke 6 48 to go duke up by 14 at home back to Cameron Dukes had nine guys in the rotation second game with a full roster at full strength so we thought itd be interesting how do the minutes get parsed out how do they get distributed this is how its been so far in this one yeah and I think its a luxury that uh John Shire and staff has its a great problem to have when you have this type of depth and rotation I think the biggest thing whoever comes in you can see the way theyre playing offensively tonight theyre sharing the ball uh certainly not too many teams can go nine or ten deep Whitehead thatll obviously change this is only his second game of his collegiate career coming back from the fracture in his foot and John Shire told us today it might take a few weeks for him to be at full game shape the way you would expect when The Seasons coming along midseason so that was some foul trouble in the first half Duke back 14 six and a half to go young back out for Roach Applause long two young battles on the boards and he draws a foul on home so many shots this second half of Duke could come from the perimeter whether theyre long twos like that or threepoint shots I mean Duke has attempted 33 threes in this game and I think its not the number its how theyve got no threes and how open theyve been they have all most of them have been off of excellent ball movement uh some Corner threes just have not gone theyve had some quality looks though from Beyond The Arc so youre good with it you think theyve all come within the flow youre fine with it well again obviously you dont want to fall in love with it but right there if youre John sire you would prefer some uncontested layups but theyve taken what Bellarmine has given them oh yeah Jalen if you get that that right there take it all right to the rim for Blakes hes got eight hope no dice from three Mitchell the rebound Erman just wanted six from long range since halftime Applause Music foreign Mitchell walks with it and a turnover eighth one for Duke Music Applause coming up on five to go the lead for Duke has been as large as 17 Wieland shut off by a young nice pass to a cutting hoe for two and thats one where Mitchell again you cannot fall asleep they will go back door that time out of the post Mickey fell asleep got beat on that cut and be facing its very hard to help Scott 11 leading the way along with suitors 11 for belliner so Charles Anderson feeds Young help from bats it does stay at this end with Duke and this is why they are so difficult to guard again right here you think you have them and then fall asleep for a second uh theyre gonna have Cutters going to the basket uh theyre constantly in motion one through five you must uh be alert at all times 13 on the shot clock so roach had to get it up and then Duke battles on the glass and they draw another foul by attacking the boards well thats been the other key area advantage to Duke uh 3321 the advantage of for them on the glass theyve done a nice job on the defensive and offensive blast philipowski and Ryan Young have in the second half done a nice job creating some Second Chance opportunities hey Saturday six Eastern the ACC huddle crew will have a complete wrapup of the afternoon football games theyll get you set for The Primetime matchup as well between Pitt and Miami here on accn at eight oclock all right here also available on the app Music Applause hes got the Mandate on still finishes on the Block Applause foreign Applause game we Tech under four to go Applause Music Applause shot clock below five Blakes tough shot and the rebound hope Applause questions wheeling going back to that block again spinning on Proctor this time well defended and a timeout with 302 to go duke by 13 trying to finish off millerman yeah its been impressive 17 assists on this game theyre shooting close to 40 39 on the game from Beyond The Arc I think its of the quality of looks uh that one right there probably the only one that was not assisted uh excellent ball movement the spacing and again its been a theme for John Shire every time weve spoken to him sharing the ball uh he has to be pleased with how his team has performed thus far offensively 33 threepoint attempts against his 19th twopoint shots but as you said a lot of them within the flow of the offense and they have served Duke well three minutes to go second half leading by 13 on Bellarmine theyre trying to get to four and one before going to Portland philipowski off the glass and thats all set up your leader Jeremy Rhodes understanding philipowski has a mismatch on him get him the ball let him go to work shot Cinema a rebounding action drawn by hope its on philipowski and thats his second and Mike this is why Jeremy roach is so valuable to this Duke team thats all set up ahem recognizing time and score and then realizing he hasnt had a touch in a little bit but hes got a smaller player on him get him in the right position feed him the ball thats what you want your leader and Captain to do Applause another front end Miss by hope Music Applause Music the road chapter controls again Applause heavily going high low with philipowski and Kyle on the floor Applause Saturday football its pit Miami in Prime Time right here on acc Network 8 oclock Eastern also available Hawk big picture with Duke how do you feel about it five games in youve now seen them live and in person a couple of times winning and John Shire talked about this understanding how to play at the end of games I think the biggest thing out of this is uh theyre finally healthy playing together with his full unit I think they think thats a really impressive uh Kyle filipowski uh he continues to impress but I think the other thing is the rotation they are really a nine or ten deep team a luxury that not too many college teams have once Whitehead is back in the flow fully who goes to the bench bench like who is not in that starting lineup thats probably the only uh difficult uh situation you have who comes in Off the Bench certainly I think thats a problem that most coaches would like to have which talented player do you have to have coming off of the bench thats he trying to muscle on a roach thats short I played very well over these last couple of games now after finding his rhythm approach you obviously know what you have at him hes absolutely going to be in that starting group Mitchells been really effective Whitehead Applause well the one thing uh that John Shire has is this guy with the ball in his hands right here you know he is going to be out on the court of the majority of the time and how about Jacob grandison his 43 16 points today John Shire was so pleased with how he played Friday because he didnt play a ton in the Champions classic against Kansas he didnt score well who played 10 minutes and John shires spoke to the team and said look there are going to be games like that weve talked about the death weve talked about the distribution of the minutes and he thought grandison really typified that on Friday against Delaware and it has continued here today from Granderson theres that edge from philipowski oh John Cyrus smiled uh but back to your point about grandison thats what he does right there he spaces the floor again Jeremy roach with his imprint on the game uh and philipowski uh Chan Chaya had a smile when we spoke to him at shoot around he said you know plays with the edge hes just got a certain Edge about him you see it right there in that situation 47 seconds left and he is down on the floor going after a loose ball foreign Applause Valentine came over for conversation with John Shire after this tie up yeah I think uh he was going to have a Teddy Valentine had a word with philipowski phillipowski was pleased to come away with that loose ball kind of love the fire from the freshman Applause foreign drives kicks it back Granderson wants another nearby Johnson well on the other side development is going to come up short and people are going to look at this score and say that was a 20point game but it was a lot closer uh than the score would indicate they gave Duke all they could handle again uh one of those teams that is a matchup nightmare but credit Dukes defense John Shire has to be pleased defensively how his team was but I was really impressed with how they shared the ball offensively Jacob grandison all smiles he had 16 Kyle filipowski and a second consecutive game goes for 188 after those three double doubles at the start that doesnt
