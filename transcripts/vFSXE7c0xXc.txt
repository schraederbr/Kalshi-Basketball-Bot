and leot and low were excellent in that one ishmail leot had 17 he was six of eight from the floor and low had his second double double of the season with 11 points 12 assists in the game against Eastern Kentucky mentioned his second double double of course the first one was a triple double he got right here against VMI already here you can see Sam Houston intensity on defense flying through screens foul called on Panthers first possession of the day here Jeff cable trying to say it was a shooting foul and theyre going to say it was on the floor so Jaylen low with the Baseline inbound nine and2 record best start not just in the tenure for Jeff Cap at pit but the programs best start since 2 and 16 they are number 11 in the net rankings Nick and well theyve got an opportunity today to start the season 10 two and if youre Jeff capable got to be pleased with what your team has done so far this season definitely got to be pleased especially you know they feeling like they got snubbed out of the tournament last year they scheduled a tough schedule but this noncom schedule this year and are doing a great job Sam Houston has battled injuries throughout this season Brennan Burns did not expect to be the starting point guard coming into the year but he has started the last five for Chris Mudge whos in his second season as the Sam Houston head coach coach coming off a regular season title last year but upset by UTEP in the Conference USA semifinal missed out on a tournament bid they have not been to the dance since 2010 trying to change that this year but Le gets a takeaway hesitation on Wilkerson and knocks down the pullup J you notice in the beginning of pretty much every game legs been the one to get it started offensively getting to the basket stopping and popping Panthers rolling with the same starting five theyve been going with Zack Austin of course he came off the bench for the early portion of the season but they lose Damen dun and they juggle the lineup a little bit Austin ends up filling that spot and Nick you and I were talking before the game with Jeff capable and mentioned Zack Austin is playing the best basketball hes played in a pit uniform right now well hes a freaky athlete an elite athlete hes always played well but one thing cable wanted to harp on him was discipline how can you be consistent how can you have to discipline in your training to do it game after game and thats what were seeing in this stretch of course Austin hit the buzzer beater against Ohio state that gave pit a huge Road win in Columbus this is now his third consecutive game in the starting lineup averaging 11 a half points across his last six and Jaylen low gets on the board its all Panthers early feathery layup he likes getting to that left hand every single tear drop has a chance to go in with his soft touch low averaging 16 and 1 half on the season 5 and 1 half half assist for the sophomore point guard is fourth best in the ACC kick out to Burns here with seven on the timer Sako the drive and cant get it to go Corin Rises up to grab the board leg it quickly the other way draws the Applause contact hes so Shifty on these drives isnt he Nick yes he really likes getting to that left hand as a Defender you got to try your best to try to get him to go right was one thing to look on The Scouting Report says force him right force him right its harder to execute leg it there hes just a Relentless driver of the basketball he always trying to take it to the basket putting pressure on the defense getting to the line low Corner three knocks it down low getting hot earlyer at the beginning we said ham and egg there Jaylen low and Leed showing they a dynamic duo leading the charge so far 2 minutes 23 seconds in timeout Sam Houston Music Music well its a 10 nothing lead for the pit Panthers just over two minutes in and Nick you couldnt really draw off a better start if youre Jeff cable Jaylen low with five points on the corner three and a really acrobatic take as well hes been excellent to start this game Panthers have made their last four from the floor made their last four were really just being aggressive you know letting the game come to him Jaylen low usually is the type of guy lets the game come to him but we want to see him be more aggressive in the beginning of games saw low averaging 165 and five only other player in the country to do that is casparis yones from Illinois whos been good for the Ali ey this season for Brad Underwood but low coming into the air expected to be the point guard for the Panthers and really put a lot of this team on his shoulders hes done well in just his sophomore year to help this team off to the hot start step back three for low short that time and G mod he has Graham able to track down the rebound before losing it a good hustle there for guo hes leading the team and rebounding but not only does he rebound well he gets loose balls well he has active hands Bearcats still looking for their first bucket on the day Ishmael lean has done well defending Wilkerson who we mentioned is shooting 49 from three on the season but leot swats the pass there and the Panthers with the early 10 nothing lead Jason you you said 49 49 is correct so hes truly one of the best guards theyre going to play against yes hes thats Sam Houston hes going to be one of the best guards they play against all season he has made 43 threes on the season that is third in the country so high volume and high efficiency shooter from Wilkerson but that time he takes it in off the window and gets the two right on Q on The Scouting Report they say close out on him put pressure on him dont let him shoot but he knows that and he knows he can get you up get you off balance and get to the basket as well low off the screen from Corin steps back feeds it back to his forward and Corin missfires on the jumper rebound to Dorian finister transferred from Kansas State to Sam Houston Panther steel ends up with gdg its a three on two Le it lob to Cory and mishandled it looked like a little foul there rest may have missed a grab Sam Houston playing really aggressive High Tempo game right now four minutes in Wilkerson denied by Austin gets his own Miss pressure from Corin and then Wilkerson finds an opening and drains the three great block there by Austin you know its tough to have a good block there you cant rest after you get a shot a player like wlson hes going to get the ball back and find a way to score low all the way crosscourt Leed corner three drills it leg done a great job with his threepoint shooting you know hes known as a guy mainly likes to get to the basket likes midrange shot hes done a great job this year with his threepoint shooting good to see leget six of eight from the floor in the win over Eastern Kentucky had struggled a little bit in terms of his shooting percentage in recent games coming into that one but 75 from the floor 17 points and six rebounds for legot against the colonels 10 days ago pass inside Corin backing down Sako cant get the shot to fall couldnt get it to fall but You like to see that there earlier in the season they did a good job getting corn involved early with basket back to the basket moves not relying on jump shots like to see more of that this game Josiah Hammonds was looking for hofner and well done job by hoofer to save it and continue The Possession three ball drops for Hammonds cuts the lead to five so Sam Houston starting to find that stroke offensively yeah one thing about Sam Houston they are a threepoint shooting team they shoot 40 from three thats one of the top teams in the country at threepoint shooting theyre going to fill it up from long range low using Corin on the screen again that time hes fouled on the penetration and well take us to a timeout 1419 to go first half and the Panthers once again relying on that tremendous backourt Duo jayen low to ishmail leot for the connection on the triple the last time the Panthers were in action we saw history 10 days ago we got a new pit freshman record for points off the bench and Nick I have to give you credit you called this a long time ago Brandon Cummings with 30 against dku I saw it in the summer Ive been saying it all year I mean hes a human micro wave if you need scoring put the presetting in 30 points 10 points it doesnt matter he will score he has the confidence as a freshman and will start to contribute the rest of this year highest scoring output by a pit freshman since March of 2020 that was Justin champeny who of course is now in the NBA with the Washington Wizards playing alongside bub Carrington and starting to hear more of these household names in pit basketball Nick Jeff cable is really starting to turn around this program and you see the results yes not only has he starting to turn around he has turned around on this program the past four to five years theyve been relevant in tournament conversations and ACC play this is going to be one of one of those special years again I mean you had a freshman score 30 points who when this team is at 100 Health youve got legot youve got low youve got done you can make the case Cummings is kind of the fourth option in the back court and hes scoring 30 on any given day could be any one of those four and on most days its all four contributing Panthers eager to get get Damen dun back Jeff capable mentioned that Dunn is very excited to get back in the lineup as well expecting to see him in January as Leed spins through the lane gets the two hes up to seven early points here for bit we spoke of dun I was at practice earlier this week hes hes itching to get back you can tell hes frustrated he has injuries but hes still participating in uh noncon drills you know working on his left hand working on off hand hes going to have more weapons when he comes back this is the fifth full game that Damen dun will have missed of course he left just about two minutes in game against Wisconsin at The Greenbrier its allowed the Panthers to really grow without him and individual players making strides that maybe they may not have made if they did not have if they did have Damien done in the lineup so youre seeing the rapid Improvement of this team playing without one of their best players Applause turnover there Sam Houston trying to take advantage thats the fourth pit turnover of the game so far jumper from Scroggins is good and its 1712 7 and A2 minutes in and thats seven points seven of Sam Houstons 12 points are from turnovers so Sam Houston staying in this game from turnovers if pit wants to try to build a lead and get them out of here theyre going to have to stop turnning the ball over low nice feed Austins three nothing there and turns it over again theyre ducking in scogin hes a great hes an undersized big you know thats almost a lost art in the game of basketball today undersized bigs but nice little face up sweet jump shot sgin is in his fifth season with Sam Houston has improved each year this year averaging 77 a game for the Bearcats Applause low defending Brennan Burns here but find some space Burns drives kicks hofner open at the top of the key and off Target foul called on the floor looks to go against the Panthers its a fivepoint pit lead as we head to our timeout 1149 to go in the first half Music Sam Houston six and five on the season and of course have one of the best threepoint Shooters in the country in Wilkerson their defense allowing 762 points per game they would like to get that number down a little bit but overall Nick theyve got an opportunity this year to come back from a year they won the C USA regular season and now they are trying to follow up on that not just win the regular season but win the conference and get to the NCAA tournament games like this in December can help prepare you for those tough tests late in the year yes and they really have reloaded year over year but theyve also developed inhouse werson hes a homegrown Talent you know he came from Junior College usually those big time players at these schools youre getting them from other schools other major universities hes a homegrown Talent he stayed and has developed even on previous great Applause years this is a quad three game for the Panthers Sam Houston currently at 145 in the net rankings the Panthers with three wins so far in the first two quadrants on the year and whats important is theyve avoided any bad losses pits only two losses this season of course on the road at Mississippi State who is number 20 in the net rankings and then on a neutral to Wisconsin in a close sixpoint game Wisconsin number 40 in the net currently but Nick take a look at the company here in the top 12 for pit this is the reason why right now theyre being projected as around a five or six seed in the NCAA tournament of course we got a lot of time left but important what pit has done in the nonconference Slate so far to boost their resume early in the year yeah so far its been so good theres a battle tested team theyve passed virtually every test theyve faced you know lost a tough one against Wisconson but thats going to happen every single team you see up there they also lost tough games you know when youre a good team you play a tough nonconference schedule and you end up nine two mentioned best start for the Panthers since 2016 third straight year now where the Panthers have certainly made themselves relevant among the top teams in the ACC Wilkerson open in the corner back iron and cummings tracks down the board love to see Cummings in there getting his nose dirty as well helping out on the rebounding low Shifty move couldnt get the bucket Panthers over two and a half minutes without a field goal Wilkerson to short rebound ends with delich leads the pass to Cummings Baseline Drive and one BBA Cummings baa Cummings hadnt been in the game longer than a minute and a half and already almost potentially can have six points here this is transition basketball at its finest yeah it is great rebounding as soon as they get the rebound looking up ahead securing the rebound first pushing it up seeing us your score finding your scores in Tradition transition Cummings finishing with a tough finish I love Jeff Cables answer when you asked him if that 30point performance helped to build his confidence he said confidence has never been the problem with him and that is what helped him to get 30 is because hes always been a confident guy hes willing to take those shots he doesnt hesitate and thats how you get 30 points from a freshman I tell you what I saw it in him this Summer the point I knew he was going to be a special player uh was the TBT tournament so our alumni team came and played some pickup against the current team and you know we we were good alumni coming we were up for most of the game but at the end Cummings just was relentless score and bucket after bucket having fun out there talking a little Trash confidence is not lacking from that man all the buzz after that alumni game was about Brandon Cummings I remember exactly what youre talking about and well in the absence of Damen Dawn he has certainly surged forward as an option in this Panther back court and a significant one at that Diaz Graham correct the rebound for pit pit doing a great job of limiting him to one possession one shot guos three off Target rebound there went to Sako now finister contact on delich thatll be his first finister likes driving to the basket likes putting his head down and dve and Del doing a good job sliding his feet but kind of got caught with his hand down riding him Sako working on GMO and out of bounds great defense by the panther big thats something we have seen improvement yearoveryear with yo keeping his hands up not afraid to get his nose dirty not afraid to go chest to chest and wall up Force the offense to make tough shots k those threepoint numbers not quite what they were last year not as efficient in that area but his rebounding has been much better and has been a huge lift for this Panther team trying to improve in that area Diaz Graham does lead the team in rebounds per game as leot sinks the short jumper and hes headed to the foul line and thats what legga does he gets to his spots he likes that right when he gets into the paint defense kind of knows hes going to pull up but theres nothing you can do cuz if you think hes going to shoot it hell drive and get all the way to the basket great shot from Leed Leed up to nine points Panthers are on a 70 run over the last minute 40 completes the threepoint play Panthers have their largest lead of the day at 2514 in addition to what hes done offensively Nick hes done a great job defending Wilkerson as well hes done a great job Wilkerson one of the best scorers in the country but pit theyve done a great job with all the great scores they played against you know aside from maybe Wisconsin or ton Wisconsin they did a great job with all the elite scores they faced this year substitutions on both sides Dorian finister going to step off with two fouls Brennan Burns by the way with three for Sam Houston so theyve got a couple of important guards in foul trouble and forces them to insert Eric Taylor The Freshman hes in number 12 onto the court for the first time for Sam Houston if Sam Houston want to stay in this game they got to play some honest defense cant get caught with your hand in the clippy jar with Ticky tack fouls out of bounds called on the Panthers there stays on this end Chris Mudge 2024 C USA Coach of the year started his career at Texas its a ga there from 06 to 08 worked with a guy named Kevin Durant I dont know if you remember him Nick remember him yeah mud coached great players LaMarcus Aldridge Kevin Durant Texas coaching Legend he was a clear foul Austin definitely got him on arm there but hes used to getting blocks so I think he was shocked call the foul fans didnt like the call nonetheless s is going to head to the line and misses the first Sako just 56 from the stripe on the Music Applause season Sako 0 for two from the line and extends a scoring drought of over two and a half minutes for Sam Applause Houston Panthers led by 10 from leet Diaz Graham low with five Austin with five and cummings with five a piece as well low out to Austin three in the air got it to go probably the biggest Improvement yearover Year Austin has been in shooting hes been a more consistent shoo and you could tell when they drive they look to him they kick it and he shoots you with confidence without hesitation Sam Houston had a hand up on that shot there he still confidently stepped up knocked it down Wilkerson working on leged kick out hofner gets a three Le did a great job defensively there on Wilkerson but Wilkerson put so much pressure on the defense th made everybody get attention on him kicked it out to the second best shooter hofner ends the 110 pit run now guo using low off the screen Bullseye this is turned into a shootout here thats what Sam Houston likes to do but thats what pit specializes Applause in well they say you need veteran guards to win in March Jaylen low and Leed fitting the bill for pit happy holidays from the 412 well for the Panthers 31 points all coming from four players Nick we talked about the list of Jeff cable guards hes been able to produce well here you go leg it low Austin in Cummings with all 31 for the Panthers maybe you categorize Austin as more of a wing but the point Remains the guards have been tremendous yes the backourt depth is incredible uh some of the best in the country you never know whos going to kill you that game very efficient as well Panthers shooting 61 from the floor Leed is a perfect four for four low is three for six Austin and cummings a combined four for Applause five Jeff Cap of course last season led the first team in ACC history to start one and five or worse and finish ACC play with a winning record speaks to what he accomplished last year of course won the AC C Coach of the Year ward in 2023 and think he could have made a case for the same last year with the turnaround that he executed for a team that started slow and finished strong Diaz gram a three got it theres the fifth player to score for pit great shot good be great to see him get rolling and see him start making some threepointers Panthers are six for n from threepoint range offense has been as efficient as ever low the feed Corin the slam I think I think the bigs heard us talking about how great the guards were they wanted to get involved today right away Corin and Diaz Graham getting themselves on the score sheet and 17point lead for the Panthers Sam Houston looking for answers Wilkerson just two for five on the day be cats have not been able to get him involved but Nick you said it the big starting to get involved offensively yes a great drive and kick there for Gamo stepping up ready to shoot at all times and then Jaylen low involved in both plays feeding the bigs Corin gets on the board Jaylen low has eight points and four assists here in the first half last game jayen low had a double double was kind of overshadowed by be Cummings having 30 points how amazing it is to have 11 points and 12 assists nine of those assists coming in the second half for low Diaz Graham flies in and gets the P back heaz Graham getting involved in the offensive rebounding been a great defense most of his rebounds come from def on the defensive end so if you can get him more involved in rebounding on the offensive end itll be a more deadly offense three boards for guo today hes averaging 64 a game on the season as hner draws the foul on his cut to the Music basket great follow there right off the rim using his s foot frame heting up in the air where nobody else can so hner at the line on the other end hes a senior from Australia 10th start of the season for hofner second leading scorer on the year for the Bearcats and and hes really been impressive as of late had his first double double of the Season Monday they played St Thomas 13 and 10 for him in that game two games with at least 20 on the year and a very efficient free throw shooter 84 on the season and he goes two for two there every game circled is typically Wilkerson but best believe second guy circled is hner physicality on the inside trying to defend Corin foul and the foul goes on Wilkerson so now three players on Sam Houston with at least two fouls finister and Wilkerson have two each and burns has three so the fouls not very spread out each team currently with seven the difference is that Sam Houston have all come from three different players Panthers have seven fouls from seven different guys this games getting very chippy theyre playing hard defensively after the last stopage of play you saw a little a little squirmish between players things are getting heated both teams want to win 17point lead now for the Panthers who have looked fantastic in this first half so Music far Wilkerson tried to give and go with scrogging and results in a kickb b as Brandon Cummings checks back in Cameron Corin takes a seat and right now pits doing a great job ging workers leg doing a great job keeping the ball out of his hands making him work for every single Music Applause basket thats a freshman mistake there Cummings getting caught falling asleep Im sure they went over that La play and walk through a couple times see coach C talking to him right now talking to the Freshman telling him how to defend it and cummings had just checked into the game at the time of the foul went in for Corin and immediately finister capitalizes but does not convert the threepoint play so ball tipped out by the Bearcats Panthers will take over thats something as a freshman coming to learn getting in high school you know youre the most athletic youre the tallest on the cor youre the most athletic you dont nobody would try that play on you but in college everybody can jump good learning moment its a great learning moment for him Diaz Graham at the foul line finds Low T on the timer Cummings open three not there and rebound tipped off the fingertips of Austin to hofner trying to get Wilkerson free havent been able to do it much here today that time its a three for Eric Taylor theyre doing a great job on wierson but other guys are doing a great job for Sam Houston knocking down shots and being available Sam Houston giving a little bit of a Zone look now trying to find something to slow down this Panther efficient offense but it wont work Zack Austin a three from the wing and they go into the Zone thinking they could change the look on pit but pit was ready for the amount of Shooters pit had I dont know if the zone is going to be the option here today Austins threepoint stroke Nick has really come alive continues into today hes three of four from the perimeter and hes not hesitating it seemed like in the past sometimes he would hesitate if the defender was close to him this time hes not even hesitating hes going straight up over the defender making shots so a foul on G Modz Graham but a 15point lead for the pit Panthers Eric Taylor hit the open three but the Panthers have had an answer all day its seven of 12 from Beyond The Ark with the big Music lead 15point lead for the Panthers so mentioned Brandon comings gets caught for the foul the inbound right after he checks in Nick what did he need to do differently here so one in an inbounds but you have to do your work early you have to kind of have awareness of where you are where the offensive player is trying to get to especially on that La play underneath you got to see your man in ball and dont let the offensive player occupy that space one thing weve seen from Jeff Cable in some of these early season blowouts theyve had against teams and of course still 24 minutes to play in this one but he has not let up in any circumstance always coaching always instructing and teaching especially with a freshman guy like Brandon Cummings part of the reason why this team has been so successful high standards high expectations now with a 14point lead over Sam Houston Panthers some excellent guard play across the board offensively Sam Houston coming out in the Press theyre not afraid to change things up and kind of change up the Rhythm got to find some way to get pit out of rhythm they left Austin open again for three but misfired that time low able to grab the board Baseline Drive kick out to lean in a three got it unbelievable play by jayen low getting to the basket its almost like he knew he drew through three people Le doing a great job repositioning to get an open shot theyve been doing that all year now le it defending Wilkerson that time Wilkerson gets by and finds scroggin for two whatever you can do I can do better wierson with a crafty move and creating for his teammate as well Panthers 8 for 14 from three on the day low finds legot jab step lob Corin fouled on the leap watch low here driving deep into the paint and thats a drive there hes not driving to score hes driving to draw and put pressure on the defense because they know the defense knows when he gets to the basket oh thats what happens it it looked worse than it was thats what happened when youre a guard going against a 610 guy it could look worse than it is he was just trying to get out of the way there didnt want to get dunked on on Christmas nobody wants to get dunked on right before Christmas good to see Corin back up looks all good back at the line 15point lead Nick Ill tell you it is just so fun to watch le it and low how dynamic they are how versatile they are can pass can score its what makes him so great as a Duo for pit theres been a lot of great Duos in the past who can pass who can score but what makes them unique I think is the way they rebound as well you know theyre the second and third leading rebounders on the team I think thats really rare from guard position Austin defending hofner and hoofer wins that battle gets the twopoint basket he is the first Bearcat into double figures on the day with 11 hoer is really a versatile player hes a big body hes definitely a guard the way he can shoot it he can handle the ball but if theres a mismatch he thinks he can he got some moves down low too low the driving kick Austins three Off the Mark Corin grabs the board and cleans it out thats the aggressiveness you want to see from cam Corin youve seen it in spurts youve seen it beginning of the year You seen it in a couple games here and there but if he can be that aggressive that feisty on every single possession this pit team will be unstoppable Cameron Corin with seven points still in the first half but that is the most hes had in an entire game since November 24th against Wisconsin at The Greenbrier and you said it Nick thats an aspect of his game that they are looking to get back find that offensive aggression that he had early in the season as finister now picks up a third foul so youve got finister and burns with three AP piece and Wilkerson still with two this fou trouble might when youre trying to make a run you want your main guys in the game you need your guards you need your leaders especially guys with experience you need them in the game and when theyre in foul trouble thats a chance for pit to extend the lead has to be tough for Sam Houston theyve made six of their last seven from the floor feeling good offensively but just not have found an answer for the pit offense so theyre actually going to change who this foul was on here officials just took a look at it and they had said it was on finister I think pretty clearly there it is on Kian scrog so they make that change and brings finister back down to two and thats important for Coach Mudge in Sam Houston is now they just have burns with three everyone else two or less thats a simple mistake they both have the same haircut the same got the same Barber anybody can make that mistak well finister is not happy about it cuz now he has to sit on the bench he a coach it wasnt me Panthers Dro 50 here still 2 minutes to go in the first half Corin Le it three not there Austin hustles to get the rebound Cummings diving on the floor for it and ends up secured by Scroggins now Wilkerson crosscourt Hammonds three too strong and out of bounds on the Baseline Panthers will take over Music Sam Houston are starting to feel like maybe they feel the pressure a little bit theyre kind of chucking up some Rush shots look at Zack Austin was around half court when that guy started a square up for the three comes all the way back to contest and get a hand in the face yeah hes three blocks away maybe two blocks now from something special here looks like hes trying to get it before this first half Austin would be in Elite company with what hes done throughout his career dating back to his time at High Point on both ends of the floor pull up three goes for Taylor Eric Taylor am miss the foul trouble on San Houston has eight points only averages 29 on the season but he stepped in with the team needing him and performed well if there was questions about Sam Houstons depth with this foul trouble I think they may find something special with this Taylor Guy L it up P under what a take from is Applause leged Leed again just comfortable out there scoring on every level midrange layups free throws threepointers 89 total points in the game in this first half offense has been on display from the getgo and Hammond struggling against Cor in the short Corner eight on the shot clock hand off hofner thought about the shot then takes the three and drills the three theyre starting to heat up taking deep threes last four possessions been a threepoint shot for them they start getting hot they can cut into this lead one final possession for the Panthers low mishandled it off the screen from Corin and Wilkerson he loses a handle so now itll end up back with pit however only with point8 pit Dodge the bullet there low got a little lazy with the ball there know that Applause happens so 52 first half points from the Panthers but Sam Houston with a solid offensive performance of their own its a 12point offensively 15 points very efficient scoring but lets talk about what hes doing on defense hes shutting down one of the best guards in the country making it tough for him to score and get open shots Wilkerson averaging 20 points per game on the season thats second best in the Conference USA but just five here today and hes right in front of us as we kick things off in the second half here in Pittsburg Panthers looking to improve to 10 and two low gets a takeaway to start the half and a crafty finish on his way to the bucket what a move there even on the right side he wants to get back to that left great steel set the tone on the first half 10 points six assists for Jaylen low he gets his first steal of the ball game there to start half number two thats not a good way to start for Sam Houston you know your first possession the first pass you make is a steal for a layup like a defensive back Jaylen low kind of reading the eyes of the offensive player easily get to the Lane youre not going to outr run him in transition that left hand is lethal isnt it very lethal very lethal hner was hot in the first half misses his first attempt here in the second and a foul caught on Zack Austin on the rebound Austin picks up his second low and Diaz Graham also with two for pit just a physical game refs are calling it tight trying to keep it under control Wilkerson stepped out of bounds and Nick that was interesting the one time it finally looked like he got free he stepped out and turns it over yeah he just needs to find his rhythm and like great scores they usually do what Pits going to have to do weather the storm here Wilkerson gets a steal now steps back Beyond The Arc takes a three and hits like I said a score theyre going to find a way to get hot you know doesnt phase them if they miss a couple shots make a couple turnovers Austin open for three buries it like every time Sam Houston looks like theyre making a run hit answers with a dagger Bearcats need to get Wilkerson going if theyre going to make a comeback in this game Corin Big Time rejection but a foul call Jeff capable cant believe it looked like a late call there entire pit offense was on the other side of the Court they called that Applause foul good pass there by finister that looked like a clean block I think with how aggressive it looked maybe he wanted to call it a foul Geo straight up almost looked like Corin got more of Dio than he did Sako right yeah he heard the slap that was a slap he heard you know he heard a slap so Corin gets whistled for the foul although I think you and I agree it was more contact on GMO than it was Sak so two now on Corin hes the fourth pit player with two and the Panthers havent been able to really extend this lead largest lead of the game 17 so just as you said pit always having an answer for Sam Houston the Bearcats punching back as well not allowing the Panthers to blow this thing open just yet and again this Sam Houston team they are champions they won the Conference USA last year they know how to win they have a great coach theyre not going to go down easy offensive board Corin low a three in and out Austin another second try and that time he gets it Go Go Gadget Austin what a rebound there getting a second chance opportunity Second Chance bucket showcasing his athleticism once again Zach Austin coming alive in the last few games for the pit Panthers gets the put back there 16 points to lead all Panther scores and the lead is 16 for pit Applause Music during our early season conversations with Jeff capable he continued to mention that Austin was playing excellent on the defensive side but he wanted to see more offense out of him in the last few games hes been tremendous on both sides of the floor you know in baseball what they call a utility player thats exactly what Zack is he does it all a lot of his impact on the game is not even in the stat sheet hes a great shot blocker but he Alters a lot of shots he gets a lot of Second Chance opportunities he can guard bigs he can guard Smalls he does it all and you mentioned that Milestone Austin is approaching coming into today three blocks shy of becoming the fourth player in NCAA history with th000 points 600 rebounds 173s and 200 blocks in his career mentioned he started at High Point had some ridiculous stats there now comes to pit big reason for their success last year reaching the ACC semifinal and playing the best basketball hes played in a pit uniform right now legot drives Maneuvers through the lane and finishes off the window a great little Euro Step there getting to the Lane changing angles so the shot blockers dont know when to jump dont know how to jump leg it up to 177 been very efficient seven for nine from the floor Le and low have played the entire game for pits so far Wilkerson drives and scoops and scores thats what great scores do and the jump shots not falling at a a high as clip as youre used to sometimes good scores they can just you got to get to the basket great take there maybe got away with a few extra steps fre I wasnt going to say anything but Ill leave that to you now great take Wilkerson answering youre going to see Wilkerson here hes going to be a little more aggressive I know coaches are in his ears teammates probably telling them time to step up put the cape on its been a fun match up to watch leot and Wilkerson neither one of them has left the floor and low trains a triple to extend the panther lead 13 and seven for Jaylen loick yeah just when you think you do a great job forcing pit to run through their offense stopping a drive they kick it out somebody else hits a dagger three sometimes that can be a little deflating good to see low efficient from three today maybe the one area this year where he hasnt been himself is the threepoint range 27 from three coming into today but low three for seven from Beyond The Arc in this one finding that stroke back from the perimeter tough drive from Hammond there Austin definitely wanted to try to get a block but maybe he forgot he was a lefty craft jump shot off the L and finishes L just the Conant floor Jer knowing the bigs want to score as well they want to get in on the party found an open corn down low and Wilkerson just struggling to find his rhythm dribbles it off himself turns it over to the Panthers 6649 Nick how about number 15 for the Panthers hes been passing the ball so well use a nice little ball fake the defense thinks hes going to pass we forget hes one of the best Shooters in ACC Jaylen low down all day in Pittsburgh thankful were inside the Peter cent center 6649 lead for the Panthers and pits final game before the holidays theyll have about 10 days off before they resume on New Years Day players will get to go home come back on the 26th and Jaylen low with 13 points eight assists hes been excellent all day for the Panthers Nick and really having a tremendous season continues in here on his home floor so so far from jayen low weve seen a triple double weve seen a double double now we might see backtoback double doubles yeah showing his versatility hes really the leader of this team gets everybody involved but he wants to to eat two now he can score two two assists away from the double double feeds one off to Austin theres a three for Zack Austin hes up to 19 points and the Panthers increased that lead to 20 largest of the day great job with ball movement there low getting it out of his hands quickly give Austin a chance to hit yet another three and we talk about the assist for low you can add one more 13 points nine Dives for Jaylen low low to G Mo rims out rebound Applause Wilkerson and we talked about the schedule 10 days off for the Panthers coming after this and theyre in a stretch right now with two games in a 21 day span Jeff cable said thats so important Nick because Jaylen low and ishmail leot in particular have been working hard and have been getting a lot of minutes low averaging 343 on the season leg at 338 those two guys have been carrying this team through the early portion of the Season been important for them to have some time off to refresh their bodies yeah they need to refresh their bodies because its going to be a tough stretch when ACC starts every single team this year can win games its going to be a test every single night in the ACC theyre going to play Big minutes theyre the leaders of this team Panthers have Cal on New Years Day Stanford on January 4th to start the new year of course they are already 1 and0 in the ACC with a road win at Virginia Tech on December 7th so a kickball here from leget off the pass from Wilkerson I know the Diaz Graham twins have some soccer experience maybe Ley getting it from them huh maybe in the dorms TI leg it Al Cameron Corin Big Time Jam great Alle there just throw it up where nobody else can get it Corin up to 12 points really good day for him have been struggling to score recently not today Panthers lead back to 20 Wilkerson fouled on his way up this is probably the last opportunity here Sam Houston theyre going to have to score but theyre also going to have to get stops in the other end if theyre going to want to cut into this lead and make this a game perfect pass from leot Corin and in fatic Slam you see the celebration from Leed in the background there he likes his assist as well you got to love this team you can tell they love each other whenever anybody scores even if youre the leading scorer everybodys cheering everybodys excited when anybody scores when everybody does something well great chemistry on this team Panthers have 71 points with 13 minutes remaining theyre on Pace to have their highest scoring output of the Season theyve eclipsed 90 on a couple of occasions this year you really the magic number for pit is 80 if theyre going to score 80 points in a game 10 assists from low make it official double double for Jaylen low his third of the season and Cameron Corin is reaping the benefits of these Panther dimes saying early if pit scores 80 points theyre 45 and two when they score 80 points Applause like deja vu at this point doesnt it Nick this here you see scrin try to come in and take a charge but forgot about the weak side you got to be in Weak side help there especially theyve been throwing lobs all day there the nol helped it as well 10 assists two dunks in a row from corn little no look action from J got to add a little spice to it you know you have 10 of them you got to make one look a little fancy add some variety right yeah Sam Houston was trapped in the corner they take a timeout 20point lead for the Panthers backto back slams from Corin Music jayen low 13 points 10 assist his second straight double double and whether it comes from ishmail leot or Jaylen low karon Corin is happy about these dishes hes been getting from his backourt guards Corin with 14 points in a very big game for him to go the conference play Nick theyre going to have to check the rims I dont think its used to having 610 240 lb men damaging the rim and hanging on it with that much velocity well this is what Jeff capable wanted when he went out and got him right had a great year at Florida State last season a young guy this is junior year now and cable saw the potential the physicality he could bring to this Panther front court and here he is again that time he haded poked away but you saw a little bit of this from Corin early in the season but saw it fade on the offensive side over the last few games this is exactly what you need if youre pit because you need that front Court presence that he provides yeah and hes been a great front Court player his entire career but the amount of minutes hes being asked to play is not typically what hes been used to in the past so hes going to be asked to play a lot of minutes he is the main front Court guy and just has to keep working on his conditioning staying patient taking good shots and telling some of these guards who are good passers feed me the rock be aggressive Corin scor at least 12 in each of his first seven games in a pit uniform this season but six points or less in each of his last four wasnt taking as many shots from the floor either hes still shooting 68 from the field coming into today but just wasnt getting quite as many looks off coming into this one but now five of seven from the floor today has the 14 points and a really good game for Corin 15 for him now after the free throw and the Panthers lead by 19 lean has been locking down Wilkerson today at time a hesitation from the Sam Houston guard and he draws Applause contact Wilkerson and the bear catch trying to chip away but the Panthers still in control at the peak Music so Panthers looking to go 10 and two to start the season some really good wins already but heres whats coming up Cal and Stanford at home to start 2025 then probably the toughest game remaining on their schedule at number five Duke on January 7th before coming back home Louisville and on the road in Tallahassee but Nick all of these ACC games even more important now for the Panthers and part of the reason the conference has five teams in the top 50 of the net right now so you dont want to slip up or could be looked at when youre trying to build your resume as a bad maybe lower quality loss and so the Panthers have to be at their best heading into ACC play especially when youve had a very very good nonconference schedule you hate to spoil it if you will by having a bad conference schedule because they look at the entire season thats the committee is looking at the entire body of work when theyre considering postseason selection Panthers right now have no losses outside of quad one but both the cow game and the Stanford game right now at home would be quad three games so those are the type of ones you have to avoid losing if youre pit as Papa con back in the game here for the Panthers you can see the frustration from him he was so good in that game at Ohio State but just trying to find ways he can replicate that performance te and thats what he brings to the team he is a Relentless rebounder thats something thats you know missing in this pit formula or if you will or couldnt have some improvement and I know cable has been harping on it you need somebody down they need somebody down low who can rebound who can get Second Chance shots and thats what theyre on the court to do leg grabbed the Miss from Cummings and he was fouled on the putback attempt ishma leet second season with the Panthers of course a great career in three years at Rhode Island averag 107 points a game across his three seasons there and was a starter in the early portion of last year before coming off the bench for 18 games to close the season and what an addition he was for the Panthers a season ago and well we said it Nick him and low have just been so fun to watch in this pitb court and legats got 18 here today something thats pretty underrated what Cs been able to do getting guards to transfer in and buy into this pit program leg just one of the list of probably think of six seven guards whove been some of the best in the country coming slows things down here Panthers up 17 but havent been able to push the lead any bigger than 20 so far screen from kante low working on finister works his way looping around the bucket and scoring its just an unbelievable move he puts so much pressure on the defense when hes get into the basket especially a game like this where hes scoring very efficiently hes passing very efficiently just seems like he can do whatever he wants when the balls in his hands he can do whatever he wants hes a great ball handler Elite ball handler Elite finisher but once again the Bearcats respond its hofner whos up to 16 points now a turnover its a four on two for Sam Houston and Taylor throws up a heave kante called for the Applause foul look at the agility on this guy Nick jayen always get into the basket and the thing about him is when he drove like that before it was for a kick out to leg it for three so the defense is thinking hes going to do the same thing he switches up on him and flips up a little layup and he makes it look effortless he definitely does hes a very smooth player almost expressionless on his face you dont know what hes thinking but I think thats what you want in your starting point guard right you want somebody cool calm collected thats what leaders do when theres crisis when theres people are panicking you want to be able to look to your leader and have some calm L started out the season hot struggled a little bit was just 5 for 22 in consecutive games against Gardner Webb in West Virginia but really ever since then has been absolutely tremendous double figure scoring for him in every game since the West Virginia game has really LED this pit team well in just a sophomore season and even those games he was struggling you know he was still creating for others he was still getting a lot of assists he was still great rebounding you know he impacts the game in so many different ways turn around Jay wow was that pretty from Jaylen low that was nice that was him getting to his spot and he may not look like it but hes strong and thats one thing hes improved yearoveryear with was his strength was in the weight room relentlessly CU thats what people were trying to knock on him they were trying to say maybe hes not strong enough for the next level thats what he has to improve on well he did that kind of bulli Panther offense has been outstanding 19 from Austin 18 from leget and 17 from low but a foul call this time on Austin and he picks up his fourth with 9913 remaining so Panthers leading scorer in the contest now with four fouls in Zack Austin Music Brandon Cummings will check in for Applause Austin Z ausus you could tell he he wants to play he didnt want to be subbed out there the true player scroggin at the line here cant get it to go scroggin misses the foul shot just 60 from the line on the year Corin hands off leggy three in the air oh Applause yeah Corin getting in on the assist game as well you know legged low been feeding him all day cors like you know what I can pass too Panther offense has been very efficient all day long 50 from three 59 from the field what do you think best game weve seen from Corin this season I think one of them one of them one of them know he played well against Murray State earlier in the year too hes doing a little bit of everything today yeah what hes doing at all this is the aggression you want to see from him Panthers moving quickly the other way leg it over his head to Cummings buries a three and a highlight play from Leed to Cummings how did he see Cummings coming down the court didnt look at him once getting a little chippy Cummings coming in protecting his teammate got to like it Sam Houstons not going to go out without a fight might be too little too Music late had absolutely no ey line to comings there Nick but finds a way to get it to him and you see the tough hit he took from Scroggins well take us to our timeout Cummings hits the three 24point lead for Music pit Panthers in control here at the feet but during the break a flagrant two foul assessed to Ken scroggin and you see the hit and he kind of laid on ishmail leot there in the paint leot thankfully looks to be okay but Nick you cant argue about the C I mean scroggin clearly stays in his position there and kind of throws a hip into Leed and he is ejected from the basketball game yeah and thats clear malicious intent you know he embraced through his entire body at the smaller guy thats not safe I mean when youre losing by 20 21 points at the time you just no need yeah theres no need for that I know youre frustrated know you want to win but theres no room for that and ishmail Le it meanwhile in excellent free throw shooter 74 on the season coming into today was great last year as well hes got 23 points season high for him and the Panthers up 26 and if there were any hope for Sam Houston to make a push back in this game they likely lose that with Scroggins now out he was the interior presence that had been a factor today khif aako is now the guy Sam Houstons going to rely on in the inside but hes been a nonfactor in this game so Panthers in the drivers seat the rest of the way in this one as we expect front Court Front Courts done a great job shutting down the front Court of Sam Houston Diaz grah drills a triple off the assist from low and he is a shooter theres truly five six elite Shooters on the pit team so anytime you want to get in a shootout thats what Sam Houston likes to do they like to get in the shootouts youre going to get in out with pit better bring Heavy Artillery Sako spinning in the lane and he somehow finds a way to get it up through Diz Graham and Corin for the deuce Panthers not taking their foot off the gas as Jaylen low quickly in just 8 seconds off the shot clock draws the contact and well head to the line got 90 90 points with seven minutes left in the game pits put on an offensive showcase today sharing the ball everyone scoring and Nick theyve looked dominant in a lot of these early season games of course they had some tough nonconference tests during that road trip they were away from the P for nearly a month but Le Austin low Corin four guys with 15 or more and thats been the theme in some of these home games against weaker opponents theyre not just winning theyre winning big and they look like like a team that when theyre at their best if they can play at their best against some of the better teams in the ACC theyre going to be one of those top three or four teams in the conference could be headed for another double Buy in the conference tournament come March what I like most of them this season even when theyve had a bad half bad offensive half bad defensive half they come back to the second half with a little bit of Vance with a little bit of attitude you know they come back and they never out of the game they continue to fight and eventually its going to work when you have four or five great scores on your team eventually youre going to catch some momentum foul called there against Jorge as Graham in alongside his twin guo now and Nick you and I were talking before the game how about what West Virginia has done since losing here at the Pak by 24 which is now looking like an excellent win for the Panthers cuz West Virginia then went on to beat Gonzaga over Thanksgiving and thats looking like a great Inn for bit the BR done a great job during the season you they had eight nine new guys that are all contributing this year on this West Virginia team know theyre not going to be out of it with a coach like the a player like the sun deze theyre not going to be have theyve done a great job putting it together figuring it out as they go and unfortunate news out of West Virginia Tucker de dealing with an injury right now well see if they can get him back later on this season but when theyre at full strength certainly look to be one of the better teams in the Big 12 its looking like a really solid win for the Panthers that came in just the second week of the Season you know the Panthers are going to win the Backyard Brawl and thats just thats what we do thats what they do at the home court they protect the zoo second year in a row Panthers have won that match up with West Virginia amsul delich takes a pullup jumper knocks it down delich with his first bucket of the game so what I like about delich is he hes a shooter and he knows he is like every game hes come in he shoots it with confidence he gets the swipe delich transition and couldnt quite find Corin tried to drop one off there this is just skill work getting by your Defender its like he was a cone went right behind theyre orange like a cone went right by him one dribble pull up nice pure stroke hes become a nice piece off the bench definitely has and just yet another piece they want to develop now in the future professional playing experience overseas so hes not scared of the moment not scared of the moment but maybe trying to get used to the speed of you know khich basketball delich The Freshman from Bosnia got professional experience over there now comes to pit really good threepoint shooter Diaz Graham find delich pull up three made the shot but a foul called against G Modz Music gr you see there used his arms he pushed definitely a foul I dont know what he was shrugging his shoulders and talk to the ref about he clearly pushed him and so Zack Austin enters for Diaz Music Graham six minutes to go from the Pete and a 25point panther lead theyre well on their way to a 10 two record to start the season then well have 10 days off before Cal on New Years Day Music Applause Jaylen low 18 points 11 assists for the Panthers here today and a foul call this time goes against Wilkerson fourth personal on Wilkerson Music low curls off the screen and in and out on the jumper offensive rebound and the score for Austin go go gadget Austin another offensive rebound showing his versatility yet again hes having one of the best games of his career 21 points 8 for 11 hes been tremendous for the Panthers here today delich gets it back slices through the defense kicks out Austin Corner three out there Jorge tips it back out delich resets with low he fires a three Jorge tips it out again another try for the Panthers and they draw the foul Jorge doing a great job on offensive glass hes trying to jump up and get it but only can get one arm on it kicking it out Applause 27point lead for the Panthers but this is the type of grit and resilience that Jeff cable likes to see from start to finish I love theyre playing hard wire to wire still four and a half minutes left in the game theyre still battling for loose balls battling for rebounds almost up 30 got to love to see it so a timeout taken by Chris Mudge and Sam H Houston with 438 to play here in the second half Panthers currently with four guys with 15 or more being led by ishmail leot and Zack Austin 23 and 21 for those two respectively but a lot of the points Nick are coming from jayen low hes got 18 points 11 assists and hes been spectacular All Season as the panther point guard hit goes as low goes hes scoring at will playing defense great but his biggest attribute tonight is sharing the basketball everybody scored off one of his passes cool calm and collected keeping everybody excited to be here 63 Guard from Missouri City Texas third straight double double at home one of those was a triple double and Nick we were informed that he is the first pit player with consecutive double doubles including assists since a guy named Trayvon Woodle just about 12 years ago you remember playing with Trey Trey Woodall hes one of my best friends on the team hes one of the unsung heroes in that Jamie Dixon era uh you know a lot of people talk about uh Lance Fields Ash and Gibs Brad wanam maker Carl krower Trey wall definitely should be mentioned amongst those names he was a leader everybody respected him he made sure everybody eat he was ran the offense kept that Jamie Dixon era hot coaching now at forom you know hes one of the top assistants at forom doing a great job there in the A10 been really neat to see some of these Jeff cable era hit guards put their name in the same company as some of those guys you mentioned Nick of course there were so many good ones under Jamie Dixon and now guys like jamarius Burton from Carrington Nelly Cummings and jayen love just to name a few think Jeff can resonate with the guards a little bit more being that he was a stellar guard himself back at Duke and definitely guards they always seem to gravitate towards each other floor generals seem to gravitate towards each other a special bond huh y Thats why most of the coaches you see are former guards see the game in a different way yeah Panthers now have their highest scoring output of the Applause Season Brandon Cummings coming off his 30point game feeds Jorge Corner three is good Jorge hes a great shooter probably just as good a shooter as his brother is but maybe a little more streaky great to see him get going but also good to see Cummings yes Cummings is a great score but if he can develop as a Creator as well that only make him more Applause Music dangerous hoer drives on the Baseline makes it a 30point margin but it has been all pit and Jorge Diaz Graham gets in on the action as well the Freshman to the Spaniard in the corner on the trifecta Music well we mentioned coming in Zach Austin is playing the best basketball of his career hes got a season High 23 points today Nick and as this season has gone on he has just gotten better and better on the offensive side that pivotal moment where he hit the game winner that Ohio State game it seems like thats kind of where you could take a deep breath and be like maybe you know I have arrived maybe I am a consistent contributor on this team hes done it changing his mindset Cs done a great job changing his mindset showing him you have to bring it every single day you know in the past hes relied on his athleticism hes been always been the most athletic guy hes always been able to just show up and perform with his natural athleticism but if you add that with work and discipline you can be a consistent player now this is Pitts 12th game of the season Zack Austin has started three of them and Ill tell you what its going to be interesting to see what Jeff capable does when Damen Dunn is back healthy again because he was so good before the injury but now youve got low legged Austin done do you have room for all those guys in the starting lineup I dont know you you dont want to throw off the Rhythm Im every time he gets into the game he seems to hit a three he seems to make a jump shot good for hille but I think Austins comfortable coming off the bench but I think theyre going to slowly bring Dunn along you know make sure hes hes healthy get his conditioning back up but Dunn is such an important piece of the team you know for his injury hes leading the team in threepoint percentage hes very under control hes Elite scoring threat and both Austin and dun tremendous on defense and on offense is huge reason why theyre so important when theyre on the floor thats a good problem to have Austin still cooking here late feed to delich drive in lays it up and in crafty finger roll as his teammates loving that he pulled a little jelly roll there he learned that in America I dont think they were doing that this is the point in the game where the bench is having a great time right having a blast there a point time in the game I know all too well its time to get the walk on in time to get the guys who dont get to play much in time winding down here whats going to be a big win for the pit Panthers want to take a moment Nick this will be the last broadcast for you and I this season as pit heads into conference play and its been great having you my friend hope you enjoyed your first season its been a pleasure coming back hope future years but thank you for everything youve done its been awesome its been fun man its been most fun good being cor side again got to love it and and love seeing you in a new role here at the uh table with me and have to thank our outstanding crew as well our producer today Tristan Russell director Kevin wheeler our is Sarah Johnson all three of them and so many more have been critical to the success of these broadcasts over the early portion of the season so I want to extend a huge thank you to them as the Panthers push on once again well have a nice 10day break before the new year and thats one thing that people dont always know about our broadcast crew Nick is that theyll do volleyball one day soccer the next basketball the next and so I think theyre appreciative of the 10 days off as well and theyve certainly earned it talked all day about As versatility lets talk about the versatility of the pit production team you can do all sports youre absolutely right Panthers getting some minutes here for amdi eni Marlon Barnes Jr late in the Applause contest 32point lead for the Panthers hanging 107 with a minute and a half to go Dela the no look feed every everything but the Finish from eni wanted eni to get that this place would have he red it he already proven that hes a crowd favorite a team favorite how about delich getting a little Fancy with his shots and his passes hes showing off isnt he showing Applause out thats the story from Sam Houston Wilkerson couldnt buy a bucket today delich with the quarterback heave all the way to kante puts his arms up in the air to Signal a touchdown to the big fella k k giving the team the shoulder shrug I love it running the rim hard he plays so hard when he gets into the game I think thats why everybody loves him plays so hard he earned that bucket some big smile on his face Del showing off the court Vision here late Nick I well see how many assist he has he might be an assist leader two on the stat sheet in the assist column for seven points three of three from the floor mention hes going to be an important piece off the bench on whats really quickly turning into a deep pit panther Music roster I told you was to see you man so Nick 52 seconds left how do you see this pit team starting conference play what can they do to take their performance to the next level and really finish the year as one of the top few teams in the conference I think they have to look in a mirror look at what theyve done look at their resume from this noncon schedule and realize they are an elite team in ACC I think they can look at their what theyve done in non conference and say that honestly but just know youre going to get the best punch because of that youre going to get the best punch from every single team you play so starting January 1 when they see Cal they see Stanford maybe his records arent as strong as the other teams cant Overlook anybody in the ACCC so just know that theyre going to get the best punch from every single team they play and you saw Damen done there hes excited to get back Panthers are excited to have him back thats a guy who is an important piece on a number one seed in the NCAA tournament last season at Houston his minutes are going to be invaluable to this Panther roster as they get going with some tough in conference tests throughout this year I know Damen duns itching to get back hes one of the leaders of this team you know they know he has experience hes done it at Temple done it at Houston bringing a lot of impact to this team so far experienced guards who have played in the tournament very important for teams down the stretch theyre excited to get done back Applause as the time winds down in the Peterson Event Center the Panthers hang 110 on Sam Houston to close out their nonconference slate Nick awesome game was a final exam Sam Houston was the final exam of a great nonconference coach cable
