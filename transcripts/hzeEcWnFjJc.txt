whos been a struggle at times They lean heavily on Mai Ashton Langford Hey look they can get stuck in third gear offensively Those droughts they have theyre well documented This guy and Mai has to hunt his from the tip Here we go Whats the mindset going to be Bert Smith Tim Clockardy Tommy Moresy are officials tonight BC coming off a close loss Saturday to Duke Miami started 40 in conference play Theyre coming off that elite eight run but the Hurricanes lost for the first time in the ACC last Wednesday against Georgia Tech Their first game since then Isaiah Wong with his first touch into the paint Nearly turned it over Its tracked down by Nord Omir Shot clock down to 10 Omir the turnaround and he cannot get it to go Boston College battled through some injuries the first two months of the season Now starting to get healthy almost had the upset against the Blue Devils up at Kanti Forum over the weekend And Earl Grant still tinkering with the rotation to get his best players minutes keep everybody happy This is a team thats going to surprise some folks in conference play cuz you know why theyre going to compete Theyre going to work on every possession as Prince gets one to go early on Helix Bay has been huge for this group A dynamic piece hits the midrange Hes a freshman playing more minutes of late Wong from the baseline and able to draw the foul Its going to be on TJ Bigger Staff his first Expect a lot of that early yawn from Isaiah Wong Held to digits against Georgia Tech And what does he do in bounceback games when he has a dud He averages about 20 coming off of it So hes going to hunt his early on And here he does in isolation Wong coming off his worst game of the season You mentioned just six points one of 11 from the field 0 for eight from three And this tells you how good Miami is They did not play well offensively against Georgia Tech yet still almost won the game They had the lead in the final few minutes But thats the difference between just being a good team and being elite Elite would still find a way to win those And thats what Coach L is going to expect from his group He said We can throw away the missed shots We got to take care of the basketball We got to rebound Zachary almost turned it over and now we get a held ball Possession arrow to BC This is what BC wants early on I mean first 90 seconds crowd quiet have really no rhythm to this game And thats what Boston College likes They want this one to be physical one in the painted area place they feel like they can thrive Heres Zachary a dead eyee shooter a season ago His numbers from deep have fallen off Shot clock at five Bigger staff battling against Omir Lost it Miller the other way Kicks Popppler hits the three Wugga Popppler starts with Omir disciplined defensively Doesnt bite Doesnt get himself in early foul trouble off Baker staff They get the rebound then they run And they are so good in the open floor And Jim Larenga point to hammer it home to Omir Stay out of foul trouble Miami a much different team with him on the floor Langford backing down against Popppler Battles for the rebound And theres Omir Bodies just bounce off of Omir Looks like an edge rusher but obviously a highly skilled basketball player He moves men And Nigel Pack was held Will get a foul against BC Its Zachary You look at North Chad Omir Sunb Belt Conference player of the year Sunb Belt Conference defensive player of the year last year at Arkansas State Bowling ball shouldered Miami hasnt had a low post presence like him in a few years Heres Miller And Jordan Miller cannot finish from close which is rare Demar Langford whos been more of a facilitator this year His older brother Mai Ashton Langford and now a league bay Another rebound by North Chad Omir and a near turnover It comes to BC Loose ball and we get a whistle Jump ball Possession arrow swings to Miami This Kanes team Jordan not especially deep but their top six can go with anybody Yeah And and and itll be curious to see what that rotation looks like as the season progresses because there are guys on that bench whove lost some of their minutes to some guys whove come into the program but were capable pieces for a team that went to the Elite 8 last year So they have How about the feed by Omir finding popppler down low Hes got five Popppler A good job at the short corner making himself the receiver for the easy catch and the finish Jaden Zachary checked by Nigel Peek League Bay down low working on Popppler who tries to sell the charge and does so successfully And thats where League Bay as a freshman is going to grow and learn Hes got the advantage and physicality over Popppler So Poplers waiting for him to lower the boom and thats elite defensive anticipation Elite Bays got to learn to play within himself there and that will come Hes a young guy BC showing some fullcourt pressure Just some light stuff to shorten the shot clock here Here comes Miller now Nigel Pack who transferred from Kansas State First team all Big 12 last year Loose ball Pack able to recover up ahead to Miller Numbers popler screaming the hammer About the look from Jordan Miller Does not elect to go chest pass Bounce pass Step and toe for popppler to punctuate Hes got seven of Miamis eight Mai Ashton Langford over way off Bakerstaff for the follow TJ Bickerstaff did not have a field goal in 20 minutes against Duke In fact he only had two points in his last 36 minutes over two games prior to that basket Poppplers had the hot hand Cant get the home roll and the rebound by CJ Pñena division 2 transfer who actually began his career playing Nia ball cheering Good match up there Wong defending Mai Ashton Langford Now its Dear Langford Pñena for three Its good Thats tough And its almost like Miller wasnt expecting Pñena to pull from there but he has in his game Anthony Walker getting ready to check in for Miami We get a timeout 87 Hurricanes in the early going Wagga Popppler carrying the Canes

well against Norchad Omir who has struggled with staying on the court at times due to foul trouble and really be challenged because this is a Boston College team that will play through post because of his skill level his ability to pass it score from the inside outside as you mentioned So a lot of attention on Omir Can he play clean ball and post to get this offense kick started Post had 16 Saturday against Duke Just his third game back after a foot injury Catches it down low and right away able to draw the foul Tell you right now Matson got lucky distributing that basketball Poor decision but Kanes defenders had their back to him So somehow it snuck through to post Finds himself right away at the free throw line The foul is on Wugga Popppler Post from the Netherlands He and Rick Smith the two dunking Dutchmen Absolutely And with his return to the lineup what does it mean for BC It means that they have a calming presence during those scoring droughts Look a safety valve for any team when youre getting a defense up on you throw it down to the low post play through your big Boston College has one of those guys It also challenges Omir to go outside and defend a place hes not very comfortable Wong strong to the basket gets separation left it short put back not there BC currently on a 70 run Pñena against Walker cheering and its tracked down by Omir There havent been many clean possessions for the Canes offensively here This would be a nice place to get set run good action get a clean look start to develop that rhythm Heres your six minutes into the game and its kind of been no identity Wong to Popppler whos got seven of Miamis eight and he shuffled his feet Whats BC doing defensively Theyre not giving up any advantage Theyre making drivers meet at chess and theyre competing on the backboard And this is what we saw from Miami during the struggles against Georgia Tech A little bit loosey goosey with the basketball and giving the inferior team an opportunity to play with you And thats what weve seen early on They havent tallied a lot of turnovers but theres been a carelessness with the basketball early Mai Ashton Langford working on Benley Joseph sneaks underneath over Anthony Walker to score just comfortable and backing down and was able to keep help side away Turn over that shoulder away from it and finish Good execution oneonone play for the most skilled guy with the basketball for the Eagles Joseph whos been Miamis sixth man plays more than 20 minutes a game Now Wong on the drive Draws three Make a decision Walker hesitated Back to Wong Shot clock down to five Miami clears out for Wong Shot clock at two Contested shot and a dazzling brush stroke by Isaiah Wong Good defense just better offense I mean Maas Langford did everything he was supposed to defensively right there Langford just has to shrug and get back and try and play basketball offensively Now its Dear Langford looking for Madson and the tap in is good It might have been tapped in by Miller himself trying to corral that defensive rebound Joseph the crossover draws the defense kicks to Miller and the three rattles home Youll live with that if youre Boston College Miller is capable of shooting the three no question but he hovers around 31 So youll live with those shot opportunities and bear to the percentages Heres Madson the Cincinnati transfer away Wong pumps the brakes Popppler on the drive the dish Miller is fouled on the way up Couple dribble handoffs to allow them to play downhill Good execution from the Canes early on as they try to discover that rhythm Weve got a tight one here at Coral Games Gatorade Fit snorts Fitness starts from the inside out Get healthy real hydration and no added sugar artificial sweeteners or added colors

Grant in his second season as BCs head coach and he took over a program that has not been to the NCAA tournament since 2009 when Al Skinner was still the head coach This is still a program that is in a rebuild mode but there is a sense of optimism especially the way they finished last season They went on that great run in the ACC tournament lost to Miami in overtime Im going tell you right now Anish Coach Earl Grant is a star in the profession And I always look at coaches that take over programs in the first few years and say How do you gauge success Well do they have an identity This group has an identity meaning theyre going to defend Theyre going to try to turn you over but theyre not going to theyre not going to sacrifice too much and theyre going to compete Meanwhile Jim Larenga 12th season now at Miami Hes the Kanes alltime leader in wins and last month named a finalist for the Naymith Hall of Fame Call Coach Grant a star Coach Ls a legend I He is one of the guys on the sideline still doing it at an elite level elite 8 level if you will from a season ago But you walk away from Coach L and youre just smarter You just learn something He gives you a gym and he just walks away and makes you think the only coach coach L with a 100 plus conference wins in three different division one leagues or in a three three D1 schools that did it at George Mason and also did it at bowling green Its incredible And last year the elite 8 run for Miami the Canes had never advanced that far in the NCAA tournament And with the team that they have again depth may be an issue but with the guys they have offensively theyre going to be able to score on anybody Jim Larenga telling us the defensive piece is what he wants to see become a part of this teams DNA the rest of the year And theyre guarding and theyve improved there No question This is a balanced team but of course he wants to see them get better Pack for three Theyre waiting for consistency from Nigel Pack from deep 34 this year 44 a year ago That was his calling A new environment playing for a new team coming from Kansas State You know the performer he was there Hell get acclimated Its early but you see the firepower and so many different guys that can hurt you And hes also playing more point guard this year than he did last year Zachary backing down Joseph And the rebound pulled down by Pack Boston College has done for the most part a pretty good job getting back and taking away the transition A place that Miami is looking to get easy ones An unforced error by Benley Joseph Both these teams pride themselves on taking care of the basketball Rare turnover for a Miami team that averages only about eight a game It its bigger than just the giveaway because it takes you away from the ability to establish that rhythm and get this highpowered offense Seeing the ball go in the basket on consistent possessions it disrupts that and it gives Boston College that opportunity Coach Larenega wants more possessions than the opposition Its a simple game Its been a game of runs early on Miami now on an 80 run The long arms of Jordan Miller with the intercept Too long of a defense You cant make those type of passes Miller lines it up in and out Prince Albe and Post both missed time due to injuries Both still working their way back That one knocked away Madson able to recover Still plenty of time to shoot Zacharys really trying to work in that low block Guard trying to post up Post has his pass picked Beverly ahead of the pack accelerates to the basket Count it plus one An absolute blur this Kanes defense Swarming to the basketball like Pirata Miller at 67 able to start the break Beverly look the minutes have decreased from last year to this But yet still next man up mentality comes in and produces in the open floor And how about the substitution post just picked up his second He goes to the bench As soon as he exits guess who comes in for Miami Omir And this will be an interesting point Great observation there Nish Is this an opportunity where the Kane sees it and take full advantage with Omir offensively and also he can move some bodies on the defensive side here Rebounds start the break An 110 run for Miami Ashton Langford BCs leading scorer Alague Bay shaded by Miller Shot clock at five Alleg Bay wants help Instead hell shoot Blocked by Jordan Miller Joseph for three Back iron Offensive rebound A new 20 Its packed Hell step back from the corner and the fight for the rebound and good restraint there by Omir not committing the silly foul Thats what Jim Larenga wanted to get to him And I got to imagine coach Larenega also wants Omir to get a touch offensively on that low block with post not in Theres Omir battling for the rebound winning the battle Your big man and Omir is fighting Hes not fouling Reward the big man with a touch Keep him interested Hes got five rebounds without a point Averaging close to a double double this season 14 nine Hes got it in the low post against Bicker Staff And thats muscle Thats all it is because Bicker Staff was right there He said Okay Im going to play you to my chest Oh Oh Oh Okay It fell back Thats just leaning into that Godgiven strength And Omir makes him pay with the punishing layup The guy calling for BC radio three seats down from us used to do that a lot D Abrams was a problem Ali Bay the running hook short Another rebound by Omir Harlon Beverly the scoop and the score A timeout by Earl Grant Miami in the midst of a 150 run Miami discovered the transition game Beverly did it once Why

feel free on Twitter to hit me up and correct me because yall love doing that Uh Big 12 the top 10 teams with the toughest remaining schedules in college basketball first 10 Big 12 teams What does that tell you Yeah conference is deep and very competitive a lot of talent Pena puts an end to what was a 150 Miami run First field goal first points for BC in almost 6 minutes And in talking with the radio broadcast team and former star DA Abrams was telling us about you know BC last year would have 150 runs against them Theyve limited those Theyre back to giving up that kind of scoring drought Can they fight back here to close out this first half Shot clock down to four Miller short Now the issue for BC this season they really have not had any threepoint shooting a guy they counted on Freshman Donald Han the junior out for the season torn ACL Langford knocks down the jumper And then Zach hasnt been able to replicate his production from the outside from last year This is a team that in five league games shooting 24 from three Theyve only made on average four threes per game in those contests And some may ask well how does Zachary take that dip from the threepoint line And its very easy He snuck up on people last year Hes now at the top of the scouting report People are keenly aware of his ability and theyre going to try and cut off the head of that snake and see who else can beat you Now Maest Langford capable but he does a lion share of his work inside the arc as well So that threepoint line is not an asset for this team to overcome double figure deficits Here is Bigger Staff tallest player on the floor at 69 And BC turns it over again Thats five Wong drives stops Good ball rotation Miller working on Pñena Miller gets free Lefty layup No Tippen not there And a foul on the floor against BC That was a heck of a move from the Senui forward Standing him up Miller did hesitation to create devastation But then the buddy becomes a bear You got to finish after a move like that I thought he got too cute with that one hand finger roll that size Big fella go ahead and hook that thing Youre athletic enough He is so good inside the arc last year Shot 66 from twopoint range Popppler lost it No foul And now Zachary BC their offense at its best in transition Near turnover lays it in When its unsettled BC excels Langford did a phenomenal job of reading not giving up on the play Much like when a quarterback is fielding pressure a wide receiver keeps moving to make a catch He just cut right into the teeth of that defense made him a receiver easy lane Miller again spin cycle and he goes to the right hand Gifted player Jordan Miller just an an interchangeable piece Can guard one through five but has a knack for being around the basketball and scoring opportunities puts himself in a spot to win Millers got seven Pñena has knocked down a couple of threes And thats the other Langford brother Mai Ashton Langford getting in close DC has now hit its last four from the field Theres Popler He had seven of Miamis first eight has not scored since Wong gets separation leans in draws the contact and able to draw the foul Savvy veteran move by Isaiah Wong Its a bucket getter I mean thats what a bucket getter does He says Okay youre going to be afraid of my quick first step to attack And then watch he knows the balls going to come back to him but here were going to get Miller that spin cycle winning layup But Wong understood Okay theyre going to respect me from three cuz theyre scared I so I can drive it Let me get him up in the air and lean into it that Demar Langford who picked up his first You could tell by the reaction as soon as he stepped in he knew he stepped into a Fox trap Thats the worst feeling too And theyre rewarding those threepoint shooters as long as youre not flopping because we know what the penalty is there now But Wong understood its in slow motion defender when youre up in the air like that cuz youre coming down and you know inevitably youre catching a shooters body Thats like when somebody agrees to a game of three card monty Gotcha Yes exactly Wong an 83 free throw shooter Tested the draft waters in the off season He is one of four starters for Miami this season who has a 30point game in their career Thats what this offense so dangerous Not fun to guard And going back to Isaiah Juan we talked about his playmaking ability coming into the broadcast his willingness to be a passer Its because the next level those those scouts want to see can okay he can score it but can he make others around him better as a distributor Youre going to have to have that in the bag as a pro And he showcased that this first half of the season Kai Ashton Langford to his brother Demar When you turned on the tape for Miami how quickly did you notice Wongs vision and his improved ability there It it stood out because the first few years of his career bucket just would get the ball and wired to score the talent around him Hes become more comfortable with understanding I can make those plays cuz theyll complete them But he still does that He still can get to the cup at 62 Deceptively quick deceptively athic but a great finisher But he has more trust in his teammates now So youre seeing the complete play Wong has eight already shaking off the worst game of his season Jamar Langford the drive and kick Zachary thought about the three Passed it up Shot clock at seven Mai Ashton Langford over one tear drop Ill tell you where the Canes have struggled here in this first half and why they havent been able to separate like they want to Their perimeter defense has not been good Theyre not keeping guys in front This perimeter for BC is challenging the defensive acumen of the Canes and theyre winning by getting to the painted area time and time again Miller launches and hits Second to three for Jordan Miller Hes got 10 to lead all scores Lets see if the Eagles continue to drive with the Langford brothers Its worked Theyve made six in a row down low Pñena against Wong using his size No but a foul The Kane starting to create some separation Isaiah Wong hesitation gets to the cup with his dominant hand on the left side But Wong defensively cant keep Mica Ashford from the float game Gatorade fit fitness starts from the inside out singing Get healthy real hydration music and no

your free hearing evaluation Miami and BC came into this game as the worst threepoint shooting teams in the ACC but that has not been the case tonight Yeah but you know what it is though Ill tell you Anish the percentages I mean four of six for Miami from beyond the arc two of four from BC Theyre taking good ones And for Jordan Miller whos feeling it early on I mean hes a 31 threepoint shooter but hes being challenged there Its part of his game he wants to showcase and hes capable and so these are good looks that are resulting in makes Miller has been impressive in this first half Hes on the defensive end Hes knocked down shots from the outside and hes been a facilitator Yeah stuff a stat sheet one time He did everything Popppler for three And that is 10 points for Popppler The most hes ever scored in an ACC game Miami with its largest lead of the night Ashton Langford guarded by Wong Good recovery on the screen by Miami Now its Pñena Five to shoot Ashton Langford down the lane Gets past Wong The tip in is not there by Mlakton But again Ashton Langford finding lanes to get to the rim Thats got to be something shorted up in the second half Nigel pack catch and release Youre already dealing with a loaded group with offensive weaponry The one place where you feel like youre not going to get burned as a threepoint line but the Canes everything coming up Meanwhile BC misses at the rim again Miami looking to run Here comes Popler Omir on Pña That mismatch and Omir the gentle drop in Felt like a little dream shake A a hat tip to to Hakee Elijah Completely stood up the defender frees him and finish him Miamis had a 150 run in this half Now in the midst of an 110 run Final 35 seconds Pñena down low and he is fouled by Popppler who almost slammed the ball Showed some restraint How about air right here Thats oneonone basketball and a little dream shake Ah finishes at the cup Its just an impressive move from a very skilled big undersized but a bull Popppler picked up his second Omirs only picked up one foul in this first half And he comes to the bench Jim Larenga recognizing that Doesnt want to risk any foul trouble for his big guy who may not be the leading scorer on this team He might be the most indispensable player on the team Hes a presence I mean hes a presence He rebounds in traffic Good outlets to start the break back to the basket score Hey he moves bodies Hes a disruptor About a two second differential between game clock and shot clock Isaiah Wongs got eight points four from the free throw line Shot clock down to six BC pressing out Wong on the triple drive Lost it and its BC ball and time expires in the first half It is Miami with a 4328 lead The Hurricanes six out of eight from three They came into the game shooting just 26 from three in league games In conference BC lost to Duke twice Last time out a onepoint defeat also lost to Syracuse BC has wins against Virginia Tech and Notre Dame Miami only has one loss in league play that came last Wednesday to Georgia Tech Eagles throw it inside to begin and Omir picks up his second foul 9 seconds into the second half And and its the right call I mean these are the plays that Coach L is trying to eliminate from Omir You dont need to try to squeeze in and make that deflection Look how far Bicker Staffs pushed off the block Youve won Let him make the catch and just defend Up and under No good Bicker staff there for the follow Light pressure from BC Jordan Miller 10 points five assists in that opening half for Miami Pat knocked down a couple of shots from the outside Sends it inside and thats too easy for North Chad Omir Alague Bay Zachary keeps it in bounds Good look down low Demar Langford with great position Just a good flash from Bicker Staff to that mid post area to catch Collapse the defense Dump down for an easy layup Unselfishness for an easy one Pack doubled looking to shake Zachary Zachary working defensively right there Back to work on Vicker staff and a foul is called It is on Omir That is his third So two quick ones early in the second half And thats been the issue for North Chad Omir all season Thats a wrong call That was a wrong call That was a moving defender in Bicker Staff You almost look at that and say did he flop And I think theyre going to take that look And thats what Jim Larenga is furious about right now Yeah that that is not the proper call And its going to go Larenegas way for voicing his displeasure He will be the one who receives the recipient of that tech Yeah he gets a technical foul Mai Ashton Langford to the line and for Boston College Omirs now picked up two quick fouls He get the technical This is an entry point back into the game Yeah it should be the other way It should have been not only not a charge but a flop which warrants a free throw on the other side in the tank That Thats not the right call So Omir heads to the bench Anthony Walker checks in The Miami lead is 11 And if theres minor wins youre looking at for BC to try to climb back Only down 11 having Omir saddled with that foul trouble Lets see when BC brings Post back into the game He only played a little more than five and a half minutes in the first half He had two fouls Langford over Popppler And BCs outscored Miami 82 out of the break This is what BC does Theyre lingerers They hang around and they fight And thats the coach Grant squad that arrives every night to play Theyre not going to give up Theyre going to hang around Theyre going to compete Wong puts it on the floor Dribble drive Fall away Got it Langfords right there Anish hes doing what hes supposed to Thats twice Thats twice Wong has made a high degree of difficulty shot with a player draped right all over him Thats why I say hes one of the best scorers not in the conference in the country He really no matter what you do sometimes he wins Zachary not there in a foul Its against BC Its on Langford Dear Langford his second Im sitting here thinking too much dribbling Walt get rid of the basketball Langfords recovering Hes right there to contest High release point Defender in his face Dont matter Give me two Hes more than a scorer Hes a premium shot maker You think about late game situations end of shot clock situations Have a guy like that Here comes Zachary the other way Hes got a trailer knocked away by Pack Miami numbers the other way Popler lost it And there goes the break Now its one Catch and shoot Three is good 13 for Isaiah Long Wong salvaging what appeared to be almost a broken transition opportunity It was a pretty basketball but it results in a a shot maker getting a look from the baseline Active hands to active as Pack picks up his first foul So there was also a push in the back to get Mai Ashley Legford out of the play by Popppler Popppler also double dribbled on the play and then he ultimately finds Isaiah Wong So comedy of errors leads to three Miami already has picked up Three fouls here in the second half Ashton Langford against Wong Maybe those two go back and forth BCs finding pathways to attack the rim and finish And thats where Miamis got to be better keeping those perimeter drivers from getting to that painted area cuz BC aint hing three So you can play off these guys a little bit Make them meet chest on the drives Pack gets separation Miller cant get the tip Here comes the bigger staff Here comes BC pushing Ashton Langford lost it Itll stay with the Eagles The Miami lead is 12 Now if Im a transition defender for the Canes to reiterate that point when the balls coming the other way Im running back to the painted area Im protecting the castle there Im not worried about the threepoint because again BC is the worst threepoint shooting team in the conference Dont worry about them out there Theyre attacking Protect the painted area if youre the Canes That has to be the thought Earl Grant has said We play paintball Ashton Langford down the lane for two Too easy Playford is a long guard

special teams How do you respond when you get knocked down And youre seeing a pretty good response offensively from Miami Now theyve had some of those careless turnovers that they could get rid of Defensively they do need to be better but what youve seen is some pretty good execution offensively At least those numbers there being highlighted Yeah 62 from the field as well BC shot it well is also as Mai Ashton Langford drives in Hes got 14 to lead all scorers And Miami has not had an answer for a drive from number 11 And you know what I love Zero for zero from the threepoint line Hes just challenging and saying You keep me from getting to the rim You havent shown me yet Wong answers at the other end Those two have been the high men for their team 15 for Wong Zachary 0 for five tonight Bicker staff down low and two more for BC The Miami lead down to eight once again And its playing out real time Beautifully illustrated right there Why Omir getting in foul trouble devastates the interior defense from the Canes That just allows a body and an easy finish for Bicker Staff down low Are you surprised Post isnt out there for BC a little bit Im curious whats going on there Is he not 100 Is it a health thing I know he got in that early foul trouble but as talented as he is it doesnt look like hes even close to returning to this game Dear Langford no interior presence Boston College having their way in the painted area and BC telling this Kanes defense hey dont watch me watch TV cuz if youre going to get stuck watching a ball like this Imma cut right in your face Dear

prime time Bucks heat on ABC an East Rout Jordan cornet here in World Gables And we got a close one Why Because Boston College is doing exactly what coach Grant wanted paintball music And its been Mai Ashton Langford whos done a lion share of it challenging the perimeter defense of the Canes winning music time and time again 30 points in the paint for the Eagles And thats why they trail by two possessions only six And they have brought their big man back into the game Quinton Post the sevenfooter Omir with the three fouls back in for Miami Got you They missed his presence down low But now hes a little bit handcuffed in how he plays cuz on the catch theyre going to try and draw charges up and under Omir with a nice move BC had trimmed the lead down to six after being down 15 at halftime Now its back to eight and eight points eight rebounds for North Chad Omir closing in on his seventh double double of the season And a hat tip to Harlon Beverly whos come into this game again a guy whos seen his minutes decrease this season but hes been used Hes been ready throughout this game Every time theyve gone to him hes made some key plays First miss of the half for Ashton Langford Beverly last year only played in four games had a back injury and Miami is shorthanded in terms of size No AJ Casey tonight out with a shoulder injury Beverly shot fake Now its Wong Whips it corner The three by Joseph is good Thats the vision that you talked about at the start of the broadcast from Isaiah Wong And thats why I love working with you partner because you listen to me and you see it yourself We look right at each other distributor getting the extra look the best look because Wong had a decent look but Joseph had an elite look and thats where his game has evolved as Demar Langford gets the easy finish Jim Laren telling us as a freshman Wong tunnel vision as a sophomore found his confidence It Its interesting when you stay with one program over the course of four years player development Is that Isnt that amazing Its so weird Stick around with the program Play for a guy who knows what the hell hes doing You get better and youre a better off player for the next level when that time comes Miller has a shot blocked trapped fighting for it down low and calls a timeout to salvage the possession with 12 seconds on the shot clock Will step aside Isaiah Long not just a score Shoot it Oh no no no Im not going to shoot it Im getting my teammates involved They call him Benz Hes driving like one right now with the three No Want him Ooh I like him Quick the quicker picker uper

be heavy screening right here If youre Boston College switch everything You dont have to worry about guarding a dribble drive or a mismatch Its going to be a catch and shoot Switch everything Take away any clean look from a shooter Beverly the lob to Miller that does not hit the rim and a shot clock violation BC down by as many as 15 at halftime Has cut the lead to nine They got as close as six What has been the catalyst for this comeback comeback has been that BC has just challenged the Kanes perimeter defense and theyre taking him off the bounce Theyre getting to the rim Its been a lot of Maash Langford and now post back in the game but maybe a little cold and isnt able to finish at point blank range You got to make that one at a great look Miller down low Omir goes to work on post Help defense by Bickerstaff And here comes BC Demar Langford Post knocked down two threes against Duke Almost traveled and turned it over So backtoback possessions Post had a chance to make a play Misses a layup and then turns it over And Post is a trailer capable of stepping into that three I would have liked to see him take the first offering Then when he drove it and Amirs in his sights draw a fourth foul from Omir Embraced the contact Elected to do neither and the Canes now possess the basketball Miscommunication between Omir and Miller and a turnover for Miami I thought Bigger Stack might have touched the basketball there but made my eyes deceiving The two Langford brothers have combined for 28 Zachary And theres Jaden Zachary His first basket his first points of the game Thats it in a nutshell right there Just boom boom Barrel into you challenge you No resistance easy finish And remember Jaden Zachary was the catalyst down the stretch for Notre Dame 10 of his 14 coming late to pull away from an Irish team thats struggling Can he be a key cog in these final 10 minutes here Wong for three Bingo 18 on six of seven shooting for Isaiah Wong Efficient Is there such a thing as a quiet 18 cheering Its quiet I I mean I I just feel like hes not forcing anything here tonight Yeah thats fair Coming off a one for 111 game last time out Beverly takes it away from Langford Working the sideline DOWN LOW TO MILLER WHO FINISHES Wasnt the most fluid jam but it got the job done Its two You cant do it What are you doing judging Can you dunk cheering Give me to stand on post down low for the twohanded flush laughter The old line from Archimedes Give me a place to stand and I can move the earth Youre brilliant Youre brilliant Ill tell you what though Harlon Beverly has been a differencemaker Embracing his role tonight Hes one who pushed it on the break made the proper decision to set up Miller for uh what you would deem a questionable dunk He dunkked Sheena WONG AGAIN The 21 for Isaiah Wong cheering His 22nd 20point game third against BC in his career cheering Theres Beverly defense on Langford tipped into the air Omir wins the battle Here comes Wong Hes got the hot hand Wong pulls up lets it go Oh the crowd got to its feet Wong has it knocked away THREEON TWO FOR BC LANGFORD HELLO screaming Thatll be a way to put the butts right back in the seats here in Coral Gables Omir working on post back to Wong and hell play it back out to Beverly 10 to shoot Harland Beverly against Post Nothing Demar Langford baseline drive over Wong Yes sir 18 for Demar Langford Mai Ashton Langfords got 14 BC not going away Well Isaiah Wong got the crowd up on their feet with the triple And they say two a dunk is only two points but not when it happened LIKE THIS DIY DO IT

SECOND NOT until Demar Langford came with the one hand jelly Hes had himself a season high 18 points here Nine of 12 Efficient like his brother Five dimes They moved him to point about four or five games ago And as a handler this team has had a different look Hes been scoring the basketball tonight Anish 18 six of seven in the second half 12 of his 18 have come after halftime We come up on eight minutes to go and a foul on Bigger Staff his second Only the second team foul on BC And I think if you asked coach Larenega hed take issue with that low tally for BC defensively Post to the bench for BC Omir in there with the three fouls Theres Benley Joseph Mason Madson another threepoint shooter in there for BC Omir working down low and hes in double figures with 10 And hes got his seventh double double as a Miami Hurricane And the Canes cant get bored with that When its that easy to dump down to a bull who can finish keep feed be gluttonous down low Beverly again his defense tonight has been a subplot and a big reason Miami is winning You said the perimeter defense hasnt been great Hes made a difference when hes been in the game Active hands another guy good size at the guard spot good length and those deflections have keyed run outs that have been huge for the Canes to sustain their lead Jordan Id imagine thats not easy to do Harlon Beverly when he came to Miami big time recruit expected to have a big role as Omir misses the dunk but draws the foul you import some transfers your role diminishes he had the injury last year but to see a guy like that embrace his role on the team instead of hey Im going to go somewhere else you just dont see that all that much these days in college basketball yeah its a belief in the program its the selfless nature of the young man but of the ideals of the program and him much like Anthony Walker another piece on this roster that you know guys that were used to playing heavy minutes playing for a really good team last year that have seen that role diminish but understanding its a long season you never know when your number is going to be called Beverly who gets minutes sparingly throughout the season has been huge tonight and that will show up on film tomorrow and beyond it and making the case for more minutes going forward Its a 12point Miami lead It was 15 at halftime Post setting the screen McLockton 21 for BC Has been an X factor Hasnt played a whole lot tonight Demar Langford elevates and scores Langford having himself a game Three off a careerhigh Hes got 20 Millers been quiet in the second half and Ashton Langford rebounds the miss pushing off the window Offensive rebound Mlakton battle for the ball Its Mlakton Here comes Langford down the lane Kicks to Madson Three on the way Good BC refusing to away We saw this Saturday against Duke All grit just a refusal to give up on the play generating second chance opportunity and a rare three in the most timely of manners Thats why Madson was imported from Cincinnati Make a Skyline Chile reference and degrade it and well have an issue here Haron Beverly from the outside I dont have anything good to say about Skyline so Im just going to leave it at that Well I know you have a lot of good things to say about Harlem Beverly again knocking down making a play offensively this time knocking down the three Hes been all over the place making plays Mockton is making an impact since checking in And we get a whistle down low Hey heres the fight you see from Boston College Then ultimately Mets and getting the three ball to keep with this thing But its been punched and theres been a counter punch from the Canes Harlon Beverly whos shown up all over the place making plays Bangs down a three right there The Canes have made a living off the threepoint line tonight 11 of 16 Its incredible Out of bounds on Miami So BC ball Mockton missing the bunny and it will go to Miami How many layups has BC missed right at the rim tonight You got to complete the play if youre MLK but its inexcusable for the Canes to allow somebody to cut right in front of you when the utmost importance is protecting the goal Kanes nodded one on layups tonight He is only 12 of 23 Some of them arent contested Some of them you just got to finish Omir off the feed from Joseph who does the goggles Its a heck of a Thats a heck of a delivery I dont know how he was able to thread the needle there Post thought about it Drives down the lane Crowd wanted to walk The basket counts Well they shouldnt Its the Euro step That was all within rule And hes from Amsterdam And we get a foul along the baseline on Ashton Langford Benley Joseph What What a look Bounce pass evades the defender The long Quinton post and the punctuation from Omir Joseph similar role to last year when he backed up Charlie Moore They call him a sixman but coach says he gets starter minutes I look at him as a starter Hes their best on ball defender but hes a point who delivers first and sets guys up Look no further than that delivery to Omir sophomore from Arlington Massachusetts And Omir another rebound a new 20 We come up on 420 to play in regulation Beverly to Wong Had a careless turnover by Miami star senior Wong wanted to make a play before the ball got there A little bit eager That cost him one This is this youre at a crossroads here Youre about to get to the under four BC wants to cut this thing back to single digits Running out of time This possession large Zachary passed on the three Drives Great defense No foul by Omir Beverly That Omir presence was the one that was lacking that allowed all those points in the paint Hes returned Harland Beverly playing his best game of the season 10 points four assists Hes done it on the defensive end as well I can go ahead guarantee Coach L will be heaping praise on one of his role guys whos been a star tonight Now we get a whistle A double foul was called Omir his fourth post his third will step aside 350 to go in regulation Miami by a dozen Ever wonder why they call it the American dream and not the American goal or plan Maybe its because in dreams you can do anything In dreams you can hold your entire world in the palm of your hand and turn time inside out again and again And you can do it all with your eyes wide open Gatorade Fit Fitness starts from the music inside Get healthy real hydration and no added sugar artificial

coming back Poshmark is the perfect side hustle music Theres so much I can sell Bags clothes and even electronics Its so easy I can list in 60 seconds or less I cant imagine a better side hustle music So a double foul was called on the two postmen Quinton Post and Nord Chad Omir Thats three on post four on Omir And then following that a technical foul issued against BC head coach Earl Grant Yeah Earl Grant engaged a little bit with one of the really good refs here in college basketball frustration happens but got into it a little bit uh Smith and uh earned himself a tech there And I get the frustration Uh both guys I feel like both coaches have been frustrated times tonight with the whistle I thought its been a pretty fair call tonight but obviously you got Oakran who did not like what transpired down here and felt like the arm to his big in post warranted a quicker reaction and a stronger whistle perhaps Wong hits one out of two on the technical 7663 And now for BC the threepoint struggles really get highlighted Youre toward the end of the game youre down double digits and you havent been a good threepoint shooting team all season Post backing down over and thats the plays got four fouls and Post went right after him And thats something if youre this Eagles team you wish youve had throughout the game Early foul trouble from post for whatever reason Coach Grant elected to keep him on the bench Hasnt seen the minutes hes accustomed to seeing Maybe health related Dont know But thats what he provides when hes on the floor The ability to score it like that Only his fourth game back after missing the first 13 with a foot injury Omir puts it on the floor Joseph shot clock at zero He got it off It hits the rim Omir the offensive rebound A new 20 Huge for Miami An uncanny ability to rebound in traffic because of the strength Miller down low Count it I say it time and time again about Jordan Miller The guy just has a magnetism about the basketball He puts himself in positions as a receiver garnered the attention by pointing up to the sky at 67 for Beverly to find him And again Haron Beverly a winning play distributing the ball to Miller to get a very crucial basket to extend the lead to 13 Now one of the questions for Miami their depth and if Harland Beverly can start to be a contributor like hes been tonight it just gives Jim Larenga one more arrow in that quiver Absolutely But you keep him engaged and and hes clearly been engaged because when hes come out those minutes have been productive ones Dear Langford strong Beverly fighting for the rebound Loose ball Ashton Langford has it He gets tied up and a foul is called Its starting to get a little chippy here in the last under three minutes Officials are going to really have to be cognizant of that to the close 5050 basketball winning time Guys are going to really lay it all out there Just want to see this one end amicably Thats always of most importance Sixth team foul on Miami So BC in the bonus from here on out Ashton Langford uncontested Joseph That pass was knocked down by Demar Langford Now Beverly would tend to shoot on Pñena to the rim Harlon Beverly once again its been incredible What a boost that young man has provided from scoring to defending to distributing Hes checked all the boxes Pñena for three It doesnt go Wong able to come up with it Up ahead Its Beverly lines it up AND IT ROLLS IN THAT KIND OF night for Harland Beverly Aston Langford in attack mode Nothing there And Miami can see the end line as Miller is fouled by Dear Langford A one and one for the Canes The lead is 17 You cant say enough about what you saw tonight from Harland Beverly Number five out here playing like a fivestar doing everything for this group Isaiah Wong always has his eyes up Harland Beverly youre thinking Hey just hold up You dont need it But its been that kind of night for him They touched every part of the rim and decided to go on through the net In 19 minutes off the bench Beverly 15 points five assists two steals six of seven from the field and he made both of both of his Miami has a team 12 of 17 from threepoint range just one game after going five of 32 Impressive stuff And of of the questionable times where feel like the Canes didnt defend to the ability they can allowing some of these drives and finishes at the rim it has not been Harlon Beverly thats allowed his man to beat him at least that I can recall throughout tonight And thats been the difference down the stretch BC made a little run got to within single digits You bring Beverly into the game the defense goes up a notch Absolutely Provided a heck of a lift 120 to go Mai Ashton Langford out of control Alleg Bay off the shot fake Hes been quiet and a jump ball possession arrow to BC as Joseph got tied up 113 to go Miami on its way to going to five and one in the ACC You were telling me before the game you feel this Kanes team is the best team in the ACC Why Yeah check with me before you say the things on the broadcast so Im comfortable agreeing with them But this is what I will ride with This is what Im comfortable with Yes they are Do you I think you agree with me a little bit in this one And I say that theyre the best team in the ACC because this team is built to go far in March Theyve got veteran players who understand coachs vision Their transfers have fit in seamlessly and their balance They can score better they than they can defend but they can guard Where they must be is when they play physical teams they have to be more physical They adjusted in the second half and thats why theyre about to go on a win by 20 plus tonight 19 points now for Jordan Miller Bigger staff over What Jim Larenga loves about this team he has so many guys who can carry you on a given night We know what Isaiah Wong can do Nigel Pack is capable Jordan Miller is capable Omir is capable And then today you get the production from Harlon Beverly Early on Wugga Popppler scored seven of the first eight points Its a team that has great weapons and a team that continues to get better as we get a shot clock violation But as Jim Larenga cautioned us during shootound today hey were only at halftime of the season Youre judged ultimately on what happens in March Yeah absolutely And understanding that you cant get too high or too low in the season because its a long one and youre trying to play into the end of March This groups focused They looked a part of a a a team thats 16th in the nation Quite possibly a lot better than that Impressive to win in conference Impressive to be this dominant in the second half against a BC team thats known for quality defense
