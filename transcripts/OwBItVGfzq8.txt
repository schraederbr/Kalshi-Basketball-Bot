for NC State head coach Kevin Keats tonight here in valano Arena Reynolds Coliseum and the tip is one by Ben Middlebrooks Inc state in the home white the throwback uniforms with stayed in red across the chest first touch for Styles he looks to drive Sparrow nearly turned it over and they do turn it over as Hill stepped on the sideline not surprised State start a game off early in a two3 Zone they notice n State hasnt been shooting the great as of late so why not try to go with a two3 Zone to try to trip them up early Cameron Brown bringing the ball up handling the point guard duties he have to play against NC States pressure as they turn it over bounce pass by Peter aduro picked off by the point guard for NC State Michael oconnell Marcus Hill fouled This Time by Cameron Sparrow get a look at the starting five for NC State coming off a nice win they start their ACC play one and0 an overtime win over Florida State looking to carry that momentum into this game and then not to look ahead KC but theyre at Kansas on Saturday thats a g its essential for them to sharpen the night as much as possible for heading to Kansas middle Brooks going to work on oduro and theres Styles couple of chances for NC State nothing falling we played one minute here Toby n DOI and Sparrow gets the games first basket Cameron Sparrow the sophomore from Baltimore part of a great Freshman Class A year ago for the Eagles made to the all rookie team in the Mak last year one thing with cop State running the two3 Zone NC State is going to have opportunities to shoot shots Thats essential for them to make them if they want to stay in the game andc state has not shot the ball particularly well from three so far this year so it appear they might see Zone a bit this Applause Music season Eagles 0 and 10 but not untested against ACC opponents he started the season at Wake Forest as Sparrow is short on the three also at Virginia and at Miami so this their fourth ACC game one thing NC is trying to do is theyre trying to beat the Zone its essential for them to try to beat it to get easy opportunities another three from Hill still nothing Fallen big two in rebounded by middle grooks Applause Music and we got a whistle I think this is going to be on Styles an ice cold start for NC State of five from the floor one thing we can expect from NC State is for them to attack the glass on the offensive end one thing Kevin Keats loves this second and third opportunities keeping the offense alive thats the thing C state in his Zone its going to be a lot tough for them to rebound out of that zone Cameron Brown another basket for coffin State and a nice start for the Applause Eagles theyll show a little pressure as well with nooi Hill throws out of the Trap good look opposite by Middlebrooks maybe a run out kie Horton Euro Step wave it off he was fouled first on the point guard o Connell and those are a of shots youre going to get tonight if youre Inc state in that two3 zone essentially C state is giving up the open three and living with it and hopes that it goes in their favor nothings Fallen yet so coach Keats going to bring on a number of Subs Ron pass Dennis Parker Jr Trey Parker and Brandon Huntley Hatfield so a new four only oconnell who just picked up the foul stays out there this is nzi who played against NC State last year when he was at Maryland Eastern Shore last Touch by The Eagles officials tonight Bill cumington Jr Tony Padilla and Adam Applause Fu I expect cin to stay in this two three zone until we see NT State Mak shots Applause 0 of seven Ron pass who hadit a couple of Threes late shot clock threes at that in the win over Florida State cant hit this time Brown impeded by Parker thats Trey Parker and the Freshman picks up his first teams third and ellerby going to come into the game along with Jonathan Dunn so some good Sid coming in couple of six seven Wing players as Sparrow and Horton out fans still filing in here good crowd tonight in the Heritage game as you would expect but three and a half minutes no points yet for NC State and a layup for the Eagles its oduro nearly a turnover from oconnell whos been one of the nations best in terms of assistant turnover ratio this year first touch Hunley Hatfield looking to get established and a reach in foul thatll be two on o Connell so nothing fallen for NC State and now the guy that that orchestrates the offense just picked up his second that might be a huge loss for NC State Michael Connell has to decrease the pressure especially in this first half now Casey this is pretty rare isnt it two fouls in the first half typically coach Keats is going to make us up but this is maybe a sign of trust in his fifth year senior point guard yeah I believe he trusts Miche o Connell Mike knows how to play with two fouls early in the first half I expect him to come out in a soon in a near future yeah Hill just went over to the scorer table throw it away Dennis Parker Jr throws ahead OK conell cant take him out yet cuz hes going to the free throw line when we come back Cen State off to his six nothing starts and the Zone doing wonders against the wolf pack here at the under 16 as we would like to thank North State R for being tonights game sponsor experience ranking the way it should be at Northstate Bank visit Northstate bankcom to learn more the caterpillar scholar aving program would like to thank Marcus Tyson Marcus is a member of the wrestling team and has maintained a 30 GPA in the classroom congratulations Marcus on your academic and athletic achievements and thanks to pill for their support of the St athlete program Music Music oh Music Music Applause Music Music Music thats a great start for C State 6 nothing here on the road in Reynolds Coliseum and their second year head coach is Larry Stewart one of the best players in copen State history took him to the 1990 CAA tournament went on to have great success in the NBA Des might be an undrafted name to the all rookie team you see was a copen state 1988 to 1991 which is a pretty cool tie in as okell puts NC State on the board with the free throw is that the very first meeting between NC State and coffen state was right here on this floor back when it was the regular home of NC State mens basketball December 1988 his freshman year played here with copin State against NC State and NC State team by the way that had five Pros on it including Chris gani Rodney Monroe Chucky Brown Tom glia Brian Howard all on that team dun gets the layup and right now C state has been able to get to the rim a few times Cas thats something that c state is doing theyre attacking the basket trying to get easy looks at The Rim yes they are 0 and 10 but again this their fourth ACC opponent so talk about you know coming in there are no nerves uh when youre facing your fourth ACC team and theyve been in these types of environments before backing down backing down still no field goals Brion pass looking to draw a foul another offensive rebound Parker does draw the foul and finally a field goal goes in for NC State much needed by NC State getting multiple opportunities at The Rim strong move by Trey Parker to complete it Dennis Parker J kept it alive so that stops kind of like the story for cin state right NC State started 0 of 10 from the floor got to keep going freshman from fville missing the free throw that was an issue for NC State a couple of games go SEC ACC challenge against Texas the wol back team shooting just better than 30 from three nothing going down yet as sparrow elevates and hits took advantage of what the defense gave him had gambled trying to get a steal in that play it led to an easy opportunity for cop stay at the Music basket Parker again with oconnell having the two fouls and theres Brion pass in the corner and thats what he can provide in his senior season a good threepoint shooter big shot by Brown pass something that thats something that NC State is going to have is those threepoint opportunities tonight good find for erby as both Parker and Hunley Hatfield a hand Applause up copin state is taking advantage of NC States pressure theyre guarding him closer to the half cour line and theyre taking full advantage of it same spot same shot for pass this time it rims out Parker Jr cleans up and Coach Stewart is not pleased with his team on the defensive glass he will call it timeouts 128 Eagles Applause Music but they got they got to grab a rebound Music C state has made it last four shots but on the other end for timeout called by coach Stewart because his team has already conceded five offensive rebounds and Casey other than that theyve been pretty much perfect tonight but as NC state has missed shots that defensive stop doesnt count until you grab that rebound and thats something that Im sure Larry stos emphasizing in his huddle is to finish possessions I mean theyre doing a decent job with guard State on the initial action its all about finishing for this cop State team Zary Harrison has come in back up point guard to Camron Brown Big Show by Dennis Parker Jr switches off Sparrow it tipped out of his hand Horton a three and an offensive rebound first for the Eagles and now Cameron SP is going to go to line hes already got four points this is a a c and State team playing hard playing inspired just looking for that first win of the Season just has more energy seems like theyre attacking the rim trying to get second and third opportunities at The Rim theyre under siiz so thats the only way they can stay in it is through their Applause energy now number two they gave Wake Forest a pretty good game in the opener but as and keep in mind this is a team that went 2 and 27 last year right but as the the ow and one two three starts to add up it starts to become more of a story they just playing through it looking to get that first win of the Season what a story it be if they get one here well enough so far sixpoint lead s minutes into this game done called for a foul trying to get through middle Brooks is doing a solid job on the defensive end as I mentioned earlier one thing Larry St emphasized during that timeout is to block out and finish the possessions I expect them to make that adjustment this is Paul mcneel Parker a three who is online too strong Applause Music so coach Keats putting in mcneel Jr here just to see he is known as the best shooter on the team as Middlebrooks left his feet that led to the foul against Harrison so when youre having shooting struggles right therere just three of 15 to start why not try to go to mcneel Jr who has not played a ton just six total points on the year but perhaps he can provide a Applause score cop state is taking advantage of NC States pressure Harrison had a mismatch on that play and decided to take to break down mid mid middle Brooks try to move him away from the basket so he had room to operate there he goes one and two out state has led this the whole way State just looking for some Rhythm offensively they turn it over this is dun cant finish around the rim and the rebound taken by Harrison no look to Dunn for the flush C state is just playing hard theyre playing hard theyre having fun having fun and theyre confident this two three Zone has produced great results for C short Corner jumper Styles and Middlebrooks with an easy Music one got to say though a little surprised in a Zone thats got to be McNeil shock that he turned down I know I know they got a decent shot from Styles there too but and theyre going to have those opportunities to shoot they got to shoot in their Rhythm and have that confidence thatll be the second foul on dun but he gets a little punctuation here the Eagles often flying early in Applause Music Raleigh back with KY more now on Andrew Sanders here in Reynolds Coliseum Goin state with a sevenpoint advantage and theyve done it despite allowing NC State really to get to the offensive last it hasnt mattered NC State shooting just 24 meanwhile the Eagles 64 they been get good looks theyve been putting a lot of pressure on the room taking advantage of NC States pressure I expect popping to stay in this two or stay in this one two two zone for as long as possible pass has knocked down the only three so far for ANC State Styles offensive recycle by Applause mcneel free throw line jumper and another offensive rebound middle Brooks looking to do it Applause himself great job by Ben middle Brooks timing the ball off the rim to keep the offensive possession alive for the wol pack practiced against this guy he doesnt seem like hed be easy to box out hes one of the toughest between him and DJ Burns they were tough and M Brooks hits the free throw that allowing C state to set up its pressure copin state so far three turnovers but they havent come in line ball situations where NC State could really pish in the Fast Break where theyre third best in the country in that category we got a kick ball here by middle Music BRS on the defensive end NC State is trying to speed up C State as much as possible by increasing the pressure I expected them to throw a couple double teams anything to throw the defense off the do Z cant finish over middle Brooks and thats a foul on Applause Harrison fou number zero talked about in the open that Styles starting to become a goto option as number 10 Marcus Hill Rana 23 points against Florida State thats a season High not just for Hill but for anybody on this team and get this hes shooting a little better than 54 that number would lead the ACC but hes one field goal shot you got to have enough shot right hes one shot shot so pretty impressive usually you think about guys that are going to lead the league and shooting its early but you talking about the big guys right not not a guard yeah usually it is but Styles said in the postgame against Florida State he said you know Marcus Hill he might get more of the paint than any guard Ive ever played with thats something that Marcus Hill loves he loves those paint touches and it puts so much pressure on the defense because it clears up so many opportunities for the offensive team sting has cut it to two lby attacks thats what lb loves to do he loves to play out of that midrange mid post area he saw he had a mismatch on him he took full advantage of it there was their leading score with 11 their last game at Wagner H in just 22 minutes this will be an NC State turnover taking NC State some time to get adjusted to this Zone they havent seen it much this year I think theyre still just trying to figure it out and build that chemistry on the offensive Applause end theyve seen a lot of it in this game right because they havent been able to get really those transition opportunities driving kick Harrison s three is off and a recycle by Applause tooy and the only fast break point tonight for NC State have one and it came off the okell free throws midd Brooks rejects the shot one of the best shot blockers in the ACC better than one and a half per Applause game the repost pass middle Brooks fouls lb gambl on that play which led to Ben middle Brooks having an opportunity to finish on offensive end hes just been doing it at a high level on both ends of the floor as you see there with that block and NC State does a great job of feeding them on the offensive end to help him get going because thats what theyre going to need from him his 16th block of the Year second in the ACC in terms of box per game s Bryce C Bryce CD will check in we play the last couple of games against Texas Florida State pass comes out middle Brooks I think might have a cut on his left hand so hes getting that taken care Applause of left index finger give you 20 seconds to to clean that up and they want to right cuz they want him to stay in and shoot these free throws or this free throw I should say he already made Applause one her the Freshman from Chicago picking up on the ball in the doy now this is Erb what a finish boy Styles was up towards the top of the box there and he still put it up over a in it strong move byb cop state is going to need that from him in order for them to stay in this game he knows it Styles middle Brooks again Styles loves that Baseline jumper middle Brooks More throws coming fou number three first eag that foul goes against the guard camon Brown his first ninth team foul so NC State in the double bonus the remaining 837 of this first half P middle Brooks has done an excellent job just keeping his keeping his energy High by getting second and third opportunities for NC State hes doing a great job of doing the dirty work right and thats something that coaches love and thats why hes been playing so much in this game that makes sense you know when your offense is clicking everythings going smoothly thats thats all fine and well but so far this has been the kind of game where n States just had to scrap for for everything and middle Brooks has been able to to give them a spark really when seems like nothing else is Music Applause working a good match up here Taylor picking up Eller six to Applause shoot with one on the shot clock Horton does draw Iron and thats going to save a possession here for the Eagles that was excellent ball Movement by cop State on that possession multiple touches from everyone on the floor even a behind the p a behind the back pass a shot winning their favor on that offensive Music Applause possession more good defense by middle Brooks and styles take us to the under eight Eagles still out in front by three Music the wel back mens basketball team we like to wish a happy birthday to all of our fans celebrating birthday us tonight happy Music Applause birthday so some of the fans that just sat on the the cement tiers where this the future seats were to go part of the incredible history of this facility Jen Taylor will go to the line to shoot two as he got downhill against the Eagles and the foul starting to mount for an Eagles team that has led this whole way we weve got some pretty cool footage for you uh Reynolds Coliseum over the years and uh really just a fun game every year to be able to kind of look back and see some of the special moments that happen in this building many memories andc stay Hoops in this building thats why this game is so important especially with NC State wearing the uniforms representing the past in my opinion I think NC State might need to stick with these uniforms and wear him a little more I think thats a popular opinion honestly its a great look they havent lost many games in either 25 and2 since 2000 in this building thats part of the history of this building back when it was the regular home it was known as the toughest place to play in the ACC maybe in the country lby fouled by Parker Jr its still a tough place to play whether its volleyball wrestling womens basketball gymnastics the ACC Champs part of the the energy the history of this build third final four Banner from Cleveland from the womens basketball team as both mens and womens went to the final four heres North Carolina head coach Hubert Davis about playing here the Sea of red just never seemed to end was always flustered in those first 20 minutes it was that Applause intimidating Hill with the hands for Applause Music two move State draws level strong move by Marcus Hill scoring in transition and thats what n state is going to get tonight theyre going to get those opportunities in transition because if youre cop in state it causes Applause miscommunication this will be one and one fre throws for ER as hun half Fields like he lost his balance really just went kind of King into lrb just doing a great job of just putting his head down and just attacking his NC State Defense he notices that theyre pressuring him further away from the basket and that clears up a lot of driving lanes for opportunities to get to the runby playing with two fouls again this C State team two of their top players have been out with injuries and their leading scorer darus Ward fifth year player and Ryan Argie a sophomore was on the all Frenchman team last year in the MF so without two of their top scores as herd cant hit the three theyve pretty much been in an eight player rotation although we have seen Darius Leonard play his first minutes in the month of December here good block by Taylor Cameron Brown see State looking for its first lead wont get it here Taylor stepped on the sideline Music tough play by NC State on that possession they had the transition that they wanted jayen Taylor ran his Lane to the corner thats an unfortunate opportunity for the wol pack four turnovers so far for NC State four for the Eagles thats key for C State because NC State turnover margin better than plus four per game doesnt sound like a lot in basketball he really is theyre theyre one of the best in that category for you and so if you can be even with them in turnovers does a lot for you tough shot maybe a chance to run for Taylor bounce past nearly turned it over again and now they do put Hunley Hatfield in a bad Applause spot cin stays doing a great job just staying in it thats all you want to do if your cop State stay in it and try to build momentum in the second half Applause Hill again he gets in the paint and hes one of the best Shooters in the ACC when he does first lead for the wolfback comes here 5 minutes remaining in the first half its a 70 run extended here in the last about 3 and 12 minutes a contact no foul Taylor on the push another tough pass from Applause him andc sts doing a great job in transition just got a complete passes Marcus Hils you seen on that play doing a great job breaking his Defender down getting to the rim but when other guys attack they just got to make the simple play and just catch everyones trying to do too much and play Too Fast just got to move at a comfortable Pace if youre to Wolf Pack entering for the wol three third out Styles Applause reenters Casey when you start 0 of 10 as a team against a Zone I dont know a frustration sets in that quickly but can that cause you to kind of press a little bit you get down nine early it can it can um and weve seen it tonight but its essential to understand its a 40minute game right and and the defense is eventually going to wear out C State threw their best punch early and theyre still staying strong but NC St is going to have to continue to stay solid for the duration of the Applause game the doy with the Applause basket they close that on pass good ball movement straight on Parker J pours it in great shot by Parker J had his feet set in shot Rhythm that might be one of the best times the ball has moved so far tonight for NC State offensively Hunley Hatfield going to be whistles thats his second take us to the under four timeout NC State up three thanks to Dennis Parker Junior Music Music what do I got to Music Music he Music Music Music Music 2 3 left Music la Music confin state is led by as many as nine in this first half and you can see the hot start since they cooled off a little bit it they couldnt find anything uh in the early going theyve settled into this game case this is the largest lead incy state has had so far by three how have you seen things change somewhat subtly but slowly but surely over the course of this half as you mentioned Cen state has just started to cool off a bit they start off having a bunch of momentum and it honestly threw n State off with the zone that they presented and I dont think n state was necessarily prepared for what they saw from compa State and now NC States starting to get settled in and adapt to the flow of the game which propelled them to get a twopoint lead cin state has four points from the free throw line the other 20 all in the paint if youre not knocking down threes thats what you need good play Dennis Parker Jr and styles pays it off great job by Parker Jr drawing the defense and finding dant styles for open three energy starting to pick up you can hear it in here tonight basketball driveing dish Styles got off to a slow start against Florida State he had just two points at halftime he finished with 21 that included knocking down three threes and NC State needed every bit of it in an OT game that St Florida States nations leading really historical streak 14 consecutive overtime wins which is almost unfathomable I mean you go to overtime youre talking about a coin flip game they won 14 in a row until they ran into NC State the other day and one thing that dant Styles hitting that three did was it forced C state to move out of the two3 zone and now theyre in a manto man and thats if youre n State thats what you want because thats going to clear up many drive the lane opportunities for n state to get to the Applause rim done travel and to your point earlier NC State hasnt seen a ton of Zone yet this year they havent they havent so if its Casey if its been four or five games since youve seen Zone thats youd rather see yeah yeah and thats what most teams run in the ACC as well is manto man not many teams run Zone I think NC States used to that Hill trying to force the issue saved underneath his own basket and Als playing so hard and they will win The Possession be a traumatically and NC state has figured out how theyre going to win this game and they know to win this game by getting second to third opportunities off of Misses I dont see anyone even checking back all five guys are going to The Rim when the shot goes Applause up the Eagles have scored just two fou break points so if theyre not hurting you on the break might as well crash and thats leny state to 11 offensive rebounds to this point nice move n doi to with the Toby nooi played against NC State a year ago did not score he played just a couple of minutes for Maryland Eastern Shore but he had a couple of nice plays on the offensive end as middle Brooks gets to his spot and extends the Wolfpack lead and middle bricks has a huge Advantage inside the paint Im surprised n State just doesnt go to him every Applause possession runs to it on both sides of the floor forces the turnover but yeah thats easy for him and thats there thats there pretty much been there every pretty much every possession so far its essential for Ben mbooks to get going early good box out by dun and one of the few times its felt like tonight NC State is one and done on this yeah on that play not many people had touches usually NC get their gets their best looks when it gets from side to side of the court and multiple people can touch the ball on offensive end little surprise C and state didnt try to go two for one here six on the shot clock for Applause brown the doy sees it roll off shot clock is off Hill doesnt care he wants to run Applause number 10o one thing Marcus hill we know where were going to see from him is a lot of driving opportunities thats been beneficial at times for NC State cuz it could clear up opportunities for shots its up to NC State to hit those shots when theyre presented Hill and styles really stepped up the last couple of games those have been two big games right Texas Florida State you see what that pair has done and thats coming off what was a tough trip to San Diego play the ra childrens Invitational lost to Purdue and BYU so despite a tough loss against Texas game they felt like they really should have closed out positive sign for a team thats still looking for that goto option and right now Styles and Hill have kind of auditioned best to this point I know its a long season but theyve already got a conference game under their belt these are time of year where you got Kansas on Saturday you got to start figuring out the answers to some of these questions number its so early and and and the coaches know it um but its still an opportunity if youre Inc state to stack up quad ones thats something that is going to come back and and serve as a lot of value later on in March when youre trying to make a March Madness you could win quad ones or you could just win five games in five days yeah that work do hey Ill be honest I dont wish that grind on anybody my body is still recovering from that to Applause Music R 77 for pass and Company Parker Jr a highlight to end the first Applause half and NC State will take its largest lead of the half into the locker room an O of 10 start they go 11 for 22 50 past that point nice way to finish it off for Parker Jr might be a game changer for NC State to have Michel Connell back out there he picked up two quick fouls and the grad student makes their offense go 11 assists in his last two games he leads the ACC as assisted turnover ratio better than four and a half so he gets them a lot easier shots when hes in the game and might make a big impact here in the second half kind of deflection there camon Brown able to stay with it more penetration and finally some points not in the paint a short quarter jumper on the Baseline by odoro if youre oduro youre going to get those looks n States a team that loves to pressure and thats clearing up Drive Lan for guards to get to hook up oduro on offensive end oduro spent a year at George Mason in Odessa College he actually set a career high against his former team George Mason earlier this year and another offensive rebound for NC State they go for two on the possessions the oconnell three and the Styles back contemp if youre an empty State its essential to convert on those second and third chances that youre getting on the offensive end thats something cop State struggles with is finishing possessions NC state has to convert to win comfortably in this game oduro shot fake and fouled by Parker Jr well you said just the second go partner said hes going to get those looks and he just got another one and this time he used the shot fake to his cuz the guards for C state are drawing so much attention especially on their drives if youre a dur if you could just find get to your sweet spot as you seen there got B middle Brooks up in the air when you get Ben middle Brooks up in the air you you your in state you lose that Rim protection and he took full advantage of Applause it thats a home bounce a little smile from Music oduro its brother JN my remember played at George Mason also played at Providence great player Peter plays very similar to Josh okay how about you you play you have multiple Brothers right at least one I have one brother one brother how how are your games pretty similar uh pretty pretty similar he has me by by a couple inches so we have to change our games a little bit and hes your older brother yeah so hes clearly better than I dont know about Im trying to represent for all the older brothers Applause out transition triple in and out great pass Hill to Parker Jr and theres the transition points NC State was looking for in the first half and now a turnover on the inbounds an unforced error by Hort state is looking for opportunity to build that momentum as you seen there Parker Jr has done an excellent job this season of just running his Lanes trying to get easy opportunities in transition great job on Marcus Hill to find him sixpoint lead for NC State move it around around the perimeter open shot Styles his second of the night D Styles is automatic with his feet is set especially in that corner hes had plenty of opportunities tonight to knock it down and hes starting to get Applause going and hand check on Hill your brother played D12 though right played at great player at talson played at talson University y CA conference played against Kevin Keats um during his time there and Kevin Heats actually won the ca for years when he was at talson which PR him to come to NCC y Applause y triple hand off for the brown Applause Eagles patient maybe a little too patient here and they dont get a shot off NC State did an excellent job on that possession on that defensive Applause possession so stayed solid no one gambled they put a full possession together for full 30 seconds great job Music so a chance here to make it double figures for the first time Music Applause tonight hell lost it got it back and a good stop for cin state one thing N St struggle with that last possession is spacing spacing was bad and forc Marcus H to shoot a tough jumper turnover starting to mount for the Eagles here had really the unforced one on the inbound on the other ends Hunley Hatfields going to come in here and spell Middlebrooks these are some important minutes for Huntley Hatfield he took him until the second half just to get get a a field goal attempt he only got one shot against Florida state which he hit in 18 minutes they havent really established him theyve got to get him going if theyre going to reach their potential this year as a team I agree Ben Middlebrooks has done a great job but hes going to need at at times hes going to need to have that guy come in and help give him a breather whenever things get rough and and Coach Keats has played them together just a little bit its a its a possibility this year but it should be one of the strengths is at the five no matter whos it up shot tooy the turnaround over o connells out stretch t Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music lrb size advantage and he takes Hill to the hoop lrb does a phenomenal job of getting to getting to the basket right and as you seen on that play put a series of moves together to help get to the left side of the basket hes been performing big as of mconnell had it knocked out of his hands by Harrison right to Parker Applause Jr Styles right there able to bail him out at the end of the shot clock and again thats one of the questions for the this team when The Possession isnt going anywhere who can still score it Styles does that Applause Music time of Duro in Music answer

Hatfield defending without fouling L he pick up his third and thats what NC States defense intends to do is disrupt tempo as we see here theyre starting to disrupt their offense making it tough for CA state to get a shot off Brown shot clock violation he got the shot off didnt draw Iron you know C state has really avoided the big run in this game State hasnt man a Haymaker but they have turned what was a ninepoint deficit slowly here into an 11point lead and I think coffins starting to wear her down as the game that goes on they dont have as as deep of a bench as NC State does and starting the show again they did get Leonard into the game here for the first time in the last that but its largely an eightman Applause rotation coach Kei hasle L of dep this year is that something good find here for an easy land for aduro is that something you felt as a player sometimes when you all had depth and you had really tightened the screws defensively over the course of of the game that the final 5 minutes 3 minutes whatever it might be could you start to feel that other teams kind of running out again against you at times yeah I but I would say this I I dont think uh Kevin Keats um I think hes still trying to figure out a lineup that works I think thats why were starting to see more and more faces out here I think once he finds a group that kind of all meshes the best that hell stick with that and and essentially reduce the lineup every year he tends to go deeper down his bench in November in December but come January I expect an eight man rotation as well penetration by Parker hell shoot a Applause pair great job by Trey Parker attacking around your n State you know those thats where your opportunities are going to come from is from attacking a rim C state is lacking a rim presence down low of durl being essentially the r Defender down down at the basket so its essential for the NC State guard to try to get to the basket and put pressure on this cop State defense last time these two teams met a couple years ago almost to the day December 6 202 uh 2022 that was the Heritage game that year in C State against coffin State Casey you played in that game I dont know how well you remember it but Jon Smith had 33 in that game and Jarel Joiner had 29 oh wow thats big time speaking of guards getting to the rim and and scoring baby T had six threes to go along with it well was a 9472 win for the wolf back Applause Brown gets pass pass and that possession all started with Ron pass he did an ex an excellent job guarding with his feet and not with his hands they give the big man the ball Hatfield working hard foul Applause Z Harrison thats his third personal foul conf states third Music Music foul oppen state has returned back to their two three Zone forcing NC State to Music shoot Eagles looking to run the doy left elbow pull up too strong got his own Miss and fouled by Applause Parker for this third person Kevin I know youre frustrated with the fact that NC State couldnt finish that possession I know personally this NC State team spend a lot of time working on rebounding and nothing bothers coaches more than giving up second and third chance opportunities essentially like giving up a free basketball three Subs as Parker Junior pass at Huntley Outfield outs get H and oon back back in along with Ben middle Brooks both Hill and Middlebrooks the best nights offensively so far in the double figures time out Cate time out Cen state will step aside as theyve cut it to nine here in the second half Music dont forget your NC State Ms basketball team returns to the lenogo center on December 22nd TI off is set for 400 pm as they host Ryder to purchase your tickets visit gaccom tickets Music Music la Music la Applause Music Music w Music Music there a scoring distribution for NC State so far tonight Hill leading the away with 13 all of 10 of mid Brooks points came in the first halfs out there now Parker Jr who has 10 three fouls and thats what were going to expect to see from NC State all year I mean that Balan scoring could serve as value in terms of an opponent not knowing who could get hot On Any Given Music Applause night pretty quiet for Jaden Taylor so far this one point looking to change that and does certainly benefits to balance and this team has had it at times Applause this is on middle Brooks C State shooting free throws when we come back with the under eight all right fans its under 8 minutes in the second half that means with cin St head to the fre line be sure and get loud for the how fou if they miss two in Ro you Applause get right thats right the time is now its time for Sall engineering JY and I who is the student Applause ready spit two where am I going where am I Applause going hear you hear you Music Applause congratulations friend the difference is in the Music Music he e everybody Applause your Harris line for eag back Casey morcel Andrew Sanders with you from Raleigh on campus here at NC State two free throws come in forur senior Z Harrison and with it being under eight the Miss free throw promotion has been triggered so hes got some pressure on these Street throws as he calmly sinks the first the C State four down 10 here theyre hanging on theyre hanging on they stayed strong and NC State tried to go on a run and but this lineup that were seeing from NC State we expect them to try to speed them up speed up the tempo essentially a four guard lineup and theyre going to switch every screen yeah the Eagles got off to a fast start talking about you know the anatomy of an upset youre probably going to need to get off to a to a nice start but again theyve really avoided as he go back to the line theyve really avoided letting NC State get out and run for the most part theyve limited the easy baskets and it has kept them right in this game and you dont want to harp on it too much look everybody you can see next to their next to their point to right 0 and 10 0 and 10 its been a tough goal it was a tough go last year they went two and 27 but I think this performance despite matter what happens the next 730 if they come back and win if they end up losing by by more than you know currently nine certainly a positives they can take away from what theyve done already tonight most definitely most definitely I think you said it best they thrown their best punch at MC State and theyve just stayed solid if they can keep this momentum heading into M play they could be very dangerous especially if they can get a little healthier Applause Music Applause dead ball Applause turnover basketball head coach Stewart playing their fourth ACC game tonight and again W Force able to pull away late in that game Virginia 17 the only blowout was in Coral Gables at Miami Applause Applause theyve been methodical at times too patient if the push isnt there as Harrison right here theyve run a lot of clock and shorten this Applause Music Applause game what a pass okon the middle Brooks and middle Brooks is hurt that was a tough Landing Ben Middlebrooks has been phenomenal for NC State doing in on both ends guarding the guard and then going up strong for a finish hit on the fast break julus they are going to review this Applause I dont know about you Casey I didnt see a whole lot from lby there obviously he makes contact foul as calls I agree I dont think it was intentional he started to go up and then you know kind of put his arms down like you know what Im not going to be able to get the ball yeah it looked just like a freak incident on that play he didnt really touch him too much yeah just looks like a normal basketball player to me foul yeah that was the call on the court it is the third foul on terby he joins Harrison with three Sparrow on the bench with Music four this game has been physical tonight on both ends two previous calls turned on the floor common foul Two Shots Bill coming to Junior tonyia at of four just a common foul Music first point for Middle Brooks here in the second half to at 10 in the first and was really the Difference Maker probably the the pain reason NC State had a lead at the halftime Music break there one for two W from the ball this is herd called for a foul and thatll be free throws for C and state here one and one Casey I dont know Im curious your thoughts is what you think about this NC State is not played at the level tonight that it didnt win over Florida State youve got Kansas looming as a player you know whos coming up next on the schedule some people call it a trap game a look ahead game is that something as a player that you ever caught yourself doing no not me personally um but it is normal and it does happen um in the locker room at times you you got to know hey were going to next yeah yeah and and thats for sure um definitely one of those games thats circled on the calendar but if anything I think its best to view this game as a game to essentially sharpen the knife and and learn from your mistakes because you know when you go to the fog um the margin for error is going to be so Applause slim good oh done called for a foul I was in the process of saying good block I thought it was number 13 thats going to be the third foul on done foul at the line middle Brooks he knows that Copa state has a disadvantage down low hes been living at the free throw line hes been living in the paint and thats gave NC State a huge advantage on the off 24 free throws taken by NC State so despite the fact that not shooting it well just 33 for the game able to tack on an extra 16 points at the line still by mle Brooks Applause Music oduro the offensive rebound yeah hes there to clean it up oduro doing a great job just staying solid he knows if he just plays his role hes going to have opportunities to score M Brooks fouls done going to get dant Styles in the game also is doof excited to see goof tonight we havent seen much of him this season he could add a great he could be a great spark to this NC State team as hes another guy that Kevin ke is essentially trying to fit into the lineup and evaluate first free throw missed by dun his SM D last played against BYU out in San Diego just a couple appearances for him off the bench he was ineligible the first two games missed the col gay game with an injury so hes been a little banged up get some time here second free throw good and even with cop States record being what it is theyre going to play hard to the very end active hands and dun couldnt get the lob to go but he saves The Possession the doy looking to make it single digits again step back oh Toby theoy makes it a sevenpoint game this compensate has so has so much Applause fight but the record being what it is they move with a different sense of urgency you show and the post moves its just his second basket of the Year looked like hes done it a million times right Applause there foul on Hill thatll take us to the break copin State not going away number 11 Denis J hisoul winning sevene classic championships and while they did have uh a few other teams come in play no team from outside North Carolina ever won the championship and it were part of Reynolds colum that tournament Coach case big part of why Bas basketball became so popularized in this area the ACC Styles going to work tough move NC State needed a basket the under four timeout just a single digit game back up to double figures thanks to Styles and conf and state look theyve got an uphill climb but they are in this Applause game and doy dribbled it off his foot great defense by Parker J doing a great job just sliding his feet he knows he has a size Advantage so he just stays solid on that Applause possession Styles left Applause open hes got three threes on the night thats three straight games for him with three threes not bad for the stretch four and that shot was big for dant Tre Styles forcing NC St to get a 14point lead and now everyones starting to get into it and you can feel it that the crowd is starting to get going off a bounce pass from okono three more for number three and a timeout conf and stay after they turn over again n doy off his foot doof with good defense stay straight up horses to Music travel its a 70 spur for NC State trying to close out this game it hasnt been their prettiest it hasnt it hasnt but defensively look held the the Eagles to just 50 points to this point and once a couple shots start going down things get a little easier if youre NC State this is Val film that you can use heading into Kansas you dont know what type of Defense Kansas can necessarily throw at you they might surprisingly throw a Zone youve seen that a lot in this game so this NC State team can use this as a lesson that they still have a lot to learn and ways to go into the season basketall Music Applause Music under two to Music play styles again starting to be that goto option he and Hill strong move by Don TR CU even though he could shoot it he still loved that midrange he did a great job on that possession get to his Applause spot Duro flurry moves to just sticks with them three ball Music lb that was smooth by lb shot it in Rhythm playing hard to the just the second three of the night for the Eagles Styles feeling it in and out do he takes the rebound away from Hill its five on four momentarily HBY no look bounce pass bed by aduro and they want timeout theyve got one left and they will use it with 417 to go in a 13point game and looks like NC State is going to survive a great effort from cin state in NC State they were testing on how they were going to react to the two3 zone and it took them time to get going but they found a way and tonight I mean Ben Middlebrooks did a great job of being that guy and it started with his offensive rebound his his defense on the rim and theyre going to need his presence down low in order to come out with a strong Victory not only tonight but heading into Lawrence next week excuse me this Saturday conf State still winless on the year its coming its to state that mean they did all the things you could do to put you in put yourself in a position to win yeah I felt like they just ran out of gas towards the end of the second half and it all starts with their bench I dont think they went too deep it State essentially played all the scholarship guys available Applause Music Applause Music so to be Baseline lefts in bounds forado DOI 18 to shoot harison wants a screen they ghost the screen and Parkers called for a blocking foul number four on Trey one more chance at the free chicken sandwich promotion this place gets L they know this is their last opportunity for a free t thats what you got to do with your Harrison just erase any thought to the chicken sandwich on the first shot you dont want the pressure of shot number Applause two McNeil J back in J Hill the leading scorer in this game 16 six of them for the free throw line back number seven Applause Music Applause chice got him both one and a half second differential shot clock game clock Applause lost the basketball once again they get another opportunity for a free sandwich chance to cut into single figures again but its not often the home team is called for a foul and the student section of the B cheers Applause done with 10 points now four and double figures to the eagles they have fought hard Applause tonight McNeil across midc Court hes not just going to dribble it out hell take a step back three and this game comes to a close 6656 the final score NC State Now 26 and2 in Reynolds Coliseum since 2000 so a 10point win in the end for the wol pack they struggled at times with cop at State both their Zone and manto man but this defensive battle goes the way of the wolf and state found a way and it all started with Ben Middlebrooks doing a great job with his R protection down low andc States going to have to build on this this is a lesson that he still have ways to go heading into Lawrence Marcus Hills 16 points leading the way for NC State as they win their Heritage game and improve to seven and3 on the season up next a trip to Kansas thatll do it for our broadcast here in
