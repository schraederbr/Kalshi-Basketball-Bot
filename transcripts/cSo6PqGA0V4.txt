Chad venning and we are underway the deakes in their old gold with black lettering white trim and the Eagles in their Road gray Applause uniforms wake immediately goes inside to Trayvon Spillers for two and thats a really nice job Boston College Plays tough manto man and Spillers is a guy who can really score close to the basket we said wakes been struggling shooting the three so maybe getting closer is a good way to start the game and Dan you notice a change in the Boston College starting lineup Chaz Kelly will come off the bench with Joshua Beetle making his first start a tremendous start to the day for BC as Donald Han Jr buries the three there you see Cosby hildr Salis spillers Reed hildr and Salis are the two make this team go they both got to shoot better they both got to take care of the basketball better for a weake team thats been struggling at this end recently theyve theyve really struggled to shoot the ball defensively theyve been fine theyve been able to force turnovers but they just havent been able to convert particularly from three and they they kicked it away that time now Donald H for Boston College just made that threepoint shot and that is tremendous news for Boston College because over their previous three halves Boston College is shooting was shooting three for 26 from behind the AR well those are similar numbers to what wake has done the last three games only four for 23 from Music distance here is Beetle the Clemson transfer Dion Brown they need to get him going and thats a good sign for the 63 junr from Western Massachusetts grew up in great barington saying that Boston College was kind of his dream School w hes another guy they really expect big things from him love that about c h you can post him up you can use him in different ways very effective now in his fourth year at weight hes a big strong guy and hes one of the best postup guards in the conference and so again Wake Forest has gotten some mileage going inside early yeah no doubt Dan that hildr is strong puts up the three and hey who says either of these sides cant shoot the three ball well they have already made in the first two minutes of this game as many threes as they made in their last three halves of basketball Sports you just never know hand Brown and now strong with triples and BC off to a quick 94 lead and that that if if youre Boston College thats the way you want to start coming in on the road here is Salis the senior from Omaha out of Millard North High School hildr great shot fake Works along the Baseline gets another defender in the air and draws the foul number one against Chad venning now hrth is another guy who has struggled to shoot the three so far this year but he is one of the most aggressive drivers that youll ever see and that was a really good fake and as soon as he got his man in the air you knew he was going to the basket and one thing that strikes me about hildr like youre saying Dan is that hes also always under control when he drives to the basket he has good balance he works off of two feet theres so many things about his game that I think translate man hildr and Salis are the two guys who get to the free throw line the most for Wake Forest and thats a good thing because theyre both very good free throw shooters even though he only made one of two Music there Elijah strong playing a much bigger role than here hes now got five early points comes in averaging just about 11 per Music game good job defensively by Dion Brown to spoil that dribble handoff trying to get it inside to read but venning pushed him off the spot Salis gets to his spot but misses the shot good tough defense by Josh Beetle and here comes Beetle looking to go end to end he is denied now you want to push youd like to beat that Boston College defense down the court if you Applause can strong defending Spillers who gives it up to Cosby the Alabama transfer and he kicks it out of bounds back to Boston Applause College Wake Forest doing a really nice job here on the defensive end and spers is just standing there waiting for come on in sure and I think if youre beetle in that situation you have to recognize theres four guys around you somebodys open well wakad coach Ste forb says that he wants Spillers to play more like Stacy Ogman got a taste of it there with the block shot couple of opportunities for BC venning misses his first field goal attempt and then the held ball possession errow will stay at this end with BC I think everybody would like their players to play like Stacy of course well Spillers you know really is a revelation and Im always is drawn to players with his story out of Charleston South Carolina didnt have division one opportunities he went from Junior College to where he then last year at app state was a first team allc conference player in the Sun Belt to where right now an effective player in the ACC with NBA Scouts paying attention I mean its just remarkable sometimes in athletic stand how people can seemingly come from nowhere well executed Baseline out of bounds for BC draws the ey of Coach Forbes who calls timeout 13 to 5 the Eagles on opening day of the ACC off to a flying start here in Winston and he has the as you mentioned off the top Dan this program heading up coming off a 20 win season and looking to build upon that this year Fon Reed gets the touch inside for way corest decides to go over the left shoulder off the front rim no good job defensively by Chad Benning and this what youre talking about the Wake Forest program we said excuse me the Boston College program in an upward trajectory heres Benny spins quickly to the Baseline sees the double team coming so finds Brown who has his shot Rim out another chance inside now a chance for three as Elijah strong plays to his last name powerful finish hes already got seven points D Wake Forest doing a pretty good job so far double teaming Benning and forcing him to give up the ball but when you force an outside shot like that youve got to be able to rebound and that time strong just like nobody blocked him out Spillers was trying to but strong did a great job so wake has turned it over a couple times theyve given up a couple of offensive rebounds not a good start for the deeps but a very good start for that man who misses the free throw appeared in only 19 games a year ago for BC drain the game warnning jumper with 4 seconds to go in overtime earlier this year to beat Missouri State last month in the Cayman Islands well Boston College at this end has three straight stops defensive stops and for BC they call that a brick the brick is finished on the Spillers Applause threepointer now Spillers hes very effective around the basket but he can make a three in fact he com in shooting almost a little over 36 but thats only his fifth made three of the Year boy if he can start knocking down that with consistency the sky is the limit Beetle misses the runner Fon Reed comes back up Court holding his right hand and wrist which is taped to begin with whistle and a foul off the ball as Parker Frederickson was coming to accept that pass St char3 Donald J Donald H Jr picks up the foul as you see Steve Forbes in year number five as head coach at wake 59yearold native of Lone Tree Iowa hes talking about Lone Tree being a small town and some of his background yesterday after shoot around as always we enjoyed chitchatting with Coach forbs pretty good telling his story hes a great Storyteller Frederickson misfires from the corner and when you miss a three like that its usually a long rebound and Boston College able to get out and get in transition nice job by the deakes to get back though Roger McFarland has come into the game for the Eagles heres strong tied up Reed tied him up and the alternate possession arrow in favor of the deeps and there you see again Fon Reed holding well I said he was holding his right hand I do think as you see him flexing that right hand hes in some discomfort he does a nice job here just getting his hand very solidly on the ball thats a tough situation where you got to be careful not to foul but you still want to be aggressive Salis tries to get to the Baseline be will cut him off now Salis goes right around him right to the rim Salis is so good getting to the basket and youre right Beetle did do a good job cutting him off but Salis was able to keep that PIV the foot and uses strength a nice tough basket Brown working on Frederickson the second Defender is Reed back out to Beetle thought about it now strong hands it off Farland back out to Beetle skipped to the corner five on the shot clock strong triple Applause team and on the sideline receiving that pass was Chad Benning and he was really on the sideline he was out of bounds we talk about Salis and his hes multi talented guy he just spins around in there after Beetle Cuts him off at the Baseline Beetles complaining he got hooked but once Salis gets down in there you got to bring some help and now since snapping the 91 BC run when they opened up a 10point lead wake has had its first kill thats what they call three straight defensive stops and they cash in at the other end to find the big man sevenfooter Fon Reed right to the rim its a great job by Reed to go straight to the basket on that roll and Salis keeping his head up and finding him theyve got to get Reed more involved on the interior so a 91 Boston College run has been answered by eight unanswered by the deeps and that run can continue off the Miss from the corner by Roger McFarland look out hildr getting downhill and draws the foul shot was blocked by Elijah strong but it is a twoshot foul they say that hildr the captain for the Demon Deacons was fouled while shooting hildr is a guy that really likes to go in transition if he gets the ball and he sees any opportunity at all he is very aggressive getting it up the court and as we said this is one of the thing he does he gets to the free throw line well hes top 10 in the ACC again this year in free throw shooting 84 before today now hes made two out of three a senior from wory England who is recruited via Zoom coach Forbes learned of Cameron through current 76ers head coach Nick nurse a friend from back in Iowa who had actually coached Cams father playing professional basketball in England Im always fascinated by the connections of how one person or player goes from point A to point B particularly how a guy from England ends up at Wake Forest they are sure glad to have him here the last four years in geektown chz Kellys checked into the game coming off the bench for the first time this year for the Eagles tough finish Inside by Donald Han Jr that really was a tough finish but great ball Movement by Boston College you know you and I were talking off a before the game about Geral M Mater and the great history of guards at the University of Virginia as Salis Miss fires Donald Han Jr is the son of a pretty good guard back in the day for the hoos absolutely his father was a threetime captain UVA 1400 career points foul on the rebound good call against Roger McFarland thats thats a deep three by Donald H Jr and its too early in the shot clock you need to get the ball moving from side to side heres a situation where they do get it moving from side to side and even even though hand stumbles hes still able to get it to the basket but if you move the ball you force the defense to move you create opportunities for those Music drops Churchill laass into the game sophomore big and to Paul transfer heres Frederickson they go into big number 55 big size Advantage for him nice job by Hastings to stay with him Jaden Hastings is a elite shot blocker got a piece of that one heres another takeaway numbers on the run out throw it to the rim and the two veterans fight for the slam its Salis over hildr I dont know who Frederick was throwing it to but one of those guys got to Im guessing postgame depending on who asks him of his teammates Frederickson will say yeah I was passing it to you the correct answer is Salis because thats the guy who got the Applause dunp well theres a theres another offensive rebound for Boston College thats four now for the Music Eagles heres Kelly the 63 Jr from Houston Eagles have cooled off after making their first three from distance today again you dont want to become reliant on the threepoint shot Salis attacks cant finish with the left hand a bass misses on the putback attempt but you need to get your feet set if youre a bass he went too quickly and there was no need for it hes a big guy and he only had guards around him yeah 610 250 sophomore from Nigeria Fred Payne number five in Gray on the floor now for Boston College lost out of bounds by McFarland well the highlight of the afternoon on opening day here in Winston Salem no question its a pass from Frederickson yeah it was just Salis I think it was just Salis off and flying here at the Joel The Great steuart Scott who we just heard from his high school RJ Reynolds High School only three miles from where we sit here at Joel Coliseum and even though the Tar Heels his beloved Tar Heels are not playing were glad to be here for this ACC opening day Boston College in town weve had an entertaining start to the game a couple of r BC took a 10point lead but Winston or rather Wake Forest has come right back to make the ball game of it and their promising freshman Juke Harris out of Salsbury North Carolina drills the three and the deakes have taken the lead thanks to a 12 to2 run that was just great ball Movement by Wake Forest at the other end Strong finish by Fred pay the sophomore from gramling Louisiana ties the basketball game this really a good job collecting himself and pay stepped right past Fon Reed and Payne is a guy he was hurt last year but Boston College is really high on him they think he can develop into a really good score yeah still coming all the way back he completes the threepoint play but what you love most about Fred Payne hes an effort guy 100 all the time loves to defend as we see him right now making life difficult for hildr in the back court Spillers rather than taking the jumper attacks and miss the layup gets it back and is denied thats a really good job by Hastings to bother that shot without fouling another Point Blank look this time Hastings couldnt finish Spillers rips the ball all away for Wake Forest well thats one you really want to have as an excellent job by pay to find the open man inside Hastings has to make that one I mean go dunk it well at this point for the red shirt freshman clearly he is better at this end of the floor better on defense than at offense as he continues to develop tough shot by Harris missing on the turnaround and the reason that was a tough shot was because the ball never went anywhere youve got to take the ball side to side and force the defense to move its not just first guy down the court shoots Kelly went to the floor and as he was getting up got rid of the ball no travel was called BC keeps possession 10 on the shot clock off the pain Miss Wake Forest with it now with wake having struggled lately shooting the basketball theyve uh picked it up certainly here and going in the game coach Forbes told us yesterday he was looking to do more motion more cutting Reed is foul have you seen that in the first 12 minutes we will talk about that when we come back as Reed in some more pain timeout as usual this has turned into a tremendous Home Fort advantage in the era of Steve fors you can feel it you can sense it every time you hear at the Joel well you know this has been a tremendous hope court advantage in a lot of ears Doug you know they played here when Dave odm was the coach and they had great teams you know you just talked about Rand and Tim Duncan guys like that and then under skip prer here they had wonderful crowds and great teams this is a this is a university with a tremendous basketball tradition no doubt I got a kick out of you talking about your days playing in the ACC at UVA back in the mid 70s and the history of Number 15 here at Wake Forest as we look up and see his name Skip Brown and how he changed the score of basketball in this league well I dont know that he changed it necessarily you have to use your verbs correctly I was on the team at Virginia I think play is a little bit of a stretch but back in the day and this is 50 years ago now you didnt have point guards and shooting guards and fours and fives you had two guards two forwards in the center and either one of your guards handled the ball but skip Brown was somebody who handled the ball for Way Forest theres a traveling violation Almost 100 of the time and when our team would prepare to play wait for us the object was to try to keep the ball out of his hands to disrupt the deaks offense and of course it never worked because skip was a pretty good player his name hangs up there and you sit next to Doug Sherman down here no I love that stuff I love the history of the ACC as a northerner who has joined the fry in recent years I just love hearing the history about all these programs that is of course what has made the ACCC so good over the years Juke Harris a step in three hes got six points off the bench for wa now theres such a huge difference between that shot by Harris and the previous shot by Harris and its just not because one went in and the other didnt great ball movement and Harris is able to step into a three and that leads me back to what I mentioned before we went to the last break coach Forbes wanted more motion more cutting out of his team have you seen that so far here this afternoon Dan I think so theyve moved the ball pretty well from side to side they got off to a slow start because they turned it over and gave up offensive rebounds but now that theyve cleaned that up theyre doing pretty well on the offensive end strong wide open from the head of the key and that snaps a shooting slump since theyre opening three in a row Strong having a big game already to his season average with 10 points and retied once again strong comes in as a 38 threepoint shooter and hes already made one today you just cant give him that much time he can score 25 and 13 rebounds against Temple last month while on his way to challenging that here this afternoon Tyler Johnson a backup point guard for Wake is out of the floor number eight giving Chase be him blocked wonderful help defense by Aton Reed Reed just followed him down the lane and he just followed him down the lane and he waited look at him very patient doesnt get his body anywhere close to him but he just waited until he put the ball out there and then he went behind him and knocked it away thats really a heck of a job Brown left it short rebound pulled down by Trayvon Spillers the third leading rebounder in the ACC at over nine per game bad entry pass good defense by vening to knock it out of bounds the de will keep it number one Reed needs to do a better job getting and holding position inside but Johnson has to be more careful with the ball than that he was in the top 10 in the ACC when he was at Louisville last year in the assist but he has been a real little loose with the basketball during his time here at Wake Forest need to make a better pass than that yeah he was uh at 36 assists per game number 10 of the ACC last year for Louisville hildr feeds the post Spillers the other you could just see that coming a mile away what happens is the ball goes into Spillers and he thinks hes got an opportunity for oneonone and he puts that shoulder down into him and knocks him down right in front of the official unless youre going to make that move very quickly I think you got to get the ball back out and move it to the other side young man who he got into the transfer portal last year out of App State chose wake over LSU Arkansas and UAV another portal win for Steve fors who has been brilliant in that regard good defense by Harris Brown to Strong Quick Release and he banks it in and then gives the Michael Jordan shrug and camon hild didnt give any kind of shrug he just shook his head nothing he can do about Applause Music that strong still enjoying that smiling while defending at the other end I love it Reed left alone now strong tries to pick him up BC catches a break there and grabs the Applause rebound from the corner cant use the glass as well there and strong missed it and then the rebounding foul against the Eagles strong as I mean HFF is right there and the ball banks in yep there you go and in the background you see he shaking his and you got to be careful if youre down here on defense you dont want to be smiling about your offense for too long and so hildr goes back to the line for the third time this afternoon top 10 in the ACC in free throw percentage also top 10 in steals just off the top 10 at number 11 in assists per game and the reason he goes to the free throw line so much is both on the offensive end and the defensive end he is in the middle of everything yeah coach forb says theres not 10 players in the country who play harder than that man yeah and hes not an observer hes mixing it up the entire Applause Music time be with Johnson at midcourt able to keep his dribble keep his balance Johnson seemed inevitable to pick up that foul he was doing a nice job moving his feet and at each dribble it seemed to get a little more physical effort and the officials are looking for that they they really do not want the dribbler progress to be impeded and he just gets too frisky right there you know when Beetle fell down the first time that raises the referees antenna eye so you just have to back off a little bit Bill Covington the official who made that call Pat Driscoll and Jerry heer our crew here in Winston Salem this afternoon on this opening day of the ACC no doubt about it BC turns it over H for the B ball under 5 minutes remaining in the first half hildr back out to Reed doesnt look at the basket brings it around to Tyler Johnson back to hildr into the corner here goes the Applause Freshman Salis kind of broke his own ankle there able to keep possession somehow five on the timer Johnson puts it up its an airball he had more time than that easy for me to say sitting over here weve got the clock right in front of us with no pressure weve got the clock but we dont have the basketball not yet got to be ready over here have you been wiped out youve been doing basketball games for 40 plus years have you ever been wiped out by a ball or a player coming flying in your direction bite your tongue no okay Im knocking on wood yeah me either some close calls but nothing that would make Sports Center thankfully now Johnson has picked up another foul hes in the game hes trying to be aggressive but you just you have to try Music smarter Beetle makes the first tomorrow afternoon our ACC Network womens basketball triple header starts at noon Eastern when number 10 Notre Dame takes on Syracuse and then SMU squares off against Florida State and we finish up with number eight du coasting Virginia Tech at Cameron Indoor Stadium always enjoy tuning in to see the electric Hannah hialgo for the Fighting Irish Leaf the nation in assist per game at over four and oh by the way shes third in the country in scoring as well pretty good multitalented is what youre telling she is fun to watch I thought Harris was going to shoot that if he did I think Steve would come out off the bench after a precocious freshman shooting on 27 instead they work the ball around and get a better shot out of Tyler Johnson and thats the kind of thing that Johnson can do if he just stays under control he was a top 100 recruit a couple of years ago coming out of St Benedicts prep in New Applause Jersey well take a break with BC holding on to a slim onepoint lead to give it up well he is an accomplished college basketball player thousand Point score from a couple of years at Morgan State and the last two at St Bonaventure where he was second Team all Atlantic 10 last year for the Bonnies and on Q hes got his first two points of the day thats just a nice job by venning to recognize that the defense opened up and theyd like to get in the ball but probably not up there at the top of the key and have him drive to the basket Harris off the Juke draws the foul asked yesterday how he got his nickname Juke it comes from his mom cuz as a child apparently he was juking all around the house we saw a little Juke right there to get by his Defender well a lot of kids little boys in particular do a lot of juking around the house but this guy I mean hes really a goodlook prospect he moves very well and weve seen he been able to shoot the ball well PA cardi had him top 100 in this past Years ESPN 100 you know his veteran teammates Rave about his talent Hunter Salis says Harris already looks like a pro whether he has that upside who knows but he is a tremendous get out of this years freshman class for Steve Forbes and I think hes only going to get better as he gets more time on the court and one of the things thats happened today Spillers picked up those two fouls so Harris might be getting a little bit longer run than he normally would now this is what Benning likes to do and here comes the double team Chaz Kelly thei mishandled the pass now theyre going to try to reset inside with three on the shot Applause clock and wait for us to take that shot every time venting is best when hes down inside with his back to the basket Johnson attacks along the Baseline nice R around pass and the throw down by Aton Reed thats really a good play and Reed doing a nice job being ready inside Tyler Johnson has Elite Speed he has done it I mean in a game where he was ACC rookie of the week La last year here 27 points 11 assists six rebounds against Florida State its in there its just a matter of coach for bringing it out on a consistent basis fight for the ball comes to Reed despite that achy right hand hes able to steare the basketball and now he again holds that right hand as he follows the play back up Court his teammate sis will have a chance for three Doug you were just commenting about how heon Reed was slow coming up the court but whatever is the problem with his wrist or his hand he does a nice job catching the ball right there and then they theyve got a four on five but still Salis is able to get to the basket and venting he doesnt have anybody to call because Reed is still down on the other end but its one of the things that makes Salis so dangerous is if youre venting if youre not going to try to block the shot just get out of the way and instead he picks up the first personal the night team fou against Boston Applause College Salis makes it 3430 we four with the fourpoint lead and the second on Benning Johnson deflects the pass right back to McFarland heres Payne for three ps giving him a little bit of liftt Off the Bench H working on Kelly theres that post up game you love so much Dan he posts up as well as any guard in this league I mean you cant go double team him because hes such a good Applause passer is nine points lead the deeps Elijah strong has 13 to lead all scorers Johnson in transition the one handed Hammer from Sal go lets go lets go at his best Tyler Johnson can be one of the better guards in this league he got the ball up to court quickly and when you can pass it to Hunter Salis thats always an advantage time out Boston College willll be back in 30 seconds as the here have made their last five shot attempts from the floor Dan and now how does BC respond well the decks have four steals theyve done a really good job creating points off those turnovers and thats the real thats the thing thats slowing BC down they got to get Benning more Music Applause involved ball comes back to hand time Kelly with six on the shot clock or rather on the game clock and another offensive rebound for Boston College this time its Chad venning and he was fouled and they called the foul on Reed so thats Reeds second personal foul I think no first person foul excuse Music me it is the S7 foul but it was in the active shooting and venning gets two ven hes only a 60 free throw shooter but that was that was a great job by Boston College to battle on the offensive board so you know when youre struggling a little bit you need things like extra possessions and BC got themselves a couple of shots up can the deakes get off a good shot two seconds 1 second Johnson Hees it and the deakes will head to the locker room with a threepoint lead fun start to our afternoon really fun start optimistic enthusi itic shots that maybe he shouldnt have taken but he really did a nice job Tyler Johnson also was a nice boost off the bench for the deeps Johnson played very well he didnt have any turnovers had a couple of assists they would love to get this guy going brown who was quiet in the first half misses on the drive gets it back saves it off the leg of Harris and Boston College will keep underneath now they talk about Brown as being a pretty good rebounder he get that rebound amidst four in the middle of four weight Forest guys but that was great defense by Hunter Salis to prevent an easy basket yeah last year at UNBC when Brown was the first team All Conference player in America East bounds he averaged 7 and a half uh 76 rebounds per game one of only two players nationally last year 63 or shorter to average 19 and7 now again the America East is not the ACC you dont expect him to be able to rebound at that level but clearly as you alluded to at his size hes a pretty good rebound bound thats now eight turnovers for Boston College P working on Brown getting to his post up game absorbs the contact missed the shot back tap out to wake fresh 20 on the shot clock but Reed is working hard inside and and Salis was too late with that pass Reed was open strong finds the open Beetle spotting up 4 three see you turn it over and you get down and give up a three thats what drives coaches crazy Steve Forbes had any hair hed be losing 38 38 our Applause score Salis gathers and he has it Rim out a foul on the rebound looks like they got Fon Reed with the personal and that is his third he is the first player in this afternoons ball game to reach that threshold and Reed has been a big big factor in this game so far they can ill afford to lose him venning has been kept under control and a big part of the reason for that is Reed check that thats only his second oh second okay personal foul so just two on Reed haris saves it this is a very odd looking fast break Applause hrth again got to his spot just couldnt finish and he asked the official nearest to him Bill Covington why wasnt there a foul call well if youre going to be do what hild did and Bully your way inside you cant expect the referee to suddenly say okay were not going to play physically anymore the last two post UPS I think he really forced so now that is the third foul on St and so hes going to come out of the game The Games leading scorer questioning Earl Grant about something another Point Blank look on the Baseline out of bounds hildr unable to convert thats at least three of those that Wake Forest has missed here early in the second half I me you cant get any closer than theyve gotten now not uncontested but theyve been close Salis into re the second Defender leaves so he shoots Music it boy great opportunities Music Donald Han Jr at five early points hes been quiet at this end ever since Brown swings it Chad Benning draws the second Defender near steel instead it comes back to hand who missed the layout and a foul as Salis came together with KY Shonda a 69 freshman who has come off the bench for Earl Grant Jr you know it hasnt been very pretty here to start the second half but these guys are playing hard no doubt as we talked about at halftime off Mike theres a good energy in the building its opening day theyve got a good crowd here and for a couple of teams trying to get their conference play off to a good start Beetle got the start today in place of Chaz Kelly who played limited minutes off the bench Donald hand buries the three and hillworth was in pretty good position but hand just got that off very quickly now wake this half Dan is 0 for six how many of those have been inside a 10 ft how many of those have been inside of one foot well they finally convert maybe about 3 ft away the senior from Richmond now with six the deakes back to within a Applause Music point Benning Benny they dont want him handling the ball out there no they they like him handling the ball if he can get it closer but this is just a really good pass and even though hildr has his hand up thats just a great job by Donald Sam Jr and if Reed gets the ball that close to the basket hes really tough to stop that fouls on Salis freedom of movement Salis was impeding the ball handler he doesnt like the call folks here in the building dont like the call but he was impeding the ball handle I when the referees really clamped down tightly on that stuff usually when its out on the perimeter beetle step back to Salis F the rebound and well bring it up theres been talk this year about Hunter Salis playing more of a primary ball handler role do you think that has impacted the rest of his offensive game this year Dan well its possible you know you you can always make that argument when hes not shooting the ball well from three but hes shooting it well from every place else hes a guy who would have been drafted last year maybe in the first round but decided to come back to try and win a championship here at w he and hriff have been quite a onew combination the last couple of years for the deeps well hildr just really drives hard to get really close to the Music basket hildr has not attempted a three so far today uhoh here comes Fon Reed the big sevenfooter will shoot two the Wake Forest defense with the takeaway Reed continuing to hold that Washington to recruit Hunter Salis another Gonzaga guy when Fon Reeds coach from high school from the Steward School gave mall and said you know what while youre out there my big fella actually is looking to get back East there you see Alis Williams Player of the Year in the conference Jake laravia coming from Indiana State to be an NBA draft pick Ty applebe Hunter Salis so hes out there gets a call and says you know what you might want to talk to the guy named Fon as well and it wound up being a two for one trip out to the West Coast pretty good deal great deal you get two guys like that are you kidding Music me beetle I think theyre going to get Salis Applause again that is his third now we got a lot of time left in this game for Sal to have three fouls and hes coming out and Johnson who played very well in the first half this is an important stretch here for Wake Forest and for Tyler Applause Johnson Shonda getting extended minutes so far here in the second half and no VC made its first three threes of the first half made its first two of the second halfers on the run out throws it down but that wasnt the impressive part how did that pass come in there dropped it right in the bucket Applause Music wow McFarland to the reverse and he was denied by Spillers who came up with the basketball Here Comes Tyler Johnson Reed sets the screen hildr goes the other way to find JIS for three hes into double figures and that matches his career high that he scored against Michigan last month and its now an 11 nothing Run for the deeps what a great stroke when he can step Applause into big answer for Boston College to cut what was the biggest lead of the afternoon for wake back down to five and that was McFarland who came into the game as a 12 threepoint shooter yeah just two for 16 hildr on a great back cut couldnt handle the pass maybe a little low from Reed well heres your pass and your dunk well this I mean theres one dribble and then how do you make that pass right over the hand of Shonda I thought for sure he was going to tip it so thats a great catch then to collect yourself and score easily yeah Shonda at 69 is the biggest defensive back Ive ever seen and he still couldnt get a hand on it Reed rounding out another Point Blank chance missed by the deakes you have to have your big guy has to make that shot I mean he got great position did everything but put it in the basket Beetle attacks from the right side hangs in the air tries to find the man in the corner it was deflected by a Defender out of bounds so Boston College will keep 13 on the shot Applause Music CL drive to the basket Beetle out of control here a little bit and I I think that Spiller is the guy who got his hand on the ball but was he the last to touch he indeed did touch it but his momentum was not what carried the ball in that direction I think theyve got a beef potentially Music Shonda lost it here comes Wake Forest with hildr hes going to the baset theres no way that hes going to stop I mean that was one on Two And he just powered the ball to the goal he is a consumate worker first on the floor often times for the deakes well before practice we saw that yesterday Applause Wake Forest has been really scrambling on defense in Boston College has had a hard time finding the guy whos open when theres double teams Shonda with his feet on the line thats a twopoint shot the Freshman from Congo has his first two points of the day thats only his second field goal on the season he plays very limited minutes Music Applause Harris nice post entry and Trayvon Spillers has a chance for a threepoint play that is nearly an impossible post entry from that angle but that is a great great pass the head fake gets the defender to put his arms up and then Spillers with the knives CAU that is a great great pass thread the needle with a bounce pass to make sure neither of the help Defenders could get it Spiller shaped up nicely and now the senior from Charleston South Carolina is at the line and Reed Reed goes to the bench for a rest we talked about the fact that he missed a couple of shots inside but remember hes been favoring that right hand all game Applause long but hes been really good venning has been contained and again the reason for it I think is is Reed and hes again getting treatment on that hand does not look very comfortable and with Reed out of the game venning gets a blow Applause too Chaz Kelly in at the point for BC along the Baseline Hastings made a nice pass but there were three deep Defenders all around the man who received it and theres that swarming defense youre talking about well Doug I would argue with you he made an attempted pass but when you throw the ball into trouble like that I dont know that we can Define that as a nice pass youre right nice job getting it there but youve got to be able to foresee the guy who receives it what hes going up against youre right and but the dicks as I say theyre really scrambling around and when you scramble around like that theres usually somebody open and you have to be tough enough to find the open man and BC has been struggling with that here recently parer fredon back into the game still scoreless here today Johnson with that Elite Speed able to get to the basket draw the Applause foul well the senior captain from England with the way theyve played today theyve been struggling from threepoint range and even though they have shot the three uh better today four for eight 50 the key is that eight they havent shot an overabundance of Threes but theyre wearing Boston College out on the inside 28 to 12 with points in the paint theyve now attempted 16 free throws so they are attacking and attacking inside now the first thing Steve forp said to us after practice yesterday came over and said you know for the things that are causing us some issues they havent scored the basketball well in recent days until today of course the pressure of expectation is it a thing for these Wake Forest players that notably they were picked third behind Duke in Carolina the preseason ACC poll do you think that plays a role at all for these wake fors players is strong now has 16 points they really ought to guard him yes I think it does uh because were not just talking about the preseason poll you know they read that and shrug it off but you know all the noise the social media all that kind of stuff really has to wear on and that was a mistake by Johnson abass was there getting ready to rebound the ball Johnson has to shoot that but boy how fast was he getting in there he is quick but no I I think the the pressure of expectations is always something you have to consider well the offense has been flowing much better for the Demon Deacons today strong feeling it not on that one a bass clears the rebound wake was averaging its last three games fewer than 50 points per game theyve already got 54 with more than half of the second half to go Johnson is fouled maybe clean up top but Jaden Hastings got him down below low for the personal well that was a situation where Johnson went in there looking to score not to pass and a bass a bass had a bass followed the ball it would have been a really nice opportunity for Johnson to dump it off well the competition certainly was worthy couple of top 25 teams in AM and Florida another Power conference opponent in Minnesota but I think Steve Forbes would say it was more about them than the opponent the shooting issues in recent games the threepoint numbers 6 for 28 1 for 15 and thats the game they won yeah now Boston College despite the fact that they have struggled you know on the inside and theyve turned it over a couple times they are still right in this game this is a tough hardnosed group theyre not going anywhere Eagles led by as many as 10 early McFarland gives it back strong hangs in the air and again multiple weight Forest Defenders doing their job hildr the trailer Frederickson feeds the post abass missed the reverse that was a great move got a great shot again your big guys got to make that crowd wanted to travel on Jaden I think they wanted a basket on the other end but theres a three boy thats a big turn around a basket that a bass really should make and now Boston College comes down and gets a three big triple by Fred Payne cuts the lead back to three Spillers no no whistle Boston College with a chance to tie Bo wake has missed a handful of those Applause Music today Reed and Salis will return on the next stoppage for Music weit Frederickson whistled for the foul he thought it was a good contest but pay will shoot three with a chance to tie the ball game pay has really been a factor Off the Bench this is a really nice dribble he steps him back guess what they just showed on the jumbo Applause Tru well this is not exactly an impartial group in here watching the jumbo TR no theres a lot of old gold and black tie dye as always here at the Joel so staring into the teeth of the student section for Wake Forest pay made the first and the second he is now 11 of 13 on the Year from the line this is just a great job by Boston College Wake Forest had seized control of this game and much like in the first half after Boston College seized control and wake came back the Eagles have done a great job battling bath in this game and this guy at the free throw line has been a big factor the F and Spillers are the two deakes who went to the bench with Salis and Reed coming back in and we are TI at Applause 55 well wake has missed a number of Point Blank Range shots not uncontested but still shots you would normally think you they make on the switch trying to find Reed hes got it back out to Johnson under 10 to shoot he reposts and the foul comes against Hastings little twoman game and thats a really good Twan game you know just because the guy the big guy throws it back out you know theres no reason not to throw it right back in and Reed continue to battle for position thats not always the case with Wade Reed doesnt always get it back when he kicks it out poting on the shot clock Salis swings to hildr to the corner Applause Johnson inside they go again Reed out to a wide wide open hildr VC with a chance to retake the lead Im just not sure you pass up a one foot shot for a three in 2024 you do not if youre 7t tall Farland thought about passing inside instead misses over the top here he goes so you say hes not going to look for a teammate in that situation bman will be back at the free throw line yet again their lead Wake Forest in this game nine to nothing in Second Chance points and its a 91 run for Boston College that is now 92 as wake retakes the lead uh this is obviously we just showed hes now six of seven from the line six of eight but hunter Salis has only attempted one free throw so Boston College has done a nice job keeping him bottled up and off the line BC led by as many as 10 in the first half wake has led by as many as eight here in the second sh able to save it back out to Brown offensive foul Salis is Music hurt and theyre asking for the trainer Music that was quite a collision inside now remember Salis has three personal fouls and he tries to get in the way right here I guess its not Salas it was Tyler John who stepped in there and took the three yeah he rolled his right ankle there stepped on his teammates foot and rolled that right ankle and thats that is a charging call you dont see very often because no not anymore because yeah the defender has to be in legal guarding position before the offensive players sets his last foot before he goes Airborne so Salis good to see him walk off under his own power with just a negligible limp hopefully that right ankle is okay but it looks like hes going to head back into the locker room maybe to get a look and maybe get ret taped but they dont want to be without him for any length of time 723 remaining in regulation and whats been a tight and entertaining opening day in the ACC the guy who comes in the game for him is Harris and Harris had a tremendous has had a tremendous game so far thats number two on the right wing forwe Forest big triple for for Frederickson her first points of the day and fredericksons one of those guys 90 of his shots with threes good ball movement the sophomore from Bixby Oklahoma makes it a fourpoint game once again out of control BC fortunate not to turn it over Pat Driscoll says the ball was deflected so no traveling violation Brown no hriff rips the rebound and Reed again comes away holding his hand and yet he play on hild and hes going to theine again they know whats coming and they just cant stop it again Wake Forest has done a nice job moving the ball and Johnson just draws the defense to one side with his dribble Frederickson cuts across the lane Boston College is a little late getting there his high schools alltime leading score open 2100 points at Bixby high he originally committed to Mike BR Notre Dame but then when coach Bray was parting company with the Fighting Irish Frederickson reopened his Recruitment and decided to come to Wake Forest to play for Steve Forbes instead hre Salis has returned to the bench from the locker room Music Applause lets see if BC can respond again strong good shot F on the shot clock Kelly gives it up brown attacks and throws it down where was the help defense wow it looks like Reed was coming but he was just a little bit too late and elected not to try for it but again thats what happens when you move the ball from side to side sometimes the defense is out of position that was a big basket yeah seven points for the junior out of Monument M Mountain High School in the burkers of Massachusetts foul before the shot ficks comes to help and its Elijah strong whos in the corner so hildr is reluctant to leave him because he shot the three so well Brown just beats Fon Reed to the spot but thats because the ball moves around and because strong has had a such such a good game shooting the Applause ball juk Carris makes the first tomorrow afternoon our ACC Network womens basketball triple header starts at noon Eastern with number 10 Notre Dame taking on Syracuse and then SMU squares off against Florida State well finish up with number eight Duke hosting Virginia Tech danah lson leads the nation in scoring over 27 points per game get a chance to see her for the SS tomorrow afternoon its important stretch for white forest with Salis out of the game Brown back out to Beetle timer down to five finds the open man in the corner strong a little strong with the shot readed the rebound just over five minutes remaining in regulation really nice job by wake flying around on defense on that possession Steve Forbes From the Bench just directed hildr get the ball in the hands of Johnson and let him start the offense from that Wing clean look for Harris Music that was a good Music shot Beetle gets back to that dominant left hand and Johnson who says he was being hooked gets f for the reach in Johnson has has had a very good game hes been very aggressive on defense and offense Applause both and early in the early in the game he was a little overly aggressive on the defensive end Hunter Sal the round of applause is for Hunter Salis coming back in for Tyler Johnson who takes a seat now with three personal fouls Johnson has played really well young man out of Brooklyn New York 6257 BC misses Frederickson will slow it up into the front Music Court what lineup combinations have you liked the best so far today for Wake Forest boy that was a dangerous pass Salis misses good stop big stop for BC again Ive really like Johnson in the lineup and Harris in the lineup and again we have not seen the customary starter big triple for Donald H Jr but how did he get it he got it off an offensive rebound and thats Dion Brown we talked about the fact that he is a great rebounder for a guard and we have not seen dein Cosby Jr since the first three minutes of the game did not start the second half hildr draws the contact under control as usual gets the foul call and will shoot two when we come back we set that before today about three or four times come back for the end of a good ball game here in Music Winston doubt Alabama to get two teams from the ACC in lots of drama here tonight well this is a fascinating story thats been talked about this season and you and I both yesterday talked about my how the game of college basketball has changed for this to be a fact well there these are the only five guys in the entire league who are finishing their careers where they started and who have been starters at their schools I mean that and you see all the games they play thats just remarkable you know consider how many new guys everybody has every year and a school like Louisville they have everybody new there are lots of schools like that around the country especially with a coaching change you get an entirely new roster well both teams have shot better than 40 from distance BC has done more of it with 12 made threes in the lane thats a nice two look twopoint shot good looking shot by Chad ven and that is the first time that venning has been able to get that shot and thats his favorite shot out of Bishop Lin high school in Brooklyn back to a twopoint game with just over three minutes remaining when Boston College shooting the ball so well from three that means that there might be more openings inside for Venom Cross Court to Harris the big guys battling inside now five of the shot clock here goes HRI fouled before the shot as brown couldnt get a step on him and commits the personal thats been wakes Forest Wake forests offense and thats five fouls on Brown and hes been a critical guy in this game hes got seven points and six rebounds but thats been wake forests offense at the end of the shot clock HTH puts the ball down and goes they havent been able to stay in front of it hild eight of 10 from the line so far this afternoon Applause he leads all scores with 19 well its one thing to be able to get to the line and then he gets the line and he makes him thats such a Applause weapon Beetle off the hesitation another chance for the Eagles and a foul against against Donald H Jr thats the seventh team foul on weight and another offensive rebound that Boston College theyve really been able to convert these and Donald Han 4 BC is the right guy to go to the line hes really the Eagles best free throw shooter since Olivier Handlin a decade ago of course handland was the ACC Rookie of the Year in 2013 but some of the things that hand does at the line hes 87 thirdd best in the ACC this year and so if youre the Eagles you want number 133 at the strike well we just showed you before that free throw they were 12 TN up in second chance points now 13 make that 140 overweight forest and points after offensive rebounds and if not for the free throw shooting lately of Cameron hildr Wake is not scored the basketball its been over four and A2 minutes since their last made field goal well this is this is typical Austin College very gritty physical on the defensive end haris thought about it finds hildr in the high post to the open man Salis strong big rebound Spillers back out to Applause hild Boston College was in his zone now they switch back to the manto man Harris had it poked away whose ball is it its the Eagles ball Fred Payne playing some good defense and Payne has been a factor on the offensive end and Harris Harris did a pretty nice job he gets by but he just cant finish that in fact nobody hits the ball he just loses Applause Music it BC down two be keeps the dribble tries again misses in the exact same manner he did last time down I think he was aware of the presence of Reed and hes trying to extend his arm and Float the ball up a little higher than Applause Music necessary Earl Grants team down by two in the closing moments here at the theyve had to shoot the three pretty well because Wake Forest has done a nice job cutting off the inside venning has basically been a nonfactor on the offensive end hildr having a season high performance followed by one of the BC Defenders strong appeared to get it clean up top well that was that was be who picked up the th and so hildr who has season highs with both 20 points and nine rebounds heads back to the line are you uniform number guy do you remember Guys numbers what was your number by the way at UVA I I remember that number my number was 43 all right reason I ask is that hildr through his first three years did not wear number six he switched to his childhood number the one his dad wore when he was a professional basketball player thats because its only very recently that you could have number six in college basketball yes things have changed oh my Boston College with a chance to retie or retake the lead so wake Force got exactly what they wanted Hill with the ball in the low post and he misses the two free throws P lost it Johnson had it for a moment it comes to Harris that is some defensive play by hild he knocked that ball Applause away time called by wake well be back in 30 seconds with Cameron hildr and the daks clinging to a twopoint lead Music Music Applause hildr came into the game averaging 11 points per game he has nearly doubled that but a couple of big Miss free throws on their last possession keeps the game at 6664 W those Miss free throws about the only thing hes done wrong today not only does he have those points but hes got nine rebounds hes got a couple of steals hes got a couple of assists and again those nine rebounds and those 20 points are season highs and this the 11th game played a lot of games has we I think if youre wake you want to take the ball to the basket you dont want the Applause seven Spillers shot clock at three as he rises up and scor that really a tough Applause shot strong strong is fouled by Spillers oh hes got to be careful I know he thinks he got a good block but you certainly dont want to get a technical foul in this situation strong has been very aggressive offensively gets a little fade Applause away and again guess what they just showed on the Jumbotron Dan hes smiling only on the outside coach fors not smiling at all Applause Strongs a 68 free throw shooter on the year perfect swish on the first now remember one of the things that wakes had a problem with today is defensive rebounding so if he misses you got to make sure you block out and get the ball e Reed Joshua Beetle having a conversation along the lane as strong makes a pair back to a twopoint game time is called 351 remaining in regulation well and so that means that Boston College is going to get the ball back if they dont foul so you can get a defensive stop here because youll still have 51 seconds left even if they run the shot clock all the way down as soon as we finish here in Winston Salem will get you to the dean doome North Carolina and Georgia Tech scheduled for a 200 tip theyll be getting underway shortly but we will wrap things up just as soon as were done with the Eagles and the Demon Deacons you see the reset but both teams have timeouts and Boston College well excuse me Wake Forest is in the double bonus so theyll shoot two on the F but I think one of the key things right there is The Possession era which at the moment favors Boston College Harris hildr Salis Reed and Spillers out there for Wake Music Forest Eagles in their full core Applause pressure Parris going to have to use a time out thats the last timeout thats Wake Forest last time out and the other thing of the people on the floor for Wake Forest at the Music moment the in college Beetle and hand are the two Defenders on those two guys they do get it into Salis hes bottled up immediately dangerous pass and its stolen with a foul against Wake Forest a huge play for the Eagles charge to number six well that was a great double team and you get to think about okay I dont want to get a 10sec count here remember wake just used their last timeout so Salis was not in a position where he could call timeout that thats exactly what Boston College wanted to do you get the double team your force a tough pass very good free throw shooter at the line missed it big rebound for Reed and hes fouled and he and Pat Drisco wind up taking a seat together about Applause Locker Applause charge the fouls on beet no its charg the strong excuse me and so we walk 94 ft to the other end Fon Reed going to the free throw line we talked about the fact that hes a 58 free throw shooter coming in hes three out of four today by the way thats four fouls on Applause Music strong now you make this when you put Boston College in a bit of a box Salis who rolled his ankle earlier in the second half seems to still be favoring it a bit he goes out Tyler Johnson comes back in for Music defense over clut free throw now strong strong looking for that shot missed it hriff with his 10th rebound and he will head back to the foul line if youre Boston College you know you have a little bit of an opening there you have to take that shot strong has shot the ball very well today you you need two possessions and so you had to get the ball up there and then hildr again just doing everything H the line 20 points 10 rebounds season highs in both and on only eight field field goal attempts just about all those field goal attempts were bulling his way to the basket well after having just missed a pair at the line atypically gets back to normal on the first making it extra difficult now for Boston College trailing by six now if youre wake Force the only thing you got to defend is the three Beetle oh my Johnson was lucky there and now it looks like the eagles are going to let Wake Forest dribble it out the Demon Deacons open up the ACC regular season with a 7266 victory and remain unbeaten here in Winston
