played a few minutes last year a much more experienced North Carolina team as we are now ready for the chip of our Sonic Blockbuster matchup Applause and not surprisingly at all the atmosphere is great just as it will be in Chapel Hill a month from now Roger ayersberg Smith AJ Desai are the officials and the Tar Heels with the opening check Derek Lively the second starting out on Armando baycat and you know that Carolina wants to play inside out early Carolina coming off a onepoint loss on Wednesday against Pitt Duke coming off a twopoint win Tuesday overweight Davis with a miss and the long rebound out to Roach boy roach aggressively puts it up comes up empty and its out of bounds to Carolina as tonights starting lineups are brought to you by degree going to get a very experienced Carolina team Davis Love leaky black Armando baycott all with a ton of experience in this rivalry and Pete Nance a grad transfer from Northwestern of course a much younger Duke team with all kinds of freshmen on the floor along with Jeremy roach one on one in the post now here comes the double to try to get the ball out of the hands of bacon Ava blood has played two very good games in this building 25 is a freshman 22 is a sophomore and Carolina won them both they have won the last two times theyve come to Cameron and remember he had 28 in that huge game in the final four and was Unstoppable in the second half a little strong for Tyrese Proctor kicked back out by Mark Mitchell Duke wants to move the ball from side to side get some ball reversals and then attack Proctor attacks and rolls off the back of the iron to bakeout already North Carolinas alltime leading rebounder still with a bunch of games to go RJ Davis off the screen over Derek Lively Lively got a piece but a baycott there to clean it up boy what a smart play by RJ Davis to knock the ball after it got blocked he had the presence of mind to knock the ball to baycot and RJ Davis has been struggling his last two one of ten from threepoint range averaging about eight and a half points per game in his last two first took that elbow to the guy in the Syracuse game a week and a half ago missed a few days of practice roach uses the screen and it wont go down off the window and another rebound for Bangkok and bacon is a oneman gang on the defensive boards good match up love and the Freshman Tyrese Proctor lob again now one for two from Beyond The Arc the rebound to Roach Caleb love settled right there he needs to get to the freethrow line more with his athleticism he is a downhill driver but hes not shooting near as many free throws this year as he did last year Carolina going under those screens roach with the elbow jumper and Duke on the board and thats going to be available when North Carolinas in drop coverage on ball screens that midrange jump shot especially for Jeremy roach is going to be a good shot Davis frees himself up and he knocks it down as you mentioned struggled his last time out just three for 15 against Pitt Hubert Davis hoping that a few more days of practice shake the rust off getting a little further away from the eye injury that RJ Davis will be back to his normal self here tonight well his normal self is one of the best guards in the country one of the best free throw shooters youre going to see Derek Lively launches a three and comes up empty a good start here for Carolina with an early fivepoint lead bacon into the chest of lively who got a piece of it shot clock does not reset they caught again into the chest of lively and again he altered the shot already the game physical inside but Lively holding his ground one of the best shot blockers in the country Proctor boy and a couple of Blue Devils had a hand on it but couldnt knock it down love nice shovel pass Babcock couldnt handle it roach for three cop just couldnt grab that little pass the dropoff but thats a good shot in transition years ago you wanted to get all the way to the basket but a pullup three in transition is a great opportunity good pace and a long stretch without a whistle here in this one steal by Proctor philipowski will lay it in to tie the game Carolina a little too casual on that dribble handoff Tyrese Proctor whos a very good Defender he is longarmed and athletic and really starting to come on love with a crossover kicks it back out leaky black Pete Nance and itll be Carolina Ball but we come back a frenetic Pace Jay to start this one between Caroline and Duke just what we expected a physical contest where the glass is going to be the key but Caleb love just a little step back three from Deep and then a fantastic play by RJ Davis to tip the ball after the block shot and then Jeremy roach he is really starting to come on for Duke and they need him to be the man in this one Applause Music fun fact people will still be impressed when you surprise them with a treat from McDonalds even when you got it for free using reward points because no one

spectacle the most intense playoffs in sports Applause that is hockey Music ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by John Deere nothing runs like a deer run with us this is the Blue Devils Lair here deep below ground level a few levels down here to Cameron Indoor Stadium I have not been down there I I have not done much mascot work in my career although you have been in several layers before I believe in her time but uh that hes got all kinds of different signs and sayings and obviously when Carolina comes to town to more than any other program theyre going to hear it from the fans here to Cameron two unranked teams they were both unranked in both games two years ago those two games in this game Jay the only three times in the last 60 plus Seasons that both have been unranked in this game but you know what if you didnt know any better you wouldnt know any better walking in this feels like every other Carolina Duke that weve always done which means theres a lot on the line here tonight already Derek Lively II has been a presence in this game with his shot blocking he was rolling to the rim they just couldnt complete the pass but with Lively in the game Dukes field goal percentage defense at The Rim is 15 percent better he has three blocked shots already in this game he averages two a game and thats not in a ton of minutes his play has really picked up the last few weeks and well say it for the second time tonight RJ Davis looks like his normal self yeah hes back and that midrange jump shot because of the drop coverage that Duke plays is going to be there all night unless theres an adjustment with a hard hedge or a flathead Davis averaging 16 better than 16 points per game one of three Tar Heels averaging better than 16 and 18 per game along with love and bacon Carolina able to play with their heels on the threepoint line theyre not concerned with threepoint shots they want to protect the paint turnaround wont go for Kyle filipowski who comes in here on a tear with five double doubles in his last six games theres that middle ball screen and roll love into bacon he got fouled in the middle of the floor it is so difficult to pick up baycot as the Roman he sets that screen and then immediately rolls to the basket so if Derek Lively is going to try to impact the ball at all he goes to it and stays with it too long and because RJ Davis adjusted up his man cant get in there and tag and get in front of Armando baycott when he rolls the middle of the floor that middle third is going to be where Carolina attacks with that ball screen baycott having another great season averaging almost 18 points per game better than 11 rebounds per game subs for Duke including the grad transfer Ryan young another Northwestern guy so Pete Nance and Ryan young team four years at Northwestern and now theyre on opposite sides of this rivalry Armando baycott spends a lot of time right here at the freethrow line he shoots about eight free throws per game and Carolina makes about 18 on average the playing against North Carolina you have to play good physical defense without fouling theyre going to spend a lot of time at the line Proctor bringing it up for Duke when roach missed those four games with a toe injury Proctor assumed more of the ball handling responsibilities and now John Shire feels like hes got two equally capable quarterbacks out there on the court roach with a strong move but he cant finish it young with the offensive rebound and then love is called for the travel boy Ryan young just has a knack for offensive rebounding he reads where the ball is coming off and if he doesnt have an immediate stick back he looks to try to get it back out for an open threepoint shot yeah you always say about a guy like young hes not an Above the Rim guy but boy is he good below he is a terrific rebounder gave a stand right with Jeremy roach he is not going to help off out of bounds and itll be Carolina ball and baycott shaking his head as if to say to Young you cant do that to me and one of the things North Carolina is doing on Tyrese Proctor theyre going underneath screens theyre not as concerned about him hitting a three they want to make sure he stays out of the paint and the double drag up top Roll Pop Davis for three rebound leaky black and back comes Duke both teams missing some opportunities around the rim roach yes but Jeremy roach has been aggressive in transition and when Dukes been able to secure a defensive rebound theyve had a couple opportunities in transition to run theres that Zoom action and roach stand right with Caleb love taking away that handoff option Davis turns the corner baycott lays it in Armando bake out so good at setting a ball screen Wing or side and rolling right to the basket and presenting himself you stay with the ball too long and they just drop it off to him five field goals for Carolina Jay RJ Davis has scored two of them and assisted on the other three Granderson off to young pretty twoman basketball for a beautiful pass bacon had to step up to stop the Granderson drive and a beautiful pocket pass to Ryan young thats beautiful basketball getting a little physical between Nance and filipowski love with a sweet bounce pass and another bucket for bacon right now Carolinas able to attack the paint and thats what Duke really wants to prevent they want to protect the paint make Carolina score over the top of them and right now Carolinas been able to turn Corners you turn Corners you draw help and then play off it Another Touch for young defended by baycott really good at pivoting Granderson for three rebound black North Carolina can close out short and be a little bit late to those shots they just want to stop drives first and foremost faycott spinning on young draws a crowd finds a wide open nap young the rebound not going to get a better shot really good pass by Armando baycat out of the double again a long stretch without a whistle and as soon as we say that weve got one and a Timeout on the floor Carolina with a fourpoint lead Midway through the first half Jason on ABC Music welcome to the film room with Duke head coach John Shire and coach were going to look at your offense here youre going to get Jeremy roach into what you call floppy action where hes got a decision to make which side does he come out on and we give him the option here which way to go Mitchell clears out and we can get him downhill thats best but still we do a great job when we have a chance to hit the post not just a score but also to make reads and get cuts and we call this a deal move right here where you know Ryan just goes right at Tyrese we get some good things that can happen and then all the time we work on with our guards reading what the defender does here Hildreth goes under and this is an automatic shot for our guards anytime we shoot we won our three fours and fives crashing the boards now Ryan young gets the offensive rebound here if he doesnt you want the immediate stick back if he has it but if he doesnt have it what do you want we want relocation threes and you know for us this has been a staple to do basketball for a long time you get off as a rebound relocate and me and you were talking about it but the percentage that that our players shoot off an offensive rebounds seems to be a much higher percentage from a normal three thanks to coach Shire thats the film room you did this with Rick Barnes and Knoxville a couple of weeks ago for Duke or for any team for that matter Jay how much of the offense or set plays so that how much are hey read and React to what youre seeing and go make a play a little bit of both Duke has a number of set plays on its menu they like to get down in transition and just flow into offense but theyve got a number of sets that they run and then counters great shot fake by phillipowski I mean that allowed him to get right into the paint to Jalen Washington who made a great move on the other end its nice to see Washington back when Armando baycott got hurt against Virginia went out of the game Washington came in and that shot that just opened up the lane but Washington came in and he wound up having 13 points and six rebounds was taking off and then he injured his ankle again against Boston College but he is a special talent and you saw when he caught the ball on the other end he just gives a little inside pivot to face up and he can make that 15foot jumper and I think hes got the ability maybe not in this game tonight but hes going to be able to stretch it out to three Jalen Washington is a special talent and he hes going to be a ridiculously good player Young out Lively back in philipowski at the line the he leads the team in scoring rebounding and steals the seven time ACC rookie of the week so far this season and the only freshman in the country averaging better than 159 on the season and you really have to sit on his right hand he is a right driver first he can go left but youd rather have him go left than right sneaky pass from love into Nance and a block is called on filipowski his first usually when Nance drives the ball he likes to drive metal and this time more to the Baseline side but a spin back to the middle to the bench Nance has scored 34 points in Carolinas last two games and Hubert Davis has talked to him about being aggressive and he said Nance was a little worried early about stepping on some toes this veteran group that made it all the way to the national championship game a year ago and Hubert keeps telling him there are no toes dont worry about the toes go be aggressive when he first got to North Carolina Hubert Davis told him hey man I want you to be a dude like dont defer just because you havent been there Ive been here and when Nance is aggressive I mean he can shoot it hes not quite the Brady manic shooter thats really going to stretch the floor and make seven threes in a game like manic could in any given game and hes not the rebounder that manic was but hes a good player Carolina fans also happy to see Puck Johnson back in the game thatll be a goaltending call on lively Johnson missing the last three with a knee injury count that basket for RJ Davis whos having himself a good first half you can really tell how Carolina has been Resolute to drive the ball theyre putting Duke in positions where theyre having to help and rotate and Carolina can play out of it rather than settling for jump shots and I think this is when Carolina looks the best is when theyre aggressive getting into the paint Proctors soft touch on the floater to get Duke back within five Tyrese Proctor has really changed this Duke team taking over as the primary point guard last five games hes averaging 12 points and four assists hes an excellent Defender and he leads Duke and it says and hes going to be a really good player boy another good pass from love but another rejection for Lively and Proctor down with the board Duke has numbers Granderson in transition count the basket and a foul when Duke is able to grab a defensive rebound they have gotten Outlet passes and they are running thus far the transition Advantage has gone Dukes way an excellent pass ahead to Jacob grandison RJ Davis not in position to take the charge just got clipped on the side and Granderson able to finish the play while hes on his back and Jay thats a big call that is number two on RJ Davis with 8 45 to go in the half he sits freshman Seth Trimble is into the game for the first time now for the heels Seth Trimble is a great driver very athletic and an outstanding onball Defender but he does not stretch the floor hes only made one three on the season so youre going to be able to help off of him and sag off of him Washington Baseline on lively out of bounds off Roach so Davis has to sit bacon is on the bench right now so you wonder if love feels hey I got to take it upon myself a little bit more to do the scoring or if they still have some other options out there Im not sure his mindset ever changes from Im gonna do some scoring hes a scoring guard but the question is what kind of shots will he take and if he continues first and foremost to be a driver and then take the the perimeter shots when theyre there I think Caleb love is at his absolute best you know people talk about his shot selection and and thats fair rightfully so but how do you balance you know tell him to take shot and take certain shots but he can make difficult ones as evidenced by the final four last year when he made about as difficult a shot as youre going to make huge three in the last minute three of the 28 he had to send Carolina into the championship game its feisty and its fun so far here with Cameron Procter in his first game in this rivalry with a floater Carolina of two on Duke Applause about two moments that are certainly making Carolina fans smile right now as we take a look at tonights Sonic Blockbuster in the last 100 games theyre 50 50 in the last hundred and eleven Carolina is up by one in that one the win of the national semifinal last night when that guy Caleb love had 28 and once again Jay the third time hes come into this building in his career and the third time he is playing well well hes doing it a little bit differently in this game from some games hes played recently gets his shoulders and his torso passed the defender Jalen Blakes took the bump and how much better is Caleb love when hes aggressive getting into the paint hes such a strong athletic guard and he should be making a living at the freethrow line five career games against the Blue Devils better than 20 points per game for love coming into this one good defensive matchup here with Seth Trimble guarding Jeremy roach he seems like Seth Trimble was born in a stance so explosive and such a good arm ball Defender and he may get some good minutes here with RJ Davis on the bench with two roach tries it again kicks to Grand to sit in the corner got to get a shot off and a shot clock violation gives it back to Carolina give credit there to the Freshman Seth Trimble and we talked hes not the offensive player yet but he can be but defensively you dont see many freshman guard and guard the ball like Seth Trimble and hell bring it up to take love off the ball at least for now baycott has returned for the heels philipowski has returned for the Blue Devils another ball screen for love and another good look puff Johnson for three What A Difference Maker puff Johnson can be because he can stretch the floor he missed his last three games with a knee we had 12 points against Louisville 11 points against Notre Dame he was a huge lift to North Carolina in the national championship game against Kansas gives them another offensive threat on the floor that you have to guard on the perimeter Lakes being hounded by love philipowski will answer with a three of his own Jalen Washington not used to guarding that far out on the floor and its almost like philipowski either knew it or could feel it little horns action out top for North Carolina Duke going under on Seth Trimble theyre going to invite him to shoot that three Washington with a corner three Mitchell the save and he finds Blakes great play Lake still playing with that Batman mask broke his nose in practice January the 17th he looks like a superhero how much better are the mass now when you break your nose and phillipowski stepped out of bounds North Carolina getting some ball screen action and then a great throwback on the shake action just terrific job and a terrific pass and then a nice little jab step just got Jalen Washington back up a bit and philipowski he can really shoot it yep Nance a little indecisive there between putting the ball down and passing it and he ends up turning it over I dont think he expected Jeremy roach to be in the passing Lane he got in between the ball and Seth Trimble and not as much as anything caused the walk two coaches who played in this rivalry each of them between their playing careers being an assistant coach and now tonight has been in more than 30 Carolina Duke games rebound Nance so John Shire Huber Davis know all about this rivalry thus far North Carolina doing a pretty good job on the defensive glass and Duke statistically the second best offensive rebounding team in the nation they get better than 38 percent of their misses good throwback wide open three filipowski too strong thats one area Duke has not been able to consistently knock down perimeter shots this season boy what a bad pass theres nowhere for Bay cop to go once he caught it Mitchell he went right into the chin of puff Johnson he led into his chin theyre just a strong drive by Mark Mitchell watch this here boom Applause Music Johnson got the worst of that hes okay Mitchell at the line for a couple averaging about nine points four rebounds per game good Wing Defender as each coach sends in a couple of Subs and for jubert Davis our first look at DeMarco Dunn hes 65 sophomore from Tucson Arizona you know its funny when that kind of thing happens and who knows they probably would have wouldnt have called that anything it would have just been a basketball play but if you tough it out and just get up their officials dont go to the monitor if you hold your jaw maybe you got a chance theyll take a look at it yep Carolina shooting 42 percent Duke just 35 Carolina leading by three theyre both seven and four in League Play they are tied for sixth in the ACC but again the top two teams in the league Clemson and Virginia in the league standings both lost today so whoever wins this one just one game out of the loss column in a game and a half out for the league lead Dunn kept it alive but it bounces free to Proctor going all the way another transition basket for Duke when they get a defensive rebound they have been shot out of a cannon and Tyrese Proctor forced the Carolina defense to stop the ball nobody did they were trailing him and he winds up getting the easy transition bucket and thats got the building rocking again here as duke is back within one look at the difference from The Fast Break points 130 well traditionally talk about Carolinas fast break but Duke has been scoring most of its points in transition ahead of the Carolina defense done into the paint lost it got it back they caught the rebound might as well have been a pass fate got such a great offensive rebounder remember no RJ Davis still on the bench with two long three for love and Duke can take the lead and thats the kind of shot where you say Caleb love what are you thinking there hes had such success getting into the lane he can make that shot but at that point in the clock it wasnt necessary Roach and yet another rebound for baycott thatll be his sixth of drag screen in transition good throw the pullup by leaky black is short and thats not the shot that Carolina wants leads to a run out Mitchell to Roach and Duke has the lead North Carolinas offense has not helped its defense some of the shots that the Tar Heels have been taking have led to run out where Duke is able to play ahead of the Carolina defense and in the full court fast break points it has been all Duke in Cameron Indoor Stadium Music youre in a hurry Im off to Americas Best I heard what you said

only at Sonic so machines from college game day this morning Eric Cameron Indoor Stadium always a great venue for the morning show the Jeep halftime report is coming up shortly Holly Will preview it Stephan ponds okay fine you like Derek Livelys impact so far in this game whats he doing well well I love what hes doing hes rocking and altering shots theyve got to get Armando breakout involved in offense but they got to get him on the Move theyre gladly too tall for him to come see straight over thats right just eight points for Armando and Seth what do you think theyve got to do better for Carolina what RJ Davis went out shot selection obviously was impacted when the shot selections impacted your defensive transition is compromised Dukes doing a great job of pushing off and misses and when Carolina gets in Lane theyre not covering the backcourt they aint crush the defensive transition all right see you in the half guys thank you Holly you saw RJ Davis is back into the game Jay sat for almost five minutes with those two fouls Huber Davis looking for for a bit of a spark here towards the end of the first half and RJ Davis three of six from the field when he went out and he is such a good ball handler passer good pass by Armando baycat and black with a bucket fake copy assist and thats one of the reasons Armando Bacon needs to touch the ball more when North Carolina plays inside out I think their offense much more effective Music theres Lively by the way with four blocks in the first half Purdue philipowski driving on Nance and a foul philipowski just went right into the chest of Pete Nance to draw that foul and then bacon looks middle to see if the doubles coming it wasnt and just shot that pass right across court right past the outstretched arms of Mark Mitchell for an easy basket for leaky black just a really good pass for Armando beta but thats I think thats the way North Carolina needs to to play inside out continue to attack the paint draw help and then kick it out to open shooters that can knock down an open shot or shot fake and drive the closeout the Lebowski The Freshman one of 20 wooden late season candidates for the wooden award there are four in the ACC Armando baycat is another one the other two of the ACC Isaiah Wong from Miami to Cleveland Smith from NC State and phillipowski has been so consistent and a high level since last three hes averaging over 21 a game nine rebounds shooting 50 from the floor slack to the Elbow Nance kicks to Davis and the weak side follow for baycod for two more but that was really good offense because Carolina got it from one side of the floor to the other made the defense move and thats when Armando baycats even more difficult to box out and look at the numbers ten and seven all ready for bacon villopowski getting more aggressive but he cant finish it black from the corner and it rattles out leaky black started off the season shooting the three very well 13 of his first 33 about 40 percent two for his last 20 coming in as Proctor puts Duke back on top or Tyrese Proctor is really starting to Blossom he should still be in high school Duke got him to come a year early out of Australia played at the NBA Academy and he is a future NBA player good drive and the finish for black just blew right by Mitchell everybody was up near the freethrow line Carolina lifted up their offense and there was no weak side help and just a great drive by leaky black you mentioned that two for 20 when hes that wide open in the corner the corners his spot he still has to take that shot Proctor again what a game hes having but his expression never changes Jay he looks like the the coolest cat in the building hes played a lot of highlevel basketball in his young career but hes really starting to come on and that frees up Jeremy roach he doesnt have to take over ball handling responsibilities and he just think about scoring coming off screens baycott spins on philipowski and it goes two more for Armando Baytown anytime Armando baycott gets the ball in the left block hes going to look to spin toward the Baseline and then he spun back and thats a difficult shot that he made baycott takes it away and Carolina can take the lead in the final minute of the half were just a lazy pass fake not able to step in front and knock that away horns action up top they can throw back done getting some minutes loves been on the bench for a few minutes for Carolina mans with a step back blocked by philipowski and he got hit going up and the officials didnt call it Hubert Davis is incensed and John

going up for a shot theres no question that Eddie as he was coming up he was fouled and Hubert did not like it at all and he wasnt alone on that Carolina bench well thats about as angry as you will ever see Hubert Davis and he is still talking with Bert Smith one of the officials about the noncall Duke with a onepoint lead and the ball with 218 seconds to go in the first half here at Cameron do this has returned for Carolina RJ Davis sits remember hes got the two fouls so they dont want him in here right now on defense or Proctors had a nice half Rick wants to go with about eight on the clock that gives him an option for an offensive rebound but not Carolina the chance to take it the other way Proctor to Granderson hell get a good look at a three and thatll do it in the first half here in Durham and we have a foul called I believe Bert Smith has called a foul and theyre going to look and see if the foul was called Before Time expired it really doesnt matter they can look and see but its not free throws Duke only had four team fouls so it wont result in a one and one Applause so it would go on Roach Applause if indeed it was called but as Jay said no free throws it would just be a personal foul on roach but again this theoretically there might be some time put back on the clock maybe 2 or 03 but it wont be very much Kurt Smith and Roger Ayers looking it over Applause dont want to know do our ratings go up with as much television as the officials watch in these games youre just campaigning for Morgan you always tell me ratings go up when they put you on camera the money maker baby well I think we expected a close one Jay and were getting a close one these two teams listen Carolina was number one in the country preseason Duke was number seven you know neither program has probably had the kind of three months or so that they wanted to have but theres a lot of upside for both of these teams going forward no question and for North Carolina at halftime you know that theyre going to be talking about defensive transition and we mentioned earlier in the game Carolinas this goes for both Duke and North Carolina your offense has to help your defense you take a bad shot youre out of balance and all of a sudden you allow a runoff and in the first half it has been all Duke in transition you know the fast break points 16 to nothing in favor of Duke the foul is on roach and twotenths of a second on the clock Carolina inbounds and now its halftime with Duke leading by one 3332 Jeremy roach leading the way for Duke with 10 Armando baycott 127 at the break for Carolina Holly Rose with John Shire well coach a lot of your players are young in this rivalry experiencing it for the first time how do you like their composure employees in the first half yeah I love what they did I thought it took us a few minutes between these two programs and the Blue Devils with a onepoint lead on the Tar Heels foreign and this RJ Davis Jeremy roach matchup is a good one at the two guard spot another floater this one he leaves it a little bit short Carolina needs to do a better job of grabbing a defensive rebound and getting out in transition a leaky black leaky black grabbed that rebound but it was a slow break Mansion to baycow spins around Lively and left it just a little bit short but leaky black digs it out but itll be a held ball the possession arrow will keep it with the heels Tar Heel coach Huber Davis had a chance to speak with Holly Rowe during halftime well coach how did your commitment to the glass pay off in that first half limiting their second chance opportunities well I thought really good job of boxing them out as I told you before you know theyre the best in the conference of getting Second Chance opportunities so for us weve got to limit them to watch every possession I thought we did a good job of that in the first half but well have to do that in the second half fast break points you know they scored half of their points off a transition and thats off of our turnovers and bad shots so we clean up the turnovers in a bad shop and continue to try to attack the basket we get you to free through a lot more than anybody in the conference weve only been to the free throw line three times my hope is thatll change so Jay how does Carolina get to the line more in the second half continue to continue to attack the pain in the first half especially Caleb love early in the first half they did a good job of turning the corner off ball screens and getting into the paint drawing help and then playing out of it but they cant just settle for jumpers I mean that by Pete Nance should have been a shot face and a drive you know that was a settle over a seven footer the Lebowski eight points in the first half now into double figures philipowski has got a ton of game and when he adds in he can play Down In the post but he can catch it a step off face up or he can turn around shoot over you hes a freshman playing against a fifth year senior in Pete Nance mans for three too strong and a foul underneath going on its Lively yep philipowski because he can shoot it he can catch it a couple steps off the lane that was a good job by Pete Nance to push him off the lane but philipowskis got that shooting Touch where that little 12foot jumper is a really good shot for him and Pete Nance just had his hands down didnt discourage the shot they caught a touch and kicks it back out Lively defending him well love fouled by Proctor Crocker just got that left elbow right into the chest of Caleb love and then on the ball reversal love looking to drive it middle and that puts a ton of pressure on the defense just a simple ball reversal gave a a little fake to his left and then drove it right and he is primarily a right driver he could drive it out of the way but hes much better driving to his right Davis the kick and the corner three for leaky black thats his spot if hes going to knock down a perimeter shot its going to be from the corner that was all because of the action in the middle of the floor that Drew help Proctor boy great pace and he lays it in Duke back on top he just read the secondary Defender that being Armando bake out if bacott steps up he dishes it off if not he takes it all the way he is showing more and more of his skill set week by week Davis into the chest of lively thats the fifth block of the night for lively so long and athletic can take the bump and still block the shot Mitchell leans in and finishes Duke by four thats Mitchells first basket and he got it off the lefthand drive into the middle leaky black not playing his left hand to keep him out of the middle the reverse wont go for Bangkok play a quick move but Lively bothered it Lively beat him down the floor yeah he might have altered as many as hes blocked tonight much more of a factor Derek Lively the second than he was in the first couple of months of the season hes healthy now and hes a really good Rim Runner and an excellent shot blocker tough angle there for roach and it grazes the side of the backboard love Baseline floater too strong just off one side of the floor now Carolina never reversed the ball and put pressure on Dukes defense Mitchell driving on black and its down to the heels Davis needs some help and he finds love the switch Davis step back over phillipowski and its Duke ball Derek Lively the second has been an impact player in protecting the rim and Dukes Rim protection defense with him in the game and over the last several games has been 15 better absorbs the bump still blocked it with his left hand and Mark Mitchell with the left hand drive spinning back to the right and getting the bucket against leaky blacks college basketball is brought to you by under two dollar craves from Sonic for a limited time only at Sonic our thanks to chicoa Cartwright who is Manning the fan cam for us tonight favorite Cameron Indoor Stadium and to kill a car right as soon as shes a freshman here at Duke and he wants to take your job one day and to call a lunch come on up right now its a wonderful opportunity Toccoa to rest your voice with some of our for both playbyplay professionals you can get a word in edgewise come on up Dan Schulman J Bellis Holly Rowe and the game day gang all with you here at Cameron Indoor Stadium the 260th meeting between Carolina and Duke of 259th rather meeting between Carolina and Duke Carolina leading the alltime series 143115 I think Dukes got a look to Kyle felipowski roach got caught in the air and fortunate that he was able to kind of Bounce It Off baycot out of bounds to retain possession as Puff Johnson comes into the game now for Pete Nance for the heels and now leaky black is guarding Kyle filipowski and on the perimeter thats a pretty good matchup for black but I think philipowski can take him down into the post itll be Mitchell over Johnson and baycott holds off Lively so that Davis can get the rebound Duke switching exchanges between guards now that puts roach on Caleb love the kick blacks hit 13 here in the second half not this time and its Duke ball Proctor ahead phillipowski and yet another run out for Duke after a defensive rebound they are getting run out after run out thats been the difference in the game largest lead of the night for the Blue Devils baycott spins Lively got him again Applause and then baycott had to get rid of it as he was falling out of bounds itll be Duke ball Derek Lively II has been a presence around the rim blocking and changing shots but after this shot by leaky black the rebound bounces out and a great pass ahead to the sprinting Kyle filipowski wait Dukes transition offense has been stellar Lively has not scored hes only attempted one shot but hes been about as impactful as anybody in the game with the six blocks Davis with a burst of speed great look extra pass to the corner for three or the second three and we talked about that corner but North Carolina with a little bit of a push and the ball movement was excellent second assist of the night for Caleb love Dukes starting to spread the floor and even though baycott is not coming out to guard Lively I think they have to look to philipowski let him touch it Applause instead itll be Mitchell with one opportunity Mark Mitchell shoots close to 40 percent from three and he is a long athletic forward thats a lefty and this is a drive to his right and puff Johnson just catching him with the body and he finishes the play but thats really good ball movement the kick out after the penetration into the lane and then finding a wide open leaky black in the corner and the sub coming in now for John Shire Ryan young will take the place of lively who gets another huge Ovation as he makes his way to the bench Ryan young an excellent offensive rebounder that just knows how to play so you have to think that North Carolina is going to try to take advantage of the rim protection being on the bench and let Armando baycott touch it and go to work Jay the Tar Heels have just two made field goals in the second half the two threepointers from leaky black now you can add a three from caleblo Caleb love needs to be aggressive he was left open that was a rhythm three and one that you want to see him take its the challenge threes after just one pass that put Carolinas transition defense in a problem what a screen by Young roach too strong heres Davis give credit to Duke for getting back it looked like Carolina might be able to take that a little bit quicker down the floor Davis the drive cut off by the help defense grandison black had the three but hesitated the no long rebound to Proctor and he turns it over Johnson love bacon will finish Carolina back within one and thats the first transition basket for North Carolina off the Bad pass by Tyrese Proctor they deflected it and took it the other way and timeout John Shire and Duke this has usually been a staple of North Carolinas offensive attack transition not a good decision by Tyrese Proctor that lets North Carolina play ahead of the Duke defense and an easy lob to Armando baycott and Cole Anthony now with the Orlando Magic he knows a little bit about transition basketball Joel emitted the Sixers at Madison Square Garden to take on the Knicks featuring former Blue Devil RJ bear that game comes your way six oclock Eastern time we showed you Cole Anthony remember now the Orlando Magic so hes teammates with a couple of former Blue Devils and Carol Wendell Carter Jr I would imagine theres uh some pretty interesting maybe side bets going on Jay between the two former Blue Devils and the one former Tarheel there always is Applause all right yes thats some good screens Proctor off the back of the iron and the rebound to RJ Davis and Carolina can reclaim the lead boy big battle between baycott and young down on the Block love spins hangs and hits Carolina on top he basically called for a clear out but he scored that bucket in the paint and he is so strong and athletic the more he drives it I think the better is the result 10 points for assists one turnover tonight for love off the fingertips of young but we got a foul called on bacon the Timeout on the floor in a onepoint game Jay would love having put the heels back on top Im not sure any Tar Heel on this team has hit bigger shots in his young career than Caleb love has but when he is aggressive driving the ball he is more than a handful got a little bit of contact and made the floater not that into saving you have to Spire can help

these freshmen on the new side obviously the first time that they have played in this rivalry the Derek Lively is playing well Tyrese Proctor is playing well theres no ones surprise we got a good one Carolina 45 Duke 44 Midway through the second half roach creates a little space Lively secures the rebound Granderson hits the three boy not just a great rebound by Derek Lively the second but a Next Level thought to kick it out to grandison for that three he didnt have the immediate stick back and looked out for the wide open three thats really good basketball by Derek Lively off balance shot by Caleb love gives it back to Duke the best time to shoot a three is after an offensive rebound and Derek Lively after setting the screen nobody there to box him out and he grabs this rebound and immediately looks out to grandison for that wide open three and the analytics prove it theres no better time than after an offensive rebound every Tar Heel was in the lane thinking about taking it the other way not thinking about playing more defense Blue Devils turn it back over on a travel RJ Davis trying to find some space tough one and it goes and its all tied up at 47 RJ Davis has gained so you mentioned his last two hes been one of ten from three but he had 26 points against NC State he could put points up in a hurry in a variety of ways and a good decision maker with the ball 16 points per game in the number one free throw shooter in the ACC as well Proctor good defense by pop Johnson Applause they pick and pop out of this or roll RJ Davis right down to the rim itll have to be roach wow did he earn that one boy what a tough shot by Jeremy Roach hes right about at his average right now 12 tonight 122 per game on the season love no every shot around the basket is contested philipowski pulls his way in baycott takes it away so he had the advantage on puff Johnson but baycot came over from the weak side boy Davis tries Lively again and that is the seventh block of the night for Derek Lively the second well Davis had baycott coming down the lane but thought he could get the shot up over it leaky black trying to pick up the foul I thought it would be a drop off but Branson did a nice job of coming over and getting in front of baycod to take that pass away step back Davis tough shot and a three to put the heels back on top it was so difficult to guard off that ball screen because he can step back he can turn the corner they took away the roll from bacon but RJ Davis is starting to assert himself on the offensive end phillipowski might have gotten away with steps finds roach with a little 54 ball screen to get philipowski to his right hand he just couldnt turn the corner baycott did a nice job with help defense and switching off boy RJ Davis watch him come off this ball screen and roach trailing him he just steps back and Nails a difficult jumper his form is so good and at the other end of the floor roach just with a crafty play kind of stopped and Force Davis to back into him and create the foul and Lively with his first points of the night his 39th field goal of the Season 31 of them have been dunks when Armando baycott goes to block the shot that leaves the offensive glass wide open for lively nobody there to box him out Davis not this time Proctor comes out of the scrum and thats what you have to do the guards have to get in the rebound it cant just be the big guys on the defensive end Applause off to Proctor a battle underneath and love comes out of it but we have a foul call going against Armando baycott just a second well Derek Livelys activity level has been high Ian baycott going after that blocked shot just a little bit of a push there a lot of people call that rebounding with all the contact in this game big guys are going really on a rebound roach now guarded by puff Johnson after the switch crossover it hangs on the rim and comes down to Leaky black boy leaky black has done such a good job on the defensive glass es eight rebound of the night Lively almost forces a turnover itll be out of bounds to Carolina with 7 35 to go with a game where the lead keeps switching back and forth in the first game of the season between these two the first time Derek Lively the second has ever played in this rivalry and boy is he having himself a night for the Blue Devils does that remind you a little bit of Mark Williams a couple years ago and how he blossomed toward the end of his freshman oh hes going to keep rolling on into the evening Florida and Kentucky are coming up next Joe Leonardis got Florida first four out Kentucky last four in so obvious implications and then after Gonzaga and St Marys capping off today Oscar shibway 136 rebounds per game always fun when the Gators and the cats get together and how about Gonzaga and Saint Marys Randy Bennetts got himself a heck of a team they are the leaders right now on the West Coast Conference they are undefeated in conference play thats a big game out west tonight St Marys has a top five defense going against the top five off defense in the country against Gonzaga Gonzaga averaged 86 points a game and the question is against Saint Marys with the way they control Temple and the way they defend if Ken Gonzaga score over 70 freshman Aiden mahaney the leading scorer for The gales St Marys having a terrific year those two will meet a few weeks from now back in Spokane in the rematch Davis from the corner around and out and a rebound down to Lively really good action by North Carolina that little fade screen to get a shooter open in the left corner just didnt make it filipowski nice pass Lively turned it over but it bounces to Proctor and a foul will send filipowski to the free throw line loose ball it looked like Caleb love had an angle to that 5050 ball to take it the other way but Proctor got it and thats one that when Hubert Davis and his staff watch the film theyll say thats a ball that Caleb love should have had for Carolina she makes 18 free throws a game I mean they barely got into the freethrow line in this one two for three on the night usually theyre wearing a hole in that nail at the freethrow line and theyve barely been there boys this guy become a fan favorite in a hurry and Kyle filipowski if youre doing a the top five freshmen kind of a firstteam AllAmerica freshman team pretty good chance this guys on it oh hes on it yeah Brandon Miller is leading the way from Alabama but Kyle filipowski is second foreign stretch for the Blue Devils after this one tonight at Miami on ESPN Monday night at Virginia next Saturday on ESPN as well tough stretch for the Blue Devils Miami picking up a big win over Clemson earlier today Applause Duke doing a good job and negotiating these screens out front thats a tough shot over a seven footer icky black down with a rebound off the Miss from Love right now with Armando baycott out of the game its got to be RJ Davis here switch driving on philipowski whips a pass into the corner and its the third three of the second half for leaky black RJ Davis got a switch and he was going against philipowski and just drove him into the lane and because they helped off of leaky black they wanted him to take that three if anybodys going to take it theyd rather have leaky black taken hes nailed three of them in this game black with 13 points nine rebounds on the ninth shot clock at four roach knows it gets to the freethrow line and it Nestles in to give Duke a twopoint lead a really patient use of the ball screen got RJ Davis on his hip that was a huge bucket after that leaky black three Baseline low and the reverse as he slithers through a couple of Defenders to tie it up how about that step through he made past Mark Mitchell to get to the other side of the basket and use some English to get the bucket that was a terrific drive by Caleb love last 100 meetings each team has won 50 of them and theyre all squared up with five minutes to go here in this one a little slice cut screen for the screener well defended by North Carolina and then an illegal screen off the pitch as Mark Mitchell went right into the body of RJ Davis with Caleb love here this is a pretty good Patience by North Carolina he was able to refuse that screen and Tyrese Proctor has to make him use it and that opened up a lane to the basket and heres the switch Kyle filipowski guarding Davis Davis crosses over and then Mark Mitchell has to help off of leaky black and when he does wide open shot for leaky black love deep one over Proctor off the back of the iron long rebound to Black Johnson from the corner misses the three not the shot yeah after getting the offensive rebound North Carolina needed to reset that that was not the shot they wanted Applause Roach goes and hes fouled oh Jeremy roach has been terrific at driving angles but he watched the feet of his Defender went under RJ Davis went under he was able to turn the corner and the difference in driving east west and north south you drive north south you make the defense help and you have an opportunity for a threepoint play lets go to Holly well yesterday to end practice John Shire grabbed the guys pulled him around in a circle and hes speaking Kerwin excuse me Jeremy roach spoke up and said listen guys you dont know what kind of physicality youre in for when we played in this game last year we were ready now you see they are this is what roach was telling his teammates they needed to bring and he was right his leadership has been standing out for Duke tonight on the floor Holly thank you and what a play at the other end of the Court off the drive by love had it rejected and philipowski is still down for the Blue Devils but Caleb love took that with the right hand and he was gonna punch it but he was facing basically two seven Footers trying to block that shot this is a strong take Derek Lively just sends it out but pal filipowski still down Lively the rejection and it looked like filipowski reached for his left elbow momentarily when he hit the court theres the eighth block of the night for lively and philipowski now at least sitting up on the court Applause where shot blocking has now been referred to as Rim protection but thats incredible Rim protection by Derek Lively the second what an impact he has been in the lane the Lebowski on his feet Timeout on the floor twopoint game in Cameron the pepperoni on Paneras new toasted John Deere nothing runs like a deer run with us a game that has seen eight ties and five lead changes its duped by two David Cameron over their Rivals from Chapel Hill with 409 to go in regulation and one of the ball and one of the biggest differences in this basketball game has been the play of Derek Lively the second inside hes got eight blocked shots and 11 rebounds Nance behind the back trying to back down Mitchell turn around fade away is good and Carolina ties it first points of the night for Pete Nance just a really good oneonone move where he pivoted and fell away with that jumper Applause roach has it knocked away Nans wide open misses the three in Lively down with his 12th rebound of the night that was a good opportunistic threein transition for North Carolina Nas just wasnt able to knock it down Carolinas been letting Jeremy roach get to his right hand erson thats a tough pass at the feet of lively and the question is what was he going to do with it when he caught it he gives it to Proctor and just kind of a disjointed possession there for the Blue Devils 304 to go itll be Carolina Ball but the Ovation you hear is for the return of Kyle filipowski that gives Duke another seven footer to go along with Derek Lively the second but you have to think that North Carolina wants to get a touch for Armando bake out hes got 14 points 10 rebounds but he hasnt touched the ball much lately mansch passes up the three dribbles it into traffic but is fouled just got a step on philipowski and filipowskis got very good hands reached in and knocked the ball away but got the foul called on us wasnt in legal guarding position had his elbow on the back that arm bar on the back thats where maybe the fouls called I mean youre not supposed to have an arm bar on the driver period fourth team foul on the Blue Devils now the Duke bench wanted a foul on Nance instead its a turnover and Nance commits the foul thatll be the seventh on Carolina so Duke will be heading to the line for one and one Duke is shot up till now 12 free throws in the game Carolina only three I cant recall a Duke Carolina game where the Tar Heels have been to the freethrow line so seldom the Lebowski one and one 77 from the line on the season Applause and whos it off of it is Carolina ball ruled off of lively John Shire voices his disapproval cant look at that unless youre inside two minutes Applause Davis Around Proctor Proctor recovered and got a piece of it looked like Lively was there to father as well you use the term Rim protection Dukes got a lot of that this season dont they well Lively is a game changer Purdue and there is nothing going on around the basket for North Carolina because of the presence of Derek Lively II the Lebowski guarded by bacon gets the shot off rebound Lively he did it again wheres that rebound number 13 for his what a game by Derek lagley II and a game where Duke needed his presence roach defended by Nance goes by him and widely to follow timeout Carolina Derek Lively the second Duke by two Applause Music its time to bring balance to business travel and discover the equilibrium that works for you at National youre in control skip the counter choose any car in the aisle and manage your rental right from the app so you can mix work with leisure or later with work giving you the control to find the perfect balance go National go like a pro Applause as duke gets the drive to the basket it draws help this drive to the basket here is going to draw help and keep an eye here on Derek Lively the second now when Armando baycott right under the basket comes over to block the shot what youre going to see is the glass is wide open for Derek Lively the second to get that stick back you go to block a shot theres no rotation over to pick up Lively and he gets another rebound and a huge bucket to put Duke up 5957 his presence in this game has been game changing for Duke and he is starting to Blossom the number one high school player ranked last year and he was injured to start the season didnt have a much continuity going through the early season and had to listen to people questioning his ability and whether he should have been ranked number one as if it makes a difference whether hes one five seven whatever but he is starting to really Blossom and come on and hes a big reason why Duke carries a twopoint lead into that this last minute and a half of Regulation a seasonhigh 14 rebounds previous high was 10 a seasonhigh eight blocks previous high was five the most anybody has ever had for Duke in a game against Carolina the program record for blocks against anybody is 10 held by Sheldon Williams and Cherokee Parks 14 rebounds and eight blocks tonight for Derrick Lively the second lets see what the response is from the Tar Heels Cherokee parks and attendance tonight the Chiefs Davis to love oneonone with Proctor got the switch got philipowski on him will he drive it or pull up spins gets it back finds black wide open in the corner boy hes made three of them already here in the second half but not this time as we go into the final minute well Duke choosing to protect the paint and recover late if at all the Leaky black and hes nailed three of them but that one short so lepowski sizing up Nance drives on him cant get it to go but he got it back Lively occupied Armando baycott and he couldnt get there and a timeout with 353 and Buffalo Wild Wings the deals dont stop buy one get one half off Wing Tuesdays buy one get one free Applause Armando baycott and Derek Lively right under the basket when this shot is missed baycat trying to box out Lively and just couldnt get to that ball Derek gladly the second he has had some good games especially in the last three or four but this has been Next Level his ability to protect the rim his rebounding running the floor talk about an impact player that makes Duke a different team than they have been earlier in the season and thats the look of a young man having his best game of the year Music five of the 14 rebounds of the offensive end hes kicked some back out for buckets eight blocks as we mentioned hes only had two field goals one of them was one of the biggest shots of the night but again he has been as impactful as any player in the game tonight but his activity level has been really outstanding and hes played more minutes perhaps in this one than hes played all season long to your point Ryan Young Who usually plays a fair number of minutes hes only played six minutes off the bench tonight because Livelys been so good you cant take him out of there hes played 33 minutes Carolina beat Duke here last year then beat him in the National semifinals Carolinas won two in a row in this building this young Duke Team Four Freshmen are getting significant minutes trying to end that streak right now 16 seconds remain on the shot clock for Duke a little over 35 seconds remain in regulation North Carolina does not have to foul here but they have to have a good defensive possession and get a stop Granderson to inbounded for the Blue Devils Proctor with a ball roach the drive left hand minutes guard philipowski went to set a screen he just ghosted out of it and that opened up Jeremy roach with that right hand drive into the lane really good call out of the timeout by John Shire to essentially isolate Jeremy Roach you thought it was going to be a ball screen but philipowski just ghosted out by not setting the screen at all passes and watching just slips out of it and that opened up that drive for Jeremy roach nobody there to step in either to take the charge or try to block the shot if Armando baycott comes over its a dump off to Derek Lively or an offensive rebound bucket roach now with a gamehigh 18 and 51 points Jay in his last three games it seems with Proctor doing more of the the ball handling roach turning into more of a score right now for the Blue Devils yeah thats freed him up Proctor taking over the ball handling responsibilities has freed up Jeremy roach to be more of an offensive weapon and he moves well without the ball but now he doesnt have to run everything and then look for his offense remember missed four games with a toe injury and even played at less than 100 percent for a few games as well they really missed him he is back he certainly appears to be healthy and he has had a terrific night Purdue with a now a fourpoint lead with 209 to go and theres still plenty of time for North Carolina they dont have to take a three here theyre down two possessions 6157 but you still think attacked the basket if they kick it out for an open three thats one thing and the foul by Proctor Duke had two fouls to give they still have one more I think they want to wait a little bit longer you dont need to foul that far away from the basket but a couple more seconds go if you can and philipowski with a foul so thats number six on the Blue Devils here in the second half and now the banjo yelling now to the Five Guys on the court thats it and because of where the foul was committed now its out of bounds on the Baseline Duke wants to get everything going toward the short side of the floor toward the ball side Bangkok the kick Nance for three the rebound down to Roach and they can feel it now here at Cameron North Carolina couldnt ask for a better shot the kick out from the post touch and a straight on three from Pete Nance they couldnt have asked for anything better already a true possession game as roach steps to the line and adds to the Roach coming off a 21 Point performance against Wake Forest and about to hit the 20point mark again Applause now you have to have a three love and a travel called on Proctor but just four tenths of a second left and the Blue Devils are going to beat the Tar Heels move ahead of them in the ACC standings and pick up a very popular win here in this building and what a growth moment for a young basketball team The Freshman played well didnt they and obviously Jeremy roach helped a ton as well a big win for John Shire and the blue and the Blue Devils in their shires first game here in this Duke Carolina rivalry as the head coach it was back and forth all night long until Duke salted it away Jay in the last couple of minutes and it makes you look forward
