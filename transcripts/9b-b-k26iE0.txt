and Chaz Kelly is their starting guard the man you see in your picture now is the Eagles in their home white the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in the navy blue and the tip is controlled by the jackets it had a weak off Nate George Manning the point chased by Kelly the runner and long loose ball Tracked Down by Donald Han Eagles starting five Donald Han your Spotlight Player Roger mcfar and Chaz Kelly Deion Brown in the back court with Chad venning up front venning a brown on the Baseline Farland playing on senior day hes a graduate student deep three by hand and the board for George yeah for BC you want to see some ball movement side to side try to open up them gaps but obviously H Jun has to be aggressive but inside with Benny is where I think they could really make some noise that lob was off the line by George to Suare Ibraham Suare part of the starting lineup an injured group the most injured team in college basketball well get into that a little bit later on but theyve been six or seven deep for the most part of the last two months three by George to strong and John really thats why its so impressive how Jord Techs been playing with a short roster really a six seven man rotation but they continue to play hard bring energy and effort and I think defensively theyve been physical and really Music Applause active hand towards the rack for the lay in as BCs off the schnide and Donald Han can play midrange game he can shoot to three triple penetration is important though right just has to be aggressive to the rim being aggressive with his drive to the rim is going to open up his perim Applause good move by Dongo P with a rebound and John if BC can look at opportunities to get out and transition and play Fast get some early buckets I think thatd be ideal for them three by McFarland and hes got it I tell you what theyve been theyve been waiting BC for somebody else to step up besides H Jun and Chad Benning could it be McFarland could it be Deion Brown they need that third guy really to step up and help him out with the scoring load sare with the left hand no good that was wide open yeah McFarland only shooting 25 from three that was his 15 three of the Season BC is a team shooting 35 Applause Music jackets in manto man McFarland and the board for Suarez Georgia Tech has missed their last four shots defensively BC was stifling against Virginia Tech on Wednesday he only scored 36 points and theres Lance Terry with a three Lance Terry Johan is really unheard of now scored 36 points in a game usually you see that in the first half but we were talking to coach Grant on our Zoom the other day today and he was just saying defensively Boston College theyre connected theyre communicating and theyre being more active coming up to play good weak side defense and hes a presence Eric in the paint theres no doubt about that the one thing with him though he has to watch his fouls hes fouled out of five games he he has to be aggressive but be aggressive without fouling it really was a slow start to the season a projected second Team all ACC but over his last five games averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds something that they expected out of Dango Powell missed the bunny pows been excellent last seven games and double figures hand for three and he hits it Donald Han from the wing BCs on a run I tell you what John if BC had a better record hed be in consideration for an all ACC team hes been one of the most consistent players in conference this whole season George and theres a three Dongo showing some distance big part of his game if he can get that going hes only hit six and 15 attempts on the season John if hes able to knock down that threepoint shot at a consistent rate NBA potential already hell definitely move up those draft boards if hes able to knock down that open shot hand off the front rim George takes the Deep three Dongo over the top keeps it alive for two hey Dongo 83 rebounds per routing thats first on the team including 69 offensive and Earl Grant told us we have to defensive rebound when youre built like that when you have that athletic ability when you can move that well all you have to do is really be active and stay around that Rim good things are going to happen Chaz Kelly H the three Applause hes the guy who hit the game winning three against Florida State the game you and I called a couple weeks ago and the Eagles came back from 15 points down good pass in the paint Cutters Lance Terry what a pass by Nate George well both teams early on are against some good ball movement which is creating good opportunities and good looks at the rim and for Boston College these other guys are starting to step up and make shots was going to take pressure off of Ving andan Jr Ving has been quiet finds Dion Brown for three and tries to keep it alive hes BCs leading rebounder but its Georgia Tech ball you see the ball movement right here by BC great job of finding their best player best shooter Donald Han Jr knocking it down and Nathan George has been on a roll pass in the Bas great finish by Lance Terry scient Music movie trivia Isa Rodriguez is our contestant and well try and guess the

one rank womens lacrosse teamad to at that Music a Music Georgia Tech to inbound good to have you with us on the ESPN app for the moment soon to be on acc Network hes Eric dandorf Im John M Perell substitution Musta blocked by Jaden Hastings and Hastings has been a stabilizing presence on both ends of the floor for BC also being pretty efficient around the rim shooting 81 in his last five games 13 for 16 from the field and there you shows an example of it right there but call for a travel but I I I like the change of pace they have with Hastings and Benning theres Earl Grant he says Hastings is working hard too hes been tutored by Chad venning theyre in the gym early you know tendency big men the more for any position for that matter the more you work it its the better you get and its good to see a vet taking along a young guy and helping him out boy CH Dion Brown just landed with a thud thats a scary collision with brown his head hit the back of his teammate Jaden Hastings knee well take another look yeah you just hope is hes all right I mean been a lot of examples of uh guys getting concussions just off of plays like that and you know McCollum is one of them at Georgia Tech they had Blakes whos in concussion protocol over at Stanford so he just hope Brown is all right Deion Brown transfer from UNBC tries to Shake it Off 20 points against North Carolina earlier this year hes help to the locker room yeah it looks like theyre going to go put him through some testing that was a hard fall you just hope everythings all right with Deion Brown so with brown out great pay off the BC bench fallen from the wing misses to three and the rebound by mustaf mustaf the son of former Marilyn Star Elite Gerard mustaf passed away this summer John I think for BC McFarland he hit one but then his next two are misses so now its time to drive the ball hes not really a you know excellent threepoint shooter he excels more at driving to the basket so now he should look to pump fake and try to get to the rim and the midrange is that a good idea you tring to want to get more ball movement if youre if youre BC obviously you want the ball in your best players hands but to begin The Possession get some side to side Movement try to create an easier shot and Dongo converts as Georgia Tech has its first lead of the game Elijah strong off the BC bench for Roger McFarland the officials are Tommy Mars ER Lewis and Greg Evans strong from Charlotte 68 sophomore four and a half points 33 rebounds its made 17 starts Applause Kelly around the ark you see a scoring Dr of 225 his hand just lost the ball well those are the unforced airs that BC cannot have and going back to your comment about strong he was a guy who really started off strong this year no pun intended but ever since getting monos slow down a littleit BC needs to get him back into the rotation get him going Damon STM the second coach for Georgia Tech former Celtics assistant Powell jump hook and and the rebound hand is tenacious off the glass I mean hes one of the best scorers in the ACC and hes also leading this Boston College team in rebound he just attacks the glass he attacks the rim hes a great threepoint shooter having a great year for Boston College and the drive and he ends the BC score out of three minutes nice touch as he has seven points to lead BC averages 16 Nate George 20 plus in four straight games its a three by Powell and Han grabs the loose ball rebound both teams still searching for offensive identities well on that last possession it was a great Drive Right There by George getting in the paint great kick out great extra pass just didnt knock that the open opportunity Georgia Tech shooting 31 Beetle the Clemson trans five to shoot for pain way off the line see John those are the type of shots BC cant have you got to get the ball moving you cant let the ball stick because youre just going to end up shooting tough shots like that and Dongo down the lane but a foul before that and we will head to a timeout BC leading by a point come on back to chest dut Hill after this he hes doing all that being the focal point every single time going to every single game so The Scouting Report is really built around him so for him to be able to play the way hes playing shows how hard hes working and show shows the extra time that hes putting in the gym coming up next at 4 Eastern on acc Network Chase Hunter and number 18 Clemson take on SMU Virginia Tech Miami tap the triple Header by Dongo at the line for the jackets 53 from the field top five number in the ACC hell leave the lineup with nine points and five rebounds placed by Ibraham Suare how do they adjust when dong goes off the floor well that in the beginning were talking about going inside the vening vening is not in right now so you got to try to get down hand off some ball screens off some handoff actions give him an advantage so he can try to get downhill if he doesnt have the opportunity at The Rim look for the driving kick hand three a little bit rushed and and look he we know he can make tough shots but you want to try to get clean looks and clean opportunities you cant sustain taking tough shots throughout the game if youre BC Powell and Fred Payne the loose ball rebound Applause Beetle takes a three and he Nails it Josh Beetle has been a nice contributor since coming from Clemson hes been in and out of the lineup hes capable of getting to the rim hes capable of shooting the basketball but he has to bring more consistency I think him and Fred Payne are two guys who could really bring a lot of energy and effort and they also have the capability of scoring the basketball 6 and A2 points per game for Beetle Colombia South Carolina Nate George has been quiet step back three left it short Here Comes Han transition kick from pay and hes got another three these are the opportunities that BC wants to get semiring the basketball Fred Payne great pass to their best shooter Donald H Jr definitely knows what to do with it hand now in double figures with 10 Georgia Tech has made one of its last seven shots Terry good touch in front of the elbow thats just a tough take Boston College honestly is playing good defense theyre staying connected theyre putting bodies in front of Georgia Tech Lance Terry just making a tough shot right there in the paint and Terrys been injury pled hes a key part of the rotation 18 starts leading the team at scoring 15 per game drive by beetle erratic and here comes the Music jackets suton almost cocked it up good Hustle by the Eagles in transition defense as Beetle Hit the Floor well beetle with the the tough shot on the offensive B probably not the best look great job to make up for it and come all the way back down and hustle and get a deflection see right here just hustling getting in front of pow getting on the ground getting knocked down those are the plays you have to have especially if you want to win these type of games in Applause ACC P Manning the point as McFarland the back court Fred pay as well knifing through the defense strong Beetle switched by the jackets for a moment strong from three another three for the Eagles theyve hit six and thats huge for BC especially with h junr out wheres the offense going to come from we talked about strong early on this season he was playing really well they need him back and being aggressive offensively its opened up the floor for them theyve made six of 13 threes they averaged seven per game Terry the three and the bump hell get three foul shots Elijah strong Applause foul strong hes been out with mono comeb back kind of slow start but they need him to get going he has to be aggressive hes a guy who could shoot the ball he could get in the mid Post BC really needs to get guys going besides Donald Han Jr besides Chad venny Terry at the line hes been injury plague with that wrist injury Music we have three foul shots Georgia Tech as a Applause team shooting 66 tonight at ad after am mens basketball triple header the nothing but neck through breaks down the day and night the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every game they look ahe at the best match up on the schedule next week right here on acc Network and the ESPN and we welcome our audience on CCC Network to Connie for in Chestnut Hill hes Eric dorf Im John me Perell hope you enjoy that centilating lacrosse coverage BC with a fourpoint lead Over Georgia Tech its been a story of threepointers for the Eagles as fenning goes Baseline and a foul is called but we will take a timeout tell you more about the storyline thus far when we come back right after this on accn verbial teams you dont want to play Maybe looking ahead to the ACC tournament in Charlotte oh well I mean both teams they I guess they have something on the line right BC is still having hopes to get in and Georgia Tech theyre trying to work their way up in the standings but I think BC has carried their defense over from that Virginia Tech game theyre doing a great job of really crowding the ball when George has it and just putting bodies in front of guys whats funny about Dongo he is a big MacGyver fan you watch mcgyver growing up in senagal is one of the few American shows they got he loves Richard Dean Anderson who clearly youre Doppel Gainer strong its a three its raining threes for BC theres 73 and 14 attempts so so John what youre telling me is he could fix a lot of things with a straw and a piece of tape well one of the coaches says youd mcgyver that during a practice and Dongo turned around said wait a minute you know who mcgyver is the coach was like of course I know who mcgyver is they didnt realize that Dongo knew who mcgyver was I was a fan of MacGyver back in the day as well Beetle trying to spin instead of foul is called on Dongo second by Dongo who is the hero of their cow win with a tip in at the buzzer and John you just got to give it to BC I mean they they could have laid it down theyre second to last in the conference but their effort and energy and activity on the defensive side of the ball has really allowed them to be aggressive offensively and already with seven threes in the first half and its not just from Han junr theyre spreading the love a little bit Eagles basketball Josh Beetle at the point hecs made four of their last five shots and theyve stifled the jackets offense jackets hav scored in 250 he made a good point about the defense carrying overs pay misses the three and dger grabs the board but BC help Virginia Tech to an unworldly 36 points which is really unheard of and and yes a lot of that had to do with Virginia Tech missing shots but Boston College defense was so active they were so connected they were communicating they had a lot to do with those Miss shots as well and theyve carried over into this Georgia Tech game 11 points in halftime for the Hokage on Wednesday night yeah I wonder what the conversation was after the game with Coach Mike young and his his Virginia Tech Team a lot of shots the next day in practice Im assuming I would think so McFarland to turn around and mustaf got the rebound J mustaf in the paint takes on two Defenders and a jump ball possession towards BC good defense by Chad Applause Benning and this is really where MAV Excel is at just going downhill playing in transition but again BC with bodies there around the rim and great job tying Georgia Tech up going down the other way BC has really done a great job of just playing with a lot of energy a lot of activity on the defensive side of the ball and I think when you make shots offensively you want to play defense a little bit Music more and the Deep three no Hometown roll thats T but when a guy like Donald Han Jr the way hes been playing youre okay with him taking those Applause shots reigning ACC player of the week Nate George is 0 for six from the field mustaf hey Let It Go on the weak side Dongo ran into a wall so BC like they did against Virginia Tech theyre creasing off the interior we talking about BC having to get the ball movement side to side same thing for Georgia Tech theyre playing more ISO basketball and thats just leading to tough shots at The Rim but Chad ven is doing a great job being a rim protector for BC in this first half Ving whistle for the foul is Applause first Tommy marsy official says it was on the floor talk with Greg emans trying to sort it out Chad vennings defense always a big part of the BC equation pay a hand twoman game and deflected by Terry he was playing feisty defense and he ended up winning the 5050 well hes one of the best defenders that georia Tech has leading the team in steals and he has a hurt wrist so its tough for him to shoot the ball on the perimeter but he can still be active defensively see him right there getting deflection going down to the other end for Georgia Tech sh senior from col Park Georgia three not falling for the jackets theyre two for nine from threepoint range shooting just 30 overall BC is just there every single defensive possession theyre there with a hand up theyre making it tough for Georgia Tech at The Rim great job being active Music Applause defensively mfin the take too short and Here Comes Georgia Tech so BCs in a scoring draw now with three minutes well they got to be careful getting back into that isolation basketball what a pass great pass right there but BC whats really had him going early on is the ball movement theyre getting great looks at The Rim Great Looks on the perimeter they cant fall back into playing isolation basketball moose sto the beneficiary off the pass from Dongo Applause intensive defense by Damon stms jackets foul on Lance Terry is first and Dango showing his skill set with the great job the mustaf right there finishing at The Music Rim all Dango has really been holding down the scoring load making plays inside and Terrys just playing with a lot of energy and effort zenning trying to back in neon Brown back from the locker room after an apparent head injury Benny hits some no wor for the wear and I think when Benny gets the ball just be more decisive before that double team comes and when hes able to get it out those BC guards have to play off the scrambles great job by Dean Brown getting into the paint knocking it down Browns last three games averaging six points and four rebounds Powell the three George tracks it though and John I think Deon Brown was the guy that the BC coaching staff really expected a little bit more out of he has to look be aggressive when he has those opportunities Nate George playing out of control throws it away his rough afternoon continues but Georgia Tech overc commit on defense well every time vending gets the ball Georgia Tech is going to look to double team BC guards have to be ready to play off those close outs Deon Brown good job getting into the paint knocking it Music down probably dont want to do that if youre Chad Vining again and hes coachable hes hes co dont go behind your back in a crowd on the threepoint line mustaf for George need to get George going and there it is the three for Nate George hes one for five from three and youre not going to hold him down the whole game but you got to credit Boston College defense theyre just being active when theyre switching theyre up on it theyre not letting him get any space a guy like Nate George hes going to get his opportunities throughout this game fenning in the post strong tried to grab the rebound instead its a foul on Nate George who comes up limping holding his hip and they can ill afford any other injuries the most injured team in college basketball as venning is a load in the post of 270 lbs I just like the physicality that BC is bringing you see venning hes going up being strong strong following up with the offensive rebound getting an opportunity for two free throws at the free throw line games missed headline by wasy Reeds with 20 they expected to be one of their top scorers in Florida transfer then OBrien they got from Colorado and the portal and just been an injury plag season for Damon stmy and its one of those years where you say what are we doing wrong well I was talking to coach star and hes really like hey this is what I got you know I got to adjust I got to deal with it and I think theyve done a tremendous job of really dealing with the guys that they have and the guys that they do have theyve been given a lot of effort and energy and theyve been having a pretty good season theyre in a theyre in a good situation like I said with the win it could put them in that sixth spot in the ACC oh what a drive by mustaf but he missed the slam did the hard part and three and they convert after the Miss slam Donald and has been read out with 133 points that was a great job right there by vennings meeting him at The Rim right there but thats the opportunities BCS need they need to get out in transition and try to get those easy looks get it to your man Donald H Jr hes going to knock it down that pow the drive but starts with venning defense for BC as he disrupts the slam well you like the aggression by mustaf right there but venning he has been around the rim all game and it its allowed him to get out in transition great decision right there by Kelly and if you get it to your man han Jr hes more likely than not going to knock that down and an outstanding first half 13 points three threepointers five rebounds turnaround by Dango has been outstanding thats a pro move by by Dango he has 13 oh you said it right there thats a pro move I mean it was solid defense right there by vening just chesting up Manning up right there but great footwork by Dango and knocking down the fadeaway that was tough Kelly trying to shake George and Musto has the rebound George transition how the sac State transfer high percentage shot but BR the board a great job by BC right there getting back in transition Georgia Tech wants to push the pace BC great job of getting back and another tough shot at the rim for Georgia Tech BC calls a timeout we will take a 30 second timeout with the Eagles leading by four HEC 51 down the stretch including a game coming up at Cal as they make their West Coast Swing next week Kelly nice job on the Baseline foul on the jackets nice move by Chaz Kelly a great job just keeping the ball alive good ball handling right there finding Benning and Benning just has to go up strong with that he really didnt even have to double clutch with the left hand youre 611 260 go up Strong finish that get an and one but nonetheless opportunity at the fre throw line venny no points in the first half hes been a rock on the offensive end for the Eagles averaging 13 points 41 rebounds his last three 14 points per game and those numbers tell it all third in the ACC from the field John his teammates have to do a better job of finding him in the half court when theyre slowed down but defense I think hes been great this half for BC mustaf at the buzzer and its off the mark so good first half BC regaining control Georgia Tech needs to find it great navy blue jerseys great to have you with us on acc Network thanks for spending part of your weekend with us on the Blockbuster day of college basketball as a turnover to start the half a hot pass by George what happened you want to be able to get in the lane and make a easier pass to Pal really it started with no ball movement youre just going off the initial Drive BCs defense is already set another unforced error for Georgia Tech Kelly Skips a pass for Roger McFarland and Kelly McFarland and brown part of this four guard BC attack with venning theone big man five to shoot three ball for Roger McFarland transfer from Southeast Louisiana vening the board and thats his first bucket of the game in half court if youre BC if youre not getting the ball to Donald H Jr find a way to get Chad Bening the ball in that low poster not only is he effective scoring the basketball but he can get doo in foul trouble George Tech eight George Powell in a three thats the tone of the day theyre three for 12 from threepoint range and a lot of those opportunities in open shots that Pals been getting has been good looks he just hasnt been able to knock him down BC matching its largest lead of the game ion Brown exited for about 10 minutes in the first half with an apparent head injury takes one back and he left it short a rare bad shot for the Eagles in first half where they had pretty good ball movement well every time they get good ball movement they get a good shot when they dont get good ball movement they end up with a shot like that base slide Lance carry styed by Chad venning it was a wall in the post how about venning just being the rim protector for BC today and he takes one back from Brown for a bucket what a sequence right there lead of the game and its been Chad venning coming out party in the said couldnt really explain why they held him the 36 points in terms of Virginia Tech he could tell you though that BC was more intense on that end well it starts obviously with the guards at the point attack theyve been doing a good job keeping the ball in front but when they it does get by Chad Benny has been doing a great job protecting at the Applause rim three no good from George whos been silent for the most part on the offensive end hes four straight 20 plus trying to become the first tech player since Matt Haring to score 20 or more in five consecutive games that was 1998 for the former Georgia Tech great Applause in the post for Dongo deflected again BC the amoeba defense in the post and and who was it Chad venning he got his hand on a deflection just making a play being around the rim being active and to your point about Nate George I think now hes hes trying to force it a little bit he hasnt got a lot of open looks he cant get in that where hes starting to force shots he has to let the game continue to come to him but still look to be aggressive with the ball in his hands jump ball possession towards BC Tommy marsy Eric Lewis and Greg Emmons are officials as Donald Han heads to the bench for Earl Grant the fourth year BC coach Fred Payne back in pay at a quiet first half but hes been much better in the second half of the Season well we had the game back when they played Florida State he was kind of the guy who really brought BC back with his energy and effort thats what really brings to this team how about the take by venning and he missed the dunk miss the dunk but I mean nonetheless I just like the aggression going to the rim you have to be able to finish that but just being aggressive putting the ball on the ground and you got to finish that big fella but hes been doing a great job on both ends for Boston College today thats when your eyes got really big I never had that opportunity to go and dunk the ball but I would lay it up really Laughter nice George deflected Again by Benning but its a foul on BC thats on Fred P his second I didnt really see the foul there but Bennys just been all over defensively that would have been his third Block doing a great job just being active inside the paint on both ends of the floor Dongo thought about the three going to back in deflected to mustaf fourstar recruit for the jackets three to shoot and punched away Terry tracks it down did not beat the shot clock turnover for Georgia Tech oh again it starts with Chad venny on the defensive side of the ball Walling up against Dongo force him into a a bad shot mustaf picks up the loose ball and it just they didnt have anything that whole possession just isolation ball coach stoden obviously not happy with that possession Georgia Tech needs to find a way how to get out and transition or in the half court get some better ball movement he Disturbed Damon stanmire and the hook by Chad venning who has six second half points weve been saying Chad Bennys name a whole lot yes we have Dongo for the foul onine how about the UPS by Fred Ben yeah Fred Payne hes just another guy we talked about his energy and effort especially with Donald Han Jr off the floor he needs to be able to make an Applause impact you see 8 and seven at home theyve won all of their AC games at con form good pass by Kelly to venning whos harassed to the post the foul was on Lance Terry we will take a timeout BC rolling on a seven to nothing run Music fans please direct your attention to Center Court for a special for every threepoint shot PA by the mens and womens basketball team its now time for todays Boston Calling Music Festival dance off the Boston Calling Music Festival is set for May John Benning has been all over the court today both ends of the floor being aggressive to the rim providing Rim protection on the defensive side of the ball coming from the weak side swatting it away you cant say enough about what hes been to this Boston College team today and The Testament too to keeping focused you know how difficult it is only you have one point in the first half you might tend to drift a little bit come back with renewed Vigor in the second half and also Testament to the coaching staff and their adjustment maybe in the locker room to feed him the ball more exactly I I think offensively in the first half they just werent looking for him enough and I think this second half they made it a point to get him the basketball and rightfully so he can score down low and he can possibly put those Georgia Tech bigs in foul trouble just by him being aggressive in the rim number one Notre Dame highlights our final Thursday night womens basketball double header of the regular season next week Clemson and Louisville tip off the night at 6 Eastern then Hannah hadalo on the top ranked Irish host Florida State should be another fantastic night of Hoops full court pressure a new look for the Eagles do you like it yeah I like that it just a different look making Georgia Tech change their Pace up a little bit Terry smothered again thats been the formula for the BC defense over swarming swarming to the basketball d George tries to skip it Kelly got a hand on it to punch it away with three to shoot but yeah the swarming smothering defense a carryover from their Virginia Tech effort well theyre just active theyre communicating they know where the ball is they know where their man is theyre getting deflections I mean theyre playing a heck of a defensive game today power blocked again by Chad Benning my Applause goodness lets dad venning has just been all around the rim rim protector thats his fourth block today he has been active and mobile at that rim three they beat the shot clock but its off the line Benning onean wrecking crew in the second half end off for brown he gets bumped by mustaf and Eric Lewis calls a foul John this is the point for Georgia Tech where they theyre theyre getting a little antsy now defensively BC is locked in Georgia Tech not able to get any clean shots so this is where Georgia Tech has to be careful of really taking bad shots and be careful of turning that basketball over jacket shooting 27 pain from the elbow BCs largest lead 15 points and all of this while Donald Han Jr is out of the B basketball game I mean Chad veny has been doing a great job and then you see pay doing a great job shielding the defender right there hitting the midrange jump shot air ball by George Nifty dribbling by Terry in a foul on Dion Brown defense against the hokes fre shot for Georgia Tech has been contested and Boston College is making it extremely tough for Georgia Tech on the offensive side of the ball for the Eagles El at the line Georgia Tech is five for six second half field goals glaring 0 for eight for the jackets BC shooting 50 the first 5 and a half minutes of the half John I mean talk about Nate George hes fresh off a ACC player of the week hes Aver at 24 in his last four games and he really looks frustrated hes not able to get any open looks and Boston College is just there on every single pass when he has the basketball Kelly the take and aggressive drive by the Junior from Houston hes fouled its on Lance Terry a guy like Chaz Kelly third on Terry I really think he can get himself going on the defensive side of the ball and then that that gives you energy on the offensive side you see him right here just being aggressive to the rim pull your head down be aggressive be strong opportunity for a bucket or a foul Kelly at the line for Two Shots BC a 72 foul shooting Applause team John I think this is an awesome sign for Boston College theyre doing all of this without their best player on the floor this is what coach Earl Grant really was looking for for other guys to step up and make an impact great observation on your part with hand on the bench we still thriving up by 15 Terry the Deep three Dongo weak sides got it Dongo the put back hes been terrific again and couple Pro Scouts in attendance getting a good look at his game we really one of the low and bright spots today for Georgia Tekken he will get an opportunity to play at the next level just from his athleticism and his versatility and how he moves but if his offensive game continues to improve youll see his name continue to go up on those mck graphs against Cal memorable performance 26 and 13 10 plus and 20 of 26 George the beautiful lob forare whos been quiet but dribble penetration by Nate George and if Georgia Tech is going to climb their way back in this game they have to be able to pick up the pace and get those easy opportunities like that in transition George averaging six assist per game thats 12th in the Country Strong the runner and he hits it off the BC bench Elijah strong nine points per game and you can give them any offense thats a bonus starting to get a little bit more comfortable since coming back from that mono and hes the guy that can really score the basketball and BC needs him to Aus number last Georgia Tech offensive possession George blocked again here comes Josh Beetle on the run with pay look out and he blows the layup but hes fouled Eagles triggering the break defense turning into offense that has been the for well how about the quick adjustment on the defensive Side by Boston College FS on sutt is third prior possession they just got a lab you see strong coming in helping on the lab getting the tip and then creating offense from their defense getting out easy opportunity at The Rim pay and chance to knock down two free throws fast break points in favor of BC with Fred Payne at the line coming up next at four Eastern on acc Network you can see Chase Hunter and number 18 Clemson take on SMU in Dallas and then Tech and Miami C the triple header West Durham and Dan boner on the call at SMU Clemsons had a fantastic year thats a big game right there big big game for SMU looking to keep their hopes alive for the NCAA tournament yeah the in or the out Joe lardy has three teams in the ACC making the tournament at this hour Music Terry and S again triple Drive This Time by Terry matching what George did well they need another guy besides George to get in the lane and create plays and we know Terry is more than capable hes been dealing with some injuries but hes capable to get in that lane and make plays he was the leading score for Georgia Tech before that injury happened strong Wheeling the deal does not go through through AA he hes been manto man throughout and a foul away from the ball thats on the Eagles Elijah strong call for his second foul a lot of memories come back to mind when you see their faces just three great players off the mediate timeout Terry with the three and some mixing and matching down low with SW and Hastings theme coach in Georgia Tech History thats a story list Bobby kremin yeah how cool is it for these guys to be able to play for one of the best point guards you know obviously out of Arizona but how about the defense by BC and Beetle find strong who holds be beetle beetle quick Hands by the Clemson Music transfer SP BC defensively all night and Beetles another guy whos capable offensively and defensively but just being active and having your hands involved on the defensive side of the ball 10 turnovers for the jackets only five for BC a great job by just being active activity Beetle you see right there getting in the driving lane and creating offense with their defense BC has just been active all night on the defensive side of the ball just making it really really tough for Georgia Tech constant pressure hounding them and they havent gone out of manto man see the turnovers five for the jackets ZL Grant gives some last second instructions to Jaden Hastings off and a foul the Eagles again a contested shot Benning and and look its its a great drive by mustaf right there hes being aggressive but a foul or not youre going to be met at the rim tonight by Chad Benning and BC has just been great defensively and theyve really made Georgia Tech adjust you see they take Nate George out of the game now you have different guys handling the ball and probably something that Georgia Tech hasnt been really accustomed to Georgia Tech just 3 for 13 from the field in the second half half after a quiet first half this to stop this is Georgia Tech has not LED since the 1118 Mark of the first half when it was a onepoint Applause lead and again theyre playing shorthanded canot underestimate that enough most injured team in college basketball Terry the three after the good hustle for the loose ball rebound but Benning with the rebound its just not falling Georgia Tech three for 16 from three well theyre frustrated theyre out of rhythm offensively and usually when that happens youre just going to start to for shots and thats what Georgia Tech doing but how about the guys behind us John I mean theyre just been giv the energy all night for BC give them an a devendorf point for intensity The Hook by venning and the rebound for Dongo Gustaf C y on the Baseline three by Terry and thats a foul on the jackets Ibraham Suare first on Suare fifth on the team but theres an open look for Terry on the wing and it doesnt fall well I mean even when Georgia Tech thinks they have a clean look Boston College did their best to get back in transition and make it tough and and again when its been hard all game even those open looks set you get seem a little bit Music harder where BC needs to go right here in the half court now they have to have a guy cut off that double team Payne for three good Hustle by Fred Payne and hes fouled by Dongo its an important game for Georgia Tech games that weve talked about for the last couple weeks in conference Beetle this fires and a steal again Fred Payne takes it away from Dongo and he hits one man fast break its been that type of day for B6 and Fred pay doing what he does bringing energy and effort and we talked about in the beginning D this is a trap game for Georgia Tech they could with the win move up to that sixth spot with the loss they dropped two spots so BCs playing for not only Pride but try to keep their hopes alive to play in this ACC turny great job right there Fred PR defense to offense just adding energy and effort and being aggressive towards the rim going right downhill at Nate George hes a cerebral player as he punches it away from Dongo and his line he has five points five rebounds four assists in 19 minutes hold time of the ball as well and a rapidly improving player for the eagles with Suare at the line after the foul was on Josh Beetle his second sare misses Fred Payne I mean just continue to talk about him just his energy and effort I mean when he brings that to the floor good things happen you see him getting the steal and then pushing the ball down in transition finishing at The Rim thats what Boston College needs from these other guys venning started out like a house on fire in the second half beetle step back is no good Georgia Teka scoring out of 320 Dongo ends it thats a good pass on the break well great position right there by Dango just getting right by the rim but one thing that Boston College cant do is start taking quick shots in the half court execute if you cant get a good look try to get it down to your big fella vending and get a good opportunity at The Rim or at the foul line Dongo with a double double 17 and 13 McFarland strong on the Baseline pinned at the rim for a jump ball terrific defense by the jackets it was a great find and a short row by venning catch and then he did a great job being in control and making the pass but how about Dono just meeting him at the rim and wow showing his athleticism mcfar is a strong kid yes he is just going up there and getting it and saying no not today sir Dongo to the bench for stanmire bro youre not Powell back in the ball game along with Terry wide open three for POW he misses back door though from George and hell have a chance at the line F was on Chad Benning that will bring us to another timeout connected communicated communicating excuse me and just active defensively just swarming the ball when the offense does get by in the paint Chad vens been there Rim protecting I mean Boston College really these last two games has been pretty incredible on the defensive side of the ball power one of two rebound by Donald Han your old coach Jim bahim might be watching up in Syracuse but Im sure as a guy who prided himself on his defense with that two3 zone any coach for that matter has to appreciate what BC has done the last two games absolutely in that two3 zone that wasnt a regular two3 Zone obviously we had the personnel and the length and athleticism but it was tough to go against that two3 zone but BC theyre doing it man demand just keeping guys in front and just being physical and being active Terry off balance with the runner Hastings the board even right there you see DM Brown and Terry just bumping and even though Terry got the shot off its a tough shot and hes still there contesting the ball George Powell and Terry combined four field goals thats the Thunder youre looking for offensively from Georgia Tech fouls on Nate George is second team line Georgia Tech has had a week off do you think that factors in it all since they beat Cal and a thriller we talked about that John Im not making excuses for anyone you know if you get a week off especially for Georgia Tech you try to get you know some more bodies healthy and more prepared and ready to go so whenever you step out on this floor especially in this part of the Season you you have to be ready to play so no excuse for any extra days off off at all our next gymnastics meet right here on accn in the ESPN app is tomorrow afternoon number 16 Stanford against Clemson coverage begins at four Eastern I heard you were mean on the balance beam back in the day in Michigan back in the day I still am what do you mean what Hustle by Donald an who just crashed into the fancy SE court side is he okay as he comes out yes he is he typified what BCs done on the defensive end today hustling all over the floor exactly just just putting in that Fred Payne something that coach Earl Grant really has needed from this BC Team all season but John I guess better late than never yeah Im still kind of flumed by your balance beam comment but were not going to we dont I dont we dont have any video I dont think we do it Im glad we dont because someone in Syracuse can help Laughter Applause us foul on Hastings as Terry now has 13 points hes six of seven from the line BCs missed seven of its last eight shots and scoreless in the second half good bounce pass to Benning who missed the bunny deig side Hustle by by McFarland to venny and that should be go ending and it is so Chad venning gets the hoop he has 10 second half points BC is moving the ball in the post especially arent they well theyre making a point of getting into venting I think he has the advantage down there you right here Dono just showing his athleticism you know lucky for BC got the Goen but especially in the half court set go to your big fella play through him if they double team him play off the Closeouts with guards three is good first threepointer of the game or second rather for Nate George iss two for nine from three thats only their fourth of the night look Georgia texman dealing with adversity the whole season right theyre not going to lay down and BCS be careful you di Brown being aggressive to the rim talking about the other guys much needed basket right there for BC counter punch by Dion Brown and N1 when youre aggressive to the rim good things happen and one chance for an opportunity at the free throw line Deon Brown putting his head down getting to the rim showing his athleticism knocking down the threepoint Applause play BC for the Run of play has had the lead last lead for Georgia Tech the 1118 Mark of the first half when it was Applause 1413 round with Five Points converts the threepoint play pow on the Applause Baseline I tell you what John Im really impressed with Dango and just his passing ability right at that height hes superb hes showing his skill level we know hes athletic his athleticism and his versatility but showing a little bit of his offensive skill set passing the ball and scoring the ball Applause today Farland erratic and the rebound by pal who moments ago just had his first field goal of the game pal averaging 17 points in his last seven outings George trying to shake the defender mustaf Terry guarded tightly by Kelly thats but a foul on BC called by Greg Evans its on Roger McFarland is first just Terry foul or not being a aggressive going to the basket youre going to put the rest in a tough position you know to call to make them call the foul but BC has to be careful on the offensive end taking those erratic shots it just leads to easy transition opportunities from Georgia Tech and thats really how theyre going to work their way back in this game 5 minutes left yeah the Eagles have had trouble all year sustaining leads the largest lead was 15 the 1403 Mark of the second half but now its down to eight with under five to play see the timeout situations on your screen BC has three Georgia Tech has two so now look out its a sevenpoint eagle leat the worst thing you want to do if your BC is get comfortable and start playing complacent you you have to continue to be aggressive but make good decisions with the basketball take good shots seems not a surprise for Georgia Tech good job by our crew headlin by our Producer Mike Baker and director Andrew Semel as hand has the step back from the elbows first bucket of the second half well its 430 left in the game it looks like its Donald Han Jr time put the ball in your best hand in the hands of your best player and hes going to make a play Nate George suddenly eating up his third three of the game George with a string of four straight and 20 or more reigning ACC player of the week but now its a twopossession game again BC threes factored in yeah I mean look BC has a couple possessions where theyre taking a r shots and then Georgia Tech is coming back down and getting good opportunities at The Rim good catch by Dion Brown stifled but he somehow found a way to lay it in crafty with the left hand crafty with the left hand a little bit of Deo right there I used to love going finishing with my left hand but Dion Brown great job just being aggressive to the basket did you just give me a first person third person thing Applause Ill let that go but I like it the and a foul so a more aggressive Georgia Tech offensive team with Dion Brown as Eric dor says you can you can appreciate well I gave you a little third person but Deon Brown doing a great job just putting his head down finishing with the left hand at the rim for our timeout was on Chad venning so mustaf at the line Jaden mustaf three points venning has 10 second half points 11 overall but his defense has been the story he also has grabbed six Applause rebounds Georgia Tech Trail by five at the half they had 27 first half points Kelly Han McFarland Brown in the BC back cour with venning up front and Miss vening right there he had a great seal at The Rim Deion Brown the elbow jumper yes sir the UMBC transfers starting to feel it I tell you what that was pretty great job playing off the close out jab to the left onew dribble pull up midrange knocking it down great shot he went down early with an apparent head injury but hes come back nicely in the second half and thats a bad pass goes out of bounds BC basketball costly time for a turnover thats their 12th turnover of the game and John to your point about Brown hes came back and knocked down shots but timely shots shots that they really needed Brown on the break to McFarland The Hop skip of the jump missed the layup he sees missed at least three of those and tracks it down though good Hustle by Donald hen it was a great decision by him pulling the ball out one of the most improved players in the AC CC takes a three and hes fouled hell have three foul shots Jaden mustaf with the foul is Applause third H Juniors such a good shooter that you have to be there and mustaf was just under him he he didnt let him land thats going to be a foul every single time you were shaking your head why well I just think that mustaf he has to do a better job of staying connect to hand Junior especially at this point in the game you know if he gets any type of space hes going to let it go and you got to do a better job of being aware where you are especially when youre guarding a guy like Donald Han Applause Jr coming up next at four Eastern on acc Network dont miss Chase Hunter and number 18 Clemson in Dallas taking on SMU and dont forget Virginia Tech in Miami Capp the triple header West dur Dan Bonner standing by in Music Dallas two out of three for hand Eagles up high 10 Powell holds whats your offense for Georgia Tech look like now well you got to get something quick right now BC is doing a good job of just staying guys in front looks like they went to a little zone right here great decision right there by coach Errol Grant and a high pass by Terry looking for Dongo but yeah the first time today theyve gone to that zone and they did it mid possession right switch into that great job Kelly good job tracking it Applause down was a great another another smart decision by Boston College pulling it out letting the time take away a little bit longer Eagles have played a terrific game Georgia Tech has turned over 13 times DC only has six turnovers great job with taking care of the ball and and you know Georgia Tech was going to make their run but a great job by Boston College sustaining during that run foul on Jaden mustaf thats his fourth an important game for BC we mentioned earlier about how important it was for Georgia Tech theyre all important down the stretch but the Eagles trying to stay out of that morale in the bottom half of the ACC and make it to the 15th or 14th spot so they can get to the ACC tournament in Charlotte well they just got to keep focusing game by game its not over yet for them right they they still have their hopes alive they game by game if you can continue to win games youre going to put yourself in position to get into ACC tourning and we saw what North Carolina state did last year anything can happen when you get into that oneandone situation in the ACC tournament Applause half court pressure but Terry three no good long day continues for Lance Terry their leading scorer who averages over 14 points he has 50 but the numbers arent kind hes made a living at the line eight for nine Eagles have dominated Brown and the the three hes got it theres your ball game Donald hand makes it rain but why not how about the Hustle by DM Brown keeping it alive getting the ball out to donalan junr and I thought he was going to wait a second but hey the way youve been playing go ahead and let it go young man knock it down Applause must and we will take a time out BC pulling away fact that hes been relentless on both ends of the floor and its senior night right his last home game and he wants to have a good showing in front of his mom and second to last home game they have one coming up with Clemson on March 5th but youre right good point Roger McFarland Chad venning both saluted before the game usually they would do it the last home game you would think a little bit different here though little bit of a quirk in the schedule Kelly to venning and the Layin for our player of the Music Applause game fing a loose ball and that will do it so on Senior Day Earl Grant picks up a much needed win with Boston College as they were
