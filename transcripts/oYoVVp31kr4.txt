and Javon blackshire Jr in the starting lineup Duke counters with the normal five and thats Tyrese Proctor seion James Cooper flag KH kiple and common malawat who wins the tap and away we Applause go first meeting between the two schools in about 5 years now forign change first is ACC members we see immediately Duke going to try to take advantage of the 66 point y seon James posting him against black and thats where Proctor has really been efficient this year hes making all those shots last year he missed some of those hes not missing that many this year and sasoko and malow watch immediately at the Block and there is a whistle blown and its on common malow watch from rck in the South Sudan but Duke normally wants to start the game off getting to the inside often times its malow watch with the lob this time its hosting their point guard seon James who delivers another assist where hes been one of the best in the ACC especially when it comes to assist to turnover ratio B sasoko the Michigan State grad transfer is going to be a handful tonight for Duke he is much improved and affecting the game for California here in the last half dozen or so sto yakovich seven to shoot against James out of the corner the three ball bouns away for Wilkinson Proctor on the drive with the right hand malawat the follow Soko goes for the block shot coach you always tell your big man crash the opposite side correct well you cant almost get back its cleared out theres a little guard over there everybody says block out but there is no blockout there the ball goes right to where Mal watch is its an easy tip kiple foul on the sto yakovich drive its his first second on du getting to the basket but as Soko goes over to attempt to block the shot no one there as coach mentioned to take malawat off the glass an easy bucket for him but one of the things we got to take be be mindful of malawat already picked up one personal foul in the first possession defensively for the Blue Devil petrius to put it in play and thats a 5sec count Arya Eric thanks very much Georgia Teek a winner against Stanford at Mish Pavilion in midtown Atlanta we welcome you a Cameron with Cory Alexander Jim beheim West Durham you havent missed Tyrese Proctors knocked down a three and hes had a scoop two or malawat has had a follow of a proctor Miss and heres Tyrese for another one that rattled out flag the rebound for the Blue Devils punched Away by blackshire first meeting ever between the two schools in this building Duke coming off the sixpoint loss of course Saturday at Clemson and CS trying to find their second ACC Road win of the year and its still this is the toughest thing for Cal three or four trip four trips across the country that is something that theyre not talking about but its its there the coach which game is more difficult that first game the midweek Wednesday game or the Saturday game once youve been here and got an opportunity to get acclimated know both of them are difficult the first one youre just getting here the second one youve been here too long almost so its its theyre both difficult nothing difficult for tyes pro to WD getting off to a great start yep hes part of our storyline tonight too I I thought John shs comments today about him were just fascinating about a young man whos now after a freshman flash maybe a sophomore dip now as a Juniors really starting to accelerate this Blue Devil program bears trying to get on the board petritis inside skips it back blacker will toss another three away short and James the rebound and when you come into Cameron Indoor you get opportunities like that you got to take advantage of them because Duke has tremendous spurred ability sto yakovich fites malow watch for the rebound and is that going to be the out of bounds last Touch by Duke I think the second foul on malawat no no foul in that possession just knocked off malawat out of bounds Jim what about tyres Proctor the patience of a junior the guy whos now kind of seeing the floor doing everything well its the shooting percentages hes making shots hes not making mistakes and hes theyre most really I think theyre canle really good but this guy is underrated in terms of what he brings to the table and on the other end Cal cant shoot they have games where they literally cant shoot but V Tes proo WD he came in with the reputation of a shooter but his freshman year Midway through the season went more to the point guard position pushing Jeremy roach off the basketball so now getting him back on the wing with an opportunity to make shots by being found by Cooper Flag by being found by seion James hes taking advantage of his opportunities sooko the follow of the Bears Miss and Cs on the board three minutes into the Ball Game Malik Brown handling the rock for flag now and heres Cooper on the drive and it bounds away against Soko bears trying to get in transition sto yakovich the catch coach if youre coaching Cooper flag on that possession do you ask him to shoot the pullup jump shot or continue to go in and attack the big guy on that one I like him to attack thats what he does coko made a great play he just got got big and its its a tough shot but I like flag going to the basket Brown came in the game by the way to spell malawat for Shys blue devs and Malik what he brings in his defense screening you know great hands he probably would lead the league in in steals if he played more cuz hes right there at couple per game at 18 minutes hes come back nicely from the knee in and he did lead the league and Ste as a season to go but of course continues to get his hand on basketball great from his for deflection standpoint sto yakovich will fall Away really struggled on Saturday against wake was just four of 13 and the last time that sto yakovich was in this area it took him all the way to the late second half to get his first field goal at North Carolina struggled in that game offensively well hes he struggled since he came back I mean hes really its been a real struggle for him and Duke is a tough team they switch so much and they get up on him uh hes going to have to work for everything tonight foul on sto yakovich in the front court is Duke handles heres canle winding through traffic and Score first basket for the Freshman from Milwaukee and hes really gotten better at putting the ball on the floor hes not just a shooter and hes people forget how big he is hes big hes a big guard and he can get to the basket fivepoint lead for number three duke still leading the ACC after seeing their 16game win streak snapped on Saturday at Clemson petrius out of the corner and its good Reus petritis the air force transfer just his 12th three of the Year petrius getting to that Corner Spot giving his teammate an outlet but him knocking down to three is a bonus but hes played much better basketball as of late Proctor again swatted out of there by sasoko thats going to get us to a timeout an emphatic rejection by the Bears big man back in a moment boss at Clemson on Saturday looking to have a bounceback performance here tonight blue dos will have the ball after after the rejection by sasoko a moment ago tend to shoot though very quickly as James handles The Possession flag fall away left of the lane is good first points of the night for the Freshman from Newport Maine and hes been relatively passive in first halves especially at home when his teammates get going looking to see Cooper be a little more aggressive to start the game off now one of two from the field heres Wilkinson against James look game fight for a spot right of the lane fall away thats well short air ball Brown the recovery uhoh Isaiah Evans is in and he you dont have to announce him hes going to announce himself yes he does has never seen a shot he didnt take flag follow way over petritis and a foul on Rus petrius first on petrius second on Cal the other one belongs to blackshire not sto yakovich so a couple of free throws coming for the Blue Devils and Cooper flag finding the open spot in the center of the zone and then plays 101 against ahoko and Coopers going to win that battle the majority of the time he gets an opportunity to play oneonone against anybody but especially a big guy trying to move his feet Jim it seems we keep looking for ways to keep talking about how good and how impactful flag is well I dont think you have to look too hard even I can see it from 90 Mi up here without my binoculars he affects the game at every end in every way shape or form playmaking def defensive plays block shots making shots so I mean thats why hes getting the attention hes getting hes clearly in my mind firing away the best all around player in college basketball he does a little bit of everything and uh the biggest thing with him though is hes got a will to win I was talking to coach Kay today and thats what he talks about his will his toughness and thats something you dont teach hes got it if Mike shashy says you get the will to win Cory you got it he wouldnt come to lunch with us today cuz you two guys were there and he didnt want to put up with two guys like you coach weve been holding you back all year we that goes Im really sorry about all that I know its amazing how Ive overcome it it is it really is its the story of the year really quite frankly off the floor Jose he threw it away heres Evans again the Duke turnover and a sixpoint lead Proctor had a three to open the game James against Joseph Ola Joseph and a travel is called by Jeb So Cal has gone to the bench and Joseph follow Joseph is in the game Lee Dort the Vanderbilt transfer and DJ Campbell out of Western Carolina who is actually from the 757 Cory has checked in for the Golden Bears little Virginia flavor on the floor yep Proctor James Brown flag and Showtime slim Isaiah Evans out there for the blue dos and heres sto yakovich against Brown this is what Duke is able to do with Malik Brown on the floor you can can switch defensively and still be able to make Cal make tough shots but that time sto Yakov is doing a great job getting in the paint finishing with the left thats what you have to do try to drive it against Malle Brown tried to pocket pass and it was inadvertently kicked itll stay with the Blue Devils and another look at Andre sto yakovich and we talked about sto yakovich struggling from Beyond the threepoint Arc however doing a great job getting downhill able to finish with that left hand and avoid the shot blocking potential of believe Brown so flags out Browns out James is out Mason Gillis plays for the Blue Devils tonight for the first time in three games hes missed the last two with illness and was very well missed by the Blue Devils at Clemson he saved them in the game on the road against wake Force hit three huge threes at the end of that one and Eric Lewis a three second call on common malawat well thats the first thats the first of the year I mean are you kidding me thats thats it shs like I didnt even know they had that call I thought they eliminated that call I think John shy is just as shocked as you are coach and it really wasnt that bad I mean normally to get a 3 second you got to be in there about eight heres cam or blackshire rather beg your pardon out front now this is DJ Campbell blackshire with 11 to shoot lost it on the dribble malow watch on the switch heres the kick for sto yakovich is three missed everything Ola Joseph the rebound and its blacker with the horn going off on the shot clock and a fresh 20 for the Bears this is a strength of the Bears offensive rebounding is they lead the ACC and offensive rebounding so one of the teams that you look for to be able to have to chase down their misses and as coach mentioned they miss a lot of shots throughout the game leaner from sto yakovich is short dor couldnt control it Jeff Hartness says it belongs to Cal well stoak doesnt he just isnt the same player before he got hurt he was leaning in he was making all those shots he just he hasnt got it found his rhythm if you take away you know games in the middle of the season its always difficult to get back into a rhythm interesting to see how Mason Gillis in game one back from being ill will be able to respond here tonight Proctor and Duke now on the Run Music heres malawat Tyrese tees up a deep three thats good we watched them go over that in their Scouting Report earlier today John Shire urging his guys if they go under that screen they give you space feel comfortable to let it fly y eight now for Proctor pair of triples in toe were 8 minutes in duks built a sevenpoint lead their largest here of the first half cows missed their last four shots and thats an offensive foul on the van the Vanderbilt transfer Lee Dort third on Cal thatll get us to a timeout Blue Devils will have the ball and a sevenpoint lead when we come Music back great start here this evening just as he has been all season long really being that consistent offensive performer on the exterior for John Shire to go alongside Cooper flag and KH canle the two fabulous freshman for the Blue Devils and tyres Proctor continues to grow we talked with John sh earlier today about his maturity the way hes come along from what was a low point for him a season ago the Arizona game in this building earlier and he said its been on a just absolute incline ever since yeah I I I think hes a huge key for this Duke team moving forward sometimes you got to be patient right coach well some some guys it takes a couple years nobody wants to hear that but with some guys it takes a couple years to get to where you want to Duke by seven canipa pull up oh look at the shot over Dort malawat fights for the offensive chance Gillis a three got it Mason Gillis back in the back in the ball game and on the scorebook well we talked about how he would look in his return and the first shot looks pretty good but basic Gils of course one of the best from Beyond The Arc for the Blue Devils knocking down the three ball sto yakovich out the Campbell now heres Dort heres Wilkinson J OJ Wilkinson thinks about it with five to shoot drives Gillis now theyre going to throw it away if theyre not careful two to shoot Dort or Ola Joseph there it is shot clock violation great defense well tuning up the defense Cory and when Gillis steps into the game and adds a three thats just extra but his experience is Elite youre talking about a young man that played a national championship game a season ago KH kiple with the extra pass there passes up an opportunity for himself to get a great shot from Mason Gillis at the top of the key Isaiah Evans on the perimeter heres malawat back for Proctor thatll Bound Away and a Ola Joseph the rebound 10point lead for the Blue Devils largest to the night and Wilson a deep three hes hes playing with a lot of even when hes not making shots hes still taking him hes still playing with confidence which is great for a freshman the coach he gets in the starting lineup once sto yakovich is ill and unable to be able to play now how do you manage that when a guy comes back sto yakovich back in the starting lineup but WIS has been playing so well you know its theyre two different positions so hes going to get his shots and still going to get his shot so my my whole issue is toov is he hasnt come back to show that he can get by people and make plays since hes been back and Wilkinson I mean he he has no fear hes just going to go I mean hes having a bad night and he just steps up there and makes a three when they really need it you know when youre playing Duke in here you cant let him get the two or three buckets spt cuz theyre going to run right away from you common malawat at the line 77 his last three games Five Points five rebounds as you see flag come back and Mark Matson has a line change again he gets sto yakovich Dort and Ola Joseph out of the game brings petritis blackshire and Soko back we talk we talked about the game at Clemson for the Blue Devils where their 16 game winning streak was broken Cooper flag played 38 minutes in that game with no Mason Gillis he had to put in some extra time ended up cramping late in that game and you could see did not have it in him to be able to will him to a win at the end of the and they didnt make any excuses but theres no question he was a little under the weather for theame yeah he hes not an excuse maker not going to give anybody that opportunity Wilkinson skips it but trus couldnt pull the trigger hell drive on Gillis that got swatted by malawat but first a foul thats the play where the GU guy guarding the balls got to realize I got the shot blocker behind me and Mason didnt have to reach in there he could have just let it go and malat was going to have that one P trus going to get a couple out of this junior transfer Arlington Texas first one is good dont forget our first mens lacrosse game of the season right here on acc Network in the ESPN app number seven Virginia welcomes Richmond to clockner Stadium in charlotts will coverage start Saturday morning 1130 on acc Network Im not going to be prejudiced or anything or biased but watch out for already wait you already laid the groundwork by saying youre not going to be Im making one ex bias by the way Im allowed one exception heres flag on the drive hes got six Ive been to every lacrosse game for 40 some years so Im I know what Im talking about there okay where it is you watch Jim Brown play lacrosse at Syracuse I didnt say it I was only about 2 years old then come on stop I was 12 theres Wilkinson I did watch him play football he was fairly good thanks appreciate the confirmation uh n point lead on the Miss and they go to the deck Gillis and petritis Hell ball will stay with the Blue Devils theres a little football right there from Gillis whos built like a football player he and seante the two of those guys are put together down there Mason Gillis is second on the foot built like football players yeah he James hes second but when it comes to this court hes only second to seon James he is a strong young man and absolutely willing to give up his body to go get the loose ball on the floor SE James is man I mean he is physical he can guard he can do a lot hes a really good player ironically SE J his football career came to a close on an ACL injury as an early in his high school career theres a drive and a miss by Wilkinson and malawat finally gets a rebound heres Caleb Foster off John shs bench into the lineup and this is a good opportunity for Caleb Foster to build some confidence get going and find his way truly to being part of this run for the Blue Devils theyre going to need him as this season goes along M second three of the year thats not good its great for bat coach yes its very good its not good for Cal 12point lead now for the Blue Devils Back Door sasoko y sasoko made have saw the dust on the top of the rim one that one WD he put his head in the rim tell you what Mar sasoko is 69 listed at 240 grad transfer from Michigan State from the West African country of Molly Tyrese proor who played against Michigan State early in his career asked John Shire is that the same sasoko that we saw in Michigan State because hes playing completely different for cow yep long three good thats Applause flag poer flag now with nine points shooting the basketball extremely well from the floor WD looking at his ACC numbers it is ridiculous over 50 from the field over 40 from three continues to be great in every other category of the game and in one rating Im not going to give them props because I dont really know their name but he is the number one defensive player in the nation blacker two to shoot three ball over James missed everything another shot clock violation on cow well Duke is getting stops on defense and theyre fuing the fire with threes at the offensive air you got two freshman knocking down the three ball Mala watch is only got a few of them early in the year Cooper flag has been shooting it much under the weather but unable to stand the test against Ian sheon Victor Lock and both those guys were dominant on the interior Cooper flag was slow offensively in that game only four points for the first 36 minutes score 14 of Dukes last 17 points Jim we saw him last Tuesday night Clemson was going to be a handful regardless right is getting better they theyve got a lot of Veteran guys theyre going to be difficult in the tournament season wait a minute you talking about being difficult you guys got him a loss you went down there and got Brad Brownell and Clemson a lost he told me he didnt want to see you guys anymore he loves me he he does he loves me oh my gosh 7 minutes to go sasoko after the turnover by the Blue Devils and last touched on the entry pass by canle itll stay with Cal but I dont think Ill mind if I dont go back to Grand come on now dont do dont do that dont do that dont get yourself in trouble down there love it dont do that did you love The Possession defensively last time for Mark Madson going Zone against the Blue Devil en forcing the turnover you try it it might work it probably wont in here but youre going to try it and just see if it gets him off their stride a little bit foul on Caleb Foster its his first fourth on the blue do Eric Lewis looking at the Duke bench after they were upset about the call and looking at the guys like really Im calling that every time Caleb Foster getting a piece of the arm there coming up with the steel but I love what John shires doing right now getting Caleb Foster action and minutes trying to get him back integrated into this rotation Caleb fer playing without confidence right now needs to find that to help his blue double team what a pass by blackshire sto yakovich a scooping score with the right hand hes got six and hes been doing a great job getting to the rim coach yeah thats what he needs to do especially against Duke theyre not going to let him shoot from the outside still 11point Blue Devil lead seon James looking for a path to the basket hell come to a stop and a travel call by Mark snner as I think Mark Madson was trying to help that could have been a push I agree with you WD on this pass Im going to go as far as to say black Seer had zero idea where he was throwing that basketball he just had to get rid of it because he jumped to pass it fortunately for him his teammate to yakovich in the right spot and able to get a bucket off of him heres Wilkinson who hit a three early thats his only basket sto yakovich boy kipo got there nicely sto yakovich a step back and it rattled out on him last touch though by sasoka who was battling Brown sto Yakov is now one of his last 18 from three Im not sure Alber goes out on them as as hard as they are right now I may give him an opportunity to show me that he can make him because he can absolutely beat you off the bouns he shown that throughout this game well that was a big shot for him he needs to make one of those would close out Jim or would you give him the look Id probably close out hes hes going to make an open way youre going based upon his last name yes heres flag a DK theres the Zone look and they screen down on the big guy and now Cooper gets it right in the middle and thats an easy one great execution and it wont show up in the stat sheet but awesome screen by Malik Brown defensively in that zone taking Soko out of the play Dukes just too good against zones take us through this again here coach they you missed the screen down but there was a little screen inside and now Cooper gets it in the middle theres nobody there to defend it the center can I always say to ARS you cannot be screened if the screen comes at you you know theyre trying to get one on the top side youve got to beat the screen you cannot let that screen take you down there yeah WD I would have loved the conversation when the center did get screen after he told him they not good if we hadit a backup he was coming in Ola Joseph short with the three flag the rebound Brown was called for the foul by the way first for Malik Brown its the fifth on Duke here Cs got four we got five and a half minutes to go in this first frame its a 13point Blue Devil lead James and the rebound for Jo OJ Wilkinson front court for Cal the stars have been pretty quiet sto yakovich has six Wilkinson three thats nine of their 17 this is a defensive effort from sure is its really good blacker on the drive follow away over Brown and the rebound James but Duke did their job when they force you to have to take those tough shots even if they make them you did the job defensively look at that oh thats a block for sto yakovich yeah sto yakovich averaging 12 blocks per game in Cooper Music flag as one of the very one of three guys averaging the numbers that hes putting up this year including the Steals and blocks so sto yakovich not just doing the job on the offensive end of the floor the other guy Cooper flag Andre sto yakovich and J broom thats great company to be in really right now its probably a two horse race for players of the Year broom and Cooper I think right right now seon James the foul his first six on Duke and bounce for sto yakovich against Evans The Freshman Andre with the right hand rejected malawat scooped up Andre sto yakovich right back in and draws the foul but watch Showtime slim move his feet and defend thats not something you saw from him earlier this year does a great job Walling up allow Comm malat to come in with the block shot but the effort defensively by Evans is something that really kept John shy from playing him heavy minutes early in the year oh yeah it was the most scrutinized dnps you were seeing yeah cuz fans were like why is he not playing especially after he comes in hit six threes in the first half against Auburn but what he did he showed John Shire that you can trust him on the defensive end of the Flor to give you the effort still not a great defender coach but hes going to play much harder on that end hes young sometimes it takes a guy year but you got to give stovich a lot of credit there he got a shot block he went right after it and turned and came right back at it hes shown a little lot tonight to me in terms of just being tough getting to the basket and it feels like we last Saw Andre in Chapel Hill against Carolina who did a really nice job on him defensively he didnt scor you well into the second half he came in averaging over 20 points per game theres a backourt foul on Campbell as C continues to kind of ramp up a little pressure here but it feels like in some since hes matured as the season is unfolded knowing hes the number one guy at the top of the Scouting Report well I think hes also recognized hes only shooting 30 from three so dont settle for the threes continue to use his size and athletic ability trying to get downhill attacking the basket already three field goals for him today getting to the rim even though he hasnt been able to get anything going from the outside you got to give Cal credit theyre changing up their defenses theyre trying to press theyre trying to switch to the Zone theres a quick call foul on Wilkins and its his second but coach I think you have to do that against Duke right you dont want to give them a steady diet of anything to allow them to be comfortable no 16 foul on the Bears by the way the second on the Freshman from Powder Springs who by the way is the threetime ACC rookie of the week Jeremiah Wilkinson only Cooper Flags one more put it this way WD Wilkinson has three times more than anyone else in the league except for C flag three times more than jeremi Wilson yeah yeah they call a Runway yeah oh its a runaway all right Proctor against Ola Joseph heres kiple Baseline and good its a smart play by kiple to go drive the Baseline and when the help has to stay with Mala wats and dont give up the rim now you allow canle to be able to get a just little bit of separation and go to the midrange largest lead 13 Applause Ola Joseph tend to shoot Duke digs down defensively now Wilkinson against Proctor o what a screen Wilkinson foul line couldnt hit it Dort the rebound and a hell ball will stay with the Bears and thatll get us to a timeout yeah proor is going to feel that screen a little bit though WD John shy not happy with their not being a call on that one even though hes happy with a 13point lead because whatever happened at the end of the Florida State weight game he probably did and he still scarred from what happened between he and Coach beheim afterwards so thats probably why my man MCW didnt say a word MCW was so good he never got yelled at in his last year he was you didnt even play him as a freshman what do you mean thats why I never yelled at him he he wasnt in the game and the next year he was in the game the whole game and you didnt yell at him cuz he was so good right he was so good oh my goodness 13point lead for Duke Mason Gillis back on the floor second sequence weve seen him here in this first half with Evans heres kiple by the way flag on the bench here John sha really is trying to kind of find those rotations tune them up a little bit now hes got everybody back having Mason Gillis back absolutely helps you get Cooper flag some rest Proctor couldnt get the roll sto yakovich front Court trailing Applause 13 no field goals last three and a half Applause theres the turnover by the Bears its all defense for you kiple bounced away good look and once again off of a deflection so its almost free money right there to when you get that deflection get out in transition opportunity for you to score points off of turnovers WD the Blue Devils had 18 points off turnovers versus Clemson in the game on Saturday so they were able to expl like that Clemson shot close to 70 in the first half however Duke was still had a lead simply because of all those points off turnover here goes Proctor on the drive and thats going to be a foul I believe on Dort Jeb Hartness out from underneath and it is on the Vanderbilt transfer from Dallas thats big Lee Dort who goes 610 245 and Dukes movement has been really good tonight theyre getting good shots theyre getting to the basket area theyre getting open threes and this is especially when Cooper goes out of the game this is good for them to be able to learn how to play and score when hes on the bench proed to the free throw dont forget softball season rolls on the Shriners childrens Clearwater Invitational coming up this weekend ACC network is the home for four games starting on Thursday at two Kentucky Virginia and you see Friday has Florida State Saturday Clemson and Sunday at 1000 UCLA in Virginia its here for you on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN app nice nice first half for Proctor by the way how about the the beautiful weekend in Charlottesville on grounds at University of Virginia we already did a promo for Richmond visiting in Lacrosse now youve got two softball games Kentucky and UCLA visiting dont know those are in Clearwater Florida what yeah yeah a little better than Charlottesville no offense to Charlottesville little no offense but the weather a little warmer down there you know well I mean if anyones talking about warmer it shouldnt be you you clearly like weather Soko fou by GB they said it was cold here today I said what its a summer spring day for you right now easy foul on Patrick gangba the true freshman from Manasses Virginia itll be his first eighth on the Blue Devils and mty sasoko who is a 70 free throw Sho this kid this is a terrific young man theres a wonderful story on the Cal website about sasoko taking his nil earnings back into his home Village in Mali and developing water operations and things for The Villages and so I mean just a remarkable yeah sense of who he is and where hes from I had a couple kids from Africa and did the same thing sent money home from parents who to the school back home second is short so its 3320 under two to go in the first half see heres flag back this is this looks a little different defensively somewhat of a Zone but you got to find that guy at the top of the key Cooper flag missing a good look look at the big fell rip it away and draw the foul Cals having trouble scoring but theyre doing a good job trying to hang into this game I mean its theres a little too much separation right now but if they could get a couple buckets at the end of the half here give them a thought that they could come back in the second half second on kiple also an opportunity for them to put points on the boards without having to do it at the free throw line sooko back at the strike went one of two on the last trip but as you mentioned coach has the opportunity to get closer cut into that lead a little bit without the clock running and when you get in here you have to make your free throws you have to make a couple shots to be in the game and missed another one missed the front end of the one and one so one of three is mty Soko at the line here goes flag through the lane with a left hand hell take the contact and shoot free throw sooko that will be his first and thatll be the eighth on Cal here in this second half as we wind down these final 93 seconds Taylor and Luke and MCW at the break Louisville a winner tonight in Raleigh Florida State in wake and there was Rama all over the place in Winston Salem and Georgia Tech held Maxim Reno tonight to eight points on four of 13 meanwhile Nate George had 22 points and Dongo had 15 points and 16 rebounds for Georgia teack Nate George has been one maybe the most improved player in the league especially from the beginning of the year hes just been tremendous Im going to argue that one coach but we well get into that one later well Im not giving it right but hes been hes been pretty good stovic definitely one of the most improved as we see Wilkinson knocking down the three ball to top of the key but how about a guy that played for the Duke Blue levels a year ago and now stord Cardinal jayen Blakes who has the highest increase in points per game nationally hes had a good year I like Nate George just because of all the stuff he does theist the hand on the ball running the team yeah love with Nate Geor is doing had a big game you guys call it against when they went to Clemson and won that triple overtime game was huge sto yakovich Baseline Fall Away on gangba no good James the Applause rebound lead is 15 for the Blue Devils Cal just one of their last eight Proctor out Applause front now hell tee up a three front rim Miss blacker on the Run kick out Wilkinson Lefty three too strong they crash the Glass St yakovich had it it gets knocked around and the final possession will belong to the Blue Devils you can call it a small thing but no recognition of time and score on that possession it was opportunity for Cal to take the last shot of the half and they take a quick one giving the basketball back to the Blue Devils with an opportunity to add to their lead 15point lead for John sh and Duke the use lose it timeout with 13 to go here in the first and the Blue Devils have fired it away at about a 45 clip from the floor Cal under 29 here in this first half all defense but to Corys point you as a coach you just hate to see somebody run in there and try to take a shot when you get the last shot yeah and thats the difference coach if Duke scores here now they get to 40 even 41 so push the lead up to 17 18 in comparison to if Cal is able to keep that last possession and get a score youre talking about possibly a 13point game its a big difference Zone from the Golden Bears here Duke has been really good against this Zone they got a lot of weapons flag the runner Here Comes Campbell from the beyond the midcourt line oh and it hit the back of the rim but Duke is still going to take a 3823 lead to the locker room so the number three Blue Devils in control here in the first Luke Hancock in studio hold it down for your home state of Virginia coach Bean talking about clear water better than Virginia come on man stop it hold it down for Luke were going with MCW thanks Michael Taylor tanon bomb good Music luck what theyve been able to rely on for the majority of ACC play Cooper flag with 13 points in the first half tyres Proctor the only player who made multiple three points field goals for the Blue Devils and he continues his Stellar play here for Duke bears with the ball to start second half here sto yakovich to work off the Baseline can nipple the rebound and the Blue Devils back on the attack very quickly Proctor digging in on blacker o nice steal nice play and Wilkinson comes away with the turnover and the basket so the Freshman from Powder Springs Georgia has now got eight in the ball game and Wilkinson continues to do the job on both ends of the floor and when you get easy baskets as such coach for a score youd love to see your top guys getting out the transition right yeah thats the kind and that play was there last time they missed it they found it this time but when you often see the Blue Devils go to something on the interior to start games to start halves often times its a lob to malat coach you mentioned they had it on first possession but didnt execute it correctly this time they get it done on the second offensive possession of the half high percentage shot blacker front rim Miss of the three James the rebound lead for flag oh couldnt quite flag it down I see what you did there no very good James through traffic before the sasoka rejection a foul I believe on Javon blackshire do often put you in such a predicament when they play pick and roll action because what is s Soko supposed to do there other than get dunked on if he doesnt take away malow watch then Proctor gets the layup and when he commits to Proctor you throw it up and end up being on the wrong side of a highlight from K Malo he cant Proctor cant get in that deep if he gets in that deep hes going to make that play or make it have an easy layup can I just offer you this that in the last 6 and a half half games seon James has now had 26 assists and five turnovers that any good I never saw any type of assist turnover ratio that looked anything like that but seon James has been the perfect compliment to this Blue Devil Squad and most importantly its allowed tyres procer to get off the ball and become more of a shooter 10 for Wilkinson now couple of Threes in the first half and Cs first two field goals here in half two flag against petritis tough match up for Reus can I help Proctor three from the front coach you help off him you got to help someplace else and Wilkinson just puts his hand in the air letting everyone know thats my bad leaving a guy thats already knocked down 50 of his threes here today Applause 4527 18point lead with two change gone blackshire in traffic finds petritis underneath its a good play from blackshire he struggled hes old for six he hasnt able to get points on the board Javon blackshire might lead the country an assist off passes when he leaves his feet its a unique category uhoh malat fouled by Soko that was a collision between two big guys Mala taking a second to get up but Soko making sure that he did not give up the dunk there was going to be no dunk that time no it was not malas came in with mean intentions however and giv aoko a lot of credit he goes vertically but just strong enough to be able to body up malawat knock him backwards and prevent that highlight from happening and he brought his hands down thats when youre theyre going to call that every time you got to keep your hands straight up so here is common malow watch from the South Sudan who wears number nine Cory you know why he wears nine right Im going to go with L alang it is a nod to Lou alang Who was his mentor y in the Sudan and of course he played on the South Sudan Olympic team last summer in the Olympics and got to tell you that group was competitive in the bracket that the US finally won the gold with yeah they gave the US everything that they could handle just like K can nipple is doing on the interior the second chance points for the Blue Devils now they have a 144 Advantage Wilkinson against flag Proctor helped out tend to shoot petritis now skips for sto yakovich against kiple Andre trying to find a crease fallway is short off the front rim and heres flag they just dont give you anything easy Cooper through traffic and Applause one he uses his left hand just about as well as anybody he just gets in there and uses it its this is a great play yeah weve seen Cooper go to the left hand off and this time off of rebound brings in 94 ft attacking the basket goes by petritis and then attacking sasoko we saw what he did K malat on the earlier possession none of that to be had by Cooper flag who allows it to hang on the rim just a little while before he flexes so here is flag who as Cory told you hitting 53 from the floor get the league 46 from behind the line and 84 at the foul line its pretty good guess thats why he might be the first pick in the draft yeah hes also five for five at the line hes got 16 now in the game his his release has gotten better as the years gone along hes going to be a really good shooter someday yeah went spent some time at home with his dad Ralph got in the gym over the Christmas break and really regained that shooting touch he said he was lacking it in the first part of the season for the Blue Devils but then once he turned 18 has been able to turn it up the TR to some Miss on the three Proctor the rebound and then stolen blacker standing conf right there nope watch the rebound confidence for no reason he over would that be irrational confidence coach that would Applause be the lead is 21 its largest for the Blue Devils theres a bump and a foul on petritis you just cant guard him when he gets that angle on you and gets to the Lane I I just think the one thing Cory and Coach that gets discussed about flag and the one thing Ive noticed in seeing him live first of all I think hes better live than he is on television no offense to our industry but I think he sees the floor Cory at 94 ft just about as well as anybody Ive ever seen live he really does and he he celebrates his teammate success thats the best part about of his game is hes not looking for individual success hes about winning so he knows his teammates have to be successful for them to win was part of the reason why hes in the top 10 in the ACC and assist as well yep heres James out front flag over the top of petritis and tapped home malawat 10 now for com malawat Coach Cal just cant score when you cant score you just cant play a team like Duke now theyve got the worst field goal shooting percentage in ACC play at under 40 its going to be a lot lower tonight blackshire and flag the rebound on the backside but what an advantage to have your 69 freshman we call him a four but hes really not that with the ability to the rebound and then facilitate initiating offense allows the Blue Devils really to get out and transition and play much faster another one nope common hit one in the first half his second of the year thats enough for him heres Wilkinson and James the rebound they just cant make a shot no the Cal Knight is not getting better even when theyre getting the open looks on that like that last possession those are ones you have to capitalize on we saw cow get a lot of those shots early in the game and when you dont make them coach early does that start to weigh you down from a confidence standpoint no question you just have to see the ball go in bears are three of 11 from the floor in this second half and a timeout is taken the lead 23 for number three duke here tonight at Camp counter punch punch tonight I think its interesting two different physical dimensions but both very effective and impactful for their team both very impactful for their teams but one an 18yearold won the four youngest players in the conference and won a fifth year senior who is a grown man at this point in his career and playing a lot of big games at Michigan State so you seeing the experience versus potential in that matchup between the two and right now you have to say that potentials winning 6 and 12 years older Soko is 24 years old theres a foul on Evans so Isaiah Evans sees the floor 66 freshman from F North Carolina for the first time better known by the way as Showtime slim uhhuh uh comes in ready to shoot but to his credit he has found meaningful minutes in the rotation of Duke as the season is gr gone along and I think hes a piece too Cory that down the stretch for the Blue Devils Evans is going to have to be a factor and John Shire is starting to trust him more and more throughout the Seas season he understands that he needs his shooting but he loves his mentality coming off the bench always ready he talked about in previous games where hell start inching closer and closer closer to his seat start rocking his leg letting coach Shire know Im ready to go coach its about my time 11 to shoot for Cal and sto yakovich with kiple defending to put it in Play heres Campbell winding around Evans to the basket with a right hand and a great job by Evans defensively Walling up and forcing a tough shot not allowing Campbell to be able to get the layup on that Applause possession and heres Proctor now against DJ Campbell Brown the screen hell challenge Dort look at that and offensive foul on Malik Brown uh Im not sure and when you think about that Malik Brown gets stopped by Dort but is it because the oh theres the offensive foul its that yeah its that left elbow to the chin theyre going to go over and look at this one and see if that needs to be upgraded for a flagrant one hard to see that well from our angle but more importantly lucky to see the court possible FL foul thats Eric Lewis the referee with Mark snner theyll be to the monitor here first and of course Jeff Hartness rounds out are officiating crew nerd one of my travel Partners we hang out in the Sky Club together wow okay nice you know he gets me into the American Club I of course take him in the Scott Club you know you you dont really want to talk about hanging out with a referee those are my people I am a referee friendly Im a referee friendly broadcaster and let me say this you didnt you never coached thats all I can since the Hall of Famer has joined us hes become very officiating friendly oh absolutely These Guys these guys Ive always said these officials in the ACC really they do a great job now I didnt say they were good but theyre better than some guys around the country all right so now as you sit in this seat how are you going to assess this one is this a flagrant one or will this be just I would say I would say it was completely accidental theyll probably call it flagrant one but I dont theyll probably call it a flagrant but after review the play has been upgraded to a flag one elbow to the face so flavorant one on Malik Brown and well get another version of it it absolutely is accidental however you cant measure intent the elbow does make contact above the shoulders which means that will absolutely be a flagrant one foul yep nothing like your old days of coaching in the 80s when you could punch somebody and just be a common foul correct coach pretty much heres well lead D is 61 at the line in the Big East there would be no players left in the game if that was a flagrant and the first one good for the Dallas Jr 22 years of age is Lee Dort born in Haiti a year ago at Vanderbilt 17 games or actually one game a year ago uh 17 games two years ago in the 23 campaign it was injured last year correct able to split the pair on the flagrant free throws but Cal gets the basketball back with an opportunity to try to cut into this lead its 22 right now and if youre Mark mat and youre trying to find something to go in your favor remember the trip over is two game so theyre going to play again on Saturday and you want to be able to take some type of positive momentum into your weekend game Wilkinson trying to find something against kiple and he does twopoint pull up that was really his best oneonone situation in this game he took his time he got in the lane and got a really good shot but playing against Duke is one of the very few teams that will allow you to play oneonone because they force you to have to make great individual plays to beat them proor scores on the drive hes now got 14 thats that same scenario we saw from Proctor earlier where he throws the AL alyo to malawat but he puts the big in such a predicament there you take him away or you give up a layup which we saw in the last possession that a layup heres the pullup Wilkinson and the rebound for Ola Joseph and a reaching foul on Gillis once again Proctor getting downhill and you see dor retreating because he doesnt want to give up the alley to Malik Brown and so as he stunts trying to take away Proctor Proctor not deterred at all able to get the easy left hand layup fourth foul on Duke second on Mason Gillis out of Newcastle Indiana Newcastle Indiana WD Steve Alford the largest high school basketball arena in the country that is correct yep played there coaching at oakill my gu Steve Smith whos here tonight in the building tonight came up to see coach Bean yeah Hall of Fame coach yep one of the greats at oill I dont know how many he won but he probably won at least 10 national championships didnt he uh I think its nine I think the number is actually nine bad not bad at all and to get there you cant get there no thats very true youre one of the very few that has been to mouth of Wilson multiple times multiple times Evans live for brown got batted Applause away almost 8 minutes gone here in the second half petrius on the receiving end and Evans knocked it over the end line here comes Foster flag for Duke Proctor will check out and Evans will come out no canle so were going to see were going to see excuse me Jim were going to see Gillis and flag together here Cory MH and thats one of the lineups that John Shire talked to us about is being able to implement that and you really have Cooper now playing the three position right with Gillis at the four Malik Brown at the five so Malik Brown and Gillis have both missed time for the Blue Devils this year John Shire is so excited to have both those guys back in the rotation first on flag fifth on the blue doubles fresh 20 for Cal and flag boy does not turn the motor down at all doesnt know what that means thats the beauty he doesnt know what that means every play so the very important stretch for Caleb Foster reason being Caleb Foster does not have a field goal since the Miami game wow hes had three field goals in that game doesnt have one since this is the opportunity for him now to get going and try to find find some confidence Foster into traffic back to flag Duke by 22 look at Cooper flag go Marcus Haynes good Heavens you can Google it if youre younger folks I would go curly Neil but that was a good call too hes from Greensboro get a foul on H was before your time this is true coach yeah curly Neil was from Greensboro when we come back the Golden Bears as the ACC goes Coast to Coast about one and n on the trips its too hard theyre doing everything right theyre not making excuses but its just too hard in my mind to make kids travel that much four times across the country and playing games and being away from home I I think its just too hard and I think the ACC can help by eliminating at least one of those trips as we see Cooper flag go to the Turn Around by during the Christmas break when neither of those schools are in a allow them to stay at least 2 weeks to play four to five games on the East Coast allow them to get acclimated theyre not missing class time and allow them to be able to play those games and eliminate at least one of those trips across country yeah the only problem with that is you have school break Christmas breaks and the schools dont want to play with no students there but theyre playing games anyway thats still the time where youre playing ACC game so you got to play somebody yeah theyre trying to cut back on the ACC G heres Steel by flag in the open floor hey oh thatll be on Sports Center yes it will I see you young fella now weve talked about Coopers Ducks throughout the year and even though this one is not catching a body Im putting this one at number one my young fell with a little Showtime on this one even a smile on the way back recognizing his own work Cooper flag showing off here at home defense and boy the Blue Devils have responded here tonight yeah a different team obviously in Clemson but they they theyve really done a good job defensively made it hard for Kell to get anything good coach how important is it to have games like that at Clemson where you unable to get you know get the win is it a wakeup call is that something that as a coach you often say maybe our team needed this well I I dont like that but I think you do learn a little bit more kids listen a little bit more when you lose a game like that P trus on the board his second three of the night hes got nine in the game usually when you avoid a loss like that you win by a couple at the end the kind of lesson kind of goes away yeah flag has got another 20point game Evans has a three Bound Away that was last Touch by the Bears I think no says Eric Lewis off of Blue Devil so itll stay with Cal with under 10 to go and Dort is out and so is STO yakovich sooko and DJ Campbell return theres a look at Cooper Flags night this is a great opportunity for Duke to get some other guys some opportun game opportunities to try to get better by the way its his ninth 20point game in conference play not bad for a freshman young guy 18 barely figuring it out coach you coached in my opinion the best oneand done freshman in the college basketball game Wilkinson is able to knock down the three ball hes talking about me talking about best one in done freshman but I believe you coach the best one in Carmelo Anthony yeah there he he he led us to the National Championship had 30 point 34 points National Championship G semifinals had 28 I mean he was just a man back then if Cooper flag is able to lead this Duke team to a national championship which is the you know that has to happen to be in that category do you place him in the same standing as Carmelo Anthony and what hes been able to do this season if he can go that far I mean he does more things Melo was more of a rebounder in score mhm Cooper does some things defensively that very few guys really can do and helps everybody be better hes really a a point forward type player that kind of player they dont come along very often I mean he hes different we everybody said that all year long and hes held up to that hes hes actually I think going beyond that a little bit he gets better every time I see him the biggest thing he has hes got a toughness to him heres Wilkinson tried to oh nice pass to petritis and Soko off the bounce pass it hit the back iron for malawat and is that double double number four for malawat I think so yep sure is and theres a block by motty here come the Bears the other way petritis sooko double clutch malawat affected that were going to get a hell ball and possession will go to the Blue Devils we talked about the injuries to Malik Brown and then of course Mason Gillis getting sick missing time that may have been the best thing that could have happened for this Duke team according to when you consider the development of K malawat because he was forced to have to play more minutes and understanding that he cant get in foul trouble but he had backto back double doubles during that stretch without Malik Brown I believe he has a a different level of confidence now when he steps on the floor in comparison to before kles short on the three Soko the rebound hes all canle chased that one coach are you still a fan of following your shot no very sellem the shooters do that there you go very S I tried to explain that before but Im glad you backed me up on that one thats not theres not a lot of confidence when youre following your shot normally as a shooter when you let it go you think its going in theres no need to follow it up most Shooters go backwards we have goty a long time ago that foued the shot John Bagley at Boston C this is way back he used to get two or three offensive rebounds every game cuz he would just go right for it yeah they say that the person that misses the shot knows where its going in my mind I never missed one so I wouldnt be able to tell you about that oh Proctor high off the glass over sissoko what a nice ball game for Tyrese Proctor now whos got 16 in the game WD this is really the ballot scoring that they had when they played against North Carolina you had three guys with 20 points in flag Proctor and KH canle all three of those guys scoring 20 be a foul on Proctor thatll get us to a timeout under seven Duke by 23 is SMU and Wake Forest SMU 0 and4 versus quad one theyre going to have to get 15 maybe even 16 wins and that when that one opportunity in the quad one that they have remaining in conference Play Wake for us after losing tonight theyre going to have to get both of their remaining quad One games including a victory here in Cameron Indoor and the way the NCAA committee works if you dont have a couple of quad one wins cuz all these other conferences have eight or 10 teams when you play them their quad one wins youre going to get them so I think theyre at the end of the day when the committee looks at their record even if they have 15 wins if they have one or maybe two quad one wins I I dont its going to be hard at one point though does quad one wins and quad three losses counter one another like is their value to one more so than the other I think I think at the end of the day they really look at that quad one wins even though its unfair because some teams are playing 14 or 15 quad One games and if they win five of them theyre five and 10 but they got five in the ACC you might have one or two but you might only have eight six opportunities to get a quad one win you AG that heres the absolutely agree with Coach but heres the other side to that that is the remainder of the regular season we also have to include the ACC tournament where you could have more opportunities to get those quad one wins and then be able to build on that resume for if you dont win the the ACC tournament you still have those games under your belt for Clarity on the deacons their two quad one opportunities are at SMU on Saturday and here in Duro for SMU their one quad one opportunity is a week from Saturday Clemson at Moody Coliseum and so you get have that opportunity against Clemson and but then youre talking about teams that will if theyre getting 15 wins theyre going to be that top four in the ACC tournament and so now youre automatically going to get great opportunities in your Thursday quarterfinals as well as if youre able to advance to the semifinals on Friday and possibly that Saturday championship game yep here is flag in traffic fallway over sasoko is short Malo watch a rebound sasoko rejected that blackshire the other way Duke by 23 as we come up on five minutes to play and Javon blackers first points of the game and give Cal credit theyre not quitting not giving up but theres so much to be gained on this trip you have to consider that theyre going to be on the East Coast for three more days two days off the practice time and then well have a game Saturday so they have opportunity to be able to take something away from this game even though theyre down big you want to finish on a positive momentum canle the miss petrius the rebound Bears on the move here Wilkinson thought about Applause it heres the kick out for blackshire in another three five straight for Javon blackshire in a mark Matson timeout a little too little too late 6547 under five to go at Cameron number three dke on the way to their 13th League win 14 from the floor tonight guys five rebounds three assists three steals for the freshman and he didnt wait till the second half to really get going ran into his mom after the loss at Clemson and that was the first thing she said he cant wait until half number two to start playing and he absolutely at 13 points in the first half of this one and then the reverse dunk with a little smile over it to the Music camera just always listen to your mother if she tells you something thats all I can tell you I can tell you what she tells him a lot coach she tells him a lot Kelly of course coach Cooper for Maine United as along along with his brother Ace whos playing for our guy Freddy at Greensboro Freddy Johnson yeah Greensboro day now so Im sure As checking the game out after practice or game tonight well whatever shes been telling them its its working pretty good well she was a pretty good player herself think about not just Kelly but youve got a number of Big Time Moms in this Duke program weve already talked about Sher kiple as well as tajma gangba who was a w former WNBA player Patrick gums mom so some moms who got buckets on this Duke roster fo under five to go Eric Lewis on the Baseline think the ball got kicked Mark Matson and trying to get his group set heres seon James on the inbounds and now Proctor front Court lke by the way will have Stanford here on Saturday Cory will be back in the Crows Nest right with Dicky V its going to be crazy in here even crazier than it normally is with the crazies yep flag on the drive front rim Miss and a foul so Stanford and Duke ABC and the matchup will be Cooper flag Maxim Reno who was held to eight points tonight on four of 13 in Atlanta so two of the top scorers maybe the guy whos got a chance to be the leading scorer and the leading rebounder in the ACC when the years over in Rau and again in a normal year that would be an automatic for ACC player of the year but I wouldnt call this a normal year when youve got a freshman playing at the level hes playing but you know weve seen freshman win ACC Player of the Year and and Rookie of the Year and Zions done it but there was one actually who did it before Zion you remember who that was won a national championship with the blue doubles big guy mhm oh I got WD J there you go I was just letting beam have a swing all right I got you just I me I was going to be a fair guy here team guy trying to share the rock a little bit with you guys you know oh come on I get it and Marvin baggley didnt win player of the year I dont believe but he was I know he led the I believe he led the ACC in scoring and possibly rebounding as well was in the mix for player of the year and then Vernon carry thats right could have very well won it but was not on the ballot I remember that yeah I remember that his teammate Trey Jones was ACC Player of the Year and defensive player of the year sasoko missed the front end yeah Chicagos Jalil okaf for his his one year in this league gets lost sometimes it really does in a national championship to boot so but he had a great Freshman Class along with him and Trey Jones Justice Winslow yep out of the corner James my son buddy played against Oka fur and the g League hes still playing and still he has a huge impact in that League just got called up to the Pacers I believe they knew the Lakers were going to come get them if they if the Pacers didnt call them up 70 to 47 sto yakovich trying to find a way boy you see James leaning a little bit on the help there wilon and one took it took him a while but hes been good in this half four3 of the night for Jeremiah Wilkinson oh it looks like Cory Alexander just spot up and ripping I wish my left hand looked like that Well here heres the I was Elite baseball player but the worst part about it was I had to wear a Boston Red Sox hat and Im a yanies fan but I can tell you right now our producer will black the best and I say it with my chest the best young catcher Ive ever seen okay young man had so much command behind the plate leadership and no no question as to why he was going to be great in life and now you see he gets to actually tell Jim beheim what to do I tell you what my guy will black is absolutely made it my man Bob black has to be proud of his son yep that is one of the greatest overstatements Ive ever heard in my life what what his what has will black got on you holy my God first of all will Blacks about 5 fo2 so I dont know how he could be that great CER coach hes bigger than that and he lives Durham doesnt know Toro Pizzeria oh no is beyond me cuz its as good as any pizza youre going to get anywhere including New York City yeah and its a bayam Bs favorite Cory well for the record for the record there are a lot of people in the state of North Carolina that are absolutely happy that Jim baham said that there was anything here better in New York City tons of great places tons I love this food in North Carolina 21o lead for Duke sasoko lost it on the pocket pass trve from blackshire heres Darren Harris a Look Away Foster the three nope bounds away gun by the rebound big Pat could play a part for this team as the season goes along yep he got some experience and some minutes when Malik Brown was out of the lineup with injury now you see John Shire going with both bigs on the floor which is something I think theyll do more often especially after they were Exposed on the interior at Clemson Soko oh and brown fouls petritis third on Brown seven on Duke or nine on Duke rather and quick reminder to you we got ACC Network womens basketball presented by Ally tomorrow night West Moore in the Wolfpack welcome Miami to Reynolds Coliseum at six number two Notre Dame on the road at pit at eight and then late night the cuse and Cardinal from Maples Pavilion 1000 that means uh Justus Walters and nothing but net about 12 1215 on Friday morning Eastern time I did that last year dont dont remind me bet trus the free throw 100 in the morning then you get on the road to drive up to Syracuse no no no the average person doesnt do that they go to the hotel and go to sleep Im definitely not not average this is true we can confirm that you are not average might be below average with that move yeah that would be what Julie would say Julie did not like that oh she didnt talk to me for a couple 7453 Cal is going to lose for the fourth time in their last five theres a steal by dor heres Wilkinson uhoh behind the back against Gillis and a score and Wilkinson now over 20 points Y and so he averaging 198 in his last six games will continue to keep that average up in the starting lineup I talked with Garrett earlier today their course sports information director and asked is there a number of games as Caleb Foster gets his first field goal in their last seven games and so great to see Caleb getting in the mix but is there a number of games where he is no longer in contention for six Man of the Year good question might have to get some clarity on that before we see the Golden Bears in Louisville the last week of the regular season uhhuh were going to see C on a trip to see the Cardinals on their last Road swing which by the way they will then convert to the ACC tournament in Charlotte Foster the kick out Evans thats spun out I like the way Cal and Coach Madson has got them to play the whole game I mean its obvious they were not going to win the game for a long time but theyre going after it theyre playing hard and the Freshman Wilkinson has had a really good second half and its you know its tough to come in here you can get beat 30 or 40 in here if youre not really tough physical yeah I think hes I I really do respect Mark Matson whos now in his second year and hes done a terrific job of trying to get Cal and go north with this and theyve done the transfer portal gym theyre trying to recruit good player I mean Wilkinsons terrific well the bottom line is in the ACC and we all know this you everybody has to put more money into NL and you have to get better players its I somebody asked me a long time ago how do you coach a long time is get good players you know because youre not out coaching people in the college level they dont care who you are you just you you have to have good players and the SEC is the best league cuz they have the most good players and uh thats its just were just were falling behind and we need to make sure we make up for in the next year Dort out of the game 19point game with 75 seconds left and Christian Tucker in the ball game theres a steal that is desler knocking it away Bears on the turnover Wilkinson back for Tucker quick look inside jack McClosky out of matter day in the Southern California area I tell you what me and John shy are about to have beef theres a rebound by Darren Harris whats the matter with you and Coach no Spencer Hubbert I need to see my guy Spencer getting the game I dont see him at the table he told told me his mom was watching theres always something that somebody can has to complain about yeah gunba fouled by MOSI on the way to the basket Patricks going to get free drill Spencer lost a shooting game earlier today to Chris Carwell yeah he did and so I was on Spencer and I told him I said you get in the game tonight you better let it fly and he said and and I said if you dont Im talking bad about you he said CA dont do that my moms going to be watching I said well just let Mom know look at my God Spencer right there locked in at 58 the only player under 65 on the Duke roster but I can tell you right now he is absolutely a favorite not only amongst the fans here but also with his team they have nothing but respect for that young man who of course grew up in Los Angeles and California so Mom its a normal time for her Harvard wle game hes played in 22 career games tonight would have been 23 me me and John well you and Sh can take you and Dave o BR and coached by tal here on satday you can take up that def I got to talk it out with my guy Mahoney the Miss rebound by Foster Stanford Cardinal will be here to see the Blue Devils Cal is headed to Atlanta they get Saturday afternoon in Midtown against Georgia attack well this is a good bounce back game for Duke they really did a good job defensively and we saw Cooper flag tonight do a little bit of everything yep Blue Devils are going to win easily 78 57 theyre now thir 13 and one in the ACC and keep their game lead on both Clemson and Louisville
