blacker Jr and the Cal Bears will have the first possession zero is Jeremiah Wilkinson who used to be the Super Sub and is now averaging 20 points a game as a starter gone from Super Sub to Super Starter exactly blacker left all alone as the defender fell down and the senior vares a three that is a statement three right off the bat obviously a great great crossover dribble kept his balance Nice Applause Shot Roger McFarland and Chaz Kelly the third thats the point guard Donald H 13 hes their leading Applause score Kelly into the lane flips it up with the left hand and the Eagles are on the board really nice drive really nice body control thats a possession thats good in a lot of ways at he scored the basketball but it also got late in the shot clock this is a game the Boston College would like to keep the score down a low possession Music game Andre sto yakovich gets bumped and thatll be a foul on Dion Brown first foul of the Music game black shair is doing a great job unbelievable crossover maintains balance Defender Falls leads to a three Wilson thought about it going against Brown now inside sokos first shot of the game is good so the seniors off to a good start for the Bears Music Music Applause Brown thought about it pulls it back 10 on the shot Music clock Kellys shot no good and sko yakovich comes down with it Kellys doing a nice job getting to the paint right now and at the end of the day what theyre really trying to do is get open looks for hand hes had such a good year and by getting to the paint theyre going to be able to do that stanovic slicing in Cals up 72 crafty great use with his left hand getting all the way in finishing at The Music Rim they got the mismatch now trying to get it into vening but they cant so Kelly drives through the lane swatted by sasoko second effort no good venning tried to get it the Bears come down with it Wilkinson does ILL advised pass picked off by hand Cal really does a nice job with Brim protection Soko first and foremost but theyre so big so long and now active hands get a steal get him out transition stovich reverses the assist from Rus petritis stovich battled a little bit of injury struggled just a little bit hes getting back right now scoring a couple Baskets at The Rim Early I think its going great for his Applause Music confidence Donald hand stops pulls up hes off sto yakovich clearing for C Soko was not ready for that pass Here Comes McFarland petritis with the steel he leads the team in steals hustle plays on both ends right now SC yakovich inside blocked from behind BCs gone over two two and A2 minutes without a hoop hes going up and down right now coach Grant deciding to get a little bit more of a set burn a little bit of the clock on this possession Kelly to third open no good Soko with a Applause board black Shar Jr already hit one second ones no good mon Soko offensive board and put back 11 to2 cow and Coach Grant when we talk to him and shoot around we had c number one key to the game he said without question defensive rebounding right there Soko so big and strong gets two points on the offensive board hand from a distance no Applause Music good now Soko comes over and sets the screen for sto yakovich sto yakovich is shot is good 132 are you surprised Jared that BC has not called a timeout well the next dead ball is going to be a timeout so youre youre hoping for some kind of a foul or a touch foul to get to that timeout so uh if things dont go well soon obviously youre going to see that but heck of a start for Cal inside to venning 69 270 of strength but that ones no good gets his board comes back and finally it finds its way to Brown who reverses it in allows Boston College to get up and press a little bit sakovic right now that last shot was a confident shot we talked about him getting to the rim building that confidence F 18 ft really show hes confident looking to be aggressive now betrus the former Air Force star he does everything draws the foul and it almost goes in what a tremendous really its taken on a new meaning many times theyve graduated from a different University but the reality is whether its one year four years at times 5 years when you spend that much time with a player go through the ups and downs of the Season it really is an emotional time for seniors Reus Petrus started at Air Force guy who can do everything doesnt always show up in the box but he leads K and assist steals offensive rebounds Jared I have had it many times and you wont find a guy who plays harder than Rus petritis and on the defensive end theyve been awfully effective Boston College right now their first nine possessions seven of those possessions have been empty theyre going to need to be more efficient and find ways to put the ball in the basket Fred Payne is checked in his first shot is Applause off try this down the lane but it was blocked by Benning numbers right now for Boston College with petritis down they dont love to run but theyre doing it there and the turn over maybe thats not why why theyre not running as much Tucker lobs it up for Lee Dort whos come in and Dort got fouled by H and hand that was his only only option really against Dort hes given up so much size backs into him draws the foul not a bad play in a normal situation with hand hes so valuable for this team that he has to be really cognizant of not getting in more foul trouble now Lee Dort comes in and gives you a great backup center to Mar Soka and really provides much of the same uh great assets offensive rebounding shot blocking really efficient around the rim and youre exactly right between the two two of those guys you always have an interior presence Mark Matson former twotime AllAmerican at Stanford helped him go to a couple final fours won titles with the Lakers wins everywhere he goes now guiding the Bears here in Berkeley and Coach Matson he really has done a nice job of putting this program together and really navigating the changes in college basketball and uh the cool thing is hes really excited about the team as well its fun to see Beetle swatted by dor when I talk about Rim protection thats exactly right sending a m message with Dort here its great not only positioning anticipation but the timing was really good thats an easy easy block for him Elijah strong is in Jaden Hastings whos a big body number 22 he is the backup center hes only a freshman from Orlando this is El Li are strong hes got to shoot it the runner no good Hastings the freshman gets the offensive bound and a foul and Jaden Hastings will go to the free throw line really nice offensive rebound Hasting is known for his athleticism he has great bounce great energy uh that offensive rebound is you know comes in a timely Applause position Earl Grant watching in his fourth season last year led the Eagles to the first round game versus is Providence in the NIT they won that then they lost to UNLV had a very successful run in Seven Seasons at the College of Charleston and a very upbeat guy we got to spend some time with him both commented Jared on how much we loved his energy at shoot around absolutely and you know a lot of turnover from last year to this years team but hes put a team together here with Dynamic guards obviously hand uh is the is the really signature guard on the offensive end but they really a lot of guys can get downhill make plays and really has done a nice job putting this team together yeah they lost their top five scores but thats thats almost the norm now right Jared in college basketball yeah a few years ago you would have said that and it would have been a shock now most teams its like that you just have to build a lot of times from you know from the very very bottom and build your roster with no players sometimes one of thems Quinton post whos having a nice season with the Golden State Warriors right here in the Bay Area Spencer mahom number seven in for Coach Matson thats him in the corner five on the clock sto yakovich has got to go hes got to shoot it now and they dont get a shot off turnover by the Bears well the patience was certainly a positive they got the ball to multiple sides of the floor but when you get that late in the shot clock some way somehow you have to get a shot up and sto yakovich certainly has that ability to always get a shot up but just was a little bit off in his in his head and exactly what the time Music was pain off the screen no good dorton Hastings battling no called on the contact down low you know defensively with Hastings is that way youre seeing it you know they they sometimes will do soft Hedges and a drop drop coverages with Hastings he can really be aggressive on the ball screen coverages which puts the offense really back on their heels it ends up in turnover good defense by Boston College lets see if Han can get on track offensive foul on Donald Han Jr two on hand the leading score for the Eagles who averages over 16 a game and thats exactly what Boston College cannot afford right now and really its a good call when you lead with your shoulder you know you have every right to go towards the rim you lead with the shoulder and hit somebodys chest its going to be an offensive th and he comes out Jared hes one of their big scoring punches the biggest whos going to pick up the slack for Boston College is a question maybe itll be Deion brown with the steel and he tried to flush it on sto yakovich but he missed he was going for the exclamation point great athleticism but nothing easy against this Cal defense Campbell had it swatted and thatll be Boston College what great hustle in defense there by Boston College hes a complete player weve already seen him score the rim a couple times shoot some fadeaways uh from 18 ft defensively hes becoming more and more active with block shots but hes really done a nice job not just as a shooter but a scorer and a complete player I got to ask you as a guy Jared that took so many charges you just have a very high pain threshold or did you were you in pain a lot I wanted to see the floor and I wasnt as talented at all as all these other guys so I had to find a way to take charges and get the coaches to like me so uh I I suppose had a high pain threshold but more importantly I like being on the floor so I had to find a way Deion brown with only the third field goal made for Boston College 156 C Campbell tried to get it into sissoko black Shir with eight on the clock black Shir for three J blacker good good offense beats good good defense I thought Boston College had a nice defensive possession right there theyre hedging hard on the ball screens got Cal out of rhythm but at the end of the day a oneonone play with blacker feeling confident on senior night hes got two Hoops both threes elij are strong with a strong move along the Baseline strong move and strong words unfortunately yeah talking to Cs bench Music ill advised as that that jumper just took him right into the bench and he talked about it and there was nothing Sly about it it was it was pretty obvious pretty aggressive and uh that makes it easy easy on the officials to make that call the shot itself was fantastic you know Id be proud of the shot as well but you got to be proud to your own teammates and your own coaches and not the other bench my question is how did the ref hear it cuz he was sh they hear everything they hear everything how do you know you never got teed up well Im just a nice guy apparently I know I know when and how to how to say whatever I need to say you might be in the coaching Hall of Fame for most charges taken as a player and fewest tes gotten as a coach its a unique distinction yeah in 12 years I had two technical fouls and one of them I uh was actually honoring Jean Barto when I was was a head coach at UAB and threw my coat into the stands honoring him on Jean btos uh so that shouldnt even count you did that so its just so its just one one real technical Music yeah J ovich double teamed in the corner hes got to get rid of it blacker Jrs got two threes but now hes heading into the lane sasoko bails him out and Monty Soko with a great heads up at the end of the day Cals doing a great job with oneon one moves at the end of the shot clock Boston College is playing with great energy and theyre playing deep into The Possession but these oneonone moves are scoring every Applause time oh you cannot leave Wilkinson wide open but he missed Music it black Shir is really has a look and I think setting the tone on senior night Wilkinson floating down with the left no good sooko tried to keep it alive we mentioned in the opening theres a lot of stake and the guy both teams are playing that way with great great Applause urgency the problem is Boston College cant get anything to drop theyve had some decent looks but that youre exactly right the percentages are low and theyre going to have to change that strong move by stovich couldnt finish it here comes Fred Payne and the Eagles pay down the lane sooko tried to alter it they call a foul and so Payne will go to the free throw line and shoot two hey a reminder what a star studded NBA Sunday showcase matchup we have for you on ABC joic and the Nuggets finish up their fourgame road trip in Boston against Jason Tatum and the Celtics our coverage tips with NBA Countdown at 1230 Easter Fred Payne is the sophomore from Grambling Louisiana comes in and plays over 19 minutes a game off the bench tours ACL last year now back as you see the great pedor sto yakovich watching his son and theyre playing against Mark Madson now full circle ones a dad ones a coach Father Time undefeated even against hoop great Music players so hand is on the bench with two fouls coach would would you sit him the rest of the half youre going to bring him in and give him a chance yeah I I think theres no question you bring him in and you know potentially on the defensive end put him on somebody thats not an aggressive offensive player to try and keep him out of foul trouble and you just have to have a trust and a relationship with your player that say hey youre going to have to play smart it may be a couple minutes still before he comes in but I do think hell come in Campbell great move sooko so good on the board but tritis out hustling everybody and black got a Applause shot the thing is when youre down 2110 and you need points hes not getting any points sitting on the bench so thats exactly right and so I I agree I do think hell be in but right now it is been a struggle on the offensive end for Boston College this a sloppy back and forth as McFarland hits a much needed three for Boston College and I hate to say it Boston College is as much as the struggle has been down eight right now as youre not in a bad spot get a couple stops string a couple stops together and they really are right there they need a good last8 minutes going into this half Wilkinson the three is good he is such an explosive score and that shot occurred because as a driver hes so strong driving the basketball you have to get in the cushion the cushion allowed for a clean three and really a smooth stroke to knock that in this is Luca Taves driving to the hoop and going to the foul so the Freshman from Japan will go to the free throw line when we come back 2413 the cow B Bears on top this guy used to come off the bench why waste that type of shot TC tournament the top 15 teams go out of 18 if Cal wins they will clinch a spot in the top 15 this is Luca Taves The Freshman from Japan grew up in Japan Japanese mother Canadian Father Dad coaches professionally in Japan D preier in the Boston area and a very talented player who coach thinks has tremendous upside for the Eagles yeah coach Grant really likes his potential down in the future and Cal goes inside sokos just too much too wide inside all they can do is foul him foul on Chad venning his first stovic comes back into the game try this out Mar Soko with a one and Music one Taves by the way coach uh obviously fluent in Japanese and English and speaks them both equally well I struggle with one hes also pretty good at the language of basketball if you get to see his jump shot its a pretty clean looking stroke it is its really smooth its you can tell hes just lived in the gym growing up and been around the game for a long Applause time coachs son so you know hes disciplined the runner and Taves will get a hoop cuz Marty sasoko is called for Goen there was a play earlier when sasoko went to block a shot and I think he missed it by going too high and the ball went under his arm I mean he is he is just Rising like an elevator and blocking those shots and I think that was a goal 10 but it was uh its just unbelievable to think that he can get that high to to try and block that shot and to your point coach what a great start by Cal yet BC only down by eight Music Wilkinson no good good job boxing out by Boston col so one of the Achilles heels for Cal this year has been defensive field goal percentage teams have shot too good of a percentage which right there they do but for the game as a whole so far the percentages have been down time out by Cal as Taves buries the three well take a quick break too its 2419 the Eagles on a little run Music Luca Taves with a couple quick Hoops comes on in and it is a fivepoint game Boston College started is two of 14 since then theyve made five of their last seven and heated up and theyre playing with some desperation by the way we pointed out coach they havent won a road conference game so thats on the line too as the game goes on if they can keep it close theyre conf confidence will grow and you know the first you know 10 minutes of the game when they were struggling offensively there were a lot of good looks in there and so itll be interesting if they continue to get those good looks their confidence is going theyve made their last few well see how they keep it Music uper brings it back out the former Grand Canyon standout seven on the clock Wilkinson out of bound Cal will keep it but they have four on the shot clock Mark Matson makes sure theyre aware of that nice job by Boston College KN Wilkinsons going left he loves to drive left getting a lot of hands in there getting the deflection even though they didnt get the ball back it prevented Wilkinson from getting to the Applause rim Wilkinson stop turns and fires hes off here comes Dion Brown brown with the runner no good Benning with a big rebound and lays it in and he got fouled Benning with a chance for a threepoint Play What a strong offensive rebound gathers finishes at The Rim lot of confidence on the Boston College bench right now theyre excited theyre high five and theyre back in this game two fouls on Lee Dort as Chad Finning the 69270 lb grad senior showing his strength he really did a nice job after the offensive rebound of gathering himself rather than putting up a shot off balance just and there wasnt even a shot fake in there just gathered Balan finished at The Rim has a chance for the bonus hes second in the ACC in field goal percentage makes 55 of his shots most of them in close its an eight nothing run by Boston C Music Bettis he doesnt shoot a lot but when he does normally good things happen he makes winning plays and you know it yes its a threepoint shot but its a threepoint shot when they really needed it to change the tide he has the he has the guts and the gumption to step up when Music needed Benning against Dort here comes petrius and he is fouled by Luca Music Taves So Cal in the bonus and Reus petritis the former Air Force standout shot roll out still have not seen Donald H Jr who picked up his second foul early and has sat the majority of this first half as Taz turns the corner and man is he giving them a spark really give him a spark and you know part of that substitution pattern is going to be based on the score of the game and the rhythm of the game and theres really a good Rhythm for Boston College I like what theyre doing defensively theyve been really aggressive every chance they get and theyre keeping this thing right there with a fourpoint Music game tapes again and he looks at the bench like hey Im feeling it keep giving me the Rock and I think they will simple ball screen actions comes off there as a threat vens rolling hard so he has that option and hes really knocking in his shots right now he has 10 off the bats and Lee d goes off the Music Applause glass nice de by blacker now is all up in the grill of Luca T whos got 10 Off the Bench Fade Away by Brown and Dion Brown brings Boston College back down by two some of the shots theyre shooting right now are more difficult than they had early in the game but as their confidence grows theyre shooting it Knocking it in left wide Applause open Cs doing a nice job sharing the basketball again we talked about Boston College is being aggressive defensively the cows making the one more thats a wide open shot senior sticks Music it Taves misses for the first Applause time TR his knifing and missed the Buddy really a fantastic first step great Drive and youre right thats one hes going to make n out of 10 times but thats the one he missed we will get a timeout at the next dead ball the under form media timeout but weve had a lot of action until then and finally we get a dead ball so well take a break Luca Taves has 10 Off the Bench to bring Boston College back in the mix learn the game in Japan but he knows pretty well and of course blackshire from Oakland he knows that seen a lot of them and sometimes with the extra energy it can go north or south but right now for blackshire hes doing a great job getting to the paint defensively getting the flexions and on the offensive end from the threepoint line hes making plays for others but he is stepping in with confidence knocking in his threepoint shots and he is having a tremendous first half on his senior night had a standout career at Grand Canyon where he was the starting point guard and a great score until he had a knee injury that forced him to miss an entire season but now leading the California Golden Bears on senior night along with his fellow senior mty Soko and a fivepoint lead with 209 left in a battle for the bottom half of the ACC but significant cuz of the 18 teams get in the ACC tournament nice steal and here comes Brinson ahead of the back and he lays it in Great Hands by petrius ball was meant to be thrown off him he had great reaction time starts the break Wilkinson with a great finishing transition Tav lobs it up for Hastings it never got there petritis the left hand is counted and he got Applause fouled well that escalated quickly transition baskets for Cal getting out finishing on the left side petrius Wilkinson both backto back great coordination great left hand the trius with the and one a 7 nothing Run for the Bears over the last minute 24 is petrius with the spark and the former Air Force Cadet knocks down the free throw and Cal by 10 now with under two to play in the first half you know petritis is catch over in that corner was really impressive with somebody throwing the ball at you as hard as they can from 5T and to be able to catch it cleanly and start the break really has great hand eye coordination Hastings slotted by petritis Wilkinson waits for the traffic to clear since the timeout weve seen Cal really trying to push tempo right now get ball out of transition its led to a 10point lead point lead Lee Dort and the Bears up 3927 the flow of the game really just turned into a back and forth for a while and Now cal defensively a little bit more pressure getting out in transition pushing every chance they get theres a mindset in the timeout that changes a huge hoop by Taves that ends a 10 nothing run by the Bears count the hoop heads up play by blacker who knew he was getting grabbed launched the shot and the hoop goes Applause in its a senior night spectacular right now thats a tough shot almost like an NBA continuation coach well it was uh it it felt like that you know but the Step backer there decided thats part of his shot Rhythm hes scoring from everywhere doing everything and like I said his energy has been off the charts on the defens defensive end as well blackshire with double digit points now for the first time since they played wake fourth on February 8th and Hastings and Lee Dort kind of bumping into each other and we got double technical fouls Music fouls my singular takeaway from this game to this point has been how hard both teams are playing how important they know this game is this been a physical exciting Full Speed game there you see the contact between Hastings and dord each receiving the technical 99sec difference between the halftime clock and the shot clock for Boston Applause c changing the pace defensively getting back into his Zone Boston College immediately tries to get the ball to the middle Break Down The Zone lights are strong inside on try this nice left spin still plenty of time for Cal to be able to get a Applause shot black Sure Way Off the Mark petritis tried to get it no good and thats how the half will end Academy so Im well aware and they have tours and all kinds of things so it does breed toughness and needless to say those lessons stuck with them hand is back in the game and back on the scoreboard the leading score for Boston College missed most of the first half with two fouls and that didnt take long a welldesigned play curling in the middle of the paint right now its a good sign and he needs to get hot early and oh no that is a foul on hand and thats going to be his third that is a bad break coach 25 seconds in their best player picks up his third foul wow kind of a bang bang play and it may be something you just leave him in at this point this game is so important hopefully he can uh play without fouling that was a I dont know that had a great angle to to judge that but he did have two hands in St Al is back and scov went down and the foul was called The Hoop handmade to start the second half his first points of the game averaging over 16 Wilkinson to blackshire blackshire had the hot first half his first shot in the lane no good hand with the rebound Brown spinning inside and he was fouled and a foul on Andre stojakovich first foul on sto yakovich and second shot of the half no good Soko runs it down Austin college has been really good in ball screen situations second effort and in that situations you cant just guard it with the two players involved they did a nice job but the help side was a second late if youre not there when sooko catches the basketball hes going to finish that every Applause time Soko not just a high jumper but a quick jumpero hes doing a nice job off setting screens and rolling to the basket they find him and anytime hes within 5 ft of the basket he has balance hes going to be hard to stop does a nice job playing through contact getting his offensive rebound finishing at The Rim Brown tough shot Brown has given some scoring to Boston College when they desperately need it yeah their mindset coming out of halftime is take it to Cal get the ball to the inside theyre attacking being really Music aggressive up and a Trav Applause turnover really really good discipline there by Hastings stayed down throughout the entire possession slid his feet led to a travel I would say thats great discipline keeping his hands up Applause time out Cal they dont like the way this half has started not surprising the starting center the grad senior from Brooklyn for Boston College has a foot injury and its questionable as to whether he will return which is a real challenge I mean his size and physicality is so important for a lot of reasons but one to just to be able to have a have somebody combat sasoko and Dort on the inside so that is a a big blow but it really uh puts Hastings in a position now that hes going to have to produce at a big level blacker the three in the corner no good ran down by hand over to brown brown flying in and finishing and Dion brown with another tough move great job running in transition and hand as aggressive as hes been understands the positioning understands the passing angle gets the assist right there hand I think is going to be very aggressive Rive in a lot of different ways this half Dion brown with 10 in double figures for the Music Eagles Brown goes to the floor picks it up Campbell tried to steal it back now Soko on the floor pus rips it away and now a jump ball possession to cow looks like a hot potato no one good holding most of the time that situation the balls on the ground guys are diving for it the ball stayed up about four or five ft and everybody just kept handing it back and Music Music fourth lers got 12 points for the Bears running the show right now seven on the shot clock as sto yakovich spins inside draws the contact and Andre will go to the free throw line welld designed play play by coach Madson an isolation for stovich at the elbow really allows him to you know have tons of space to his right but does a nice job spinning back going to his left and getting fouled uh simply an isolation giving him room to work with with a player that has great size Mark Matson such a a positive guy we spent some time with him at the shoot around first thing he said is we got to have this by the way this is the final ESPN big Monday double header of the season a very important one at seven Eastern Cooper flag and number two Duke H wake at Cameron and then fourth ranked Houston host Hunter Dickson Kansas should be two good ones on big Monday on Applause ESPN weve used the phrase before just hanging around and thats exactly what college is doing right Applause now hand flying to the Baseline and Drew the foul he is a big strong guy really improved a lot well discuss that more when we get to the coach ass ACC Awards but suffice it to say Donald H Jr has become a major player in the ACC he really has you know in the first half with a foul trouble they were able to keep him on the bench not put him in position to get that third foul and kind of cut that that deficit in the first half with him on the bench in the second half he came out like Gang Busters right now scoring the basketball getting some assists has great activity keep in mind he does have that third foul early in this half but he can keep without getting that fourth foul thats going to be a big shot in the arm for Boston College hes one ACC player the week three times only two other players have done it did you look at the game notes do you know who it is I maxo and Cooper flag hey I do my homework I know you did kind of hoping I could give you a quiz thats right so hes in some good company yeah not bad huh Taz Kelly all over black shirt so this is a good defensive possession by Boston College and it just got better Hastings ahead of everybody and the Freshman dunks it and so what happens with Benning out Hastings is having the play theyre more aggressive in their ball screen situations and hes just I mean the way he ran the floor right there he rout outran the entire Cal team so they do have a different look and a different feel with Hastings on the floor and now not typical showing a little bit of his own look is Boston Applause College it is a onepoint game Boston College just will not go away still in search of their first road Conference win it is a onepoint game here for this team the Jared H ACC Awards Cal leading 4544 how is Boston College back in this theyre shooting 83 in the second half they shot only 41 in the first half theyve never LED but theyre within Applause one are high off the glass no good Soko runs it down scovic in and out brown runs it down defensively this is a is a really agile team for Boston College are playing with unbelievable energy and these stops that energy is carrying over to the offensive end Chaz Kelly thei Donald H playing with foul trouble and now getting other people in foul trouble you know both teams have different philosophy right now based on personnel and philosophy of how theyre playing ball screen situations and Cal is in a drop coverage being a little bit more conservative and hand goes downhill and attacks the rim gets to the free throw line so its its really a a mindset on both ends of the floor but right now Boston College is very Applause aggressive man free throw is Applause good soan plagued by foul trouble now with eight points barely played in the first half picked up his third early in the second half Music Boston colllege with its first lead of the game they trailed by as many as 13 on the road looking for their first conference Road win ptis unlucky roll right there had a soft touch just rolled the wrong way goes to Boston College but the aggressiveness on I mean side ball screen are icing I really think it starts with a ball screen defense right now for Boston College Brown spinning inside no good McFarland tius on the floor McFarland picks it up Hastings The Freshman misses everything Wilkinson whoa reversed it from his Blind Side and now he takes the lead and he really got hit hard on the face I dont think the foul is called but they may even look at that cuz on the swipe down he got hit hard thats what Mark madsons saying oh he certainly did Hastings got him right in the face and theyre going to look at that yeah and certainly he was going for the basketball but he was aggressive swiping down and needless to say theres a lot of contact right there I mean at the very least thats a foul well see what they decide right and so and while it is a foul youre exactly right but theyre not going to be able to go back and change it to a foul even though it was but what they can do is choose to make it an F1 or an F2 because of the contact to the face and so thats what theyre reviewing but we will not see a common foul we either going to see nothing or were going to see an F1 or yeah and I think as excessive as that was to the head its probably going to be an F1 I didnt think there was you know as much intent where it was would Elevate to an F2 but I would predict this to be an F1 I think he was going for the ball but it was a violent swipe at it you know part of it it was um you know with Wilkinson hes always come back to that left hand you know and hes on the right side and defensively I think there was an expectation he was going to one well if this broadcasting thing doesnt work the coaching thing I may be an official you you youve been right way more than youve been wrong thats why you hardly got any technicals dont lose sight of the fact that that was an incredibly athletic shot whether he got hit in the face or not you know after the play and it all broke down right there I think he was surprised that the foul wasnt called cuz he knew how hard he was hit in the Music face Wilkinson is a tough kid second among ACC freshman in scoring and averaging 20 since he became a starter 10 games ago shot is good so the first 10 minutes of this game I really thought there was a lot of nervous energy both teams were playing hard but I thought there was some nervous energy the last or the last seven minutes the second half were saying is unbelievable energy but its not nervous its aggressive energy theyre being theyre really going after it heres the foul one more time oh yeah theres no question thats an F1 and just swiping down so hard and hitting them on the head so impressive by Wilkinson not going down I agree Music Applause Tris inside nice pass by Wilson thats absolutely right just made a basket made free throws unselfish play definitely could have shot the 15 footer and gets a dead layup for his teammate petritis so a sixpoint possession for C the M ho to two three throws on the FL one and then the steel and the hook sloted out of bounds by Petri Applause well the response by Cal was off the charts now the question will be how does Boston College respond and again theres so much energy out there right now they we going to see guys both teams playing Music hard hand Dre contact and Donald H junor will go back to the free throw line fantastic shot fake you have to respect the threepoint shooting shot fake has the defender in the air drives basketball to the basket and gets to the free throw line again thats four fouls on lead Music D for Boston College another positive right now is the rebounding situation theyre tied at 25 a piece and theyre really battling on the boards on both ends by the way this guy was your most improved I mean Donald Han Jrs just gotten better better every year his points are 11 better than they were hes plus five in rebounds we talk about a nice jump from his freshman to his sophomore year the Virginia Beach native just really blossomed as a sophomore man I think he could be end up being on uh you know one of the allconference teams as well but and obviously the most improved potential no one picked up Wilson well theres certain things you just cant have happen if youre Boston College and Wilkinson go his left hand for an unrestricted layup just is not okay hand going to his left and BC no its good on one end its good on the other end lot of credit right now to Earl Grant and the Eagles who have really KN gone away when C has made a good run Dort playing with the four fouls no good Eliza strong with the rebound Bost just having to play with a little bit of nontraditional lineups with strong as their fiveman right now H got too far underneath the Music hook stovic runs it down and an offensive foul on Andre Stak good defense dice a lot at stake because as you pointed out coach you dont want to get into March and not be in your conference tournament no you know the other part too is once you get to the tournaments anything can happen you know weve seen so many stories every year theres teams that make deep runs you know you look at NC State last year and what they did and so you definitely want to have a chance to be at the party and make something special happen and thats why youre seeing unbelievable energy on both teams tonight Kellys three off Chris Tucker and Cal going the other way wison says give it to me and let me start something here nice steal by Fred Payne and then a foul on Wilkinson two fouls on Wilkinson defensively Boston College is act theyre active with their feet being in the right spots but theyre also really active with their hands theyre under sized one of the great strengths of cow is their offensive rebounding but so far it has not been a determining factor in the game so Cal seventh foul so now were in the bonus and BC is going to shoot free throws the other way a reminder the ACC Womens Basketball Tournament begins Wednesday afternoon in Greensboro and ACC network will have all first and second round games as well as two of the quarterfinal matchups first round coverage begins at 123 Eastern with be nothing but net Applause crew hey look for every run Cal has gone on Boston College has come right back and its still a onepoint game and they just they just found different ways of doing it you know different matchups like I said strong at the fiveman theyre theyre small theyre active but theyre still getting defensive rebounds their box outs have been really good Cal has led once Im sorry Boston College has led once on a made free throw now trying to take the lead again strong strong to the hoop and Boston College back in front he needs to be careful getting a little bit too verbal but I tell you what thats a strong move right there finishing over D great length powerful move Music Tucker draws the foul and hes saying hes shooting it even as hes lying on the ground well see if they call it a shot attempt or a pass with v and out Boston College is having to go to different areas both defensively offensively on the interior and right now is providing that depth finishing at The Rim acting his name strong as can be Deon Brown whos got 10 points for Boston College just picked up his third foul as K yakovich is left wide open on an inbounds play well cach gains the lead Applause great Hustle by both players and Boston College gets possession on the tied up hole Mark Matson really doing a nice job calling plays on an out of bounds play some misdirections right here great screens great attentiveness and then strong Cuts with sakovich coming late on a tight curl to the basket really well designed play nice execution by the players out of bounds stays with Boston Music Applause Collin strong Music blacker lobs it up sooko nice catch nice Applause finish smart offense a determined cow team get to sooko the basketball and thats exactly what they need find ways to get it ball to him and then if its a pass out go and knock in the outside Applause shot Kelly Fades away no ptis with Applause four Wilkinson the trius tried to tip it off of cow Theus is trying to get the officials to look at it but its not under two minutes so thats not going to happen but great effort is always by petus trying to keep that ball alive Luca Taves comes in now he had a hot first half with 10 points Off the Bench check that 12 in the first half yeah and such a sparkk and and really it did in ball screen situations in midrange which is uh you know a lot of times you want threes and Laps but his his midrange in that first half was awfully good made five of six shots including a Music three Donald H for three no good sooko up high theyre working hard to get hands some shots right now on ball off ball screens black are creating space in the senior continues to light it up such a great look the entire game blackshire has been strong early shooting the important shot now late blacker with 14 Taves nice lead for strong Boston College really likes the look of Taves in that ball screen situations in the first half it was as a score now is a distributor Music Applause Music Bears have made Seven of their last 10 shots Wilkinson left alone that was a defensive lapse but he couldnt make him pay sasoko right place right time and mty puts it in offensive rebounding Boston College knew that that was going to be a key to the game they let one slip away there Soko has 12 and nine one board away from a double double and now he has it or maybe he doesnt I thought he did and now foul on the floor theyre going to call on Cal Marty coko has 12 points and nine rebounds hes been everywhere on the offensive glass and when Boston College comes at them they make a run and Taves has been a real spark for the Eagles we still have a tight one in Berkeley Applause has not won a conference game on the road a birth in the ACC tournament at stake as Donald Han Jr makes the free throw so he barely played in the first half and Han now in double digits with 14 points I think most of the possessions for Boston College offensively hell at least have an opportunity to touch the basketball whether he shoots it well see but I do think theyre going to go through the him on the offensive end a threepoint Cal lead under 730 two play in regulation in the second half Wilkinson lost it then threw it away and here comes Taves Luca Taves trying to finish and a foul called late by sasoko who was flying in for the block an opportunistic fast break for Boston College its not what they do best its not what they prioritize but at this point if they have an opportunity to get transition thats exactly what theyre going to do Soko has four fouls right now hes still in the game sto yakovich is going to come in so well see if he comes in for M as Taves goes to the free thr Applause line Campbell goes out so Soko stays in with the four fouls and some watch right now is defensively Hastings in ball screen situations is really good and really active is he going to be a disruptor or can C Soko rolling to the rim and find him some shots at the basket and get helps side Defenders involved which he will be able to really dominate if he can catch the ball close all of Hs 15 points have come in the second half hes got 15 to BCs 29 in this half and keep in mind BC doing this with without Tad venning who hurt his foot hes there starting big man thats why Hastings is getting so many minutes P trus really good instinctive pass by sto yakovich easy step in for petrius good look it just did everything but go down Boston College trying to regain the lead Donald H Jr separation no good petrius cleans it up sto yakovich a good look he got Applause it the trius appreciated stovich passing him the basketball last time Returns the favor on that possession finally shot McFarland inside through the contact offensive foul called on Roger McFarland ducking the shoulder into Rita Applause petritis in transition Petrus doing a nice job dragging the defense down finding sto yakovich an easy step in three in transition which is great then Petrus again we hes a Swiss army knife he does it all drawing a charge selling it just a little bit but certainly enough contact for for that call to be appropriate sto yakovich a good ball handler good job against the pressure of pain Wilkinson a little wrinkle there by coach bson having sakovich play point guard putting Wilson on off the ball sakovich able to make a play for Wilkinson to knock in that three Wilkinson with 14 the lead out to seven Taves to counter a rare Miss by The Freshman six points a six nothing run in 35 seconds for the Bears ptis no good Soko tried to get it and here comes Donald H Jr he loses the handle strong picks it up strong misses the layup Soko with another rebound hes got a double double welcome to March both teams getting after it right now playing so hard its almost like a the entire country right now switch just flipped on they know its March nice defense by Taves and the call that could have gone either way it could have I think it was the right call and it was it was really close to being a charge that is a scouty port defens of play understand Wilkinsons going to be going left sliding his feet three fouls on Taves and in that situation freedom of movement officiating wise if its close its going to go a call on the defense and the offense is going to get the advantage Bears on a six nothing run the last minute 25 does BC have another stop and run in them Soko cleans it up ducks in and gets a foul Marty sasoko well Im just saying the Praises of Boston College understanding the scatter report playing the scatter report there next possession Wilkinsons goes left hand really without anybody getting in the way even though he missed it it required weakside help offensive rebound by Soko and nobody is going to do anything with him when he gets it there mty with 14 and 11 a double double blackshire has 14 points so the seniors honored today on Senior Day having a terrific performance in their final home game here at house Pavilion you know I mentioned at the 7even minute Mark out of the timeout the idea of giving in and giving in isnt just physically are you playing hard but mentally do you remember the scan report do you do the little things are you still boxing out and that was a defensive Mistake by Boston College Donald J no good Soko another Applause rebound Wilkinson spinning back Rising sasoko Music again a new season high for sasoko with 17 points Boston College has been so good on the defensive rebounding for the majority of the game and right now Soko is absolutely eaten up every offensive board Ts Runner no Applause good and TV timeout an 11 I mean he is having absolutely Monster game the question is does Boston College have one more run in them down by 12 343 Music left Donald H Jr weights got fouled that fouls Down Below Good call and hand will go back to the free throw line and Hs done a nice job he has good size is a guard they talked about in shoot around a little bit of trying to be able to take the ball inside against Cs smaller guards and hes done a nice job he hasnt finished but Cs fouled him hes got to the free throw line especially in the second half 15 points for Han now 16 all in the second half did not play much in the first half with the two fouls to combat the offensive rebounding Boston College is going a little bit bigger with two bigs right now theyre also putting a little pressure in the front Court trying to increase the speed of the game now that theyre down 10 points will Cal be a little more deliberate with the shot clock here I do think so and they dont want to get passive but if they can take 15 seconds off early and the lead stays around 10 thats an ideal situation blacker got it Javon blacker now has 16 I just think its really really cool the way the seniors are really stepping up on senior night the bench the other players are really leaning on them and and theyve really enjoyed having that Applause Music responsibility D Brown spinning tough shot over scovic that whole thing started with a unbelievably physical screen by strong stakich did a nice job fighting through but got there just a bit late to your point Cal burning about 15 seconds were starting to get close to the 10 seconds on the shot clock now theyre going to look to be Music aggressive slamed it home blacker found him with the dime he was looking down at the rim on that one thats how you shoot 90 from the Applause field Boston College will not go away Kelly from Deep Boston College playing the zone right now as well and they understand theyre not going to be able to make Cal shoot early in the shot clock but late in the shot clock now they have to be disciplined the last possession Hastings got out of position lost Vision they end up getting that yakovich defended well Hastings blocked it good news is they burned a lot of clock bad news is it just wasnt a high quality shot and slams it Applause down sevenpoint game Buck 25 left in regulation time out Mark Madson and Cal its really unfolded Cals been aggressive theyve got those boards theyve been really consistent getting them now these last 6 minutes really been the difference in the game Wilkinson runs it down in the back court Deion Brown trying to force a turnover now theres 10 left you dont want to foul this late the shot clock we have a foul on Boston College fou is on Elijah strong and so Marty Soko will get a chance to add to his totals career highs 19 points tying a career high 13 rebounds they got tangled up there but is you know sokos really rewarded for for diving to the basket very hard ended up tripping up going to the free throw line fantastic game by the former Michigan State Spartan who had a nice career in East Lancing and has really blossomed here as a senior in Berkeley I just love the way the seniors have performed for Cal you know the experience the energy the enthusiasm theyve really led the way Applause tonight strong for three in and out Brown runs it down gets it to strong who has it blocked Kelly begging for it at three takes it down the lane the runner is good by Kell at this point Boston College is going to have a foul they cannot let 30 more seconds run off this clock theyre not fouling though mysteriously they are not fouling and now time has run out late in the clock so now you foul but Han junor does it you needed to do that earlier well and I look I like the fact that they went for steals they tried to get a couple double teams but at that point hey you burn 5 Seconds now its going to be time to foul but once it you know you burn 15 seconds in a 40 to 50 second game and youre down seven thats going to be a little bit too much Javon blackshire already with 16 points his first double digit Point scoring since February 8th when they lost a Wake Forest by 10 right here at Cal Bo through blackshire makes them Applause Music both Elijah strong no good Soko yet another rebound now hes got a career high in rebounds and points Soko has 14 point 14 rebounds a careerhigh and 21 points Music Im here Im here Im here Im here out Wilkinsons we could hear that in our headsets Im here throw it but trus didnt think it was the right play so Boston Colleges Road wo appear will continue still winless on the road right now in conference you know I think it says a lot about a program though when when times have been tough theyve been on the road for a week right now have a long trip back tomorrow things havent always gone their way especially on the road but weve seen a Boston College team tonight that has fought I mean they have competed and theyve really played with purpose so I give Coach grant their assistant coaches the whole team a lot of credit for the way they came after this tonight you mentioned the seniors blacker and Soko played such a great game petrius who never really gets the credit but has nine points nine rebounds couple deflections couple blocks yeah hes been really good just a complete player and he makes just all the winning plays and for count at this point you know theyre really in a good spot they know theyre going to be in the ACC tournament they can play loose and free this last week and then they go into the ACC tournament with a lot of confidence and kind of just let it rip and run they dont need to be fearful of anything and they have a lot of pieces to be able to make the run in that tournament well as you pointed out and I think you cited NC State you get into a tournament you never know what can happen when coach Williams who I played for and worked on his staff always talked about in tournament situations you build your momentum once youre there and so if they can get to that tournament theyre going to have a game early they can win that build that momentum it can who knows anything can happen now if you dont have the pieces its hard but Cal has some really good pieces and I believe they can make a Applause run theyre going to have a long road trip at Lille at Notre Dame and then theyll stay back east and go to Charlotte for the tournament a circle with another rebound and that will do it an impressive win when Mark Madson
