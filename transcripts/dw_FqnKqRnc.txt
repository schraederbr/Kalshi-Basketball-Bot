came over from Princeton hes been a stabilizing presence they lose his threepoint shooting and hes a cerebral player and thats evident with his 38 assist turnover and his leadership has been unquestioned when he arrived and shury raved about his ability to lead his team and marus Burton his best player but Marcus has been a little quiet thats his natural demeanor and with the locko out its forced Marcus Burton to be more vocal which is a good thing May Davis big game against BC they last outing with 26 Shrewsberry has been good in the midrange game lately not so good from threepoint range our BC starting five Deion Brown Roger mcfan Josh Beetle Donald Han a Ford guard L for Grant Chad venning he has the basketball now hes up front Beetle and thats a rare Miss from long range for Josh Beetle doesnt shoot a lot but he shoots a great percentage shoot 57 from the threepoint line and if Notre Dame is going to double the post guards have got to be ready to knock down a couple of shots from behind the threepoint line loosen up the defense seen that starting lineup for no game Nikita constantini is in the lineup as they are off the schneide with their first two of the night its a change of pace for micel Shrewsbury why do you think hes doing that I think hes changing things up putting a bigger more physical body on Chad Vinny and hes 69ine 70 you need a bigger guy to lean on it and thats going to be a focal point as venning converts least he wants to get him in the lane all night catching him on a rolling hes mobing can move for a big guy getting him on the move so he doesnt have to dribble you see the double team coming in first possession so this time you get get it to him again second time on the row double team cant come its late s a chance with an N one foul on Burton as they cannot convert the threepoint play BC did not miss a foul shot in their last meeting against noted aim a month ago they only went to the line six times theyre playing with a smaller guards a four guard lineup for him allows them like this to get out in transition punched Away by McFarland who gets doubled yeah El Grant says he allows more freedom of movement for their offense but theyre still getting acclimated got to attack the rim and not settle those are the shots of why theyre not getting to the free throw line he got an advantage drive it Davis and punched away good defense on the weak Side by McFarland Mah shrewbury in his second year 10 games under 500 but two seasons at Penn State with an NCA appearance and Boston fans familiar with with him assisting Brad Stevens theyre lifelong friends and Brad Stevens expects to be here in a little bit Celtics and Spurs tonight we have caught some of that on ESPN Stevens will be coming from TD Garden constantini with to the big fell the transfer from monou great job there great cut by constant toel scovi hes uh in the game early just for his phys physicality and that time catches on the road and and finishes and you were talking about Michael Shrewsberry earlier I think hes a stud and I I think hes one of the despite his record when you watch on film his teams are physical I thought even a year ago they were the most physical team in the AC defensive into the floor offensively he got a ton of counters just a heck of a coach and I think as his group gains a little confidence I think youll see Notre Dame team take a step I mean this is the team thats been riddled with injuries as well yep Marcus Burton missing so much time now a loo missing time kind of figuring things out on the Fly Brown in the lane the UMBC transfer and also shrewbury has a top five recruiting class coming in I think hes a star I I really do just what you see on film and and the type of players that hes going after hes recruiting just a matter of time Brown Tangled Up with Braden Shrewsbury the son of Michael Shrewsberry but a foul is called on Dion Brown and Deon Browns a guy they expected more of especially scoring he was prolific at times with UMBC its a step up in competition that might hinder the progress it the adjustment when you come up to this level sometimes it just takes time and both clubs are struggling with confidence you know when it gets in big moments like that because as it goes on you just can constantly add pressure upon yourself and Dion Browns no different Shrewsberry theres the midrange G I talked about hes 46 from that area primarily known as a threepoint shooter but hes only made now three of his last 22 shots from the field venning down the lane and Shrewsberry comes up with it here comes Marcus Burton spinning Davis Good Touch first time these teams played though that a scored 40 points in the pink theyre not a great threepoint shooting team and you were talking before about bra Shrewsberry no one is affected more with AO being out of the game than he is because he is the guy thats their best threepoint shooter and teams feel as though if they can take him away they then totally relying upon Mar Marcus B to score distribute and create for others beetle with a bucket for BC averages seven points thats fifth on the team but hes shooting at 52 and 55 from three hes only taken 29 threepoint shots good ball Movement by the Irish and theres a great shot from the corner thats sir Mohamad whos a freshman and hes gaining confidence he is hes a freshman that put hes starting in a starting lineup hasnt shot it well from high three Point Ling was four of 20 coming into tonight and its great sign for Notre Dame if he knocks down his first hand from the elbow and brown with a put back you see pretty good rebounding team plus 02 rebounding Edge dont turn it over often 12 turnovers per game theyve been fundamentally sound but its one of those things weve heard the last couple years about the Eagles as mohamads off the line is the fact Randolph they need to learn how to win well both teams are struggling with that and its a lot that comes with that its not as simple as people think and they put themselves in position and they find they struggle to close games and this small lineup has been great formed three by Donald H ties it at 11 so Hand shooting 40 from downtown hes averaging 16 points also his rebounding is ex impressive 6 and 1 half per game thats first on the team unbelievable for a guard that has as much responsibility scoring as he does to rebound as well as he does Drive what a block Chad venny with emphasis out of bounds and Chad fenning Big Boy defense as we will keep it here Chad vck not known for his shot blocking ability but he comes over late protects the lane there sends a message swatting it out of bounds you want to see that hes not a he doesnt rebound it great only there in rebounding one of three ACC players with those numbers and sparkling statistics its just a matter of that complimentary scoring around him as you talked about a lot of this is new the scor guard lineup That Boston College is playing with it changes things so expect Tay Davis to try to take advantage of it inside tried to post him up there hes the beneficiary of this smaller lineup look for Notre Dame to kind of run some rep screens and things to get a smaller guard on him and see if he can post up Sir mohamd back in the game for Micah Shrewsberry as he finds Braden Shrewsberry Davis at the elbow just beat the shot clock rebound kept alive Applause Notre Dame good rebounding team plus 39 over the opponent and as you can see there t Davis is setting the ball screen hoping to switch to get the smaller guard thats that pretty LOF with the shot from Marcus Burton from mishak Indiana just down the road from sou Bend shooting 46 he missed first couple months of the season with a leg injury and since hes been back hes been one of the top players in the conference and theres Dion Brown he has six points great sound for Deon Brown again but he got himself going his first basket its an offensive rebound so when youre struggling to score youre not involved in the offense as much you get yourself going by going to the glass three points hes off to a fast start here for the Eagles McFarland Southeast Louisiana transfer known for his rebounding six or more rebounds in 31 of his last 45 games Hastings project but they love his game he red shirted last year hes improving um understanding his role more of a shot blacker more of an athletic Pig and the put back by Kevin ji ji a usual starter was out of the lineup tonight but hes athletic too he is and again he matches up better with Hasting so you bring it hes you can see michae shrewbury keeping his athletic guys against against BCs athletic guys CH 610 Jr made 23 starts 67 points Runner by Brown Tay Davis he can man the point first little player as he allows them to give you a different look so Marcus Burton is not always at the point of attack where you can see it see now you see the ball screener hoping they switched and they want to run Tay Davidson the post when they can off the switch chai trying to maneuver around Hastings tied up in the post and we have a jump ball keevi part of the Notre Dame attack early you dont want to lose Marcus Burton on the back door cut but if you its Carn Stanford and then um Leonard Hamilton came in and got one left the weight dominated for 32 minutes and in the last8 minutes we came aboard talking about being up 16 with 8 minutes thinking out some for gone conclusion and uh then Hammond and Sim had other ideas Donald Han with a three Luca Tas wearing 10 in white for the Eagles backup point guard player their high on cousin Jonathan Taz Chicago Blackhawk Allstar for many years won a Stanley kep Marcus Burton almost traveled rooper a veteran Off the Bench feisty defense by BC with one to shoot for Serta and hes got it my goodness he beats the shot clock wow those are the possessions that drive a coach crazy I mean a brutal possession a lot of dribbling you got nothing out of it Ander the throws up a four footer they hits nothing but the bottom of the net so youre screaming at your guys what are we doing and then you go oh great shot Cole Serta freshman from IMG Academy its a strong matches the three strong has been up and down for BCs made 17 starts he is averaging 10 points and thats his 183 of the Season as Hasting grabs the rebound Fred Payne off the Eagles bench you like his game I do confident guy comes in and shot maker I think deserves more playing time he look at this shot sometimes its better to be lucky than good and that is just I mean what throws his hands up like this is what I do strong turns around knocks down to three he got to be careful talking to the bench dont want to get teed up but great job for him whos trying to work his way back hes been affected with the small ball lineup so much success that BCs had hes been a starter and now hes trying to work himself back into the lineup and knock down that three there but he does most of his damage inside pay misses the three ji the rebound I want to know if you could pull off the sneakers that strong and pain are Id like to try though Id like to try Im sure you would Burton for three Nails it Marcus Burton good range 42 see the Improvement in this game now and that was a struggle a year ago its no longer that so consistent Applause learning by the game but his confidence is at an alltime highs and has had a rough start with the guard play that BC has youd like to see more dribble penetration like this like drivve it more driving more uh driving good fouls like this guy does Marburg then settle puts pressure on your defense hes driving patient plays off two there you go under the screen take that three ball with you and in transitions just look out he gets whatever he wants the three the drive I dont think theres a player in the ACCC that has more responsibility for his team success than Marcus Burton does and carries a tremendous burden you can see that here even tonight takes 37 of his team shots and just like that itss big time shots draws the N1 makes it look easy too theres a reason why he was ACC rookie of the year last year Mak a play like this running the Baseline out of bounds play and again gets to his spot elevates well for a smaller guard largest lead for Notre Dame Five Points can ask your average ACC fan whos leading the conference and scoring they might say Cooper flag Maxim raino from Stamford Hunter Salis from Wake Forest no Marb the point guard position is just a difficult one in this league theres theres just no gimmies I mean you you talk about Chucky hurn you add him in that equation as a big time guard the Clemson guards are big time nice move by Elijah strong got good position in front of the elbow great job there attacking his own being patient how would you attack the BC defense just like that just drive it theres theres theres no shot Blocker in the game when Hastings is not in theres no Rim protection so I think you drive it pound the paint and try to attack the offensive glass big night thus far for Dion Brown Its been a roller coaster but he has nine points already over his season his season average of seven points a game looked a little overwhelmed at times at certain points this year but hes coming off to a fast start here tonight knocking down a couple of shots here early fade away and two Caren sundra trying the contact so noted Dames got some energy and Tate Davis does as well Tay Davis is the primary backup guard takes on Texas The Moody Center in Austin you cant ask for a better Saturday of college hoops than our Sonic BL Blockbuster feature to start it off I know you love that one number one Auburn against number two Alabama could that be a final four preview I expected incredible game I mean those are two the best teams in college basketball and should be a heck of an aivy game Fred Payne hits at three so the Eagles regain some composure after the timeout they were down by six but Payne has been that type of player he hits big shots I really like him comes in with a ton of confidence you dont need to run anything for him hes always ready to shoot really aggressive on the offensive end the floor hes steady Fred Payne 73 points per game 17 steals he shoots 40 another one of those guys like Donald Han that works extremely hard shrewbury Nifty at the elbow and hes trying to perfect that part of his game well hes more than just a threepoint shooter teams are focusing so much on taking that away the first game I think his struggle started against BC they guarded him they were running them off the line they were defending him at the three and he doesnt Force anything hes a coachs son he allows the game to come to him but hes got to get aggressive and take midrange shots when theyre doing when theyre defending him this way cant allow a game to go by when your team is struggling offensively and your second lead scorer takes or third lead scorer takes four shots in a game sundra tries to save it throws it out of bounds and valid point about Shrewsbury against BC a month ago and the Eagles locked him up and since that point 33 from the field 30 Beyond The Arc and what and what they did John was they just took away three and was trying to force him off the line and that is a big part of his game so he just lets the game come to him he didnt force anything he only took four shots and it doesnt affect his game hes not hes not worried about how many shots he gets he does all the other things and you can see him making a conscious effort tonight to attack off the bous be too off the dribble and not settle for threes be more aggressive than trying to score Chad venning has been quiet transfer from St Bonaventure 69 rugged by way of Brookland but his rebounding numbers only four a game for a guy that burle you figure the number would be higher its one of the top shooters in the ACC 55 waiting stages of the shot clock for Shrewsberry thats punched Away by venning here comes Josh Applause beetle beetle with his size Id like to see him attack the rim a little bit more looking the pass I like to see him bit more aggressive attack to paint to score and then help comes great vision to find his teammates I think hes a little too unselfish at times Fade Away by Roger McFarland his first two of the game and only five points per game made his eighth start of the Season find a lot of times when guys transfer Rand off the offense even this late stage of the Season especially coming from a lower division its still tough to develop well the game is so much faster theyre playing against bigger stronger athletes every night right takes a while for guys like that to get their confidence particularly when theyre the offense is not running through them as well BC has multiple handlers multiple guards when the half court set as you can see its Josh Beetle was d DJ Han has the ball in their hand barland ties it up with a three the Eagles have been feisty theyve made five of their last seven shots Notre Dame with a scoring drought of two and A2 minutes thats been the Achilles Hill right now Marcus Burtons out of the game how does the fight knives generate offense and this is where they struggle and a foul they got Dion Brown constantini was the beneficiary but Roger McFarland impressive from distance he is here here slip the ball screen lines it up knocks down another three we got a tied one Music here adven time and space to operate inside but also what its doing is its spreading the floor giving them offensively freedom and theyre simplifying things and opening up threepointers for them theyre already at five in the season average but theyre shooting over 40 over the last couple of games its why theyve been theyve been right there giving themselves a chance to win games and just a play here or there for them its just an even an inbound or free throw there always just its just making a play when it matters in the game where its a dog fight and look like were headed to another one here tonight its a thin margin of error yes for both these teams its constantini its one of two Kei back in constant I out both teams are struggling with confidence this is a big big Confidence Game for both teams a lot of pressure uh you for the ACC tournament DC knows they need to win to keep the Gap closer but so does Notre Dame Notre Dame has the most difficult schedule remaining in the ACC they need to build a cushion to secure themselves to make sure that they get in then backed in was that a good idea its a good time he got to know they coming he got deep got to turn to make his a lot quicker its a shot he has to make right it definitely has to make but one of those things that he can do too is you know the double teams coming or the helps coming turning face paying the lob for McFarland well done on the break by The Eagles its their first lead since they LED Applause 1513 counter punch game Marcus Burton Shrewsberry and Beetle has it transfer from Music Applause Clemson what do you make of Notre Dames defense say pain takes a three thats what dribble penetration does great job by Josh V I mentioned before I think he can be much more aggressive hes always looking to pass great things happen when he gets in the paint and again another three Applause and when they spread you out like this and open up the paint with dribble penetration it just forces you to collapse and help and youre in close out positions and theyre knocking down Applause threes defense turns into offense Payne keeps his head up unforced turnover there by Marcus Burton and turns it over and BC makes him play and again Payne coming in he not afraid to knock it down as hes letting you know I got another one thats two triples for Fred Bane who shoots 39 from three and when youre guarding guys like that the tendency is not to help off of them but with the dribble penetration by a couple of times by Josh Beetle force you into rotation Eagles have benefited in knock down threes Bo blocked by venning is second of the night as he pins Davis who says hes not a shot blocker that time he pins it on a Music glass and able to secure the rebound thats impressive play and pay counters with a three Fred Payne heating up eight to nothing BC run as they have their largest lead of the game Burton Kan hes doing it all he is got momentum now just get right into your ball screen action dribble penetrating and force rotation the bumped by venting no foul and he converts love the idea hitting them on a move the double teams coming when you try to throw it to him in the post the way theyre defending the ball screen actually trying to play in drop coverage hes coming off guards are coming off hitting him on a roll or kicking out the shooters three by Davis rebound kept Alive by ji Shrewsberry no and a foul much to the shagrin of fourth year BC coach Grant vinning great job there fighting J inside has enough understanding to block it and keep it in the rim and this time catches on a roll uses all of that wide body frame initiates the contact and kisses to hook off the glass rewarding a big man for his defensive effort thats how you keep him Applause happy is that what you used to do with Duncan I had Applause to got to keep the big guys happy of course particularly when theyre playing like that theyre anchoring the defense you got to this is from a man who scored over 2000 points yeah I I scored over 2000 but I also knew take care of my big gu its called professional courtesy as the Eagles in the late stages Beetle to venning almost punched Away by Shrewsberry thats a shot clock Applause violation third BC turnover Applause BC here six six seconds left extend your defense its going to be some type of ball screen for Marcus bir and plenty of time for him to get to the rim Davis inbounding to Burton he can be a blur here he comes on beetle and the one man fast break hits it good momentum for Notre aame what happened to the defense big half for both teams they shot the well ball well on the offensive end of the floor BC with the ability to knock down seven threes in the first half big opportunity here so you can see Marcus Burton with the isolation with the clear out on the right hand cut the lead to six we got a great ball game here in con Corner Burton had 10 points to lead Notre Dame nine for pain 10 for brown and thats where were at at halftime as the Eagles lead 423 halim in Chestnut Hill coming up after the break D cuff Shan farum and Seth Greenberg in I I think both coaches subscribe to that and they feel comfortable that any team is going to run away know the name is going to fight to get back in this game but again they lack confidence as well and who finishes game for them right now Shrewsberry to drive thats a great way to start the second half and he draws contact great great job there by Braden again not settling tacking off the bounce getting to that ACC and shooting that Runner and drawing the foul and hes going to have to be aggressive they are not going to allow him to take many catch and shoot threes its a big part of the game plan and all three of his field goals have been putting it on the deck get to his pullup he completes the threepoint play after the third foul on Dion Brown turnovers have not been an issue for either Team Four for noted a three for BC Roger mcfallen and he continues his hot shooting from distance its really difficult guarding that middle ball screen it forces you to help constant owski does a great job of trying to keep the ball in front of him but he needs help when the big rolls and spraying to that three that Corners the threes is is difficult right now for notame defense here we go get in the middle ball screen action rejects it after the turnover by Burton as a three for Roger McFarland the transfer from Southeast Louisiana who averaged 16 points last year only five this year but dont tell him that no its game by game and right now theyre making SAS confident thats the biggest difference in the game right now is a threepoint shooting of BC Lee Cassel calling a foul joined by Lamar Simpson and Jamal Spearman on the officiating crew but this is good ball movement and McFarland knocks down his second three and this is the guy that shoots 211 but again he has more space and time these are not contested shots great job there sticking the follow through its amazing what confidence does right now youre seeing a confident BC Eagle group and a foul its on Josh beetle Earl in the defensive position always a man after your own heart he he has to he has to wear stretched pants cuz thats the only way he can stay in a in a defensive stance for that long I pick on him because hes coming off the rupture the hilles Achilles a year ago and yeah hes back to running on the treadmill and exercising and a traveling violation against the Irish you were joking with him and shoot around how many miles you going to do on the bike today what you do four today I I dont I I I was do the bike I did probably four to treadmill I walked my four here we go I W my ask me how many I did venting to the rack Chad venning rolling towards the rim and a foul on Notre Dame first time BC with a double digit lead since January 1st against Miami Chad vinning with the big man version of the left or right Applause cross they expected a lot when they got him from St Bonaventure and hes produced for the most part the Eagles lead by 12 largest lead of the night rer beating the pressure Tay Davis had 26 in their first meeting a month ago in South Bend the game noted name won by 18 but Notre Dame has lost the last four games in Chestnut Hill yeah theyre going to try to attack Manning and put him in ball screens hes done a great job moving his feet stand between the ball and the basket nice job keeping the ball Alive by the Irish Burton Farland at good position on Davis and its going BCs way the biggest difference between the first game and this game is rebounding BC a great job of rebounding its allowing them to control the paint theyre controlling the paint by dribble penetration and kicking it out and knocking down threes they were outrebounded by 12 the first Music game they also taken care of the basketball they had eight 18 turnovers on the first game that Notre Dame converted into 25 points theyre not helping Notre Dame right now theyre actually hurting him with that dribble penetration thats one Dion Brown would love to have back Applause Burton Burton Roper Shrewsberry Davis and ji on the floor for Michael Shrewsberry the guards are doing a great job of switching and fighting over the ball screen vinning is just staying between his basket and the ball great hands there Applause and and they beat the shot clock with a three from Shrewsberry he makes a living on Corner threes over 45 averages three threes per game one of the top numbers in the ACC thats a loose ball situation there that they were fortunate to come up with how about the Fade Away by the big fella the Dirk nosy he hit him one leged Fade Away Applause there but Im impressed with him on the defensive end the floor hes staying between the ball and the basket another turnover there Applause and Bing with the fade away against the double team thats a difficult shot here on the defensive end of the floor knocking knocking off Js Applause knee hes locking down his man for the most part all night Benning has nine points in 18 minutes made Away by McFarland whos been hot rer over Brown for the rebound rer 64 senior from Detroit only shoots 31 deep three Shrewsberry thought about it this is why I say when not the Dame gets themselves in trouble they get dependent upon burden in the ball screen and this is what their offense gets relegated to when they dont move it and other guys arent involved and its punched Away by venning and and hes got two and a foul Donald H on a quiet first half with three points as his dad erupts from his court side seat BC is doing it on the defensive end of the floor Chad vinning with another turnover McDonald Hand DJ makes some pay on the other end DC pulling he also is another Creator another guy that could put the ball in his hands without him it puts a tremendous amount of pressure again on Marcus Burton and he was brought in to help alleviate that him not being out there the scoring droughts for the fight now is just Applause continue 14 to three Run for the Eagles foul before the timeout was against Marcus Burton essentially what teams are doing against B I mean against Notre Dame is theyre just sitting in the paint clogging up the paint you got to stay home on Shrewsberry great job there by Tay Davis just creating dribble off the bals but now they theyre downsizing their lineup theyre going small a lot of ball watching for Notre Dame stagnant offensively with a loot goes absence that doesnt Music help Josh Beetle guarded by Burton Benning the take round sundra great play there by vinning he just did finish he saw the double team coming attack Baseline away from the h Mr Applause Bunny as Davis hits the tech and the fin the Eagles this is one of the best womens basketball games on the schedule its coming up tomorrow night Madison Booker and number three Texas square off against Georgia a Moore number eight Kentucky historic Memorial col in Lexington coverage begins at 7 Eastern on ESPN 2 in the app benting the foul is first with Davis at the Applause line OD Dame a 74 free throw shooting team Tay Davis played really well in the first game they did a great job of opening up the floor and getting him in Cross matchups that allowed him to attack inside and he misses both fre here and you know what that means thats a Shake Shack burger for all the fans and attendance there you go thats why theyre cheing so loud behind see if you can qualify for that Rand for a nice midnight Applause snack whistle for the we hear the fans yelling in our ear now hes their favorite player Tay Davis is my favorite player its amazing what cheeseburg yeah imagine with put a little food on your belly sounds like one of my boys you like those InNOut Burgers when you go to the West Coast and backing in on rer industrious off the offensive glass and out of bounds off from do hes Relentless Donald Han and that an attribute that he brings every morning they say hes in the gym at 630 he is he works really hard and hes battling in there but rer knows when he comes in thats his role and donals going to have his hands full all night there going to be nothing easy for him hes going to be guarded by Tay Davis or Roper theyre two best defenders for the fight in Irish McFarland the pullup boy he has some range tonight hes confident right now theres a pop theres an energy to him the balls going Music in in the floor space has been incredible for BC shooting 60 from the floor and now they have the fight in Irish spinning and theyre getting whatever they want in the offensive into the floor Burton eats up its problematic for the opposition hes got his first two in the second half he has 12 Shrewsberry has 11 Dame shooting 50 BC 6 and a Applause half and wants it battle 5050 ball sundra keeps it alive good Hustle three by Shrewsberry that helps the Cause right in front of his father great job there getting in the paint by Tay Davis hes really looking to be aggressive here offensively for the fight and Irish either scoring or creating for teammates Notre Dame has made their last three shots so its down to nine and shrewbury showing the distance which makes him one of the best Shooters in the ACC cant leave him any looks he knocks down another one hes starting to heat up Irish are fighting Music back Roger mcfallen one of the stories of the game for BC he has a season High 15 points came into the night in his last three games Rand off children with 10 total points and he has become an asset for Earl Grant he has hes been really aggressive shot looks good ball looks good good coming out of his hands and really aggressive saw the first couple go in from behind the threepoint line and since then no hesitation hes been letting it Fly he he needs to step up and score too but because DJ Han is just drawing so much attention other guys are starting to step up and it was brown early and now its probably picking up slight but Notre D starting to feel it a little bit making their last three shots McFarland was a high school teammate at University School in Port La there was Z flowers and Scotty Barnes NBA Rookie of the Year three years ago were watching Jaden Hasting grow up in front of our very eyes hes just making plays that jump out he just checks in the game and and a steel Beetle will he make it yes he will how about that balance by Josh beetle great job Josh Beetle just hanging in the air thought he got away with using that right arm and chilled off the defender but he didnt extend it shooting 61 Roper counters not known for his offense thats his fifth three of the season in 22 attempts its just an added bonus when he comes in he comes in and usually takes the best perimeter player and knows thats his assignment Applause Hastings and the hometown roll noted Dames having a tough time defending the interior its not vinning just Hasting getting the ball oneonone in the post wouldnt shock me if Notre Dame makes the adjustment and just come in tra and I know you dont want to do that the way CCs knocking down threes but got to do something different to get back in this game Burton with his fourth point of the second half points to the paint plus eight for the eagles with ven on the bench theyre getting contributions from Jaden Hastings as the Eagles have a 10point lead and well come back to chest BC leading by 10 with 1108 remaining in regulation but tell me Rand off is this a flagrant foul I dont think a smoo should have faced legal in basketball and sunra does a great job getting f after further review the common foul on white 22 has been upgraded to a flager one foul will get two shots in possession you heard the explanation from Lee Cassell Jaden Hastings assessed the flag one against Garrett sundra whos at the line so more of a momentum shift for Notre Dame whos made their last five shots they have and they starting to get back in it and sunra gets a little physical with them and they never punish the first gu they always catch retaliation there and B tes got to learn and we have a terrific ABC womens college basketball double header Sunday afternoon Paige Beckers are number seven Yukon against number four South Carolina and a Sonic Blockbuster at one Eastern Follow by number three Texas hosting number five LSU all starts with a college game day crew 1100 am eastern on ESPN from Colonial Life Arena in Columbia South Carolina get you ready for the day dont miss it Im actually going to the game nice shrewbury from distance Cory Alexander and I are going to ride down and catch that game Sunday great one you going to see Paige Beckers I am looking forward to it big moment here for VC and for the Irish its just a pivotal point in this game you starting to put baskets together but a fighting Irish for a team that struggles on the offensive end and DC you built the lead your young freshman commit a flagrant one can they get enough stops and and push keep them away to continue to hold on to this Applause lead Donald H junor Donald hen senior is in attendance and he had a sterling career at Virginia averaging over 12 points and 44 assists hes in the bucket hat you spoke to him before the game you guys shared some shared some laughs and he was a tough guy to defend when he played for the Wahoos he did um Ed Virginia couple of years after I left joke with me saying how much I inspired him in high school I didnt take it as a compliment I felt old Im like wait a minute Im watching your son youre telling me I influenced you like am I that old no youre not oh he has to be proud of his son his son has developed into a heck of a player Fred pay has been another instigator for the Eagles Off the Bench it was wavering there no he didnt cut it to seven kesn with three the Irish suddenly have some confidence its a twopossession game kesn just checks into the game Applause and you see lost him in a matchup you dont want to give him open threes choose 32 from three Chaz Kelly back up point guard in the lineup for the Eagles now Donald hand forced it but drew the foul DC had a 14point lead theres big Nikita constantini and Micah Shrewsberry with some pensive moments he wears it on his sleeve we love talking to him before the game an emotional presence on the sideline building this program and says we just need to figure out were close but theyre still riding that roller coaster no they are and and we talked about you look at their numbers and for both of these teams at 10 and 13 you think theyd be similar you understand some of the struggles with BC the numbers tell you you cant give up 82 points a game in an ACC play and 50 from the field thats not the case for Notre Dame theyre holding teams at 69 points 44 from the field 31 from three got to find ways to win look at those Boston ties six years with Brad Stevens on the Celtics bench he went to game five when they beat Dallas in the NBA finals last year and he got a pair of goggles and he kept it for a Keepsake he was in the locker room at the end of the game were in those goggles as they celebrated yeah he was a part of that process when it first started so Rachel Brad to invite him back clinching game five throw away the record like I told you I think hes an outstanding coach you watch his team compare you watch him practice oh yeah I I think hes as good as we have in this league right now where are the breakdowns occurring for the BCU defense as they got a foul on Roger McFarland is first with Tay Davis at the line for Two Shots T Davis has just gotten really aggressive um attacking off the bounce hes like a secondary ball handler for this team although they got a at times they get it he see me know that they gets in trouble it just get too relyant upon Marcus Burton but hes a guy at his size hes not a shooter but at 69 he has ball handling skills of a point guard his ability to attack you off the bounce at that size creates issues hes really gotten aggressive here in this second Applause half Earl Grant thinks he might have some NBA he does he very up and yes he does because his ball skills one hes a big time hes an elite Defender hes a versa Defender hes not a shooter but he can become a three and D guy and develop that part of his game hes not a horrible shooter but this is where he excels in transition of his size his vision you got a smaller guard on him and he creates a fine guys and hell take the three Elijah strong quiet second half off the bench maybe a little overzealous on the shot by Applause Kelly in the post gets away from strong and a turnover a rare one for the Eagles just a bad angle there by Chaz kelly didnt see the numbers when youre postfeeding if you can see the numbers you can make the Applause pass fifth turnover for BC they average 12 per game Eagles shooting 61 Notre Dame 52 story has been nine of 15 triples for the Eagles Seven of 16 not too shabby for noted aim Burton the ball fake excellent defense by Chaz Kelly it was great job containing the dribble of Burt thats not an easy job stay down on the fakes great job of fou of not fouling there Applause strong from Charlotte to venning F away with five to shoot he got the roll wasnt pretty but effective it was not but hes played really well very comfortable shooting that fade away over either shoulder strong caral the rebound 20th rebound of the game for the Eagles Notre Dame has 23 pay chai guards venning hes waiting on the double team to come if you dont come hes going over that left shoulder dont like the shot shooting a running hook there let the double team come the teammates are shooting it well three by Burton J good position Davis and industrious and hes got it he would not be Deni Tay Davis and he will be at the line coming up after this timeout but Notre Dame showing signs of life T DAV a matchup problem for a guard on the glass there fights get position Michael shrewbury getting some explanations from Lee Cassel the officials but Notre Dame admirable job flying back Randolph shers BCs made five their last seven shots but how do they battle the nerves and the mental game in the last 709 theyre going to have to go through it I mean we talked about it earlier both of these teams are struggling with confidence in finishing games getting leads and holding leads have been two different issues for these teams Applause and though the Dame has had leads and have lost him and DC has shown the ability to come back they want to win either team wants to win this game theyve got to get comfortable and reverse that trend DCs only won twice since New Years Day venning ball fake on ji but a steal by Burton oh what a spin move by that Dynamic Marcus Burton that was special Big Time play there just great speed great ability to finish was six second half 16 overall accs leading scorer venning the hook such solid touch around the rim he wants to get to that show thats not an easy shot I thought ji did a great job of pushing him away from the basket Bening in his season average of 13 points a rare misfire by Davis like it slipped out of his hand but Marcus Burton first team preseason all ACC for a reason he shows you that ACC leading score may have gotten away with an extra step there but great finish either way I think it was so pretty the officials didnt mind it they overlooked it how many of those did you get away with I was nice to the official so I was all constantly begging I was going to say I I bet you didnt do that often but man was that outstanding the reverse on the Baseline by bark is bur in a oneman wrecking Applause crew those last two baskets are relatively easy there and right now on the offensive end of the floor and this is what happened when they play with the bigger lineup with Elijah strong in there with Chad vinning floor the paint gets congested and now the intensity of fight ours defense is ramping up two possession game and Burton the take goes around fenning and its got to be someone there to stop the rotation the balls on the Baseline it should have been Five Guys in the paint there by the time he got to the basket thats just too easy and when youre struggling to close games this is whats happening Garett sundra for three Fred Payne the rebound open three probably not what youre looking for I know those are tough to pass up well hes a face up big yeah so youre comfortable with him taking a shot vinning is going to play inside and take away penetration from the guards and that look will be there strong hoist of three McFarland amongst the triple team and a tie up jump ball possession BC have yourself a game I mean Roger m is season average Four Points a game giving you 15 points seven rebounds couple of offensive rebound there and thats a big possession once upon a time ago the late Tommy hindson used to give out Tommy points on Celtics broadcast for those type of players thats a Tommy Point thats a Tom thats a Randol point you love the 5050 balls call winning plays and and you need him in games like Applause this and and J gets a hand on it but its BC ball with five to shoot so suddenly the Eagles offense is stagnant wide its not a lot of ball movement right now and Js doing a good job of staying trying to protect the rim and one of the things is happening too is the offense unit right now on the floor they got the bigger line up in theres no spacing in the floor for BC anymore theyre just much better with the four guard lineup that allows space and dribble penetration its got them to lead its why they were shooting the ball so great now theyre playing with the Elijah strong and Chad vinning in the lineup at the same time the two bigs that the better in the paint guards have nowh to penetrate fight ourish defense is picked up and the turnover is starting to mount Burton mcf on the board BC has five turnovers this half eight for the game the largest lead 14 points that was at the 1410 Mark of the second half and BCs letting their offensive struggles affect their defense I think the last couple possessions down again theres Chad Vinnie getting the ball inside theyve got to continue to defend the way they were defending in the first half that got them the lead right now Applause not the Dame is missing more than it is resistance from BC but not that possession and bumped by Burton and a foul it will be a one and one we come back from this time up but dont go away a good one breing in Chestnut Hill 11 second half points for Chad Penning hes been great on both ends of the floor here here shoots the one leged Fade Away there but hes gotten to that left shoulder couple of big baskets here at the end when VC was struggling doing an Irish run but here with his third block hes done it on both ends of the floor excuse me its Fourth block and hes had himself a heck of a game and a loose bandage there get that man taped up yeah yeah you might as well take that off I dont know what its supposed to be but its Applause its what are you what are you saying I dont know what help its doing unnecessary a gont yeah it just feels good you have a great ACC Network womens basketball triple header tomorrow night Isaiah James number 10 NC State host Miami at 6 Eastern then Hannah hadalo number two Notre D take on pit night capped off by Syracuse and Stanford will be another fantastic Thursday night of Applause oops lead climbing 28 Notre Dame their last lead was at the 338 Mark of the first half when they LED 32 Music 31 Burton has vinning on him with the switch hes got to take advantage of it steady he finds Braden shuberry for three oh my chai keeps it alive penetration by Burton cut off by McFarland oh Baseline floater that was nice by Braden Shrewsberry perfect timing again hes done a great job all night adjusting taking the threes when theyre there when they run it off the line hes putting it on the deck getting to his pull up and he knocks it down big three for Notre Dame Burton Davis and Shrewsberry in double figures all of them and a throw away by the Applause Eagles twopossession game but Braden Shrewsberry has 16 points getting to his pullup there again theyre running him off the line he knows it much needed basket there as time is starting to run out on the Fighting Irish they cant come away with empty possessions here going forward they got to dig into this lead try to get into a one possession game Applause you see two timeouts remaining Notre Dame with three Davis the drive and hell go to the Applause line strong is in because of the aggressive of pay Davidson got to know hes not a threepoint shooter he wants to get to that right Applause hand and strong goes to the bench for o Grant Deion Brown comes back in thats the second foul on Elijah strong with Davis at the line the highest scoring tro in the league Burton Davis and Shrewsberry Davis has 12 and five boards hes played 36 minutes one thing Earl grun was a little concerned about was BCs legs playing triple overtime at Syracuse on Saturday they had some time off he paced them Sunday no practice Monday light Tuesday light thought that might make some difference yeah you got you play you know you got guys that play a lot of minutes he said he let his guys in the overtime play extended minutes and it was unsure how they would respond I thought theyve been fantastic particularly in the offensive end of the floor can they hold on and close it out credit to Notre Dame making this a two possession game Brown ran into a double team look out here comes Davis Burton against McFarland Burton wins the battle El my oh my Notre Dame cuts it to two 210 left and Marcus Burton is so difficult to stop on the drive McFarlands down fish are going to take a look at it looks like McFarland took a shot to the mouth and sees bleeding there and Music what happened to yeah you can see Burtons right elbow hits him in the mouth ear ear previous play is under review inadvertent hes going up and you see the shot hes going in I dont think theres anything intentional but no by letter of the law you get hit in the face but thats just its just a basketball move right I I I would hate to see a flagrant I know its this point in the game Roger mcarton has been incredible the way hes played lets hope hes okay he takes a shot McFarland has been an exactor with that line of 15 and eight theyre showing the replay now on the video boards in both end zones at Connie for the Cassell contemplates on the far sideline but either way its a dog fight the final 210 Randolph is noted aim is outscored the Eagles 39 and 35 in the second half after BC led by six at halftime Eagles led by as many as 14 in the second half Applause very important game a swing game Eagles and Notre Dame bottom half of the ACCC Notre Dame if the season ended today would be the 15 seed in the ACC tourney in Charlotte DC would be out while with NC State and Miami good win for Miami last night at home against Syracuse dropped the orange to 5 and nine but its been that type of year in the ACC Topsy T it has and this is a big game for BC because again they just lost a triple overtime game to Syracuse so they havt Edge there and theyve already lost to this Notre Dame team so you can afford to lose again because then theyll have the tiebreaker and you will already be three games down so were starting to run out of games as be Castle tells us theres no additional call on the floor I know the fans dont like it but its the right call I think its incidental contact made on a natural basketball ball play play like that would be critical right now yes it would in the course of this game and its been a clean game has been played by the players I think the officials did a made the right call there agreed good explanation on your part incidental contact Burton driving to the hoop and converting for his 20th Point his season Applause average beo Brown strong venting and hand for the Eagles Beetle from the base and an erron shot by Josh beetle is out a tough night with Just Four Points well you dont involve yourself in the game much because youre not an aggressive scorer and in critical moment like that take a pull up jump shot not the easiest shot Davis ball fake a strong its a tie game eight to nothing Run for the the Irish a scoring drought of over 2115 for the Eagles first tie since it was 3131 same move there yep Chad Benny with the left to right crossover against J and they found something as well I think the match up with Tay Davis one of Lies as strong as a mismatch in favor of Davis Burton from the elbow Marcus Burton scintilating in the last three minutes someone has to step up and make a Applause play Oh Burtons that type of guy hes a closer for noted name on The Bob Koozie award watch list is the best point guard in the country Up and Under by Dion Brown blw by his man Brown got off to a hot start early in the game and cooled off picked a great moment to find get himself back in the game Burton bumped and fouled Marcus Burton determined to get a shot off and venning fouled him ellish its a lot of contact there Applause and Vinnie doesnt like the call but Marcus Burton is so quick the line not much Burton cant do 22 points five rebounds three assists does have five turnovers hes played 36 minutes and he HS the big shot close games a theme for both teams throughout the year that graphic tells you both of them have dealt with impressive number for BC at 5 and0 games decided by four points or less two money shots it is tie game what are you doing here if your BC youre holding it for your last possession hes got to draw up something I I think Id call time out and you will and you got to go to your smaller lineup and we will come back after this 30 want the basketball and go get it a brownand venning beetle and strong on the floor for the Eagles Applause watch your lives are strong on the offensive glass Tay Davis does a great job of coming in look out and he gets it into venning Beetle will man the point shot clock off Burton on Applause beetle its going to be a ball screen or something with zenning trying to wheel turn around missed it Shrewsberry the board and were going to Bonus Ball pretty good look for Chad venning hes been playing well making that shot all night we talked about great defensive possession there for Notre Dame one shot rebound to the basketball and we have ourselves some free basketball No Name a sixpoint lead but the last play probably not the best shot for the Eagles yeah youd like to see him attack in the rim but again hes knocked that shot down J did a really good job of pushing him away from the basket maybe making that fade away a little longer than they would like for it to have been this has been a clean game both teams have played well and Marcus Burtons played really well for the Irish Donald Han on the other side is drawing the two best defenders and just hadnt really been involved in the game much for the Eagles and I thought they were better offensively with the smaller guards and they back to their starting lineup and having those four guards in lets see if that helps them in this overtime neither team has won an overtime game at Syracuse BC played three overtimes on Applause Saturday watch Tay Davis on the offensive glass on postups shrewbury attempting to blow by but the rebound for Dion Brown you see has that good ball movement with 18 assists previous season high with eight Brown was hot early for Beetle and almost lost it for to shoot venning pass toi and flustered shock clock violation youre rolling your eyes yeah K great defensive possession there knowing vinning wants to get back to that left shoulder did a great job when he tried to turn back that left shoulder wall up put his chest on him with physicality reading the loose ball in the shot clock violation Marcus Burton guarded by Beetle takes it towards the Rock and converts and the celebration says it all he is in a Zone has a heart of a line I mean hes just so Fearless going inside 26 with the sophomore from mishuk indiano good move of the post thats the footwork youre looking for from D yeah and that time I think to give himself a better opportunity when the guards penetrates you just need to get in that dumper spot a great job there getting back again getting to that left shoulder and finishing how about the Nifty ball handling by Burton Davis the runner kzne pulls down the rebound thats a thats a Randolph Point thats the downside of this four guard lineup youve got to rebound because Chad vinning is not a great rebound he only averages four games so it relies on these guards theyve got to dig in there and come up with loose balls late possession three by kesn not what youre looking for there we go beetle with a determined Applause look Donald Hs been quiet 11 points this is also where you worry about the fatigue youre coming off a triple overtime now youre in overtime again BR didnt care about that hes got fresh legs but hes night at The Rim outstanding defense by the Irish will it turn into outstanding offense Burton for three and the rebound by J rebound rebound rebound just smaller lineup You got to dig your nose in there and come up with it if you BC timeout noted aim thin margin of era continues on each position session will come back after this timeout dont go Music away Notre Dame defense tenacious Randolph they have and they buckled down when they needed to there I thought mcfar had a step actually got away with one thats a foul on Shrewsberry there but they dont call it these teams are battling they fight for everything and Music you can see they got the ball movement there both teams just competing on the defensive end of the floor and you want to win this chance because again everyone could just remember a year ago havt North Carolina State came out of nowhere and went on a run yeah and to be eligible for the ACC tournament gives you hope that that still can happen if youre not eligible for it it it just kills the morale and teams its just difficult to play for something at that point makes for a difficult off season Burton and a foul he ran into Beetle third on beetle the Clemson transfer thought Beetle did a good job of moving his feet didnt like the call I thought he did a great job Applause of cutting Marcus Burton off there and must stuck that left arm out and got a hand on him game has been tied 11 times as Burton gives Notre Dame the onepoint lead big part of the success for the Irish 14 offensive rebounds to five for BC and the second chance points plus 11 for Notre Dame thats their advantage and a lot of that comes from the activity in of Tay Davis against this smaller lineup he poses a matchup problem and with donalan JR struggling the offensive end good Hustle by Davis saving it this is what be SE problem when the offensive end the floor theyre struggling uh hand is struggling and theyre in unfamiliar territory this is how and why you lose games youve got to find a way to get a shot Burton at the Applause elbow and goes over the top and they got a foul on the Eagles yeah just great job there getting the deflection you got to know playing against Snow to Dame theyre going to heavy rotation theyre going to protect the basket at all cost see beo there saying hey next time Ill throw a bounce pass communicating with his big kevi quiet offensively its the money shot there has eight rebounds though Off the Bench didnt start its played 23 minutes Beetle out of the line up Fred Payne in so Michael Shrewsberry making the adjustment to his starting lineup but ja still giving them quality work Off the Bench well hes going to play starter minutes its one out of two Tracked Down by Donald H 80 Seconds to play in the first overtime last time BCP backto back overtime games is three years ago ACC tournament got to try to get Ving inside wow big time shot by Donald and wow he hits the three and his father Donald senior is jacked up hand has 14 one of five eagles and double figures Burton ja inventing jockey for position Eagle basketball on this is just a big time play Here by Donald Han Jr he struggled all night but no shots bigger than that one he looks at dad and lets that know I when I saw this live I thought it was off of keev the floor white possession we will review yeah that should be a quick review its the fingertips of J the Big Fellas jockeying for Music position great job by the officials not calling over the back or anything big guys get tangled up this should be a quick review now coming out after this if youre BC you got a situation you can run here you can try to go two for one here yeah and and and call on the floor is confirmed white ball the clock will be adjusted to 411 is that what you would do I would you got 11 seconds here if you hold it down and you miss you give it you to give Notre Dame an opportunity to finish the game in the last shot I would try to score something a quick hitter here to ensure Im going to get the last possession if I score great but if I dont Im going to have another chance if you melt this clock and you dont score the advantage swings significantly to not the name and I would not want to put the ball in Marcus Burton hands for L for L shot Burton leads all scores with 28 venning leading BC with 19 and a huge three moments ago with 14 Music Roger mcfr the inbounder has 15 Fred Payne the guy who has the ball now has 11 and see Notre Dame had your defense back you could have waited rolled the ball up the court now you you got to Music score because if you dont know the Dame will have the last possession so I thought there was an opportunity there for the BC to roll the ball up steal some time and get a quick hitter off and Ure they get the last possession of the game Farland Dion Brown Baseline three to shoot Benning not his shot and the rebound by Kevin J thats not the shot you want Marcus Burton between the legs the Music three and the weak side rebound by Brown double over time my goodness first Laughter Eagles played three over time was on Saturday why not go to two tonight Eagles good look but an awkward shot yeah well both teams at the end you want to get a better shot than that I thought Burton Marcus Burton settled on shot the end the game and you dont want Vinnie taking a 17footer with the shot clock remaining thats not the shot youre looking for and on the other end thats a settle by Burke but again Burton just didnt get an opportunity there you had enough time on the clock when you rebounded the basketball maybe get a ball screen but GI but I understand you Music time can he start the heat up and close this game because he struggled on the offensive end and what formula would you use for both teams offensively to have success in double overtime just run your stuff you dont have to break the offense the tendency that both of these teams have had to start over dribbling the basketball and out executing your offense Applause and run your stuff hope the defense makes a mistake and when they do be ready to punish the defense pay almost lost it first time that BC has had multiple overtime games backto back in school history McFarland foul line extended and industrious work off the glass by Brown whos fouled whos snuck in have the loose ball rebound its great job there just coming in and I thought that was a great shot by mccarten a good look but Brown is not watching hes running in there helps the Eagles avoid an empty possession get to the foul line here and try to be the first team to score in double overtime oh my foul is on Roper his second be a one and one for d on Brown the Maryland Baltimore County transfer from great barington Massachusetts which was at the end of the mass turn Fike youre talking about a guard that was 19 and seven at UNBC hes had more of a scoring reputation coming in hes done a really good job here Applause tonight BC 9 for 11 at the line Notre Dame has missed six foul shots shot in their 22 visits Davis spinning back to J that was pretty wow what a pass its a great job there by Davis he had vinning on him and thats just a mismatch off the bounc athleticism is Kei at a premium McFarland three well off the line didnt have to take that shot has played well 15 points here I thought he could have swung that pass hes three for five from three Burton yes sir Marcus Burton season high 30 points youve got to make him pass the basketball when he gets in a pain hes just put so much pressure on your defense he got to know hes going to be aggressive eight of his last nine 20 or more and and is that what youre looking for he driving the paint just get him in the paint get the ball in his hands doesnt have a shot give him space to drive a big physical guard but here Davis just drives vinning great drop off there to J Who slams at home and look at physicality cutting off there drive by Burton just big physical finish there for a little guard and best foul shooter for the Eagles at 87 one of the top marks in the country after the foul is on ji Kiss of Death Randolph yeah just a little bit of a hitch there he have free throws there in the Syracuse game the game on the line as well hes got to settle down to make those Davis the take but contact by Chad vinning is third impressive what Davis has done and what Shrewsberry has done and ji and Burton theyve all been instigate I thought that was a really good block by vinning I thought he got it high held his ground he was in the air when a contact was made and he did swipe down but Davis has just been aggressive to your point he been driving hard right hand that time he crossed over went left took the contact and got it on the rim slow start but hes picked it up here in the second half and so aggressive threepoint Irish Applause lead got to trust your offense now run your stuff dont settle three not to your liking I dont mind a shot had he been in the game hes not even sweating because he hadnt played the last couple of games hes just checked in and this timeout and Id like for someone else maybe to create the shot the opportunity for him to shoot and Davis is starting to take over Tay Davis had 26 in the first game between these two now he has 20 and Earl Grant needs a timeout youc led by as many as 14 points in the second half but now its a fivepoint Notre Dame lead we will head to a timeout 231 remaining in dont go to their leading score Donald Han you go the other way I would go to him but it needs to be in the flow of the game I mean he struggled and I would see the matchup right now you can see rer in one of their better Defenders are on him and I would run something for him he doesnt get it I wouldnt for pick by venning to pay venning gets it back Benning Big Boy move and he converts getting him in getting him the ball right now hes been effective doing theyve had no answer for that and I would like to see Donald Han Jr because hes such a natural score to get the ball in his hands and to get a touch I wouldnt want him to go in the rest of this overtime and not get a touch venning has 21 10 for 18 from the field Tay Davis has been a bear Burton Shrewsberry Davis ji Fade Away Burton no paying the rebound its a great defensive possession there staying in front of the basketball sitting on that right hand for Marcus Burton and making him take a contested pullup and guarded tightly by shrewbury hits the deck and a 5050 ball arrowed towards Notre Dame excellent Hustle by Braden Shrewsberry his hand is slow to get Applause Music up usually condensation on the Flor Connie with the hockey arena one of the players is saying he got stepped on afterwards something but I think its that they they fell on them you can see I think thats Tay Davis they came up with a knee theyre going to take a look at that watch Ropers knee when he comes down his left Applause knee that doesnt look like a normal basketball move there that was an awkward spot yeah and youre not allowed to go diing a guy they cant go back and call a foul but watch the left knee of as the fans get to look on the video boards yeah theyre seeing what youre seeing right now his hand they could have called a foul they didnt and its a loose ball Music there good Hustle by shrew and hand then hand defenseless after the knee came in yeah its what I like to say those are soft tissue injuries when you get hit right there you know thats just say no more yeah its just unfortunate those are ones when you look at your career you probably say yeah I remember some of those right yeah I usually things you just see at the bottom of a football pile not in the basketball game its just the way the way things he going but now I dont think its intentional he just went down its just it just looked awkward the way it happened and they CAU to Plate Le Lee Cassel Lamar Simpson and Jamal Spearman the officiating crew I would not want to be an official having to make this call here this is a difficult one I mean thats just he want it it should have take this long it clear it off I mean you look now its a its a tie ball and you go down and stick your knee in a Defender I dont know where driving your knee thatal there a basket considered a basketball move right its not usually mean look at this yeah its not much effort there for the ball I dont know well either way 82 seconds left in the second overtime BC shooting 56 the Irish at 47 their overtime percentage Jo 33 for the Eagles in the second half in the second overtime Notre Dame at 33 as well we all saw it we have like 20 referees sitting behind us court side awaiting the call from Lee to cell I think its going to be a flagrant one at least its just looks like it yeah after further review we have assessed a flagrant one techn excuse me a FL one foul to blue one white 13 will have two shots white will have possession of the ball with 20 seconds on the shot clock what a swing Julian roer off for the flagrant one and Donald H at the line yeah I you dont like it for fighting AR but I think its the right call and 8 for 10 at the line tonight he has 16 points thats a big possession youre talking about having the ball up three with a minute 22 left and now its a one onepoint game and BC has the ball thats a major swing much to the Chagrin of Julian roer Earl Grant looks Applause on officials huddling me Cassel will head to the scores t or hell talk with Michel Shrewsberry Applause come on BR by illegal contact is not a flagrant one it is a flagrant 2 which calluses for automatic infection wow so the ejection of Julian roer as the call is rectified by Lee Cel and rer will hit but a lock Applause him hes one of those blue guys a senior from Detroit gives them intensity especially on the defensive end now theyll have to compensate for his absence in the final 82 seconds of you know you do and he youre going to miss him on a defensive end the floor thats where hes had the biggest impact Brown and he gives BC the lead on Brown success in the first half with nine points he has Music 15 Burton the blow by attempt and the foul this has been a really good B basketball game its been four its been fun and yes it has Chad Vin picked up his four foul and hes starting to fatigue hes a little bit late his rotations now and L hes late coming over and JR kesn has replaced roper in the noted aim lineup Burton five for six at the line played 45 minutes as 30 points the accs leading score and he misses two thats just fatigue thats just fatigue a lot of minutes hes played 45 minutes here a 900 game just tough but what a game what a game outstanding venning thats the one you take if youre mcfarley there I think you got a chance there take the three you take the open three you wont get a better look than that and instead gaves it with the shot clock on the waiting seconds thats what I mean you know in that time of the game it doesnt matter and it had you taken that shot you would have a chance to get the last possession again the game clock will be under review shot clock violation Applause you BC you know you just you onepoint possession I mean onepoint game its going to be Notre Dames ball now you got to defend without fouling there like you come off here get it to your score great job of officiating not calling the foul hand kicks his leg shot clock by Music violation this could be the type of game Michael Shrewsberry talks about a cultural cultural shift in the program shot making toughness yeah counter punches a flurry of them theres been droughts on both sides BC has a six to nothing run over the last minute 43 not name a scoring Dr of 210 but Burton and Shai Scoops it up and hits it Kevin J lunch pill Off the Bench hes been a rebounding machine onepoint Notre Dame lead fifth foul on venning and thats just its a great job by Vinnie coming to help and again the weak side guards I know Micah shrewbury is Music there back backside guards got to crack down and rebound and I and that not only did you lose your only rim protector on the floor at the time you youre losing your your goto guy here in this particular game in Chad vinning I mean hes been the guy thats kind of carried you down the stretch offensively yeah the emotions preventing say it all fouls out with 21 points lets see season high with 19 against Duke Jaden Hastings in the final 169 for the Eagles and Errol Grant Hastings Han McFarland Payne and brown J Shrewsberry Burton kzne and Davis for Notre Dame its a big free throw here Kei with seven points and 12 rebounds and he misses it Eagles down by one shot clock off where are they going I think Han has to touch it brown the fade away no rebound Burton two to play and a foul you do by Fred Payne 17 left Dion Brown took the shot what you makeing it if youre going to take it take it with confidence he does a great job of initiating contact credit Shrewsbury taking the contact and still being able to contest that shot Deon Brown double clutches it you see Donald Han has a right to be frustrated I think he got to put the ball in his hands with the lineup thats on the floor and just been a big factor in so many any of your games and he just didnt run a lot for him he didnt get a lot of touches late in the game timeout Earl Grant because now he doesnt get a chance to run his play whoever rebound initially just essentially has to heave it 90 ft yep so if Im up two in this situation I just miss it Id miss Music it valid interesting scenario with Burton at the line with 31 points 12 for 29 from the field seven rebounds because making it here allows them to execute a play Maybe throwout the half court I would have missed it he makes it and thats a new career high for the dynamic Marcus Burton 32 points all right so they dont follow your script instead a Notre Dame 32 timeout up by three four game Connie form losing streak BCs won only twice since the New Year turn Miami January 1st and then Florida State February 1st pay inbound with 17 left runs the Baseline hand will launch and hes off the line and noted aim walks away with a threepoint win in double overtime gutsy performance the type of effort where Michael Shrewsbury said his team needed to go through and try to find a way to win and if youre an Eagles fan they fought hard played well its another disappointing loss double overtime game just a heck of a game and its one of those games you just its just unfortunate someone had to lose the final
