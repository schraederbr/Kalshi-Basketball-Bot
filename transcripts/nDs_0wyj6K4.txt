a ceremony at halftime that we will bring you here on the ACC network but we are ready to go Ian mclin is set to tip it up Dennis Evans wins the tip for the card Scott Clark has it we introduce you all these new cards if you havent seen them in their two exhibition games but a couple of them on the court right now actually three of the newcomers join Brandon Huntley Hatfield and Mike James as Huntley Hatfield goes in the lane and its called for the offensive foul right out of the gate number 10 Devin Sapp drew that one I like to see Huntley Hatfield being aggressive Ive was told this week in practice hes looked different hes looked like a guy who has kind of been energized and uh that was a good aggressive move there just got just threw the charge Scot clock almost forcing a turnover here are their five starters Devin Sapp Deon Brown Bryce Johnson Marcus Banks and Max Lorca Lloyd three newcomers to their program to return e but they do not return a starter from last season the cards with sky Clark Mike Mike James Dennis Evans Brandon Hatfield and Trey white the USC transfer out as well as Scot Clark drives to the basket draws the foul and well see if he gets two shots and he is going get two shots our officials tonight BT Smith Jeff Pon and Ian mclen and Ken I think thats where were going to see a lot of Louisville tonight I think a lot of in transition Louisville trying to get out and go with it I expect sky Clark to try to create a lot like he did there he was actually looking like he might look like he passed there but they gave him the shot Scott Clark the transfer from Illinois only played 13 games last season for the Alli started 12 of those games he was a 70 free throw shooter for them but he misses the first one here hes going to get another shot to get our first point of the 2023 24 season and sky does just that CS up one Applause night this un VC program Jed with players from all over the place as we see Bryce Johnson Chicago State transfer there Bryce Johnson as he gets the bucket first bucket of the year for UNBC again the lisal starters Scott Clark all the way to the basket hes going to draw another foul and I think that might be that was on Devin Sapp nope that was on Banks Jr his second personal already Banks Jr who started his collegiate career at Western Carolina went to adessa college last year and hes going to come out after less than a minute and picking up uh uh picking up the fouls Marlin short Junior transfer uh coming back coming in for him a quick uh two fouls black one for two on his first trip of the line he knocks down the first free throw Marlin short a 66 Jr from Richman California checks in played at Stannis state division 2 School averaged 15 points and five re as a sophomore last year so he makes the move up to division one and skot Clark is now two for four from the line but hle half with a rebound it throws it away trying to get it to Trey white and another one of those unforced airs thats thats something that that Kenny Payne would like to avoid it we saw Improvement I think from exhibition one to two in that we did but Huntley Hatfield again he needs to be more aggressive I he had a shot there if he has it as were going to get an offensive foul now called on Brown Lara Lloyd get it was on the it was on the pick so three fouls in just a minute and 7 seconds on Applause UNBC have we seen this UFL lineup in the two exhibition games at all yeah I think we I think weve seen it a I think we saw it a little bit in against uh against Kentucky Wesley and but Huntley Hatfield did not start as Trey white to the bucket and gets the first field goal of the season for Louisville Trey white did scoring double figures in both exhibition games and a lot of people think he is the best player on the team the number one offensive option on this year I I think when you look at it as UNBC a turnover there Johnson just kind of a little too far out of the reach of Devin sa I think when you look at this Louisville team A lot of people are going to say Mike James has improved a lot Sky Clarks going to run the show but to me Trey white is the most talented offensive player and the kind of goto guy for this team Clark in the lane gets it up on the basket and thats all you have to do let the big fella go and get it down Sev with the dunk early did not have a field goal attempt in their second exhibition game against Kentucky Wesley but he gets one early and after four dunks and their win over Simmons he gets his first dunk tonight short goes all the way the basket and skot Clarks not going to get an assist because it was a missed shot but you dont mind missing shots when big Dennis is right there as Clark puts it up and Dennis Evans just goes up and dunks it Kenny Payne giving Huntley Hatfield some instruction over there as Huntley Hatfield just kind of got caught a little bit off and he picks up the foul so a foul and two turnovers already for a Huntley Hatfield as hes going to come out I still think weve talked about it before and I know if youre a Louisville fan you know it Brandon Huntley Hatfield is a big part of the this season success if youre going to have some success in what you want youre going to have to get some from hutley Hatfield I do like that he was being more aggressive so far but again a couple turnovers short knocks in both free throws early going here six for Louisville Scott Clark gets to the basket the nice dish to trainer underneath for the finish and thats thats the whole thing right there skot Clark Louisvilles first five possessions what has he been doing gets to the basket getting into the paint on every possession and at will hes drawn a couple of fouls hes got the assist there and kind of an assist when he got it up on the rim to Evans but yeah looks like he feels like he can get by Brown just about every time and trainer with a nice finish inside well hes already drawn two fouls on Banks Banks is on the bench so now they put Brown on him and he went right by him so I would expect Louis to keep trying to go to that Whites going to get the offensive foul as he maybe a little shoved to short white didnt agree with with it its uh caught a charge though couple of offensive fouls here for Louisville in the early going three turnovers for the cards in the first three minutes down the lane another turnover for Bryce Johnson as he loses his footing in the lane and I tell you Bryce Johnson I saw in warmups about 45 minutes before they were we we started this game Bryce Johnson took a hard fall and they looked at him for quite a a while after that their training staff did we looking at his leg leg he then kind of stretched it out it took him a while to get back out there but looks like hes fine but I thought for a minute I was like man he went down pretty hard it looked like it was a leg injury but just kind of stretched it back out just looking through the stats he would look like the guy theyd expect to be their leading scorer started 19 games for Chicago State last year did it 57 threes Mike James the Miss follows it and thats a guy Lou Will expects to kind of put a lot more offensive production up this season and important as we get the three from the corner from Devin Applause Sapp I was going to say the crowd starting to get into the game now but then they give up the quick three at the other end Clark gets to the basket again up off the rim but nobody there to rebound it he sails out of Bounce and weve got five on four advantage here for the retrievers but the miss Trey white was leaking out there yeah and sky Clark was looking for him but didnt have that a very good job of trainer getting it right to his guard I like how sky Clark looks like he is in command of this offense right now white the Miss in the lane felt like in the last game Louisville obviously shot a poor percentage and and missed some open shots drive down the lane there by Dion Brown and all of a sudden UNBC is back within one they werent necessarily bad shots but maybe not the best shot they could get and I think thats what Kenny Payne was saying he like to see him move the ball a little bit as we you talked about sky Clark getting in the paint he wants to see him getting in the paint yeah ball movement ball movement is a big thing with this team you got to they were getting decent shots youve got to get really good shots Trey white with the Bullet Pass that Mike James cant handle in UNBC with possession and a chance to take the lead inside on Dennis evm with a block lco lyd was going to go over the big fella Clark all the way to the basket over to James for the Triple in the corner cant get it to go but James with another offensive rebound and the L to Evans for the SL just throw it up to the big fella Dennis Evans is always there he gets the defensive play on one end and he gets rewarded with a dunk on the other end two Dennis dunks in the early going here cards up 129 short guard by White Challenge shot goes in and its Applause Music 1211 going the UFL freshman with a couple of dunks early and a block shot as well as Louisville leads 121 a 9 8 in reach and a 7 s Wings span man for the big fella Dennis Evans now the tallest player to ever play for the Louisville Cardinals as he surpasses Hest mmu M Stockman Jonathan Huffman and Felton Spencer Dennis Menace hes going to be a menace for a lot of opponents and hes started off pretty strong here with four points block and a rebound let set the uh teams on the court right now its Frank emu a freshman for the retrievers scores his first college points to give them a 1312 lead Tyler Johnson The Freshman guard Curtis Williams The Freshman in the game for Louisville along with Caleb Glenn the former male High star JJ trainer and Mike James so not a huge lineup out here for the cards right now Jody no its not as Mike James goes to work inside and Louisville again and the paint at that first timeout Louisville up 102 in the paint and what do they do Mike James goes right back down into the paint and scores again and hes going to get a free throw and Kent the one thing Louisville out rebounding UNBC 8 to2 but so far five turnovers for Louisville theyve got to do a better job of handling the ball two of those offensive fouls that foul was on Marlin short by the way just to reset a little bit with 1350 left Marcus Banks Jr a starter for the retrievers out right now hes already got two personal fouls as does Brandon Huntley Hatfield who started for Louisville as well Mike James for the line to complete the threepoint play and he does just that was a 78 free throw shooter last year for the Cs that was number two on the Music team cadarius Smith also on the court for UMBC with Frank umu who we talked about we see Deon brown with a Applause triple and the retrievers are back in front by one Deion brown one of the guys thats back for this team on the America East all rookie team last year averaged about seven and a half points a game with the three see brown on the replay here he missed the first 11 games last season but then came back in in really seven double digit games hes a guy that I think can score it between Dion Brown and Bryce Johnson the two guys that I think on this team kind of expected to carry the scoring load as uh were going to see uh Scott Clark back in for Mike James along with Tyler John so Tyler and he had two 19point games for them last season and when you see a guy scored 45 in a high school game you cant do that if you cant score you got to be able to shoot the ball a little bit you mean you never did that Tyler Johnson Ty all the way to the basket but kicks it out for the three and Caleb Glenns triples off the back of the rim and here come the retrievers with a 1615 lead in the early going Marlin short into the paint kicks it over for another three for Devin sap and that is his second triple of the evening and it is 1915 retrievers theyre now three for six from three Louisville yet to hit a threepoint field goal in two tries so far tonight Scott Clark gets all the way to the basket goes under it and scores and gets the cards back within two Applause Music kadaria Smith drives Baseline and gets the reverse to go around JJ trainer Smith from us USC Upstate hes played in a bunch of games in four years one of the most experienced guys in this game started 15 games last year for them averaged just under eight points Curtis Williams out to skot Clark 10 seconds on the shot clock here for the cards down four in the early going Clark into the paint again on short and short able to comp with the loose ball and the retrievers are pushing it again theyve hit their last five field goals IMU with a Miss in the lane and the cards have a chance for maybe a little break here Tyler Johnson to Curtis Williams he can shoot it this three off the back of the rim and look at Caleb Glenn fighting for the rebound and then trainer inside were going to get a block I think he was trainer did lower the shoulder but Im pretty sure it was in the restrict area I think that was Devin Sapp and trainers going to shoot some free throws when we return a chance to tie this one up deficit right now to the UNBC retrievers lets get to know the retriever a little bit University of Maryland Baltimore County their first day of class back in 1966 the retrievers Jody one of the better mascots it is a great one and one of the better wins of all time one of two 16 seats defeated number one seat they did did it back in 2018 jerius ly 28 points they were 12 of 24 from three and they knocked off Virginia 7554 and itll always be the first team to do it Fairley Dickinson knocked off Purdue in the last NCAA tourament this team picked to finish sixth in the America East conference this year that last foul by the way was on Frank emu number 21 as JJ trainer was in the lane and little Collision in the painton trainer misses the free Music throw ball off Ivanovic we got to go get that if youre Trey white thats what uh coach Paynes telling him Trey white could have had that looked like he tracked it down but I dont think he knew it was off of his own teammate lets set the cards lineup Jody a couple of gu first of all Emanuel a COR for who did not play in that exhibition game against Kentucky Wesley and on the court as well as Dono yovanovich a transfer from Miami went to the final four last year even though he only played one game for them but part of that hurricane Squad that went to the final four along with Trey white Tyler Johnson and sky Clark Johnson always looking and and sky Clark as well the two guys whoevers playing Point always looking to push it tonight for Louisville white gets to the basket like quite a bit of contact inside but nothing called oh Johnson to yanovich on the Baseline misses white with the offensive rebound goes back up and he has lost the ball on his way up got a COR for running the floor with the deflection what do you expect from the big fella because he showed us some flashes last year only played in five games and didnt come didnt start you know get get in the lineup until January after coming from NBA Africa but he was impressive this summer in Canada in the global Jam yeah I was going to say he he had a tough year last year because of he joined so late it was kind of up against it really I expect him I expect him to be a guy who were going to see like were in there now its going to be right now its going to be spot minutes he and Dennis Evans and Brandon Huntley Hatfield and hes going to do some things like dunet like Dennis Evans running the floor and a core for gets a slam you know I think one thing that was a question a lot of last year look at him get back and just challenge the shot enough to make a difference effort is not a question with him he plays hard when hes out there no he totally does I remember when it was at the first or second game at Notre Dame hes got a lot of hes got a big motor and really gets after it Ivanovic keeps the ball alive on the Bastion well see the foul is that going to be on a quarter for lets take a look at that follow by Emanuel a Music for the pass and a for running to the floor and it looked to me like Johnson could have lobed it to a core 42 when he drove the lane and kicked yanovich in the corner for the Triple white to the bench Mike James back in for the cards all tied at 21 10 minutes to play in the first half year on opening night of the college basketball season this is a lot of time with sky Clark and Tyler Johnson on the floor at the same time for Kenny pay maroy falls Applause down Banks Jr misses the jumper back in the game with his two fouls offensive rebound and then inside all kinds of in there and its going to send Dion Brown to the Applause line theres a lot of contact on both ends of the floor in the last couple of minutes first personal on Mike James the fifth personal on the cards UNBC with six fouls already so the cards will be in the bonus from here on out Deion Brown a sophomore from great barington Massachusetts to the line for two free throws he misses the first you mentioned him earlier on the americ East do rookie team last year averaged just under 19 minutes a game almost eight points four rebounds and and did show some flashes with a 21point game that thats his career high and a pair of 19point games and he hits the second free throw and its 2221 Applause UNBC what have you seen from yvanovich and the little weve saw him in there honestly we saw him so little because we did not see him in the first exhibition think I think what we going to see from him is a little bit of as Buck the were going to see that he can really shoot it for a guy his size and his versatility makes him a matchup problem Dennis Evans set to check in at the next dead ball for the cards than junor just puts his head down and gets all the way to the I mean Bryce Johnson all the way to the basket and you can see thats where they like out of the Chicago State transfer big bump up top for sky Clark Trey white to the basket and thats going to be a foul on Banks Jr and thats going to be his third personal foul say put it back in he got a couple minutes with him two fouls and he picks up his third now Louisville going to put Huntley Hatfield back in here as he has two fouls L2 give us a chance to talk about TR a little bit Jo or a USC transfer an all freshman pack uh on the all packwell freshman team last year started 29 games for the Trojans and uh yeah definitely the most highly counted transfer yeah n 91 points five and a half rebounds per game I I I just remember watching some games last year and Ive said this before and its its kind of like when you sit here and watch him he plays bigger than what he is and uh he is 67 hes misses a free throw but he plays biger bigger than that he just does so many things for his team and I think the most talented guy on this Lis roster Dennis Evans and Brandon Hunley a both check back in for the cars theres Trey white with a rebound hes going to push it a little bit but he does not have numbers so look it right to the basket to Evans and Evans takes the hit from short and well see the big fella go to the line I thought we were going to get a third Dennis dunk of the first half but thats the second personal foul on Marlin short and Dennis will to earn it at the free throw line yeah Dennis Evans boy when he gets going he he seemed like he was further away from the basket but then I forgot it was from the free throw line its just a step not a bad a 74 free throw shooter though in high school last year uh a 54 from the field that was our thats our eighth lead change so far in the first half and actually 33 from three in high school as well although Im not sure were going to see him put up too many triples I dont think well see too many triples for Dennis Evans but Strokes from the line doesnt look B he hits one to two James gets a hand on then Hy hfield goes up and grabs the offensive rebound Clark back to Huntley atfield in the corner and the three rattles off good look good job by cards hustling AMU the lob to L Lloyd and were going to get a foul on skot Clark and not much he could do about that he kind of had a body on him and L went up to grab it were going to Applause get Applause lets see a replay here that just kind of backs into him a little bit that wasnt much there that should have probably been a turnover but yeah really no retrievers and the circus shot on the Baseline by Bryce Johnson he gets that to go and he draws the foul on sky Clark and sky Clark just picked up two fouls in a couple of seconds uh they missed a walk but thats okay be interesting to see if we see Scott Clark again now with eight minutes he goes to the bench Brandon hutley atfield already out here with two fouls Tyler Johnson in the game for the cards is Bryce Johnson completes the threepoint play for the retrievers and they lead it 27 25 Johnson with seven points to lead all scorers in the early going much more engaged passing the ball getting into the paint offensively Mike James aggressive and hell go to the line for two free throws and we come back a chance to tie it up but UNBC leading Louisville 2725 its going to be on all their uniforms this season Kenny Payne wearing a pin as well on the bench as Mike James Goes to the line for a couple of free throws and a chance to tie this thing up he is the leading returning scorer for this team was number two on the team last year averaged 10 point 1 points started all 32 games and as I said earlier a 78 free throw shooter last year and this year is off to a pretty good start as well as hes three for three from the line the early going and were all tied up at 27 Brown the fake gets all the way to the basket and scores to give the retrievers a twopoint lead thats where youre going to see Dennis Evans is going to have to grow on the defensive end hes really good at blocking shots just a little late on that one James inside again he gets another foul hell go to the line thats on I think Frank U inside itll be the second personal on the Freshman guard and give James another couple of free throws and he he slipped on the Baseline and Mike James was yelling at Trey white like theres nobody on me because the defender was laying on the ground and he got it to him and by the time he got the ball he was fouled Mike James now four for four from the line James with eight points here in the early going to lead the cards and a chance to Tire this one up with 730 left to play but K go back thats where were going to see Dennis Evans thats going to be I think from game one to game 10 or 11 hes going to get to going to put him in pick and roll right exactly now he can make up for some of it with his reach hes going to be able to make up some ground a couple of steps at flection by James but Brown is able to retrieve it for the retrievers 12 on the shot clock and were going to turn over here steps call to Anthony Ace Valentine who just checked in the game hes he would never get credit for that but that whole possession there Mike James doing a great job and again the turnover coming off the guy away from him but he was doing a great job of creating some havoc and then UNBC turns it over as they were getting down in the shot clock Ace Valentine a freshman from Baltimore Maryland who had that last turnover cards right now rebounding wise with a 168 Edge on the boards as Evans falls to the court Johnson looking for Huntley Hatfield posting up I mean white looking for Huntley Hatfield Whitefield white over to James in the corner drives in took a pretty big hit hes able to score in the paint double kind of taking this game over he has hes been Louisvilles best player so far double figures taking it to the bucket Brown in the paint over Huntley Hatfield gets it to go and brown is now in double figures with 10 points to lead the retrievers the sixth tie of the first half here with just over six minutes left to play JJ trainer will check in for Louisville the next dead ball Johnson into the paint takes the hit gets it up off the glass but cant get it to go took the head from hit from Ace Valentine Valentine into the lane again Johnson reaching for it but cant come up with it and Bryce Johnson with the three we said it earlier hit 57 for Chicago State last year and that is his first as a Applause retriever Johnson gets in the paint H Hatfield never really gather himself enough to get that up and then Bryce Johnson Beats everybody down the court and scores and Kenny payt has seen enough because UNBC leads the cards 3631 lead on Louisville you see Jim Ferry 10 nonconference wins last season that was a program record this is his third season he was not the coach when they beat Virginia in the NCW tournament but boy hes had quite a bit of success went to two NCW division 2 Elite eights at ad Deli he was once the interim head coach at Penn State in the 2020 21 season went 11 and 14 that year 7 and 12 in the Big 10 after pat Chambers had resigned 10 Seasons at Liu Brookland took them to the NCAA tournament twice and right now after two 18 and 14 Seasons at UNBC he has got the retrievers up five on Louisville in the first half trainer into the lane misses but Evans with the offensive rebound and looked like he lost it on the way up but its still wi it a little bit of a Im going to try to dunk it I cant get there Im just going to kind of finger roll and hope it goes in Den ss three for three now from the field and somebody lost Deion Brown inside yeah the cards not very good on defense right now its too easy for UNBC theyre 15 of 25 theyre four of seven from three but recently here theyre getting to the bucket Deon Brown and Bryce Johnson who just got that rebound both have 12 points to lead the retrievers here Johnson all the way to the lane and then flips it over his head and impressive he has 14 points and UNBC is up by seven skot Clark with his two personal fouls set the check in at the next dead ball for the Cs not quite the same without him out there no its not and and again defensively right now is where Louis although Tyler Johnson a rush shot on the last possession louisv will just not very good right now on the defensive end James Baseline he thought he was fouled but he loses the ball out of bounds and thatll be another turnover for the C their eighth turnover so far in the first half here as they Trail it 4033 the retrievers have hit their last seven shots theyre now shooting 62 from the field in this first Applause half CER Smith just drives right by Dennis s lays it up in and its a ninepoint game Applause to white white looks for the Triple cant get it to go another a rebound by Smith for the retriever here they come Scott Clark with his steel hes going to go all the way to the basket on Smith Miss lets him go and Clark misses it a valentine all the way to the basket and Evans able to affect him just enough for a miss getting a little ragged out here right now it is like street ball right now and uh were going to get Valentine with steal a foul on Trey white the body language does not look good for the cards right now they Trail by nine with 317 to play ball playoffs uh 110th season of mens basketball look at that record 1776 and 987s 73 winning seasons in the last 78 years impressive stuff for Louisville basketballs Ace Valentine hits the free throw to increase this UNBC lead to10 Jeff ROMs football team though ranked number 13 last week in the first college football playoff rankings all they did was they they came out and beat Virginia Tech 343 on Saturday after shutting out Duke last week well he should add a game thats going on right now with some success Lal women up 13 in their season opener at Cincinatti tonight so lots of success on the Louisville campus set this cards lineup Trey white with the ball right now drives into Canario Smith Mike James JJ trainer Emanuel aor for and sky Clark on the court for the cards trainer with five on the shot clock four three James is going to have to shoot it he does hit the rim but thats about all it did and here comes Ace Valentine and the retriever is looking to build on this lead emu with the pullup triple and he drains it goodness gracious The Freshman with no fear Frank Emu from Mansfield Texas pulls up and hits the three and off just like that its a 14 a 172 run for UNBC to increase this lead to 13 a quar for on the Baseline gets his own rebound and puts it up an in again sky Clark when Louisville has had success on the offensive end its sky Clark and Tyler Johnson getting into the paint and making something happen just like they did there Louisville had gotten away from that for quite while Smith trying to drive on a COR of four kind of Fall Away lefthanded shot comes off training with a rebound but that is going to be a foul on Dion Brown and trainer is going to get some free throws and you see Louisville women up 6451 and the fourth quarter 512 left in the fourth quarter there at Cincinnati the cards ranked 17th in womens basketball mentioned the global Jam that Emanuel Lor for played in the UFL women played there as well came home with a gold medal JJ trainer trying to cut into this UMBC lead 4635 just under two minutes to play and trainer will get two free throws here his first one bangs off the back of the rim JJ was a 73 free throw shooter last season he is 0 for two from the line so far tonight missed the back end of a threepoint play ear misses this one off the front of the R so make that 0 for three for JJ and early one from the line and CS down 11 with under two to play in the first half Bry Johnson leads them with 14 points number 23 luroy misses the tip in there and Mike James comes up with a rebound a core for all by himself James gets it to him but a qu for cant finish he gets his rebound and puts it back up in in yeah very active there he gets up on that second jump quick he is on on he he did he kind caught in between a little bit on the first one but a good job from a COR four luroy into a COR four and then up and in for the pen transfer and its 4837 the first two points for their grad transfer from Pennsylvania 69 230 big Applause body Clark the trainer in the corner for three and that is the first triple of the night for the Cardinals their first three in eight tries and theyre down eight with under a minute to play Bry Johnson of the basket misses and a COR for with the rebound and the cars a chance to get even closer here they will have to shoot about 12se second difference between the game clock and the shot Applause CL Trey White with a lot of contact and then he he was able to get a hand on it wow goodness gracious and Deon Brown thinking lur Lloyd was Jerry Rice who was going to run that one down all right L will have a chance to get one more shot here Jody 227 seconds left theyre down eight they have made a little bit of a comeback here in the last couple minutes yeah and were going to get to Trey Whites just two of six it looks like hes rushing things out there hes kind of for forcing things a little forcing the issue were going to get Curtis Williams in for the last 20 seconds we have seen a lot of Williams uh the guards look to get a good shot here to end the half on a positive note Curtis Williams may be a good candidate for a little spot up three the quarter for the screen for skot Clark he misses and L gloyd with the rebound and the CTS have left them enough time to get a shot off as well Valentine to Johnson a three from the top of the key misses and itll be 1 Point 206 Lille doing a good job 24 to 19 on the boards that was was a lot bigger of a gap early on and for Louisville I think you see one thing there Trey white two of six for some things and Brandon Huntley Hatfield 0 for two no points for Huntley Hatfield its going to be at the defensive end where the cards are going to have to get back in this and right off the bat a Miss three and Trey white uh is able to come up to the loose ball and Scott Clark pushes it all the way up gets all the way to the basket and Marcus panks Jr had to do the Olay and let him go there because he has three personal fouls picked up three personal fouls gets in and up and over Dennis Evans as he runs the floor and scores as were talking about him to increase the lead back to eight so the cars with the same starting fight we saw start the game skot Clark Mike James Trey white Brandon Huntley Hatfield and Dennis Evans skot Clark and Brandon Huntley Hatfield each with two personal fouls for the cards in the first half James had 11 points and he did a lot of that he was aggressive offensively and he draws the foul there on Bryce Johnson and look heres Lille lville comes up with the loose ball there gets it out and and sky Clark in transition gets the bucket Louisvilles got to force the issue theyve got to do more of that and theyve got to come up with more of those loose balls can that was a second personal foul on Bryce Johnson and Mike James will go to the line to shoot two five for five from the line in the first half then a team High 11 points and now six for six from the line and 12 points for Mike James cards within seven if they can put a little run together this crowd is kind of waiting to explode they they want to see something something positive out of this team Jamess first most free throw of the night and its a sevenpoint lead Johnson fakes the three steps inside the line and then Dennis Evans with a rejection on Deon Brown sap Baseline on James and then Brown has the ball knocked away from behind and here comes sky Clark guards pushing a little bit Trey Whites going to get all the way to the basket theres reverse up and in thats the Trey white we know he can get to the bucket make some things happen Louisville again though making that happen on the defensive end and getting back on defense there Johnson wanted to shoot it quick lural Lloyds going to try and go over Huntley Hatfield and he rejects it he looks more engaged tonight as he goes down Scott Clark to drive the basket the crowd is in full throat and the cards are within three and again its getting it out getting going getting something on defense and then Trey white just attacking thats what he is brought here to do from Kenny Payne is to score and attack and Louisville gets back in this theyre down three as Trey white and sky Clark with some buckets here early in the second half and the cards have got something going down three yeah really good first couple of minutes of the second half for Trey white he hes the one that got it started coming up with the loose ball on the uh on the defensive end that got sky Clark the first bucket and then hes got two baskets and now hes going to try to convert a threepoint play and pull the cards within two white one for two from the line so far he has nine points is he get him to double figures if he can hit it and he misses it but almost an offensive rebound for Louisville but light comes up with the steel and then throws it away trying to get it to I thought he threw it away but Hunley hfield runs it down and then white retrieves it ping bong there ping bong ball there as Trey white takes it to the bucket he misses that one Louisville active on the boards though getting their hands on a number of balls Johnson with a Miss three Huntley Hadfield the rebound and as you can see that white when he lets the game come to him a little better than when he forces it weve seen him force it a little bit try to get in the lane pound his dribble a little bit how about the turnaround jumper for the big fou Evans no but Hy has the rebound and hes going to have a chance to complete a 3 Point play and that will be the fourth personal foul on Marcus Banks Jr as well and Hatfield Huntley Hatfield crashing the boards actually getting good position against the much smaller Banks and is just in great position thats all it is it takes thats all it takes for this card team to get a spark is to do the little things as coach Payne has been preaching Hunley Hatfield a chance to get them to even after just a little over 2 minutes here down eight at the half and that was the third team foul also in the early going here on UNBC Hunley Hatfields free throw off the back of the rim and still a onepoint lead for the retrievers of UMC Marcus Banks Jr by the way did go to the bench with those four fouls Marlin short in for them Bryce Johnson little out of control but does get it up off the glass and misses Here Comes Mike James and the cars with a chance to take the lead James all the way t takes the hit and score and again where did that start the defensive end to the floor Huntley Hatfield getting a hand on the ball creating the cards to get the ball and get it going and Mike James converting our 12th lead change of the night Mike James foued by Frank emu the freshman and James will go to the line Mike James with 14 points already here tonight he is 6 for seven from the line that was the third personal on U CS in front 5150 boy have they flipped the script out of the locker room Jody and theyve done it by being much more aggressive offensively they are going right to the basket they have but look you you talk about the defens the defens its so easy for Louisville or it was so easy for UNBC late in the first half Louisville has just turned up the defensive pressure theyre getting their hands in the passing Lane theyre being very active and again theres Scott Clark again cutting it off Deion Brown the pass on the Baseline amorco Lloyd back over to Brown and Evans cant come up with it and the little guy inside Deon Brown gets the offensive rebound again and hell go to the line have a chance to put the retrievers back in front and snap what is right now a 100 Louisville run and there is something right there that Louisville the other players that play with Dennis Evans are going to have to learn Trey white draws the foul there trying to block the shot when had he let Brown shoot that ball going to get thrown to the other end of the floor by Dennis Evans Browns free throw off the back of the rim and that was by the way the third personal foul on Trey white hes been obviously pretty key to whats been going right for the cards as white will head to the Louisville bench with those three personals 1652 still here to play as some foul trouble starting to creep into this one Marcus Banks Jr already on the ret retrievers bench with his four personal fouls and U that was his third personal foul just a second ago as well 5251 louisv leads it sky Clark Curtis Williams who we havent seen uh score just yet tonight Dennis Evans JJ trainer and Mike James on the court Williams tries to get it to Evans and Evans couldnt come up with it brown down the lane takes a bump from James and then is able to score and put UNBC back in front 53 52 something tells me there might be a few more lead changes in the last 16 minutes of this one Applause Jody aage the screen a nice catch and then he misses the easy one at the basket almost looked like he could have dumped it maybe I dont know after went under the basket it looked kind of awkward I catch I think he had such a like a weird angle under the basket I dont think he could have dunked it and thats saying something with his reach but he just got kind of caught in between and kind of an awkward look oh Lal lyd off the give and go Dion Brown again Evans not doing anything to hold up brown off that cut and brown with an easy layup and just like that is 5552 UNBC downon brown with 17 points right now for the retrievers and were going to get a block and Im not sure that might not have break for Curtis Williams cuz looked like he extended his arm but hell get hell get the foul and thats already the fifth personal foul on the retrievers they L it 50 number 13 Miami coming out that final four run last year with Donal yanovich whos on the Louisville roster played a little bit the first step they lead 7244 on NJIT Syracuse an eightpoint lead on New Hampshire North Carolina Jody getting a game from Radford and the number two Blue Devils in action at 900 on the ACC Network against dartman you never know whats going to happen on opening night first first couple weeks as uh cards 5552 Trail UNBC here saw yanovich on the Louisville bench Louisville ball 1537 to play and out of the timeout Kyler Johnson and Curtis Williams just not on the same page there and an unforced error for the cards two turnover two turnovers and a missed shot for uh Curtis Williams so far in limited minutes its not been the debut that he was hoping for Lis shooting 63 here in the second half and UNBC just 33 after shooting 54 the first half luroy has a shot rejected by a flat footed a COR for then inside almost another offensive rebound by James Yanks it away and here comes Tyler Johnson by the way something to keep an eye on Deon Brown has 17 points to lead the retriever his career high is 21 we still have 15 minutes left to play here Louisville not the same team without skot Clark on the floor in the first half Tyler Johnsons pass un a qu for cant come up with Applause Music Applause it Ace Valentine to short who goes Baseline on trainer 13 on the shot clock Valentine in the corner and another triple for Devin sap that is his third of the night and UNBC has answered that Louisville run with a run of their own the Cs have had three turnovers on their last four possessions and they find themselves down six Johnson all the way to the basket for two yeah I mean Louisville can do that pretty much anytime they want theyve gotten away from it at times but when Louisville is attacking the basket on offense theyre getting easy buckets its pretty simple work Lloyd to short thatll be a foul out front on Tyler Johnson and this not the only Louisville basketball game going on tonight Jody the UFL women were in action as well up in Cincinnati yeah they went 7759 a couple of transfers leading the way Sydney tayl Sydney Taylor was 16 points and J curry with 13 as the Cardinals get a victory again in the opening night of the womens season as well 7759 on the road theyll open the home season coming up this Sunday against the all here at the Yum CER five straight Elite eights for Jeff walls and the U women what a run its pretty remarkable couple final fours in there as well Ace Valentine the Dion Brown Deon Brown has been the star of the night for them 13 points Marlin short in the paint and the former division two player gets that up and in sixpoint lead again for UNBC about 13 and 1 12 minutes left to play in the kfcm center Tyler Johnson to the basket didnt even where to go with it but kicks it out to JJ trainer for three and then Johnson the offensive rebound and the follow the put back there for Johnson as the guards continue to do a good job thats 12 offensive rebounds Sapp got a good look at a three in the corner and he missed it has not done much of that tonight Mike James all the way to the basket for two and he looks like he can do that anytime he wants to 17 for Mike James hes been Louisvilles best and most consistent player tonight and hes played the most minutes youre going to get rewarded when youre playing a good game 17 points and seven rebounds for James card back within two brown with 17 points to lead the retrievers over to Valentine to short 10 on the shot clock he runs into Tyler Johnson and that will be a block on Johnson itll only be the fourth team foul on the cards second and he looks like hes a little got hit shaken up in the face yeah just kind of his lip skot Clark back in the game for Tyler Johnson cler with six points and two assists for Louisville so far tonight Banks Jr and his four fouls back in the game James uh I think he might have got him with the body a little bit he did get a lot of ball with both hands but um garus Smith went up for that one had the inside position got the nice pass from Banks Jrs J by Curtis Williams and then a decent amount of contact there Ill send cadarius Smith to the line for two yeah he got a little body there a little extra push from Mike James kadary Smith the transfer the grad transfer from USC Upstate where he started 15 games last last year and was just a 51 free throw shooter oh fans hope he doesnt live up to that percentage here as hes already missed the first UNBC with a 6058 lead with 1248 to play and he does just that to increase the lead to three it was like the reverse announc or Jinx sky Clark he kind of lost it when he went up he had a a free trip of the basket but hell draw a foul and get a couple free throws when we return here are we hor it thats five on Bank he just fouled out with 12 and A2 minutes left yeah I thought it was Banks he just blew by him again not a great debut for the former Odessa College star and he had 22 points at Western Carolina a couple years ago uh he was in the yeah he was on the soan all freshman team so hes going to foul out here and I never even got to get in that he played at the same high school as Allen Iverson but right now two point two points heads the bench five fouls in five minutes not not a great debut but hell send sky Clark to the line for a couple of free throws hes two for four from the line so far tonight six points two assists one rebound Clarks free throw off the back of the rim and cards just 11 of 22 from the line now one of 10 from three and 11 of 22 from the line for this Louisville team Clark misses that one but again another offensive rebound a COR for is just more active than anybody about Curtis Williams all the way to the basket for his two first two points as a card to get them back within one oh my gosh cadarius Smith did everything would make it and then a corter for it with the rejection and Bryce Johnson for three goodness gra Louis Louis tracked it down and a COR for blocked it right to the de to the uh offensive guy a COR for the offensive Rebound in the basket he just kind of makes things happen at both ends caner Smith off that Miss dunk and he says Ill try the triple and he hits the three from straightway and the lead is back to Applause five that is half the number of threepointers he hit last season at USC Upstate just two for 12 so Im sure Louisville was fine with him shooting that one but it looked pretty good for the lefthander James to the basket takes the hit from Bryce Johnson hell go to for some more free throws UNBC leading at 6762 with 1128 to play the Atlantic Coast Conference going to look a little different starting in 2024 some new additions Kent Taylor and jod demling here courtside at the kfcm center California and Stanford from the Pack 12 and SMU joining next year as well yeah its going to be create a uh a much different look for the ACC conference and again its going to be interesting to see the scheduling and how it all works out we know how football is going to work out now the the basketball and the other sports I mean its going to be a lot of fun to see those schools kind of join the fold and then uh and see how it plays out for everyone in the competition level Stanford obviously one of the most dominant Sports programs in the country uh winning that directors cup year after year Mike James to the line cards down five 1128 to play games with 17 points thats team high for the cards hes the only U player in double figures he is seven of eight from the line hell get two free throws here and make it eight of nine hes really the only UFL player whos actually shot well from the line they are now 12 of 24 from the line and hes eight for nine make it N9 for 10 and its a threepoint game with 1128 left to play as James will get a quick breather Trey white back in with his three personal Applause fouls Bryce Johnson and Deon Brown both with 17 points for the retrievers number 13 number 23 cadarius Smith has been looking for his offense lately and he takes a challenged shot over Dennis Evans gets the offensive rebound scores and draws the foul on the big Applause Music fella see the the replay of this one down low as Dennis EV good job in position in position forces a b hes got to get a body on him and box him out hor is a bad shot and then just doesnt get a body Canary Smith the 50 free throw shooter at USC up State misses the free throw cant complete the threepoint play but he did increase the lead to five here with 11 minutes to go in the KFC Im Center Scott Clark Trey white Brandon Huntley Hatfield Dennis Evans and Curtis Williams on the court for the cards Music Applause Hunley hfield tried to lob it to Evans but the retrievers knock it away and they get the advantage and brown just goes right to the basket and scores he now has 19 points and they lead it by seven PNY pays going to call time Applause out this the Cardinals Trail 7 164 to UMBC the holidays are at the Home Depot and our aisles are decked with savings so you can deck it all the Halls the yard and even deck the deck all while stuffing a little more joy into your stockings now at the Home Depot back here at the KFC hson are Louisville trailing UNBC 7164 1033 to play Kent Taylor and jod demy court side and and Jody l has looked better in the second half fair to say but theyve only managed to cut one point off of this UNBC League at times you like some things that Lova was doing but still theres just too many little mistakes I mean the cards 13 of 25 from the line one of 10 from three theyre not shooting it well and way too many easy buckets for UNBC the kick on Dion Brown up front so shot clock at 20 now 1026 to play Mike James back in the game for Louisville he has has been unquestionably their best player tonight with his 19 points and seven rebounds and the only card shooting it well from the line N9 for 10 Jody mentioned it they are 13 for 25 from the line in this game trainer crosscourt pass to James to Clark Five on the shot clock Huntley Hatfield to James with three on the shot clock just barely grazes the rim and Clark comes up with it for the cards trainer will try a three thats off sap cant come up with it white Applause does white with eight rebounds for Louisville 10 on the shot clock far gets in the paint the Up and Under cant get it to go Huntley Hatfield battling Clark for the rebound and were going to get what a foul on Huntley Hatfield did he foul Clark looked like he did foul Clark but Brown went to the ground Music his third foul after picking up two in the very early going so just his third personal foul the sixth team foul on the cards Louisville is in the bonus UNBC with seven team fouls and the possession arrow to Louisville as they Trail by seven with 9 and 1 12 minutes left to play karus Smith been looking for his offense quite a bit of length Marlin short to Bryce Johnson he has 17 points gets all the way to the basket Trey white with the challenge and then the late whistle on the Baseline I I think it and thatll be the fourth personal on Trey white it was a I think it was a foul but that is the latest whistle youll ever get Jeff getting that late whistle is it it well maybe it wasnt a foul he got a little bit of a he did have a little bit of a forearm in the back Im not sure if it was enough to I mean he and Kenny pay really getting after him you dont see Kenny Payne getting after an official a whole lot but hes really really getting after him here as uh again it was just such a late whistle thats the thing that makes it look bad there was probably contact there but the whistle came after Louisville already had the ball and looked like they were going the other end we get Tyler Johnson in for Troy white so he goes to the bench 922 left with his four personal fouls and the cards down eight and could be nine so down eight when Johnson when Trey white goes out with 920 left in the game and His Four personal Music fouls sky Clark and James they both done a good job at getting to the basket hle Hatfield the lob to trainer and when he threw it Jody I wasnt sure JJ was going to be able to get it but he climbed the ladder yeah JJ could get that one he couldnt dunk it but he at least gets it in and a good look there from Huntley Hatfield cards a b or two away from getting this crowd up Johnson with the deflection but they cant come up with it look lyd on the Baseline got the size advantage and he goes over James cant get it to go and then trainer tries to one arm the rebound cant get it James inside does get the rebound and the cards down six and a chance to cut in to this retrievers lead possession where you dont want to force something if youre Louisville Clark and James both can get the bucket whenever they want to trying to figure out a way to attack this two3 Zone and they get hle atfield on the Baseline for the short jumper and he converts its four trips in a row Huntley Hatfields been active down there on the offensive side Brown all the way to the basket and thatll be a jump ball and the possession arrow is pointing towards the Cardinals so theyll get the ball back down four with 808 to play and the crowd now starting to get involved yeah and Hunley Hatfield involved in some positive plays for L hes affecting the game has affected the game for the last two minutes for this loyal team on both ends of the Applause floor cards maybe have figured a few things out going up against this two3 Applause Zone Traer the screen for Johnson trainer in the middle of that clock looking for him gets it to train he turns and kicks over to James for three and that one is off Hunley hfield with the pushup and the offensive rebound that was a twohanded shove James to draw the foul on lar Lloyd hell be shooting two free throws when we return but right now the Cardinals cut it to within four as JJ Trader with a bucket from Huntley Hatfield himself a night the U sophomore already with 19 points tonight just five away from his career high of 24 and hes kind of doing it all 19 points eight rebounds he is hes getting to the basket hes making his free throws like nobody else to this Louisville team is and heres the one thing he has drawn seven fouls as he is going to the line right here for two shots with 739 left to pull the Cardinals within but uh yeah he is his teammates are four of 15 four of 15 from the line Mike James nine of 10 though and a chance to hit a couple more here and I dont know we had a sub what just happened they didnt Frank oh a late I think a late sub Frank U trying to check in there I guess theyll let him come in after the first free throw Devin sap to the bench Bram The Freshman guard checks in leue scores for them Deion Brown number 13 with 19 points and Bryce Johnson number 23 with 18 points kadary Smith number 11 has 10 but not in the game at the moment and James knocks in both free throws cards within two 7 and a half to play he has 21 the deflection but right ground and then in the corner to a move for three and he hit it and a good job by Mike James with active hands right at Mid Court getting the deflection and once again for the third time this happened oh Clark went up and he had the wide open layup but he kicks it to Johnson for three and he matches a mo The Freshman guards with backto back triples and the cards are back within two and the cards with a little pressure here as they try to force a little something and JJ trainer going to get called for the foul on Marlin short and thatll put short to the line Clark he went up and then he had a wide openen layup but he kicks it over to Johnson for the Triple in the corner and he hits it he hit one of those thats that might be his spot you know kir had the corner Tylers hit a couple of Threes so far uh hit one in the exhibition game from that same spot Marlin short to the line for one and one a 76 free throw shooter at division two Stannis lost safe last season and that one was hard off the back of the rim and Huntley Hatfield with a rebound and the cards a chance to tie or take the lead with seven minutes to go on opening night of the college basketball season rebound number eight for Huntley Hatfield so much more active in this second half for the Big Fellas Johnson gets into the paint which is something Kenny Paynes been preaching James gets into the paint gets all the way to the basket and scores he has 23 points and we are all tied at 75 and here comes the crowd everybody on their feet the cars look for a defensive stop and lco Lloyd in the paint and gets the little jump hook to go over Huntley Hatfield Applause Music Applause back to manto man Tyler Johnson drives and that foul will be on Bryce Johnson thatll be his fourth personal Tyler Johnson with a good second half here seven points two rebounds and two assists for the night he does have a couple fouls but just one turnover in the 15 minutes and that was early in the game one of the first couple minutes that he was in depth could come into play here in the last couple minutes as Johnson misses the free throws going to need to hit some free throws to win this game but uh the retrievers have already lost one starter Marcus Banks Bryce Johnson now with four personal fouls he has 18 points tonight as Johnson knock to the second free throw to get Louisville back within one now the cards are going to have to hit free throws if you hit free throws so far just a few of them this is a different game Deion Brown guarded by Tyler Johnson heres lur gloyd to Bryce Johnson amood is short karus Smith set to check in the next dead ball for the retrievers AMU the jumper kind of fallway Jumper after taking a bump from Clark not a great shot James all the way to the basket on L Lloyd l l Lloyd With The Block there there was a lot of contact and another block for ly Music deloyd heru in the corner to Bryce Johnson for three and the Chicago State transfer quiets the crowd and gives the retrievers a fourpoint lead cards aggressive going to the Applause basket Tyler Johnson gets it up and scores Max Lura ly 34 block shots last season at pen had two on that last possession for Louisville back to a twopoint game round to Lloyd Clark goes straight up but lco Lloyd does draw the foul take a look at the defense by Max lco Lloyd the grb transfer from pen hes not in the ivy league anymore but hes blocking shots in the kfcm center then Bryce Johnson from the corner for the Triple and UNBC maintains this lead luroy a 55 free throw shooter at pen last season misses the first of two k it just seems like every time you think Louisville is going to either get even or Draw ahead they come through with a big three on the other end 10 of 18 from three for Music UNBC this UNBC team they did it they had it one exhibition game against forom a game they lost by Four Points lyd hits the second free throw to finish sixth in the America East conference but right now they have a threepoint lead on Louis no matter what happens here tonight this would not be the biggest upset in UNBC history Trey uh Trey white yeah exactly Trey white back in forl four fouls see if he can affect the game here in the last five minutes Mike James getting a breather hell be back out there in just a minute I am sure of that Hunley Hatfield fight for the ball with Canary Smith hes got position in the post in to him as aggressive as maybe weve ever seen him he draws the foul on Canary is Smith and Huntley Hatfield will get a couple of free throws but the cards are going to have to hit some free throws down the stretch if they want to get out of here with a win so far tonight 16 of 29 from the line yeah 16 of 29 for the line from the team Mike James uh himself is 11 of the go well Huntley atfield 0 for one so far hell get two shots here and a CH to draw the cards closer and he misses Applause it 75 free throw shooter last year but 0 for two so far tonight 16 of 30 and you can talk about all the different factors you want thats just concentration maybe a little tired um 8179 twopoint game four and a half to play Deion Brown guarded by skot Clark CS with skot Clark Tyler Johnson JJ trainer Trey white Brandon Huntley Hatfield kin Sapp looked like he walk and the officials agree shrug his pivot foot a little bit there and the cards will get the ball down two with 420 to play kind of a little bit of a jump stop where his foot wouldnt stop he just kept going see if Louisville can convert here again attacking the basket thats when theyve been their best clar all the way of the basket for the dunp just like that h a little hung a little but were all tied at 81 and here comes that crowd again if the cards can get a stop here and almost looked like Canario Smith might have taken an extra step but boy he is aggressive on the offensive end and gets that lefthanded shot over Huntley Hatfield and in to give the retrievers a twopoint lead again Tyler Johnson to the basket drows the foul cant get the basket to go but hell have a couple free throws to tie and skyt Clark hes going sky here Sky High for Scott clark3 81 lead on Louisville Mike James having himself tonight one point away from his career high he already has a career high nine rebounds and its hit a careerhigh 11 free throws but unfortunately hes the only car hitting free throws Tyler Johnson to the line to attempt two here hits the first one lville shooting 59 from the field in the second half of this game they were down eight at the half and Tyler Johnson as we see Mike James on the bench right now Tyler Johnson ties us up with two free throws and were all noted at 83 our ninth tie of the night and again Here Comes This Crowd they want to see a Louisville win Deon brown with 19 points number 13 for the retrievers Kers white has been aggressive offensively the last few possessions Marlon short seven on the shot clock short double team over to Bryce Johnson in the corner and a threepointer from Dion Brown and he has equaled his career high with that triple and put the retrievers back up by three late in the shot clock with that triple good job on the defensive end there for Louisville until the final couple seconds and hes just getting a little bit of an opening there they are 11 of 19 from three Louisville just two for 14 JJ trer the follow slam and the cards are back within one you need to do it at this end though sap three wide open off the back of the rim Hunley Hadfield the good box out and lvs got a chance to take the lead with two and A2 minutes left to play 10th rebound for Huntley Hatfield hes been a Difference Maker on the glass in the second half Scott Clark Tyler Johnson Brandon Huntley Hatfield Trey white back in the game with his four fouls hell get the pass and down the lane hes oh he misses the basket but hell get a chance to give the cards the lead at the line with 224 left to play thats a great little Twan action there uh as we see the threepointer here in the corner from Brown and then the answer for Louisville JJ trainer flying in for the dunk then on this possession h a little Twan action there between sky Clark and Trey white theyve known each other for a long time theyre actually playing pretty well together for the first time uh uh uh here this season in uh really like what I saw there as Trey white hits the free throw and again this game is going to come down to Louisville and hitting free throws cards 20 of 34 20 of 34 from the line white now two for four he has 10 points and eight rebounds a chance to get to 11 and if he does he will give Louisville a onepoint lead with 224 left to play here and he does just that Louisville up 87 86 their first lead since 1652 after they open the second half with that big run now theyre going to need to buckle down and get a stop here at this end Bryce Johnson doubled kicks it over and another rebound for James that gives him a double double on the night the cars with a chance to extend the lead less than two to play Tyler Johnson all 12 of his points in the second half hes the one in control with sky Clark out there these two guys really running the show well right now for Louisville and the rever when they play manto Man Louisville has been pretty much getting the basket at will and skot Clark does just that and he does just that skot Clark an easy bucket there to give Louisville a threepoint lead here Scott Clark now in double figures with 10 points Louisville by three 8986 a 60 Run for the Cs Brown goes Baseline and hes going to be called for the offensive foul Jim Ferry does not agree with it but itll be Lou of the ball with 130 left and the cards have taken this game over in the last couple minutes his 60 run as theyve had four of their last five field goals were going to get a little timeout here this crowd now fully into the game Louisville up three with 130 to play the Cardinals have coming have come back strong here as Im sorry I was watching Jim Ferry get on the officials heres the strong move from sky Clark to the bucket again he can get to the bucket pretty much anytime he wants and they has done that just then cards with fifth of 50 838 Advantage points in the paint and they they need it because theyre not hitting anything from the outside cars is two for 14 from outside and the retriever 11 for 21 on a night when they honored Hall of Fame head coach Denny crumb by making his seat black here permanently in his AFC Im Center big games coming up for the yeah the first night of the college basketball season tonight but look at these matchups I mean weve got the State Farm Champions classic there Duke in Michigan State will take on Texas November 19th in the Empire classic Kentucky and Miami and Duke in Arkansas thats the ACC SEC challenge coming up later this month what a month its going to be in college basketball and again tonight starts it all off and theres a ton of games around the country tonight a lot of as Im looking through some scores a lot of really close games k and weve got a good one here this Louisville team with three straight home games to tip off the season hoping to build a little confidence uh theyll be back home on Friday night against chattan the next Wednesday against cof State before they head to New York for that Empire classic but uh still a little work to do here tonight against UNBC Jim f team L it by eight at the half but Louisville has outscored him by 11 in the second half so far and with 130 left the play as hes a little fired up the crowd into it 8986 Lille with the lead Mike James sky Clark Tyler Johnson Trey white and Brandon Huntley Hatfield on the court for the cards get a foul in the back court and I think thatll be the fifth on Bryce Johnson it will be and its going to send Mike James whos 11 of 12 from the from the line tonight to the free throw line a lot of things bad for UNBC on that play Johnson fouls out he has 21 points second only to Browns 22 and hes going to send Mike James the one UFL player whos hit free throws tonight to the line Mike James 11 of 12 from the line if he hits both of these hell have a career high 25 points 128 left the play Louisville up three hes been such a good player tonight for Louisville weve heard in the off season about the jump that he has made as James makes that hes now 12 of 13 weve heard about the jump that hes made as far as what he has done in the off season and youre seeing it tonight he is just such more of a confident player and this is the healthy Mike James this season the third time hes had 24 points but the first time hes had 25 points in a game as a Louisville Cardinal a new career high for Mike James a double double 25 points 10 rebounds 9186 Louisville trying to get another stop and were going to get oh goodness a block on Tyler Johnson and looked to me like he may have been set from my vantage point well have to look at it again thats going to send Deon Brown lets just see this one here Tyler Johnson SL sliding over he moved into that that was a good call that was a good call he just he got there in time but he was leaning back so a good call there Deon Brown to the line he already has equaled his career high he already has a career high 22 points as he misses the first free throw a 77 free throw shooter last season but just two for five from the line so far Applause tonight hits the second one a fourpoint game and here comes the pressure from the retrievers almost another foul there from Mamu would have sent James back to the line all right 20 on the shot Applause clock 15 on the shot clock for the csbc back to manto man and when theyve gone manto man they cannot stay in front of Clark but he got to the basket they had nobody to pass it to in the corner and the pullup three is is off the back of the rim see if the cards can get the rebound kader Smith goes up for it short down the lane loses the ball out of bounds and can they review that were going to we have 497 seconds left and Kenny Paynes going to take a time out well see it here on the B says they are going to review it lets take a look I couldnt tell Tyler Johnson looked to me like just watching it live I thought Tyler Johnson was the one who tried to back tip it and was off of his hand but I couldnt one more more look at it he short driving that may have gone off of him last but then Im not sure its hard to tell if James got his finger off I dont know that we have anything inclusive here its going to be UNBC ball 17 seconds on the shot clock 497 on the game clock L will a fourpoint lead and Jody here this team is 11 of 21 from three and thats the last thing you want to give up here yeah that is the last thing you do not want to give up a threepointer here Johnson has fouled out but youve got brown and emu with two a piece Smith has one brown throwing it in he is their leading score very high 23 points Brown is going to shoot it it looks like goes by Scott Clark Clark with the foul and brown the basket and he couldnt give up the three and you couldnt foul him either and hes cut it to two and a chance to cut it to one he has a careerhigh 25 Five Points so far tonight hes three for six this is just a kind of brown this was a get it back to Deon Brown let him get a shot you knew what he was going to do he was going to keep it keep it and Sky just got caught a little bit no mans land back here live Brown hits the free throw and it is a onepoint game with 423 seconds left some token pressure from short and the cards are going to have to shoot it so about 12se second difference between the game clock and the shot clock in a huge possession for Louisville screen for Clark from Huntley Hatfield hes got a smaller man on him Clark to the basket he draws the foul on cerus Smith and Scott Clark will get two free throws with 247 seconds left but just two for two for six tonight so he has been the one that has struggled for Louisville a lot of guys struggling but he really has had a hard time goodness some tension in the air everything this fan base has been through an 09 start last year three straight onepoint losses to start the season last year and now another white knuckler down to the last couple seconds Sky Clarks first free throw is off the back of the Run of no good two for seven now from the line but at least a chance to make it a twopoint game with 247 seconds left and the thing is the only Tyler Johnson in the lane for Louisville right now is a little surprising but Clark does hit the second free throw and the lead is two were going to get trainer back in now for Huntley Applause Hatfield sack to throw it in he has three threes so far tonight Deon Brown has two and 26 points Brown all the way to the basket and were all tied up with 18 seconds left the play and one final possession for Louisville well should they choose to hold it Trey white goes right to the basket the l oh my goodness I dont know what happened there Trey whitec a chance to tie it short Baseline Canario Smith gets it up on the basket with 24 seconds left he draws the foul hes going to get two free throws and sky Clark is going to foul out here and I dont know the other end of the basket holy cow Trey white rushing things forcing things just completely out of control and then he just takes it away from a moo and lobs it up I dont know if he lobbed it up or I dont know if that was a shot or a lob but trainer throws it down and cadarius Smith right now to the line Jody he is one for three from the line
