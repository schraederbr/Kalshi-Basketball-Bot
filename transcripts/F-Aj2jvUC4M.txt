that is probably right at the top of the list for freshman of the Year alongside Dukes file Kyle filipowski he is a phenomenal Talent having an outstanding freshman year for Syracuse Judah mints a guy that committed originally out of Oak Hill Academy to play here at 10 he plays in the zoo for the first time in his career we are underway on senior day here in the Oakland Zoo Pittsburgh Pennsylvania the atmosphere that has been created because of the success that this bit team has had and were going to get into it they were lined up out here long hour before this game started Juda mens takes the first shot for the orange misses long rebounded by Jesse Edwards though hes one of the best not only in the conference but the country and Joe Gerard misses the three hes one of the best at making those first possession here for Pitt averaging just to tick under 75 points per game this heavily senior Laden transfer Laden lineup three of them in a row just touched the ball into jamarius Horton hes a fourth transfer Jeff cable to a Gilmans run to put this unit together shot clock in seven Burton drains down the three and left the paper fly Applause and weve got an immediate whistle paper thrown onto the court and I think the referees right now are probably going to have the PA announcer address the crowd there it is nothing says college basketball like admonishing a bunch of 18 19 and 20 year olds to not throw anything on the court and then having the guy making the announcement get moved well they dont call it the Oakland Zoo for nothing but certainly right now for Syracuse its important for them to get out to a fast start in particular on the road in this environment and its who gets them out to a fast start Benny Williams knocks down the first shot hes in the starting lineup again today hes been in and out of it all season so too is Justin Taylor who makes his first career start five in Orange Jim Boeheim decidedly looking for a faster getgo than an early foul the First on judamins foreign Applause obviously anytime you play Syracuse how you attack their Zone theyre choosing early to put jamarius Burton at the foul line and have him attack from there and theyre rotating guys in out in and out but you must make good decisions when you catch it in that area The Zone has been out and cold for Syracuse this season metrically its one of Syracuses tougher Seasons defensively theyve given up a lot of Threes Nike sabandi missing rebounds Federico and Federico and then theres Burton running point now to Cummings and another rebound lost by Federico Federico and squeeze Ive got more when Pitt gets the ball back but it is a decidedly unique Advantage the way that Pittsburgh can attack the Zone because of the amount of ball handlers they have turnover for the orange how many teams the average more than four assists so you can have Nelly Cummings run your system yeah and its again their balance offensively uh their team that spreads it out so On Any Given night the four guys out on the court to go along with Federico Federico one of the better Rim protectors and defending big men uh in the country uh really is a reason why theyre a team thats sitting at the top uh second place and the ACC Burt With His Hands Extended just waiting for those passes to come in theres Federico rocking around all right so you put a guard at the freethrow line it gives you that because Federico can stay low and thats how you want to break down the Zone bar fake get it to The Sweet Spot which is in the middle and then go from there block for Federico sabandi out running right to the rim Pittsburgh with a great start at 72 on the home glass orange are one for their first three with a turnover that last block Williams has the only points still just two Mandy usually the Sixth Man here 22 in white he starts on senior day transfer out of Miami and Ohio Music Applause so much more versatile it really is and right now uh Syracuse having all kinds of problems when they break it down that way Pittsburgh doing a masterful job early on attacking the Syracuse Zone Panthers score for their first six on a sixnothing run Gerard with a quick trigger is fouled and three free throws forthcoming well Jeff Capel didnt tell his guys today we cant lose Joe Gerard so they did and this right here the spacing again look at of the spacing that pit has thats all set up you have Nelly Cummings and then on the other end Federico Federico a guy that should be on the off uh First Team all defensive uh Team for the ACC shop block leads their break Applause cannot say enough about the work that Jeff Capel did putting this group together and then not just building the roster but melder with the roster Gerard won for his first two hes got one more coming and really I think the Jeff capels talked about this and well get into this a little later but the job that his staff has done and you look at his resume right now pick 14th in the preseason poll not too many people thought that they would be in this position right now but a credit to the work they did in the off season and then I think adjusting really midseason they had to make some some changes in their lineups and really it has been a smooth ride for them getting that zone moving all over the place Corner three for Hinson Off the Bench rebounded by Burton thank you Im gonna step back 14 quarters tipped out and the orange trailing by five Applause its here three in Orange potential freshman of the year in the ACC was very good when these teams met the first time 24 points on 17 shots at the carrier door they gotta fix that JMA wire the stone there are some things that will never change by the way around and out Britain the horn Cummings wants a three and the best one has come over will offensive rebounds Second Chance opportunities early on Joel has been an issue for Syracuse Pittsburghs getting multiple opportunities off of misses and Jimmy and talked about this uh the lack of rebounding their struggles rebounding a really has hurt them early on in this game Syracuse down by its largest margin so it goes to Joe Gerard to cut into that the best offensive option this team has at just under 17 points a game and now look at how methodical Pittsburgh is against this Zone Greg Elliott gets a great look from three around now any word in that goal that you used the ball movement theyre doing an excellent job Pittsburgh out to a great start here a half game out of first in the Atlantic Coast Conference and a hell of ball oh boy nothing going right for Jim Boeheim in the Syracuse Orange at this point two for their first seven Pittsburgh is five for 11 here on Senior Day the orange and Jim behind today playing great almost WWE heels really getting the opens new ride on top the environment is going to be fantastic Malcolm Huckabee drawing of that glad to have you along with us its fun this time of year it is best time of the year right now were getting closer uh to that March Madness uh date and I tell you right now though pit the job that Jeff Capel has done with this bit program uh pick 14 coming into this uh theyre a team right now sitting a second place uh in the ACC standings should we get on the soapbox now or should we wait for a little bit later well Ill tell you right now you look at some of their numbers uh their wins you can also add Northwestern in there as well too NC State UVA and Miami top 25 wins still a little surprised theyre not in the top 25 themselves and right now Joe linardi has them as a Tennessee but certainly make no mistake about it the environment that Jeff Capel has created here along with the balance they have offensively and then I think you know theyre really underrated as a defense really phenomenal job its a pit team that you saw Nelly coming sitting in the center of that huddle the grad transfer from Colgate he said listen I want people to keep thinking about us as the 14th best team in the ACC I want people to think what theyve been thinking all year long keep us as the underdog keep underestimating us because this is a team that that counted down an hour hey were they left for dead on the side of the road but they got up they walked to the nearest gas station they called for help and then they went and bought a Maserati like this is incredible the way the Pitt has turned this thing around it really has and take a look at us the quad one wins and again at this time of the year we talk about this what does your resume look like and really pit you can put their resume up against really pretty much any team and again it matches up well Jeff Capel and staff though they dont want to talk about any of that theyre going theyre talking about going 10 they know this is not going to be an easy task against the Syracuse team thats really struggled the last couple of games he said look we cannot have any uh hiccups as were trying to close out this season all right so if you were watching the game just before us in your Syracuse fan we apologize North Carolina Victorious and Lacrosse lets show you more goals by another team Pittsburgh comes out they start five of their first time and this facing you can take a look from that area right there its facing an in Federico Federico a guy that leads Pitt and blocks getting the shot block and then they can get out in transition and get this round going thats something that Jim behind talked about but we must get off to a better spot a start in these games and the lack of rebounding for Syracuse continues to be an issue early in this game Second Chance opportunity for Pitt thats the reason why they have the early fivepoint lead best season for Jeff cable as the head coach his third head coaching job very successful at VCU extremely successful with the Griffin Brothers notably Blake Griffin at Oklahoma and then back to being an assistant in his alma mater from Mike krzyzewsky at Duke before taking the reins here at Pitt Music interesting for Syracuse you talked about Jimbo starting a different lineup to get a better start the same five start here at the under 16 media timeout no changes down bigger Music 11 and white playing in the teeth of this Zone here Pittsburgh putting a guard at the freethrow line for the most part its led to some good luck from Curry on the first one drops down for Applause Music Flint fifth in the ACC from deep and thats really again well what are you gonna do with that thats a deep a Beyond legitimens is there thats just Blake Henson knocking down a deep three theres an acrobatic move to keep that dribble Alive by Taylor Benny Williams knifing in left hand off the glass too strong Burton trying to beat the Zone down the floor unsuccessful in that effort but again so composed the rebound off of Jesse Edwards actually off of Pittsburgh that hits and triple and the ball movement early Joel has been really good for Pitt again thats a contested three and well thats what Pitt the problems that they pose they got four guys out on the court oh that could space you with their threepoint shooting ability Pittsburgh is not shy Panthers lead the ACC in three pointers attempted this year they are three away from the school record in mates Benny Williams with the triple for Syracuse I like that decision by Joseph Gerard as we take a look at the pit threepoint shooting last season to this season really is night day difference they really struggled shooting the ball last year Pittsburgh change the roster and this year they wanted a better threepoint shooting teams in the ACC get you some guys that can do it confidently rising in the corner an air ball I have to imagine that will not impact the ability to put it up the next time down the corner Gerard quick trigger that knocks down thats a tough shot one of the most difficult shot makers in college basketball Joseph Gerard you know it coming in you have to beat up on him and hes his ability to raise up over defenders and knock down contested shots really I appreciate that in his game just like that six nothing run the alley oops broken up shot clock halfway going rebound put back no one box down Henson with a tip back for Federico Laurence he would tell you on Twitter Federico two times definitely all main team and the corner heres Williams jump stopping the lane wildly Off the Mark Pittsburgh four on three stop and shoot from deep and that one you probably get at any point in the shot clock Blake hit me a little bit his team leads by four as we come on back to Western PA next Music we are the University of Pittsburgh forced in the Blue Collar city with gold standards were innovators researchers thinkers and healers are always reaching for New Heights there is no limit to what we can accomplish when we put our minds our hands our soul and spiritual Subway series menu just order by name or number Jeff cable looks so young back there in 2009 NCAA sweet 16 the very first time that Jeff Gable and Jim behind coached against each other Blake Griffin for Oklahoma actually hit his head on the backboard in that game fun fact Ive actually been dunked On by Paul Harris too who was in that first shot with Jim behind it was a harrowing experience you got a file next time man yeah that would not have ended well for one of us Music but Syracuse has lived from behind the threepoint line tonight three of their four mates changing up the starting lineup fourth unit this season and its the same unit thats out there again Benny Williams got his own Miss and then lost it getting fouled nothing wants to this tell you we are nine minutes into this game and Jim vanheim has played Five Guys well I think it looks like hes going to ride this lineup right here uh C gives the Freshman Taylor his first start and then Benny Williams has come out aggressive uh offensively in this game that time right there getting on the offensive glass and certainly the last two games coach behind has talked about uh really the struggles defensively in particular rebounding the ball looks like hes going to try to get an offensive unit out on the court you can see that can change things up and get them back in the win column on the road foul was on Federico Syracuse is coming off of that 18 point loss in Clemson most points allowed this season fell by 22 the game prior to that against Duke so trying to right the ship here and then possibly creates some momentum heading to the ACC tournament Gerard the long rebound because Malcolm I really think theres not a team in this league that you would look at next round of an ACC tournament and say yeah I feel comfortable playing them absolutely not its going to be an interesting ACC tournament and you know back to the change of lineup but the two guys that have been really consistent really three offensively Joseph Gerard been silent are those two guys you know theyre going to score a goal long with Jesse and Edwards in the paint but this right here that has been the problem for them but Ive been impressed Williams aggressive and again thats awful great ball movement great start uh for Benny Williams he has nine of Syracuses 17 Joe Gerard has the other eight it has been a twoman offensive show and after the great start by Pitt and that is a foul on the way to the bucket Federico heads to the line and right here again Jesse Edwards sees the double gives it up quick I think thats the key thing right there Joel A lot of times Biggs hold on to it too long he saw the double he knows Williams can knock it down and great ball movement again playing through Jesse Edwards I think one of the next things that Jesse Edwards development tonight at nine Eastern after our mens basketball doubleheader the nothing but net crew breaks down the day in the ACC with highlights and Analysis from all our mens games to look ahead to the best games on the schedule in the coming week as well thats coverage you can only find in one place thats right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Rico Federicos is 65 free Pro shooter six first half points he checks out first time we see the seven footer from the Canary Islands and Guillermo Diaz brown but that guy that just went to the bench you think is really the Difference Maker for Pitt this time I think hes the X Factor along with the twins uh they provided I think a great defense uh for this team and that right there you cannot execute postentry passing any better Joseph Gerard with the great pass but thats all set up a watch how Jesse Edwards seals we saw them working uh with uh coach red Autry and the other coaches out there working on their post seals you cant do it any better post seal and then the pass was on point found the First on Diaz Graham the taller of the two Diaz Graham twins so Edwards at 73 picks up all three points first lead for the orange here at 2019 its also great recognition right Federico is one of the best defenders in this league he checks out whats the first thing you do absolutely again thats Joseph Gerard making a great read Jesse Edwards again doing the rest by ceiling Burtons done great work at the freethrow line out to Hinson once a D3 hes now just one for his first seven coming off the bench today that goes to Syracuse I dont know what it does to your Rhythm Nike sabandi started today because its Senior Day Hinson Off the Bench which is abnormal you have to get used to something a little different yeah I think look senior night I think its more though right now Syracuse doing a better job Contender theyre cleaning up the defense of laughs remember uh the first really five minutes of this game Pitt was getting a lot of Second Chances heres Gerard looking for the alley it will be at just the alley the news thank you Pittsburgh trying to get back in and trying to get the Oakland Zoo back in it it is noticeably less Rowdy than it was about 15 minutes ago Applause you can hear a pin drop air ball rebound underneath curtain one bring in the noise Applause of rebound but he tipped it to jamarius Burton right here again off the Savannah Miss he knew he couldnt get it now some would say that might have been over the back on Benny Williams but nonetheless a break of four pit Burtons an 85 percent that gives him six points and Nelly Cummings checks back in the welltraveled Native Son of Pittsburgh began his collegiate career at Bowling Green State University Zumba transferred to Colgate where he did a great job running point for Matt langlo Squad played in the NCAA tournament now runs the ship here at Pittsburgh and Benny Williams is running the ship for Syracuse today boy sometimes all it takes is a little boost in confidence its the most aggressive Ive seen him play now Ive had a couple Syracuse games and hes locked in early on both ends and you see the ball go in you get a little bit more energy on this end of the fort which certainly is necessary quick trigger three for Elliott is Pittsburgh settling for easy more difficult threes or maybe two early threes but they are but credit Syracuse again it almost looks like theyre open but then Syracuse I think is doing a better job closing out that was an emphasis coming into this game thats a great job by Judah mins but he will end up with the foul thats a vowel yeah thats really uh they do I want him pick and pick up a file like that but again dont mind the aggression I think the biggest thing too of the Closeouts thats been problematic Clemson 143s uh in their win for Syracuse you know they work on closing out on the shooters in particular against his pitching throws it away I mean thats pretty awesome Jim behind is known for sometimes playing seven man rotations the first sub today came at the 824 mark was the first pit turnover by the way 12 minutes of just unabated u5 go do it 22 Pittsburgh has led by eight on two separate occasions Williams again weve been loving the elbow and then Jesse Edwards getting after it though he can secure the rebound sebandy eyes up that was altered from behind Jesse Edwards usually a forwardfacing shot blocker knocks that away to keep us tied at 22 7 38 to go in the first here in the zoo savings rate Benny Williams sophomore out of Bowie Maryland for Syracuse hes played in a couple of games this year but he has absolutely played tonight yeah came into this one and ACC play averaging four points per game hes got 11 right now four of nine from the floor hes been efficient I think the big thing Joel hes got three rebounds hes been active defensively I think a big reason why though hes had some success on the other end tonights game presented by Subway ACC basketball here from the Peterson Events Center in Pittsburgh I love Benny Williams reaction in a Donna De toota article from syracusecom the former Syracuse post standard informed Benny Williams that Jim behan had said he is Syracuses best forward and his reaction was he said what attempt well hes talented hes got a great looking shot hes got a really good length in athleticism I think the biggest thing confidence theres times where again you said it been up and down and thats been the type of season but you can see early on hes playing confident aggressive and hes had success and when you see the ball go in early as a young player it just continues to roll over there finally connects he had missed six consecutive shots and Pitt had pulled off from three Panthers are now just four of 15 from deep but hit one when they needed it in the worst way back in front after leading by as many as eight here early Oakland Zoo was hopping early its quieted down but now back into it just a little bit and that will help a little bit to get Rowdy about Applause and this one again youre going to have to live with some contested trees I mean look thats a contested of three right there now the thing about Pitt and in particular Henson I think hes a guy that creates matchup problems when he plays that fourth position too many not too many fours are used to going out and defending that late shot clock three off the inbounds missed by Gerard there is just so much versatility with this lineup and Vincent I think that was a fake from the getgo but boy did he just Juke Joe Gerard out of his shoes with it well take guys in and out of that foul line area to try to attack this Zone it was Kingston then it was Elliott Here Comes Hinson again three and one Applause go Jesse Edwards good things got away with one full head of steam down the court Gerards trapped underneath Edwards Rising got it back Jesse Edwards with his right thats five points now for Jesse Edwards Applause great find out of the double team originally by Joseph Gerard he was trapped down there on the Baseline found somehow found Jesse Edwards in thats a great finish through contact this game has calmed down what could have been a pit runaway early rebound Burton Burton through Edwards that was deflected shot clock did not reset and Burton lost the ball itll stay here this is what the fans were upset about that last possession with geroni hmm thats close Im not sure he picked up his pivot foot right there but still for him to find Edward from that angle Second Chance opportunity the one thing you can check off in terms of knowing his Scout are important what you want to do in this game Syracuse all the coaches talked about the slow starts that has plagued them the last two games this has really been a good start for this Syracuse team and a hostile environment at Pittsburgh Joe Gerard taking a seat Judah Mintz has checked back in with those two fouls after Jim behind rolled just five players for the first 12 minutes of this game hes turned over the bench a little bit more now first look at 24 in Orange Kadir Copeland also Samir Torrens still out there Music he third triple for Blake Henson and a timeout for an upset Jim behind well missed Opportunity by Syracuse and Blake Henson continues to show off his unlimited range right here Jesse Edwards posted turnover in transition you find a guy who is red hot from Beyond The Ark Pittsburgh a fourth Music we are the University of Pittsburgh forced in the Blue Collar city with gold standards were innovators researchers thinkers and Healers are always reaching for New Heights there is no limit to what we can accomplish when we put our minds our hands Soul inspiratory here progress is always in progress hail to pit proud partner of the ACC now Jim Boeheim the three by Blake Henson just before his third at this point gives Pittsburgh the fourpoint advantage and this is where the Youth of Syracuse shows itself a little bit 280 second out of 363 teams in terms of experience Benny Williams in transition runs to the rim leaves the shooter wide open yeah I think the points off the turnovers thats something that plagued them in that Clemson game as well now again they didnt have a High number in terms of turnovers but I think the points you give up off of those turnovers is key and anytime you give up 19 points off the turnovers uh thats really going to be tough to overcome Torrance heads out turnover number five for the orange Joe Gerard and Judah mins at the top of the zone Applause Music Applause it is gunning to get threes from that spot they want looks off of the Wings although deep from straight away for Hinson seems like its good enough today we got to tell Blake Henson that the threepoint line is is not 28 feet today unlimited range but look look Syracuse not bad right now Pitt 28 from uh the threepoint line theyve taken 18 of them theyve only made five so again youll live with that and theyre doing exactly what of the zone is meant to do have them shoot uh deep contested threes dude immense that is an awfully difficult shot falling out of bounds first bucket for the Freshman out of Maryland I love his game his ability to get into the paint and then raise up and finish thats a tough Baseline pullup Jumper by judamins hes worked a lot on his shooting shooting is the biggest thing for him consistency in shooting theres a deflection leads the ACC and steals he read the passing Lane well third turnover for the Panthers Gerard rising up thats a contested shot whats Nelly coming supposed to do yeah and I think uh thats really again when Joseph Gerard does not have length on him uh hes able to break you down off the bounce and raise up off the pullup thats just a big time move by one of the better scorers in college Cummings open three off the nice kick out and Jesse Edwards the rebound Syracuses big man is 11th in the NCAA in rebounding foreign Panthers with Joe Gerard tying us back up at 28 orange looking for a big road dub in the zoo Music Syracuse and Pitt joined one another on the court to demonstrate their commitment to seeing each others as equals and treating each other with respect and dignity at all times recognizing that our differences dont divide us but instead make us stronger Unity week here in Pittsburgh Music although that all ends once the buzzer sounds because Pitt and Syracuse is a fantastic rivalry in the ACC dating back to their days in the Big East together these two schools to get together and it is electric yeah its we got a good one going on right here Syracuse has been down by as many as eight and the first shot drops down for khadir Copeland today played 12 minutes against Clemson on Wednesday night has been used sparingly here and there but finding a bigger role as the years going on and the change of lineup has worked uh really uh on the road right here against Pitt theyre playing with a lot more energy and again I think the efficiency and then the ability for them to rebound I think thats going to be continued storyline in this game rebound there by Federico and then Elliott forcing up the issue free throws forthcoming for the Marquette transfer Ence Music Elliots an 87 freethrow shooter pit is a very good freethrow shooting team 77 as a unit at Tuesday nights double header on acc Network and the ESPN app starts in Charlottesville at 7 Eastern sixth ranked Virginia plays host to Clemson who get back on the bubble no no they are back on the bubble after what they did to NC State today and then its Virginia Tech taking on Louisville what on Earth got into Brown Brownells unit well Ill tell you thats life in the ACC On Any Given night and thats the reason why I think of this ACC tournament really many years people talk about anybody can win it I think this is a year where you can basically flip a coin and uh there are a lot of teams that could potentially win the ACC tournament push on Jesse Edwards instructions excuse me second on Jesse Edwards and Jim Boeheim will go get him so manir Hema is going to come in Off the Bench first action for the Nigerian sophomore and Pitt is and the bonus on the next foul mark this right here 219 tie ball game Jesse Edwards goes to the bench and the big issue pit they have 11 offensive rebounds a rebounding defensive rebounding has been an issue in his first half just led to half their points Malcolm almost 13 of 30 and they go inside right away Hinson Miss Federico to rebound righthanded sophomore out of Helsinki Finland very softly spoken he didnt even want to talk to us and shoot around the days and um Im quiet I dont want to talk about myself first and foremost he just wants to let his play do the work well he came and told me afterwards he really was avoiding you he said he would have talked to me but but nonetheless this guy right here Joseph Gerard its amazing how he is all the attention that he has coming in uh hes really at the top of every Scouting Report when you talk about defending both him and Judah Benson his ability again to create a shots for himself continues to be impressive hes been great Benny Williams has been great the Orange shooting 50 almost from the floor Pittsburgh down to 32 after a hot start and weve got a foul on hemo this is one and one and the spacing four pit look at this right here again high ball screen and then theyre spread out they find a soft spot but I think because of the spacing that Pitt has theyre able to get those offensive rebounds and then this guy right here thats a pro move again hes draped over him uh his ability to make shots uh really is something that has been talked about since hes walked into a Syracuse uniform but since hes washed actually and Joe Gerard came to Syracuse out of Glenns Falls with all the hype Jimmer fredettes Hometown he was the next Jimmer since he won a freethrow shooting contest when he was 11 this year Joe Gerard has been able not that he hadnt lived up to it but because hes playing the two guard and not the point guard he doesnt have to run the offense he can go be the scorer and Jim behind said earlier this year listen thats the best thing he does he needs to go to school and that only happens because of this guy with the ball Jude immense really his freshman campaign allows Joseph Gerard to get off the ball and play more of his natural position which is this right here deep three Gerard Off the Mark left rebound Burton Syracuses second Miss from three thats it foreign the first half Elliott open Marquette transfer in the corner short and then Hema go go gadget arms by Joe Gerard but to get out on that shot after a really good skip Court pass its LED 14 minutes here in the first half Syracuse can tie it here well most likely its final possession before the break Gerard sabandi is a great defender and he fouls Joe Gerard with eight on the shot clock so Bandy was relentless I think if anything probably got in the vertical cylinder there change of Direction change of pace Gerard not the fastest guy but again his ability to change Pace change direction hes so Shifty thats well I dont know one right there the pit fans not happy about it but again a lot of contact orange now can hold for the last shot Judah Mintz lost it hes fouled again and as a matter of fact hes fouled on the way up so a pair of free throws coming foreign you know its funny if youve told Jim bam youre going to be down by two with the break or with 10 seconds to go and Judah Mintz has one bucket I think hed take it and its been the other guys in particular uh Benny Williams of the first that he has given them coming into the starting lineup as Vince misses the first free throw but its been the other guys chipping in something Jim Boeheim has talked about getting something other than uh really calling their big three foreign Applause 16 a game and thats his third Music and with two fouls Jim Beckham will take Judah mint out dont risk picking it up here on a heave play here Comes Cummings six seconds there is the heave there is the foul and Samir Torrance is looking at Jim Boeheim who is looking back at him neither one wanting to believe what just happened and theyre trying to take a foul but he did it in the act of shooting so it looks like Cummings is going to get look hes trying to follow him there but then he does it and the ref doesnt call the first one now again and his defense it looked like he found them originally on the ground Syracuse didnt have one to give yeah Im not sure what he was thinking there so again hes crying thats an intentional foul not sure why but Jim boeheims saying hey he tried to foul him beforehand and afterwards he said look he filed him in the active shooting Music Applause done pleading his case to the referee so now seek a case from samiritories Syracuse native transfer from Marquette third for Cummings Applause timeout with five and a half seconds left to go in the first chance to strategize before the break Music Applause foreign Music to go where you couldnt before achieve goals and once felt Out Of Reach thats why Honda Engineers didnt just redesign the pilot trailsport he built the most offroad capable Honda SUV ever your new pilot trailsport part of the Honda line of rugged vehicles Music Pittsburgh leads Syracuse by four well go back to that last foul here but I dont understand it because Syracuse didnt have a foul to give yeah I mean hes clearly trying to follow him there I mean hes grabbing them around the waist uh a little confused in terms of what he was trying to do there and coach behind asking like what are you thinking about in that situation thats a tough break because uh you talk about a momentum killer um you give them three points again its one thing to follow if you give up a two but he follows them and they act of shooting a three thats really tough break orange to have a chance here with three seconds Judah mints nice heave inside his deflected away Pittsburgh defended it well and the Panthers take all the momentum into the half it started well for Pitt led by eight in the games opening minutes Syracuse fought all the way back but at the break it is the team thats a half game out of first in the conference oh the atmosphere really uh winning does that and certainly he has done that Jeff Capel theres a Florida State Miami score 8584 13th ranked hurricanes and first place hurricanes going down Pittsburgh trying to become the lowest preseason pick to ever reenact the Atlantic the Atlantic Coast Conference it was Jesse Edwards threw a double team into the free throw line and not just that they were picked second to last Pittsburgh second to last and a 15team league and theyve got a legitimate chance to win the whole darn thing yeah and again I think they talked about it uh the balance that they have you take a look at of this right here and uh certainly a big reason why Jeff Capel uh for Coach of the Year NBA agency but like sixth preseason okay you can win the league when you pick six when youre picked 14 like not only coach of the year like Man of the Year motivator of the Year well I think its the unit that he has the unselfish play again they have four guys starters of that average double digits and they had four players with eight or more points in that first half they spread it around doing a good job threepoint lead now for Pitt after the free throws by Jesse Edwards and its all of the elders Statesmen including Blake Henson thats his fourth triple Pittsburgh is the 16th oldest team in college basketball their minutes continuity from last year 308 Jeff Gable went out and he got older through the transfer portal but he also did his homework getting those guys in the pool and he credits his staff my brother Jason Milan Brown uh Timmy OToole he credits those guys really Manning of the transfer portal doing their homework to go along with some of the Player Development its one of those transfers with the foul heres the instant three and thats deep Joseph Gerard afterwards looked at coach bam raised his hands like well what do you want me to do with that again uh he looks over and says look thats a well beyond thats also the school record 264th made three six of them today now from Pittsburgh 264 in a single season for the Pitt Panthers Hinson of the six has four of them hes four of 11 today and Joel that last charge on Jesse Edwards but we saw at pit shoot around they were working on that right there they said look on the Baseline if you can get Jesse Edwards up in the air the forwards and guards are going to have to try to take charges thats on Blake Henson stepping in picking up a file on Jesse Edwards and its Edwards third so keep an eye on that with only a minute and 20 seconds gone by item a little bit in the zone but only so much Applause corner kick three got a hand on that loose ball rebound Elliott tipped it out hits it again and another rebound and Federico throws it off an orange leg the hustle underneath that is Pits 14th offensive rebound right here Federico Federico with the hustle play Oh out right there thats what he brings to the table though again not a guy thats going to go out and score you 20 points but Rim protection of one of the better uh on ball in terms of covering uh ball screens and then uh he is one of the best Rim runners in college basketball for it big and came dangerously close to raising Justin Taylors voice enough used to attack the Zone in the first half they move Burton and other guards in that foul line area that man that mans hot spots Galore Pittsburgh lighting it up in the second half and Jesse Edwards the jam to quiet the crowd a bit thats a beautiful find though by Jude immense and thats the area of his game again you know that judaments can score but his four game really has been impressive and had that going that was a three from about 29 feet at what point does Jeff Campbell say son I know youre feeling it well hes got I mean green is an understatement in terms of the light that he has to shoot from anywhere on the court jumping into the passing Lane there by Demaryius Burton Texas Tech transfer up ahead to Elliott credit your heart for trying to take a charge Burton dumped down Federicos home uh Justin Taylor is his first Applause continues to be the story look at us right here Federico Federico with the screen you got four guys spread out on the perimeter and that again another tough three you got the sevenfooter Edwards out there another guard closing out on him he just continues to shoot and a high clip I mean this is a team thats not afraid first game this season hit took 41 freeze against UT Martin Im sure there are games this year teams havent taken 41 Shots Hinson hit meat against Wake Forest that was a game that pits at the single game School record with 18 made threes again I know there are games this year in the country where teams have not made 18 shots its remarkable and thats what Blake Henson brings to the table he came into this game uh 74 threes made and hes a guy that again if youre not there on the couch its too late Edwards broken up nice rebound Copeland missed it got his own glass off the window Copeland good minutes off the bench has been the Sixth Man and theres Federico running before like you talked about and getting fouled and if thats Edwards thats four spared its on Copeland and again the the importance of him running thats making Jesse Edwards have to Sprint back on the defensive end Federico Federico one of the better running bigs theyll be beat everybody up the court with his ability to move after offensive rebounds or blocks Applause Federico out of Helsinki Finland he is a fan favorite because of his hustle because of his energy certainly because of his name Federico Federico his legacy will live on though his brother was just offered by Pitt six foot nine brother in High School playing right now back in Escalade its been The X Factor in my opinion again the guards and wings have been very good jamarius Burton now that should be up for player of the year and the ACC but Federico Federico really this right here his ability to defend ball screens Kenny Williams you know we talked about his impacts in the first 10 minutes of the game but we havent seen much from Benny Williams after we had those early 11 points in that first quarter yeah a little out of sync right there again travel but his start really I think is what kept them close uh in the first half really aggressive offensively thank you Applause Music lets go pitch and stamping out here that ball was tipped by Syracuse clean game Pittsburgh only has three turnovers the other thing in this game of the adjustment by the forwards again Pitt a team that goes really with four perimeter players uh coach bam New Vegas have to be active and then play up make sure they dont give up these open looks Applause it was a three second bucket for the Indianapolis grottoms that could wind up with the player of the year the defensive player of the year and the Sixth Man of the Year and Burton Federico and Samantha in the ACC and now the crowds back into it with that 10point lead Williams needed that to drop and Pittsburgh can really barn doors this thing Corner kicks the Bandy great shot fake some Bandy wants three and a rebound Williams foreign Applause Applause I think he has a point a lot of contact on that one degree of difficulty above the turn Im not sure he was looking at the rim on that one and the reverse English on that one to go so hes gonna save that for horse hes not going to do it again hes just going to show the video and say can you pass into Federico better pass to the diving Burton and an awesome block Jesse Edwards get that out of here hes fifth in the NCAA in rejections but his team is down eight Applause right I mean its an interesting uh flip a coin you can use whatever phrase you want it is a wide open uh ACC tournament you look at Miami Lofts today had a sizeable lead going into the half against Florida State at home where theyve been very good and very linear path on that bracket for a rematch the basketball gods are always funny that way foreign Applause really stealing momentum here in the second half and weve got a whistle Sports Center I think top ten out of bounds underneath Nike sabandi showing off the Hops looking like John Moran my goodness this right here should show up Head Above the Rim and but the credits of Federico Federico for clearing out Jesse Edwards to create that space designed to play and youre absolutely right a little thing of Federico Federico certainly should get some credit for that but Nikes abandoned with the Hops all right Syracuse down 10 really fought themselves back into this game ladder parts of the first half and Jesse Edwards is fouled so a chance to slice it down to seven and Joel thats a great read Blake Henson of that time is on a Jesse Edwards they recognize it identify it pit but does not come over the help and Jesse Edwards slowly backs down thats a big time move and finish by Jesse Edwards but its all set up though by the recognition of them to go down low and know they had a mismatch how much do you think it costs that fan to get that printed that Jim behind headshot thats a lot of a lot of college money right there to go down to Kinkos or wherever he got that one well steal one from the Syracuse beat writer Mike Waters he said somebody works at Kinkos Applause an off hours project sabandi now for three oh give it to him he points back to the pit bench five straight pit points from savandy in the biggest fashion Applause and then we get a foul off ball which just throws a little bit of cold water on it this right here again now that ones a little bit of a late closeout Applause oh and nice of Bandy makes him play but again thats what makes Pitt so difficult to match up against oh they got four guys that can shoot threes second greatest player in Crispus Attucks High School history out of Indianapolis Gerard knocks that one down Gerards first step I think underrated again his ability to get by guys I think thats been the progression in his game but his ability to get by guys and then raise up off the bounce thats a tough move he made it look easy you got to get this one I was gonna say back to Savannah dont you oh shootings all right now Syracuse having issues matching up on the perimeter foreign switches back off off the pass the wing is supposed to move up right there theyre late getting out and another 34 pitch from three tonight for the Pitt Panthers theres seven of 16 from Two and that poor guy I dont know what he was thinking brave but on the other side you know credits here because they have not taken a lot of Threes only seven threes in this game judamins twopoint specialist to The Marksman knocks down a freethrow jumper but Greg Elliott a little worse for wear looks like he slipped fell back on his shoulder Applause through dements his elevation on his pullup jumpers on display right there lets see the adjustment for Syracuse communicating not leaving open Shooters on a perimeter expand hes opening the corner Hinson takes it himself and his foul on and that is four on Jesse Edwards for 1339 to go and Jesse Edwards will go to the bench monirahima immediately summoned and that changes everything and again not a good foul that time by Jesse Edwards yeah again youre there contested just cant go down thats an easy one for the refs to make Music hes too important for them offensively and obviously defensively marked this right here 13 39 to go and now the question becomes how long does he leave him on the bench trailing by 11 on the road if youre the orange you got a strap on your hard hat and go to work down 11 game high Music and then Savannah and another foul Joe and Gerard trying to be aggressive reaching in when it rains it pours pit just has everything going its way well heres the story of the game again Syracuse has offensively not been bad but 20 second chance points for bit in this game to five for Syracuse and the points off turnovers is the same dude the earned points so to speak well Henson was going to shoot that from Aliquippa Applause Music and thats a step on the Baseline for the Spaniard Diaz brand first run of the second half Applause points off turnovers Judah Mintz forcing the issue in his foul Applause if the orange are going to make a statement here its probably got to rely on judamins he has five points hes your leading scorer you know you need other people to do things but you also need your stars to be stars and youre absolutely right I think in that first half that was a story a Juda mens not really a big game in that first half obviously in the second uh starting to try to pick it up but Benny Williams uh provided some offense for Syracuse but youre right theyre going to need him along with Joseph Gerard to try to close this game out in the second half after shrink this Gap that they have and Judah Mintz hits both free throws the Freshman donning number three for the orange which will be retired next week on Senior Day in Syracuse for Jerry McNamara Jim coach on the bench for Jim Boeheim he and Hakeem Warwick will be honored some Bandy missing the three and there is mince with the rebound and Cherry MacDonald Applause he goes but Ive seen some highlights now game winner against Georgetown in 2004 he goes yeah it makes them more relatable because were like the same guy same kind of fiery player and the job that uh both he and Rhett Autry have done with him his progression we talked about it earlier of the ability to move Joseph Gerard off the ball really because of the Season that Judah Mintz has had his progression as a playmaker look you know he can score I think his ability running the point has been used Henson is fouled he missed the three but oh boy that zone rotating late and trying to close out too hard in certain situations that is the third Malcolm fouled threepoint shooter and lets see its a poor closeout again yeah and thats a foul again he clearly hits him on the hand the problem is again theyre late on the Closeouts and Pitts doing a nice job breaking down the Zone theyre either getting it to the high post or the foul line area theyre kicking it out and go from there the communication on the back end with the forwards of Syracuse continues to be an issue again look at the spacing right here again you have the foul line area covered skip pass thats really tough to beat I think a lot of that has to do your activity in your hands in the passing Lane its not there their ability to make that skip pass to the corner tough to close out from that angle first two free throws good for Hinson do you think number two in white here showed up to the arena today and said Im gonna take this number of Threes because hes at 14 right doesnt do it justice to what he has and some of those have been almost at half court the threes that hes taken 19 points for Henson hes five of 14 from three minutes missing that one rebound Benny Williams hit doesnt mind letting him fly theyre first in the ACC in attempts and mince will count that with a foul so Syracuse not counting themselves out just yet but work to do with 12 and a half to play but hes so tough hell get struggled in that first half but his ability to play through contact has he take the contact eyes on the REM the entire time and hes a guy thats right at the top of the list as a freshman of the year ndacc I think its down to both the end Kyle filipowski at Duke but the season that he has put together really impressive for Syracuse another look at the corner for Elliott another three Pittsburgh is a 11 of 32 from behind the threepoint Arc Gerard trying to answer missed that short Williams the rebound mince gave it up to Copeland boy mitts had hit four threes last time out he ups for the two there hits the bucket and the timeout Syracuse trying to carve in but Greg Elliott making it awfully hard threes all day for three Music The Venture X card from Capital One for a guy named Nike if this isnt a logo for a shoe my goodness head above the ramp beautifully designed play and sports center top 10 right here looking like John Moran showing off the hot Nike sapandian you know Joel hes a guy that I think were really a top of the list for six men of the year and the ACC averaging close to the nine points a game off the bench of Ford Pitt he has embraced that role and its been a big and a great story out of perseverance Nike sebandi from Christmas Attucks high school its Oscar Robertsons alma mater in Indianapolis he was gonna go to prep school originally out of high school and then maybe and then another adult to rival it Diaz Graham against the Press Break It wasnt until Jack Owens got the Miami Ohio job he was a Purdue assistant new of Nike from Indiana that he brought him to the MidAmerican Conference where he flourished and then transfers to this stage it is a slow developmental process if you believe in the steps absolutely it is a great story and right here though this guy who continues to be impressive for Syracuse and the Press again this is something that the coaching staff was concerned about if Syracuse went to full court pressure rebound pulled down by hemo hes playing with Jesse Edwards struggling with fouls right now four of them with 11 minutes to go and then due to mens forcing the issue I think Jim behan asking his team to press here has just sped them up in general theres a sense of urgency from Syracuse in the last minute and a half Elliotts three get that intact dont get a steal a turnover in the back court uh Youre vulnerable on the back end that time Pitt does a nice job of getting a wide open look FEMA underneath Cummings nice little reverse the little guy wants noise Pittsburghs obliging timeout Jim behind Applause foreign offense is presented by the pit Panthers and they break the pressure that time and then a beautiful read again by Nike sebandi are right here the ball moves up by pits off of Breaking the pressure and Nelly Cummings the Up and Under Big Time finish and they are loving it right now and you know really I think it goes down comes down to the points off the turnovers 21 points off the turnover and then uh crashing them offensive glass they have 20 second chance points in this game Jim banham pulls the trigger on Jesse Edwards with four fouls 10 minutes left to go in the game 14 in Orange has to be very careful he doesnt get back Federico just dunks on him I said it earlier one of the best running bids in college a Federico Federico running the floor again beating everybody down the court and getting rewarded heres the kick out for Gerard and a three to bring Syracuse back within 12 15 points for Joe Gerard foreign defense continues to press here just trying to speed up Pittsburgh Malcolm does this look like the 59th best team in college basketball absolutely not really I think amazed that you know here they are and a race for first place in the ACC and theyre not in the top 25 and theyve beaten a couple of those teams that are in the top 25 you got a foul on Federico that is his fourth so he goes out like Im not gonna profess to be smarter than the computers and the net and Ken palm and bartoric and all those things theyre theyre formulas that are tried and true but the pit Panthers lets go to 218 144 in conference theyll be in first place in a power five League theyre 59th in the Ken pomboy rankings on one wins I mean they are ranked behind a mid major right now that has two top 200 wins in the computer yeah again uh computers uh you can tell me all you want that does not make any sense to me whatsoever but Jeff Capel again is a message to this team all year long has been lets go 10 oh lets just take it a game at a time and that has worked from the beginning when this team started one and three Applause blowouts for Pitt West Virginia Michigan VCU and then you kind of look yourself in the mirror and this team has not looked back since Edward struggling in the double team found Copeland foreign Applause despite the loss to Clemson midweek he can develop that to be a consistent threat shooting the ball from the threepoint line hes almost impossible to keep out of the lane uh but this right here this is smart by Burton again to space he look at that at the foul line he knows Jesse Edwards has four dont shy away get into his body and this right here one of the best freshmen in college basketball Jude immense three you know his midrange game is one of the better ones but if he can make that consistently the Athletics Sam vasini has Judah Mintz as a second rounder right now underneath Diaz Graham three thats down 13 of 34 and even close tonight for Pittsburgh from behind the arc this season they have hit 18 in a game that was against wake they have taken 41 that was against UT Martin 13 of 34 is mild Edwards over the top of his right hand Applause Rob Gerard got there immediately Elliott out of control Applause and that call is against Syracuse it looked like Elliot was a little bull in the china shop there but the foul is on khadir Copeland and that is his form Music pit a pig Music targets are on site its all here as we challenge app presented by New York Life helped benefit local Boys and Girls Clubs you can score points for your school and after the ACC tournament the local Boys and Girls Club will receive a donation from New York Life based on their Affiliated ACC teams final ranking well uh can they get that for tonight because Pitts shooting is off the chain they still say that I mean right here again the ball movement and theyve all been off of excellent spacing and then guys are being unselfish with the ball extra pass to the corner late closeout open three I mean look at the Ridiculousness of some of these stat lines Greg Elliott at the freethrow line this will be a one and one Burton 10 points nine rebounds four assists Nelly Cummings 14 Points 11 assists Blake Henson 19 points five rebounds hes drawn four fouls everybody has done it six guys for pit in double figures theyve all hit a three with the exception of Federico Federico honestly nothing would surprise me at this point and your point the balance when you can have uh I mean its hard enough to get four guys and double digits they have six everyones missed that is the second missed Syracuse dunk tonight 12 point lead for Pitt their largest was 15 by the way 11 assists Nelly Cummings he now has 43 assists in the last six games Applause 12 Henson none Benny Williams the rebound Applause because looking inside for Edwards Williams opened and Jesse Edwards missed the rebound thats a pretty clean look again oh Williams who has been pretty good in this game nice fine and good read by Jude immense thats a wide open 10footer Applause head playing for first in the Atlantic Coast Conference well have it with a win Applause but while theyre attacking were setting high ball screens sometimes but then other times theyre just getting what they did right there Burton at the foul line and then attack him thats head fake by Gerard rebound Elliott the bucket largest lead of the night Applause for guys that feels like they fit well they click well they have fun playing together Nelly Cummings and shoot around and he said listen its genuine but that was the key word D3 and if youre seven foot theres a rebound by Burton doesnt always work when you bring in a bunch of transcripts and for Jeff Capel its worked they got the right guys 16th most veteran team in the country and it has clints inside kick out three on the shot clock Applause heres Edwards falling back a little foul inside on Diaz Graham I mean Joe lunardi has pit as a 10 seed right now thats not fair to the seventh and the teams that play then you better be able to get out and defend the threepoint line to Spacey oh thats a beautiful touch pass by the big Diaz Graham and then this guy Blake Henson the way he has shot it tonight from the threepoint Applause thank you free throws have been a big difference tonight as well Pence 19 of 22 Syracuse 11 of 16 Applause second free throw forthcoming for Jesse Edwards Applause Cinema 15 and the orange with four and double figures Applause spend the discussion end this game how good Jesse Edwards has been now again played against the Clemson team that was very physical with him but guys averaging a double double and leads the league in blocks senior does have a year of Eligibility trying to close out late on Dean 15 May 3 the school record and theyve got five minutes to get there Williams a three yes Benny Williams very quietly he was loud early but very quietly has had his best game of the season Applause yeah Syracuse has spent so much energy now trying to get back into this game with their full court pressure Applause right now looking at guard and mens these guys look fatigued Applause Nelly Cummings has 12 assists in his 13th is asking the crowd to its feet Applause Pittsburgh kid nominal senior season coming back home Applause The Venture X card from Capital One Paulie is presented by Subway Subways upping their game with the AllStar Subway series menu just order by name or number the number that were ordering tonight is zero Nelly Cummings transfer originally from Bowling Green then to Colgate has a phenomenal career for Matt langel and the Colgate Raiders played in the NCAA tournament came home for his final year of Eligibility to play at Pittsburgh where hes always dreamed of and has it ever paid off for Jeff King and really enjoyed speaking with that young man after shoot around Humble and I think thats part of the job that Jeff Capel and snap have done when they on man this transfer bordo and his last three games hes really been playing well 14 points a game yes he can score but hes been averaging seven assists per game in his last three outings I think that number might go up a little bit after tonights performance sixth steal for Pittsburgh and I thought Nelly Cummings was funny being able to play at home does matter because he said when he has a bad day at practice he just goes home get some home cooking eats with his parents nice little reset button you dont get anywhere else for Syracuse driving through Cummings heres Betty Williams Applause and Joel Benny Williams gets that call because hes been aggressive again hes not going up song he started off the game being very aggressive on both ends he got some shots to go early had 11 points in the first half and hes going right up into the chest up the shot blocker and you know look if youre going to try to take a positive from this game before Syracuse look you know Joseph Gerard you know that Jude immense score but Ive been impressed with Benny Williams again this is probably his best game in the Syracuse uniform from an offensive standpoint and I think also defensively and its important for him to finish the season storm because he can then take that into the offseason feel good play good and you want to work hard towards something and feel like you finished the season on your basketball well I think the biggest thing happened Music to Federico so badly thats a smart play though to pull it out right here again time in clock to say how to start a fight 101 Applause that as well too but I think that goes to the veteran leadership of this team understanding again jobs not done yet lets use some clock shot clock down to three Federico plugs up with the points anyway foreign 92 points is a season High 91 against Sacred Heart and Louisville this season for Pittsburgh the 11th time theyve scored more than 80 and then Benny Williams he has a season high for the orange thats 20 points against small victories hes not gonna care at least today and tomorrow gives him something to build on things Elliott wisely pulls it out once again be a little then but a younger team maybe they try to go for the Highlight dunk 241 this team has been consistent in their message lets plate it in lets play it a right way Elliott three Point thats a difference from when these teams met in December because remember Pittsburgh LED that game by 20 and Syracuse came back to within one nearly one within and Edwards has fouled off the rebound so thats a growth and maturation process over the course of a season absolutely and you take a look at the skip pass again they continue to pick this Zone apart that time jamarius Burton with the cross card or excuse me with the nice uh pass to the corner thank you and some Syracuse fans might say well how do you fix the Zone the zone is broken heads shooting 60 from three today sure maybe theres some validity to a team shooting 60 from three against you how you fix the zone is you get older the best thing about freshmen is they become sophomores and this is Jim boeheims youngest team since 2008 well I I think that along with though I think the big issue for them rebounding that has continued to be a issue for this team the second chance points Pitt has 23 Second Chance points and then the turnovers okay they didnt have a high turnover number but credit hit stop converting those to points 21 points off a turnover for Pitt just tough to win games on or at home with those type of numbers Applause Music Applause get to 100 now Burton makes it 97 Applause Penny Williams cash again this is like when youre uh hitting home runs in the ninth inning right like the points still count and its good for his play till the final buzzer mentality which is important but it is the story and the way that the Panthers have absolutely laid the hammer down team in white is in first place in the Atlantic Coast Conference Applause and Jeff Capel would call timeout to get his seniors in ovation one name beautifully early Applause oh lets go not only is this going to give the seniors a chance to come out of the game its going to give Jeff Campbell a chance to get a senior in the game and thats Aiden fish the biomedical Sciences major 15th career game for the former manager theyre awesome for him to get another 49 seconds on a basketball court man they love him his energy and shoot arounds and practices and getting reward rewarded with some playing time on his final night get the young man a bucket fish Applause another shot Eight Second nine second shot clock game clock difference and a block phone Music Applause hey guy Im talking to Benny Williams but again game out of hand right here its gonna get another victory at home but if there is Music positive for Syracuse its this guy right here at the line finally showing some signs of I think the player that they think he can be here go your seniors Applause the Oakland Zoo sold out standing room only for a team in first place here in the ACC and a team I would not want to see in the NCAA tournament 10 seed still shocked Im going to say it one last time that they are not in the top 25 oh this pit team theyre one of the 25 best teams in the country Ill tell you that great otherwise I think we certainly can agree with that and fish deep three had that gone Rebound with 20 seconds back to fish to the rim Applause the best two points this has been the loudest the zoo has been all night Applause the first 97 points were worth it for the final two Pittsburgh a senior night are in first and they have their best season since 2016 when they last made the video six players in double digits the balance that they displayed are ability to knock down threes but I think
