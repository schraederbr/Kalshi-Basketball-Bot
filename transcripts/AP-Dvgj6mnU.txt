South Greg alley in six main threes for him his team is dialed in as they make a big push to try and bolster that NCAA tournament many better opportunities than Holmes with this crowd behind it against the top 20 teams great atmosphere this place is rocking we are underway Pittsburgh and goal Miami in Black its the basketball today with the same starting fine ball five transferring into this pit program and making huge impacts is a team that theres not one player that stands out exemplified in the last four games theres been four different leading scorers Greg Elliotts one of them and three Off the Mark and Isaiah Wong chases you down he leaves the Hurricanes no doubt about it Isaiah one youre right Isaiah won uh he is the key guy for this Miami team because of this right here his ability to get into the paint and create for himself for others hell usually make you pay from that spot a week ago on the road at cambered indoor and hes fighting through a virus hes back to a hundred percent today just held just held in seven points against two hes usually up near 20 right to the rack everything but the Finish good close by nor Chad OMeara the rim protector Miller into the lane and thats an offensive foul and what a job Jim larranega has done with this Miami team a lot of moving Parts yes they went to the elite eight for the first time in program history a year ago but that was with a totally different team than they have this year Hall of Famer I mean he is one of the best uh in the business I really enjoy watching the energy that he has watching him run a practice or shoot around and quite simply put he has put them consistently in a position uh to be in the NCAA tournament heres Nelly Cummings the floater his fires both teams still finding their footing offensively at the early Goings ball screen defense I think this is going to be key for Pitt how they defend a Miami and pick and rolls they like to run a lot of ball screen actions Miami Applause Music Pittsburghs missed their first three shots Hinson he leaves it short foreign opens the scoring for Pittsburgh count it plus the foul credit hits it for sticking with it after the Miss well for a guy that did not have one two in the last outing hit a lot of Threes oh this is just great work off of the Steal and certainly something that Miami needs to watch they had uh gave up a lot of turnovers but points off the turnovers thats something coach L talked about we cannot turn the ball over on the road against this pit team Applause heres more Chad omear double team comes in and a foul called jamarius Burton stuck a hand in there and theres Jeff Capel from the team that was picked 14th in the ACC preseason ball right now in Joe Lunardis last four in what a job hes done with this team I mean theres a lot of names you can throw around for ACC coach of the year and I would say Jeff Capel is at the top of that list he has done an outstanding job with his 15 Federico Federico rejection at The Rim sophomore from Finland and then cash in going the other way Jamari is Burton scoreless to start this game Nigel pack got a good look but missed it Applause Music Burton right to the rim in attack mode foul called well their transition off and set up by great outside defense again the rotation gets over and thats a big time block Ed by Federico Federico and then in transition Burton with the pullup coaches Jay talked to us about making individual defensive plays and what they both meant by that is uh for Miami they have guys that can go individually and make plays for themselves theyre going to continue to need more efforts like that on the defensive side start their offense with both teams shooting so well in the winds during the midweek you know both coaches coming into this game are saying look look at what they did last time out feels like both teams have really put an emphasis on the defensive end to start this game that was the key for both of these coaches when we spoke to them this morning and shoot around but were gonna have to defend a now pit again watch all the ball screen actions of that Miami runs wrong he traveled first Miami starting really slow three turnovers and theyve missed all four shots theyve taken yeah credit pitch defense again that was the emphasis in this shoot around and when we spoke with Coach Jeff Capel he said look defend were going to have to defend against a very good uh offensive Club in Miami that runs a lot of actions and then they have some individuals that can break you down off the bounce sent into the lane scoop to the hoop doesnt go heres Isaiah Wong still trying to get going Pittsburgh smothering Miami on defense finally a breakdown as Jordan Miller rocks the rim and thats a nice pass by omir breakdown and then over play by Pitt nice little back door action and the pass was on point much needed bucket for Miami Applause itll be Miami basketball when we come back to the hurricanes have come into the p and are struggling offense with you a terrific game here between Pittsburgh and Miami two teams battling at the top of the ACC but also the winner of this game is going to get a nice big boost on their NCAA tournament resume yeah huge game implications at the top of the ACC standings and two teams Jay that come into this game uh playing really well offensively uh Pitts last game they made 18 threes a program a record and on the other side Miami went on the road and had a impressive win against a Florida State where they had five guys in double digits you know this is a Pittsburgh team thats been one of the best stories in college basketball a Resurgence and youre number five under Jeff Capel right now ESPNs bracketologist Joe dinardi has the Panthers projected in the NCAA tournament Midfield albeit last four in but in his end Jeff capable wanted none of that conversation whatsoever we laughed and he said look I know thats your guys the medias job to talk about that stuff uh were doing it one game at a time and uh thats in his message to his team before every game lets go 10 lets focus on whats in front of us this afternoon and its a really tough task a Miami team well coached Hall of Famer and Jim larenega and they have one of the best backcourts in college basketball Isaiah Wong and Nigel pack the one thing that Pittsburgh has going for them today is theyve gotten this atmosphere into the game early the Oakland Zoo is packed its great to see this scene because it really is one of the best home venues in all of college basketball when they are rocking and rolling and early on some defensive stops are really has gotten the crowd up out of their seat yeah winning does that and the keys in this game as you take a look at the home court wins since 20022003 uh pit I mean theyre right there with some of the best in college basketball and Jeff Capel because of the start that theyve had theyve created this atmosphere back here as you said in the Oakland Zoo this place has been loud and it has been rocking well before this game started so Miami went empty on their first seven possessions scored on the last one though took a real long time to get this offense going North Chad omear trying to muscle his way to the rim tonight by Federico Federico thats his second block of the afternoon Music is a great individual defensive play by Federico the blow by Cummings couldnt finish it though Applause it has done a nice job keeping Miami out of transition Jeff Capel when we spoke to him this morning he said look we must do a good job in transition defense omir splits the dude two Defenders up off the window and in for North Chad omear what a pickup he has been the guy is averaging a double double they got him listed at six seven but he much bigger than that Jim lernega said he is Relentless in his Pursuit of the ball on the offensive or defensive glass its right here just a big boy move getting great footwork little up and under and he is so strong you know one of the better rebounders not just in the ACC but in college basketball thats top 25 Miami teams Music its in tough take to the rim for two Applause last game Lake Hinson made a career high eight threes didnt even attempt attempt two hes already got inside the arc today Jay thats a smart move by running out of it if he threes in a game like you said uh theyre gonna be up on you when you catch it Isaiah long all the way to the round hope teams just in attack mode going right to the hole that guy right there is a pro Isaiah one of the best guards in college score uh with the best of them apart from savandy misfires Applause nor Chad omear fading away left it short ahead to Burton finds Federico a lot of contact no call Applause Juan pulls the trigger and hits Isaiah Wong fires Miami in front for the first time today Im going to say it again that dude is going to be playing for a check when he leaves Miami and they use him in a lot of ball screens Jeff Capon staff said look we have to have really good uh pick and roll covers because Miami will put you in those situations with their backboard of pack and Isaiah long nice answer from jamarius Burton Applause Anthony Walker his first touch of the game cant connect Applause Jensen left alone youll usually maybe that rattled in and out thats a beautifully designed play double screened that time Henson popped right out Applause hes upshore both teams having a lot more success at The Rim than from three Cummings trying to change that he misfires Burton stays with it the hustle plays paying off for Pitt chin Burton does not go down and pit early on theyre getting high percentage shots a dribble Drive the previous possession dribble Drive kick to the corner wide open look they made 18 threes the last time theyre just missing some shots early but certainly getting some quality looks long contested points at a premium right now Malcolm Huckabee both defenses dialed in its a huge game in the ACC for both teams Federico Federico skying to the rim oh Music and roll and its like uh Tamara and egg is going to get a timeout timeout Jim larranega not much to separate these two teams were having fun here in Pittsburgh shot 50 from three in their win against Florida State and yet theyre ice cold to start this game well a lot of that is uh By Design of both these coaches talked about the importance of defending the threepoint line I think early on though theyve had some good looks they just missed some open looks Miami on the other hand theyre a team that if you try to take away the three uh they got guys in long and pack that will try to break you down off the bounce and get into the paint tough contestant tank but in Applause come in knowing the significance of this game both in the ACC both teams are the top four right now chasing Virginia and Clemson but also at the bigger picture theyre trying to get back into the NCAA tournament thatll help Guillermo Diaz Graham count it plus the foul thats twice now Pitt has had nice reads by the guards this time off a nice little pin down good read and then the strength thats a big time finish The Freshman who stands at seven feet tall Music came over to this country from Spain and with John Hughley out for the remainder of this season here modios Grand playing some big time minutes Applause threepoint play about Midway through this first half its a fourpoint lead for Pitt Applause Beverly another contested look Pittsburgh has dialed in on the defensive end no doubt about it yeah theyre doing a great job and just individual defensive play nothing schematically so Miamis just trying to break off go oneonone and Miami is doing a nice job of forcing them into difficult shots Miamis cranked up the pressure seconds left on the shot clock Applause went right through the hands of Diaz Graham that time only the second turnover for the Panthers today Capo told us point blankly hes like listen pick and roll defense yes but then when they break it off were gonna have to have good individual efforts defensively against their wings and guards foreign Applause ER has as well hell play 10 guys and all of them can make an impact Music not to see Anthony Walker Harlan Beverly Bensley Joseph all guys that come off the bench for Jim lehreneggers team and allows Isaiah Wong the chance to take a breather a long breather though I can guarantee that gives him options obviously having packed out on the court when Juan goes out of the game certainly Applause certainly Music Applause Music Applause double team Diaz Grand dispossessed up ahead Harlan Beverly projected great transition defense Nike sabandi Applause well Jay whats going on right now though Miamis doing a good job on their ball screen coverage theyre hedging hard of The Bigs and forwards and theyre forcing some turnovers of Fort Pitt the fan Applause thats a beautiful out of bounds underneath but back to the block crate recovery uh in transition and then right here out of bounds underneath caught a bit sleeping the pass was on point and he made a difficult shot itll look easy beautiful execution on the out of bounds underneath by Miami Applause Taylor completes the threepoint play and now Jim larranega decides to put some pressure on Pittsburgh Applause hes coming in quickly for this Hurricanes team Music seven seconds to shoot get it to Burton he has to hurry only one second on the shot clock heaved up off the mark offensive rebound keeps it alive though Music alley and kick out three does not go down Applause and a frustration foul for Guillermo Diaz Graham and this right here again you dont mind the hustle and effort another good look of Fort Pitt in and out yeah once once he secured the ball thats when you gotta let go now the fans dont like it Dicky tack but again hes got to understand he secured it youve made it attempt at it you got to let go Rafael he held on a little bit too long after Pittsburgh made a program record 18 threes with a win against wake theyve made zero today as Bensley Joseph buries that one to put Miami Back on Top by two steal Joseph doing everything Miami has numbers off to Miller in Miami with five points in about five seconds watch how active Miami is with their hands and then their bigs are doing a great job Applause coaching on ball screens watch how they defend the ball screens of pit Applause Federico Federico cleans up the spill much needed for Pittsburgh Miami was on an eightnothing run before that bucket bucket hurricanes have made their last three shots Applause turnover but the Hurricanes red hot right now Hawk Bensley Joseph providing the spark well the defense has been great for both teams right here Joseph nice little dime Miami up too well Jay Miamis up to on the road and its because of their team defense theyre doing a great job ball screen coverage big steps out and heads his heart look at the rotation on the back end and then they come up with the steal that is textbook team defense which led to offensive opportunities on the other end right now they are all locked in communicating well and doing a job taking fit out of their offense yeah both teams really dialed in defensively hes Malcolm Huckabee Im Jay alter it was funny because both teams incredibly efficient in their midweek wins Pittsburgh made a program record 18 threes on Wednesday against Wake Forest a record that has stood for 26 years and wouldnt you know theyve missed all five threes theyve taken today drop for Federico Federico Bensley Joseph stepped on the gas all the way to the rim hes been a really big spark Off the Bench for Miami quality minutes Isaiah Wong on the bench they bring in Joseph and hes knocked down threes that time though in transition I think the biggest thing his defensive effort has been huge uh creating opportunities on offense engine for three that doesnt fall Miamis made four straight three of those whove been Bensley Joseph whos got the ball here off to Nigel back Applause I havent started slow but theyve grabbed control of this game on the road Miller great hesitation leads in and now its a six point lead for the Hurricanes their largest of the game and Jay thats a design isolation they broke off their play because they like that matchup they let them go to work thats a beautiful head big Up and Under and then soft touch with the floater Miamis made five in a row its a 122 hurricanes run and it turns it over everything coming up Miami right now oh Applause theyve taken this electric crowd out of the game as well and this is why Miami though is very difficult to match up with they run excellent offense but then they also run a profile offense where if they like a matchup theyre just going to break it off ISO and let that guy go to work like that again they like the matchup of Miller versus Henson and theyre just let him go to work break off the play isolate him at the top of the key and thats twice now hes scored on isolations Miller has 12 to lead all scorers five of six from the floor all right Miami really starting to separate now a nine point lead Music Applause turnover backtoback turnovers Blake Henson not happy thats now six turnovers on the game for Pittsburgh and Miamis made him pay on the other end Jordan Miller leading the Hurricanes identifying of the matchup that they wanted in that situation coach Capel goes to his bench now and trying to find somebody to match up against Miller looks like theyre going to put a little bit more length on him but certainly Im gonna try to exploit whatever matchup they think favors them impressively Miamis 152 run has been with their best player Isaiah Wong on the bench another great look that time doesnt fall Aspergers in a scoring ground of two minutes and 40 seconds they are desperate for a make out of control Applause lets stay with Pittsburgh underneath there on hoop Panthers just one of their last eight five turnovers in the last six minutes as well lets do three bottom boy does it need that thats one of the few times Miami does not close out with hands high that time Nigel pack came out hand was down okay Applause Miller goes Baseline Jordan Miller Matches his season average with 14 points already in this game half of Miami scoring Music weaving through traffic North Chad Amir rejected at The Rim and thats a travel Miamis made Seven of their last eight in control of the eightpoint lead on the road number 20 team trying to take care of business welldeserved Ovation for what they accomplished two decades ago yeah really a remarkable of what he was able to do with that team and nice to see them back in the building honoring them for a great run that they had an incredible accomplishment and you know that was also the first year of the opening 20 years ago so to cap it off by going to Madison Square Garden and winning the Big East something that you know the Banners are still here will be remembered for a long time nor Chad omir hammers that home the steal and the slam for nor Chad omir Miami is one of those teams where theyre active not only in the passing Lanes but when youre dribbling if your careless with the ball theyre going to try to get their hands on it and create turnovers Music rebound Applause Pittsburgh seven turnovers are shooting eight of 20 20 from the floor way out of rhythm offensively in this first half s omir hes found take another look at nor Chad over here on this last possession and look at the activity on his hands again active hands bigs that are mobile and then he almost rips the rim off right here Jim learonega said uh he reminds him of Kenneth Faried his pursuit of the basketball on the offensive or defensive glass is just relentless big reason why they are the top 25 I dont know where coach Al pulled that name from Kenneth Faried but its money its spot on he didnt hesitate when we asked him and you take numbers they back it up entirely 17 points a game 12 rebounds a game but shooting 60 percent from the floor in the last 30 Seasons look at those names Tim Duncan Oscar shibway and nor Chad omear his number stacking up right with them about layered a year and also Defensive Player of the Year and Miami continues to make it difficult for Pitt to get anything going on the offensive end back into the game Miami on a 205 run over the last seven minutes and ground control of this game offensive foul ball called against Ruger popular Music this is what Jeff Capel talked about winning your battle individually great defense right in front of the ref a good call certainly a charge there and again Jeff capable said his guys are going to have to make individual defensive plays because youre going to be on an island at some times against this Miami team Applause Music Greg alley is found shooting three that gives a great opportunity to end a two and a half minutes Music started this game up six nothing since then Miami on a 3114 run Music responses if you look at the upcoming games for Miami and Pittsburgh and theyre all over the ACC Network the Panthers in Chapel Hill on Wednesday night 7 PM eastern time and then next Saturday a top 25 battle Miami against Clemson thats three Eastern both games on acc Network Miamis still with a path to potentially win the ACC regular season they have that tiebreaker against Virginia and if they could pick off Clemson a week from today obviously a long way to go in this game far so good for the Hurricanes its a team that could absolutely still win the ACC oh wide open I think for a lot of teams and what a fun finish this is going to be really competitive and stack ACC three Joseph misfires Applause so Dandy into the game Applause Music thank you long all over Savannah and he forced that one under a minute to go with his first half Miami leading by eight Juan Off the Mark Applause and thats a tough take and it drops for jamarius Curtin so strong great upper body strength that time hijabar is perfect Big Time finish after buckets buckets points for Burton its a two possession game Walker what an immediate answer for Anthony Walker 10 seconds left in the half Burton looking to call his number again off to Henson deep three is Blake kidson ends the first half with an NBA range three Music well he made eight of them the last time out a breakdown in communication by Miami they dont switch here and then this guy is the one that you cannot leave again he made eight threes in his left Miamis up by at least 10 so is that a good sign for Miami or Pittsburgh headed into the second half I think its a good sign for Pitt and particular the way that Miami played defense uh in that first half coming out though obviously the first five minutes of this second half key before pit to adjust obviously defense ending Jordan Music Milton Nigel pack a quiet first half thats it inside North Chad OMeara gets Miami started in the second half nice little dive to the post that time and again a nice read by Nigel pack thats something of Jim we are Naga talked about with his backcourt hes been impressed with uh their ability to not only score for themselves but then make good reads and set their teammates up for some quality looks foreign Applause Music Applause again nice little pin down and then they do another screen action he dies and a nice duck end of that time by omir but its all set up by the postentry bass of by Nigel pack thats pinpoint passing a good read by the guard for Miami Pittsburgh coming off that big win Wednesday night against Wake Forest Joe Leonardi ESPNs bracketologist has the Panthers in the last four rounds this would be a huge resume win against number 20 Miami trailing by seven step back Cummings contested Off the Mark you see Leonardi has the Hurricanes as a five seed right now so for them this would be a time Road win alley in transition three does not drop its get good getting good look sir just now knocking him down and that was the same in the first after absolutely right theyve had some good looks from three now again Dave had some turnovers but uh otherwise theyve got some quality looks just unable to convert in 14 that made 18 threes in their last outing and pulled at home and this one versus Miami Applause foreign offensive foul they said nor Chad OMeara had positioning on Henson and the thing is if you look at what omir did he jumped straight up the rule of verticality and then look he jumps straight up yeah and he got the elbow out thats a good call and Im surprised that hell take a look at that one again hes trying to make a move but he certainly made a lot of contact I think thats a good quality official and the big thing is leading with that album the leading with the elbow I think is what got him in position easy call for them to make a three Poplar getting a friendly Roll On The Road Poplar fires Miami in front by 10 long name team right there love the name Luca popular certainly thats a big three to double digits for Miami on the road because the threes have not fallen for Pitt theyve only made two tonight and that going inside Jamar is Burton continues to lead the Panthers Juan splits the double team kick to the corner Poplar again back to back threes for Wooga Poplar we asked a gym leader about the progression of Isaiah Wong he went to that right there dribble Drive unselfish play and kicked it out he could have easily tried to put a shot up for himself drew two Defenders and then kicked it out to Poplar he was wide open in the corner match textbook a dribble driving kick from the logo off the mark But offensive rebound coming Second Chance points opportunity and he marries it Applause Jeff cable takes the timeout after after the pit make but its Miami that has control plays like this though you can see the progression last year maybe he tries to take a shot for himself makes a beautiful read three guys around him dribble Drive kick playing more like a point guard now everybody knows he can score but when I asked Jim larenegger this happened this morning look Ive been impressed with his decision making in making other s better for Miami and says theyve had longs the goto guy for this Miami team take a look at the Hurricanes resume right now quality wins against Virginia Rutgers and Providence currently projected as a five seed big reason why is Isaiah Wong and not just the scoring as you said Malcolm but his Improvement as a facilitator for this team 10 seconds to shoot for Pittsburgh Cummings he connects on a three Applause two possession game after the Nelly Cummings three Applause an immediate answer Isaiah Wong delivers again for Miami just so tough again he can create for others and then hell go and get a bucket when he needs it back to threes for Pittsburgh Henson dials that one in from Deep and the Oakland Zoo is bouncing again the crowd back in it to the corner pack he hits it Nigel pack his first make of the day and its a big one for three if you want to show offensive spacing and then making an extra pass show that last possession beautiful offense but pit right now coming alive offensively knocking down shots and now theyre getting some driving Lanes these two teams have combined for five straight makes Applause one dribbles out of the double team settles things down the extra pass to pack back to back threes nothing but the bottom of the net Nigel pack you cant have better spacing in ball movement I mean theyre breaking you down dribble Drive kick it and then make the extra pass theyre getting open look after open look Miami one up top Beverlys there to poke it in Miami is red hot four straight makes for the hurricanes Applause Music Applause Burton hell be at the line when we come back for two Nigel pack he was scoreless through the first half but hes coming up clutch here in the second the ball Movement by Miami extra pass or nothing but the bottom of the net they are rolling right now offensively shoot around its going to come down to individuals making a plays defensively I think the biggest thing Jay is is a containing dribble drives theyve been getting beat off of the basket off bounce and thats hurt them because the health has to come over and then theyre getting wide open looks Miami when they throw out of it Music Pittsburgh certainly capable of climbing back into this game and winning it they overcame second half deficits here at home against North Carolina and Virginia to win those games it all starts with stringing together some stops right now Miami has made their last four shots Ansley Joseph trying to find Walker mishandled so Mandy has it for Pittsburgh Henson hoists the three misfires another pretty good look that time Henson again thats a pretty clean look the closeout was a little late for Miami just able to come foreign Applause Isaiah Wong at the scores table ready to check in Applause inside North Chad omear making it look easy down low today he does a nice job that time ducking and he bailed out Beverly bailed him out and certainly him ducking in that post is a good home here late to close down leads to jamarius curtain three foreign Applause six rebounds five assists hes doing everything for the Panthers rejected at the ram Henson got a piece of it how can they cash in on the offensive end trailing by eight Burton in attack mode rolls on in back to back buckets for jamarius Burton Applause Walker the spin cycle missed the layup Applause Burton would walk her all over him doesnt get the call Applause Ensley Joseph calls the timeout for Miami Pittsburghs got it to a two possession game well Miamis still continuing to be in front but defensive plays like this from fifth and then Burton with the bucket theyre hanging around hes been huge for them scoring all three levels right here ducked behind the threepoint line I love his ability to play through contact of one of the stronger guards in college basketball and Jeff Capel when we talked to him about him he said look uh he is a guy that should be in the discussion for a firstteam allleague guy he is that good theres a little bit of everything from it foreign take another look at this a nice Factory yeah thats thats a foul youre getting a lot of body there uh this is certainly they were late and again thats a communication on of the little rough screen at the foul line and because Miami has been shooting the ball well from the threepoint line you have to be up there on the cap so when they get in these back door Cuts or Crossways Applause thank you Applause Joseph for Miami thats his seventh point but when they inserted him in the first half he gave Jen there a huge boost of when Isaiah Wong makes it defensively and it hits him a timely shots toward Miami Music deep three this time it goes bagging Pittsburgh made that program record 18 threes on Wednesday night now just five on 16 from three heres Isaiah Wong in attack mode couldnt connect nice defense by Hinson now can the Panthers get something on the offensive end Nellie Cummings all the way to the rim no finish battle for the loose ball kept Alive by Burton to the corner Burton got omir in the air heres Henson for three he buries it Jay thats all set up jamarius Burton unselfish play he could have easily settled for the first three head fake kick it to a guy whos made eight threes in his last game excellent offense by Pitt and unselfish play at that time by Burton Burton and Henson have combined for 30 Applause Miller leans into Burton and they call Burton for the foul with three seconds left on the shot clock Burton really not happy I felt hes got a good argument on that one but right here again hustle played by Burton you reset it now again he could have easily settled for that head fake and then dribble Drive kick it out the spacing is there but the willingness to pass I think thats the big thing that Jeff capos talked about that this is an unselfish team and that one right there again looked like he jumped in to the defender right there and I think thats a tough one Applause Jordan Miller shooting three Burton still giving the officiating crew in earful as is Blake Henson Music Applause thats the one thing I think thats plaguing Pittsburgh today mountain is you make a big three like that you cant string together enough good plays in a row to really ever gain momentum yeah now again we have the luxury of slowing it down and having replay Applause its more Applause that angle from above that looks like hes coming out and Miller smartly jumps into the guy jumping out I think the big thing is the closeout is not good you have to be there on the catch Miller two of three from the line almost grabbed his own rebound but its Pitbull trailing by seven Hotel almost got taking it out over there on the sideline that his watch is off hes putting his watch back on Applause I dont know Applause inside Burton swan in from behind Wooga Poplar he went Airborne for that one now the only thing I dont like about that he could have potentially kept possession for his team Music Vincent stepped on the line another pit turnover thats nine against the Panthers today now again hes late but then the recovery yeah again you punch it out of bounds thats when I think maybe he could have kept but he wanted to let Burton know Im gonna be here nice recovery just would have liked to have him to you if youre in Miami to try to keep possession for your team Applause signed to omir he has feasted there but misses that one Applause shes driving on Miller Burton calls for the screen gets it 10 seconds to shoot Cummings pulls it out Kelly Cummings on the Move shot clock did not reset fell on the floor with three seconds left on the shot clock as we step aside a fun finish coming number 20 Miami trying to hang on seven point lead on the road geez it is both of these two teams Chase Virginia and Clemson atop the ACC standings and Malcolm this is a position that Pittsburgh has not been in in recent history in fact theyve been stuck on six wins in conference play now theyve got their seventh can they continue to push on theyve got a awesome atmosphere behind them but right now trailing by seven Second Chance opportunity Greg Elliott delivers Applause and what a play by Federico Federico not trying to force it back up off the offensive rebound kick it back out Applause long step back three and hes fouled thats the second time this half that Pittsburgh has found a threepoint shooter in the act of shooting and give it lamby three free throws well the problem is Isaiah look how shift he is I mean thats just you got to get there and hes closing out yeah he make contact right here again Federico Federico off the midst a lot of bigs trying to force this back up four guys around you kick it back out to your shooter thats a big time offensive rebound and envied by the big fella Federico you know and back to the standings for a second knocking both teams are just focused on going 10 but you and I and everybody watching knows how crucial a game this is for how these teams are finished in the ACC and yeah I think you know probably more holding home and in a Resume Builder again your top 25 Joe linardi has them right now last four and when you start talking end of season and you look at teams resumes obviously it goes a long way to be a top 25 team and you can take a look Joey brackets about where he has bit right now so again I think the implications of this game huge and the standings and obviously for Pitt theyre trying to get a resume building win tested three Henson bounces off no good long waving through traffic settles it down with Nigel patch thats been the Hot Corner for Miami doesnt continue Miller Off the Mark no good Applause Music Applause Cross Court pass finds Elliott this time takes it inside lays it off for Federico Federico and Miami now five minutes without a field goal their only points have come from the foul line Pittsburgh ramping up the defensive pressure but long ice cold he is so crafty Big Time shot taker Big Time shot maker I mean off the bounce uh youre not going to find too many better in college basketball when he gets it going hes Shifty and in his ability to raise up over you off the bounce is the reason why he is a Next Level player Music Henson for three he drills it the atmosphere in this place is rocking just like that its a one possession game the Oakland Zoo is alive trying to will the Panthers for a stop and yet Isaiah long Captain Crunch you know its coming you still cant stop it Im gonna say it again please Applause thats not bad defense defense thats just a guy that knows where he wants to get onto Court Im gonna ice you and then Im just gonna raise up over you thats just a big time Bucket from one of the best players in college or in answers right back these two teams like a heavyweight fight going punch for punch down the stretch Tim Burton saying I got you too Im a first the first team allleague guy as well too what a battle we have going on here long turns it over Elliott for three I like the move though last time and it looks like Jim larenegger is going to get a play call but the last possession of Pitt looked like they were going to double long try to get the ball out of his hand not leave uh Burton on an island out there one on one with him yeah give and go got a good look couldnt connect foul called against Miami on the rebound its pit ball Jordan Miller flagged for the foul Panthers with the Oakland Zoo behind him trailing by four but its Isaiah Wong whos been the Superstar going nuts an awesome atmosphere and Wong has scored the last seven points for Miami Mountain Huckabee hes trying to wield his Hurricanes team to the Finish Line yeah both he and jamarius Burton Burton 197 assists in this game uh the two star players for their team showing out and making great reads I think early on long was making some good reads setting his teammates up he knew it was game time now hes making some big time buckets on the other end of jamarius Burton so impressed with his allaround game a seven assists hes also got well five boards in this game as well too playing a complete game for Pitt just under four minutes left in regulation hit trailing by four thank you ball for Chad OMeara whats going to separate these two teams down the stretch individual defensive place if youre playing man youre gonna have to guard uh Isaiah Wong and then I like what Pitts doing here they just tried to isolate Burton on the post theyre trying to post him up let him use his size and strength and heres Burton he leads the Panthers with 19 call for an offensive foul wave off the basket saw that from here he got his arm out referee Yin its positioning theyre sitting right there I saw the arm come out once and then yeah no okay now he got the arm out he sold it pretty good but again they cannot extend the arm in that situation award for that one as Miller scores Applause definitely he got the arm out and I think thats what the ref saw there made that fall thats a tough break twopoint swing in favor of Miami Miller now up to 18 points now called for Chad omear thats his second everything going through Burton right now for Pittsburgh rightfully so he has been the guide again points but also his decision making if they helped Miami then hes making some good reads to set his guys up for open looks Burton causing contact again this time no call cant connect at a wide open jumper after Poplar went down thank you Applause Applause Nigel pack 10 seconds to shoot for Miami Poplar what a great play North Shadow Mirror and its an eightpoint lead for Miami 2 20 left in regulation Applause desperate for a scoreless for the last two minutes Music backing down pack Federico Federico cleans up the spill plus the foul quietly he has been huge for great on the offensive glass uh the drop down is not there and then thats a big boy grown man move right there and then you take a look at the spacing Again by Miami clear to see the excellent spacing that Miami has and thats all set up by ball movement and their ability to knock down threes you have to honor those guys and then theyre able to get into gaps and find people town no good still a sixpoint game with two minutes to go Miami trying to close out but will be an impressive Road win Applause into the lane too much on it Pittsburgh has numbers in transition hints it a three he hits it clay kenson cuts the lead in half timeout Alchemy buckle up weve got a fun finish coming here at the Peaks transition defense but Pittsburgh got the stop made him pay in transition hes in getting the stop a Pitts defense has been great in this stretch right here and then poor transition defense by Miami you cannot leave them open on a threepoint line at something uh Jim Lear Nega talked to us about this morning at shoot around he said look our transition D must be on point in this game been pretty good throughout this game but in this last three to four minute stretch theyve had some breakdowns those two combining for 38 points in this second half they are willing hit to try and come complete this comeback and I think the big number so James the turnovers uh pit early on uh they had a lot of turnovers Miami has 12 turnovers points off the turnovers in this game a lot of those were in the first half theyve cut down their turnovers and then theyve been getting stops defensively and getting out in transition uh on the other side Miami I gotta believe uh Isaiah Wong is going to have the ball in his hands on this possession right here theyre up three he has not had a shot in his last couple of possessions I got to assume Jim learney is going to send something his way off a ball screen and then get him isolated here he is shoot long right to the rim through contact he missed it tomings into the lane fading away it rolls in weve got a onepoint game with under a minute left in regulation and listen to this crowd come alive Music look at this battle Isaiah Wong against jamarius Burton us One turns it over heres Burton right to the rim hits in Pittsburgh the lead the Panthers lead for the first time in this second half Miami its a nine nothing Pittsburgh run Applause Jay when we asked Jeff Capel what this game was going to come down to he did not hesitate to say individual defensive plays that right there coming up with the turnover and then this guy on the offensive last putback that is a big time comeback by Pitt and its all set up though by their defense Applause Music two minutes and seven seconds ago Miami LED this game 6860 Music since then Pittsburgh has kept Miami scoreless and gone on a 90 run the Oakland Zoo has hit a fever pitch atmosphere again its hard to describe but this place is shaking right now it is allowed uh they are on their feet if youre Miami I think youre still going back to Isaiah Wong Miami out of timeouts when do you take the shot if youre Miami theres about a second and a half separated to the Gamecock in the shot clock long with 10 seconds left ripped away by Burton Applause individual defensive play Chef Capel said it Im gonna repeat what he said again individual defensive play jamarius Burton no help comes he stays home and makes a unbelievable uh defensive stop against one of the better oneonone players in college basketball thats a big time defensive stop by jamarius Burton Miami is about to give so this next I will send him to the line 71 seconds remaining Miami out of timeouts Pittsburgh has two Elliott the inbounder Applause and he stepped over the line its Miami ball Applause theyre going to review it but Miami as it stands would get the ball underneath their own hoop because Greg Elliott stepped over the inbounds line and uh its a huge uh mistake if he did because Jamara his burden was coming open free off a screen and that would be a really a big break now if Im Jim Lear again you put your faith in Isaiah Wong you might have to look at a Jordan Miller in this situation or somebody else get Isaiah Wong in a ball screen to get jamarius Burton off him but right now theyre reviewing yeah the ball hits the line oh man so it wasnt the foot that went over the line it was the ball hitting the line its Miami ball the officials went over and confirmed the call and that is and the Hurricanes because the review gifted a timeout they were out of timeouts now Jim larenega was able to draw something up absolutely youre right in that situation youre right gave him a timeout he did not have Applause Music Applause now if youre Pittsburgh you do have one foul to give you think about fouling here just do not want to do it in the active shooting into Miller and the foul comes Applause and thats exactly what I suspected now you dont know going to somebody else other than Isaiah Wong and again remember in that first half Jordan Miller Applause was a guy that got it going Music this was the matchup he was on and so it looks like theyre going to try to get Miller cant sign to omir ripped away foul called with 25 left back to back big time steals by Pitt Applause man activity right here with their hands great Applause another missed opportunity before Miami foreign I think the key thing youre right no time out so if youre Miami a maker Miss youre gonna have to draw up a play thats going to take you down the other end of the court and get a quick hitter to try to either tie this game or win it depending on what he does from the 3K line Applause Applause foreign Music Applause Music Applause for Miami Applause the Hurricanes the last two Saturdays have gone on the road play lost in overtime by two to NC State and by two at Duke a week ago point lead 6860 and are on the verge of losing another one possession game on the road in conference and a lot of this you have to credit Jeff Capel and Pitt uh Jeff Capel talked to us about this of the makeup of this team uh their team that is not going to get down on themselves and theyre able to recover from some adversity thats been the biggest difference typically a year past they would have folded going down eight or ten this late in the game they stuck with it big reason why though of their defense solid and then offensively they were getting higher percentage looks Music Applause Pittsburgh Trail to this second half for 19 and a half minutes took the lead with under 30 seconds to go for the first time since the first half Applause what an incredible effort by this pit team trailing by eight with a little more than two minutes to go to to find it in themselves buoyed by this tremendous crowd and now two and a half seconds away from what would be a huge NCAA tournament resume with Beverly the inbounder Miami without any more timeouts remaining into Miller Dewan for the tie no good Applause The Comeback is complete Jeff Caples Pittsburgh Panthers knocks off number 20 Miami in stunning fashion and now they stand alone as the number three team in the ACC but we talked about resume build
