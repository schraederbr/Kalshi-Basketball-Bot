Berry draws the start tonight the Freshman from State College Pennsylvania who had 25 in the road win at Georgia Tech Kevin ji Kyle filipowski get us going Bert Smith Jamie lucky John Gaffney on the whistle and away we go from Cameron and here is the Aussie sophomore Proctor to start the Music offense roach bounced past filipowski hesitated and then lost it on the dribble against Kei the noted a lineup features The Freshman Shrewsberry coach thats the same play he made against noted aame out there a couple times he got in there and lost the ball and struggled theyre going to try to make him shoot tough twos and thats a good thats what you want to try to do with J but coach would you rather just see him take that free throw line jumper right there when hes open to start the start the game its its its but either one if it goes in its yeah but if you if you drive it you get more more things good more good things going happen here is Burton speaking of driving kick out for Shrewsberry here is Davis left right corner For Eyes on the drive hell skip it for shrew Bs three three nothing Notre Dame great coaching move he starts his son and he hits the first one cant be any better than that that sounds like somebody one to that sounds like somebody speaking from experience buddy missed his first one when I started him filipowski draws the J out out front first on noted Aim so the Irish use the shot clock though in The Possession W keep an eye on that there they like to muddy the game up Cory but they want to make Duke have to defend for a longer shot clock the way that Michael Shrewsberry is building this program is similar to the way Tony Bennett have did it at Virginia roach tied to three well when youre on the road you want to use as much time as you can on the clock thats another reason why you have three guards in there youre going to handle the ball better Davis turns it over roach a hesitation back for filipowski what a Music spin Burton with some help on the perimeter and thats going to ca filipowski a foul those are the ones that filipowski has to stay away from John Shire in his second year now and you look at the great staff hes assembled I got Mike stry all the way on the left coming over from your Alma Elon former head coach of the Phoenix thank you boy Mike Shrewsberry first visit to Cameron is tonight told us today never been in this building until today tried to get in one time on a summer tour with his son it was locked up yes it was locked up when we come in for the game you got to you got to have top fight Security in the world let you in here well the interesting thing was he didnt have any problem getting in over in Chapel Hill was is able to walk right down uhhuh 53 Irish in front Nice Shot McCain on the board that young man is so advanced in his offensive game the Poise the patience that he plays with just a freshman but he plays well beyond his years Burton having a hard time breaking away from roach collects and the three spins out John sh said immediately after the loss on Saturday night he didnt think his team competed roach missed the three they fish around for it and it is Davis who comes up with it shwb had it off the row now McCain trying to find a pass sco St turnovers for baskets thats what kills you in this building coach it feels like its been a recipe for disaster a long time around here yeah you just cant give those to them theyre going to score anyway you cant give them baskets IES this is Davis Logan IES from zionville Indiana four to shoot against Mitchell threw it up missed everything WD I talk to associate head coach Kyle getter of not to Dame I asked him how many of your guys do you think are going to a little stard playing their first time in this building and he looked at me honestly said I believe we have a couple weve got to make it to the first maybe even the second media timeout and stay within distance proor Mitchell had it got it scor Duke in front four Dukes doing what they what they have to do but I think Notre Dames doing a great job they just they cant turn it over just take your time use the clock and get a good shot Iris have two of them here early this is Burton on the drive fed Kevin J he couldnt hang on to him good pass Kowski working the post nice pass McCain ends up with a three and the rebound for J Michael Shrewsberry couldnt say enough Jim about Philips ability to pass the ball yeah hes a great passer and when he does that youre just praying that Duke doesnt miss that shot too many times Burton bounces off a three for you like the looks theyre getting theyre getting Great Looks especially for a guy like B whos getting those looks and at this point not too bad only down four after making that first getting to that First Media timeout noted D showing some fight but the Blue Devils putting up a flight Jared McCain who has been great over this last stretch strong to the rack and Mark Mitchell on the offensive glass that gets the second chance points to give Duke a Music Music four Music look P please welcome into the contest number one K Applause Music buer well number nine Dukes got an early fourpoint lead here at Cameron great to be with Cory Alexander Jim bahim tonight on acc Network itll belong to the Blue Devils as we resume and Caleb Foster is on the floor for the first time Proctor checks out of the line lineup so you got roach McCain Foster Ryan young has come in for filipowski B Away by roach is going J roach has simplified his game so much in his prior years he probably would have tried to do too much on that one just gets to a spot shoots the midrange and knocks it down so heres Burton now and Notre Dame trying to answerer Duke now on an eight nothing run Davis Bo Mitchell moves his feet well Cory its been a great game against that name the first time out double double Mark Mitchell you mentioned 23 points 14 rebounds the first time around Marcus Burton had 18 on seven of 21 from the floor you see JR kesn has now checked in for Notre Dame you see Burton being awarded the ball by referee Burt Smith with a spot throw in here so Matt Zona and Jr kesn have come in as has freshman Carrie Booth he wears zero for the Irish heres Burton double team Zona a three left it on the rim Duke on an 8 nothing run that shot may have been a little rushed by zoning you cant do that against the Blue Devils because you cant set your defense when youre taking shots that your team is not expecting so Burton trying to find an alley wanted to wrap it to Zona there noted As gone almost four minutes without a score and there is Carri through his first shot rims out we need to get a score as we said Jim theyre getting good looks arent they theyre getting they werent as patient a couple times which they need to be right but theyre getting shots I was telling and they fight it offensively theres no stat that doesnt show the struggle of Michael shrewsburys first turn theres a drive and score for the Pressman Caleb Foster Caleb Foster now coming back off the bench where he started the season has been the starting lineup a lot because of injuries as of late and Luke needs to get him to find his contactable young kind of Chase Burton into a quick layup now Foster over the top of boot thats the way you find your confidence attacking the basket using your size and strength to knock a Defender off of you and then shoot the midrange pull up Caleb foston now seen it go through twice look out for him from Beyond the three yeah he its 16 in their win at pit including three threes he was actually the star of the Michigan State game as well yeah no question spotline of the garden didnt cause a problem for him kesn trying to find a pass young fighting kesn again and its a shot clock violation itll go to Duke and I would say this John sh wanted to know if they would compete I think weve seen them compete in the first theyre competing and Notre Dame is missing a couple good shots and thats they have to make those you just cant play defense against Notre Dame against D you know theyre playing it but they cant just win anywhere stay close theyve got a score down here and you know not that dke makes it easy but the very first possession or had a perfect possession and now theyre struggling a little bit get them good shot well and the Blue Devils are on a 12 nothing run and the Irish have gone 5 minutes without a point Julian roers coming to the Ball Game wearing number one for Notre name Proctor is back for Duke heres Jaylen Blanks on the drive and that got blocked by Zona alternating possession and it will belong to the Irish this is Jaylen Blakes first action Cory in better than three games and Jaylen Blakes putting his head down trying to get to the rim but give Matt zon a lot of credit coming over getting his hands on the basketball and tying the basket ball up getting possession back to the fighting ours as we see the blue doues going to full court pressure yeah and theres a takeaway and Blakes cant finish Proctor cant but Sean Stewart is fouled going to the basket for a little while there I wasnt sure the officials are whistles were working they just they just they really just kind of let things go here second foul on noted name first on the South Bend native kesn and thatll put windir Florida freshman Shawn Stewart at the line Seans going to be kicking himself when he sees that one later because that should have been a twoand flush and an opportunity for the and Music one Stewart missed the first he is now seven of 14 at the free throw line this year played just two minutes Saturday Music Applause night dug set thanks very much congratulations to the orange on the win against Louisville with Cory Alexander Hall of Fame head coach Jim beheim West Durham welcome to Cameron Endor Stadium where Duke has built an ear early 10point lead and Notre Dame is in the middle of a drought its been 6 minutes plus since the Irish last put something on the board here at Cameron eyes on the drive tried to reverse it up Zona scrambles but Foster whos got a couple of early baskets touched it last says John gy so with 1140 to go we get our second break in the action John shy thought that that might have belonged to the BL Blue Devils so instead itll stay with Notre Dame and a 155 ball game is what we have seen here so far Notre Dame got the first basket of the ball game on a three from Bron Shrewsberry but since then its been all du great to be with Cory Alexander coach Jim beheim Duke said they wanted to compete after Saturday nights loss we wondered how theyd bounced back so far so good well its hard not to compete with this building the fans and the noise and the push they get that at every game from beginning to end but Notre Dame had a perfect possession the first possession make it then they started to rush things and make turnovers and you cant do that in this building Ive been here Ive seen that happen you give them open shots easy layups its going to be a struggle but again Duke is going to play hard in this building it doesnt matter what happened the week before these fans arent going to let that happen and by the way I can bear I dont Ive never been anywhere up here like this I cant even see the players Im just Im guessing Im guessing Whos down there I had to take insurance out to climb up its not as bad as it used to be Cory we tried to tell used to Bey dick dick told me it was and you know and Im telling you its maybe its better now but its still I you know Im old I cant climb up are you saying that your first trip to the crow Nest has not been what you thought it would be well Id like it better up here than I did down there most of the time I didnt like it down there I think we have plenty of evidence it didnt go well down there so it doesnt usually go very well in here for coaches doesnt know me go very well for freshman guards either Marcus Burton coming in and you talk about a young man who has had a high us race been a great first year for Notre Dame and he is the guy that leads them in scoring and he does so much for them and assists as well but you look at what has happened in this game thus far 13 of the 15 points for the Blue Devils have been scor by their guards Burton having to go up against a great set of guards on the other end for the blue D and Burton made two explosive moves and goes right by a really good Defender and misses two layups and you know thats you make those two layups its 15 to n you dont feel bad its you know but when you miss those two and thats when it gets on the verge in this building yeah and how about the fact that this is the first time many of these guys even the Veterans for not to a this is the first time theyve got playing time in this building youre talking about Jr and then you think about Matt zon those guys even though theyve been here they havent played in this building yeah but this is Michael Shrewsberry first trip in this building he tried to get in one time in a summer trip when his son was playing a ball and he couldnt even get in the building it was locked up now one thing we do know about the ACC season Jared McCains been on a burner here Cory hes gotten so much better if you take away the first eight games of his Duke basketball career he has been spectacular averaging over 16 points a game and his rebounding has been off the charts a double double at North Carolina on Saturday he was one of the guys that John sh pointed to that absolutely did compete he needed some of his teammates to come along with them but that is the nature of Jared McCaine he does it with a smile on his face and hes got the great personality but he is a animal on that Court well and the Blue Devils despite the loss in Chapel Hill in the weird 24 hours its kind of been in the ACC d still got it all in front of them including the two principles that they have at least one game their Beach and sha Stewart starts the transition and heres the l oh my goodness 94 ft of special from sea Stewart the noted in player deflected it thats crazy John now with eight to shoot and Burton fouled by The Freshman WD Im glad Sean fouled him because I needed to see this replay the block shot and then getting down the floor taking off sprinting recognizing he was going to have an opportunity his fellow freshman tayor fost knows he can throw it anywhere because Shawn Stewart can go get it thats right the same sha Stewart that broke Zion Williamsons vertical leap record here at Duke sure did just take some time but hell get there heres Burton press it on the perimeter shires defense is really extending now with this advantage and theres J he couldnt finish against filipowski he cant finish yep 14 nothing run by Duke tried to feed Stewart and deflected out of bounds by Burton so Marcus Burton from Mishawaka right outside South Bend is getting his first taste of Cameron tonight WD not name has not scored yeah in over seven minutes three rattles out from Proctor filipowski is second chance for the Blue Devils Foster was no time talk about Koster seeing those two layups those easy ones go through and what happens thats what happens his confidence gets going he starts knocking down three balls and all of a sudden it is a 170 Run for the Blue Devils over the last 7 minutes and 40 seconds yep halfway home in this first half here is Burton trying to get around Stewart Kev chai the catch with the left hand and snaps the drought first field goal for ji and the first points in about 8 and A2 minutes Blue Devils are working the window here too yeah there you cant give them these I mean theyre going to get some rebounds you know Notre Dames not that big but when they get that thats when you get the pass out for the three thats the best threepoint shot you can get as a coach we used to actually tell our big guys dont shoot it if you get it on offensive rebound unless its a dunk throw it back out get that open three if you have good Shooters thats the percentage play free throw from steuart good dont forget a week from Saturday weve got an ACC Network triple header for he starts at 200 in Chapel Hill Virginia Tech North Carolina round two of that then Miami Boston College presented by food line and well close it down at the Peterson Event Center for Louisville and Pittsburgh 630 a week from Saturday February 17 team right here on acc Network WD yes sir you know I couldnt let that go coach bims talking about coaching his big guys to throw the basketball back out yeah until 1991 no one might watched more Syracuse games than me yeah Derek Colemans number is on the floor and I guarantee you he never threw the basketball out when did when did you start coaching I did say if you can dunk it you dunk him so he just dunked them all and we had not we didnt have shooters then we just have rebounds okay heres Shrewsberry and he loses it over the in line Derek always told me coach thats the only way I get a pass on this team I got a rebound I said well thats all right thats good pass off the glass it worked out worked all the way to the number one pick in the NBA draft six turnover by the way for Notre Dame in this first half I like how beam cracks the door for you Cory on some coaching philosophies that were established over nearly 50 years he doesnt realiz how much Ive studied him in his program WD thats what hes forgetting I wanted to go to Syracuse he wouldnt recruit me well Cory you I had to get guards that would pass once in a while you know I mean goly thank you Jim thank you so much America thanks you for that Hey listen when youre a first option you go somewhere to be a first option I hear you okay Shrewsberry in the backb brayen stepped right out of his Under Applause Armour and another name has to get their offense itll the defense will slow a little bit but you have to get points on the board I think theyre remarkably close for how bad their offense is I mean Dukes missed three or four open shots couple layups could be a bigger margin but all norre game has to do is score five or six points here and at least its manageable by the way second foul on filipowski Coach sends him to the bench with 848 to play and Ryan young back for an extended stay as brayen Shrewsberry drops home his second three of the first half yeah we talked with Kyle getter the associate head coach for Notre Dame about how many of his guys would be a little star struck playing in this building in front of the craes for the first time one of the guys that he mentioned would not be was brayen yeah its simply because again this young man is ready for this moment hes just got to have some help roach and J rebound heres Braden Shrewsberry picking it up for Burton in transition and that three for Marcus Burton what did I say get two buckets and you know at least its manageable now so that thats the other guy he said would not be scared the back court The Freshman back court for noted a would not be fearful of playing in this building theres McCain missing at the iron and Burton had it lost it over the in line TJ Power by the way from Shrewsberry Massachusetts has checked in to play for Duke against Micah shrew B and Notre Dame but the lead is nine for the Blue Devils Shawn Stewart turn this house over a block at one end and a flush at the Music other what even is this dont touch my things gross Janice when you bundle a moment ago shes beaten cancer she started her own nonprofit and uh she got to ring the bell for beating cancer here at Cameron during the timeout theres nothing better than to see something like that and all the money thats been raised and Dicky V is the guy in my mind for years thats done that and we miss him so much being out here get back here D absolutely were pulling for you Music coach 2413 Mitchells got his second field goal noted ases put some points on the board Shrewsberry and Burton have helped here in the last couple of exchang changes Marcus for another and Mitchell the rebound roach hesitated Cory defensively there a moment ago and I know Jeremys been bothered with some injuries on and off here in the last dozen games or so yeah but that jump shot has been working for him 20 points in the game at North Carolina look away for young Ryan couldnt finish look at couron scra with Mitchell Duke keeps possession in a new 20 here is Mitchell Lefty three and a third try now for the Blue Devils McCain attacks and couldnt finish thats the Ryan young effect Ryan young one of the best offensive rebounders in the ACC not playing as many minutes this season as he did a year ago but he constantly keeps possessions alive for the Blue Devils when hes on the floor TJ power in the ball game for the Blue Devils you see him is on the near side as you watch Tay Davis Drive now shuber is three and a oneandone situation for Notre Dame offensively Irish come in dead last in the ACC in field goal percentage they are second best in field goal percentage defense in conference play and Ryan young going to be called for the moving screen itll be his first and the Third on du you know I think you have to recognize the job that Mike mik shwb has done this year his team plays hard theyre not as talented theyre young they give everything they have every game and theyve had some wins and some near wins that I dont think anybody thought hes really done a really good job with his team this year and Coach hes playing a lot of freshman and so when you think about that they made the decision to go with the freshman in comparison to going the transfer portal route and even their transfers are very young players as well yeah talking about Davis Roper guys like that that have come in from other Applause programs here is Carrie Booth a top 100 guy in our ESPN rankings a year ago that got Applause blocked here is Proctor nice scoop Tyrese Proctors first basket this Duke team is a different team when Tyrese Proctor is aggressive and hes confident they didnt have an aggressive confidence tyres Proctor at North Carolina and they didnt have of course he was injured in the Georgia Tech game but if you go back and look at the way the trajectory of this new blue Dela team has been this year you have to look at the results of tyres pker in those games as well Burton slip briefly rebounds kesn and he lost it turned over by the Irish turnover number seven on Micah Shrewsberry team and there is a look at the 47yearold native of Indianapolis back in his home state now as the head coach at Notre Dame he started his head coaching career at IU South Bend which was a niia program in fact the guy that gave him that opportunity was here today to watch their workout Marcus Manning who is part of the Durham Sports foundation in this area so a nice moment for Coach to have Marcus in his group dont forget Thursday nights going to be huge on acc Network ACC PM is live from RE Coliseum at 400 and then look at the matchup at 800 pm number three NC State number 16 Virginia Tech presented by allly and thatll be followed by a live edition of nothing but net from Reynolds at 1000 Thursday night all here on acc Network the hokes in the pack should be terrific thatd thats the rematch the hokes winning the first match up in blackburg by one only a Liz kley buzzer beater so Im sure the wolf pack looking for some get back on this one absolutely just a terrific year in Wom womens basketball in the ACC where as many as 10 teams are fighting for an NCAA opportunity that ball got deflected and last touch Jamie lucky says by Duke so it will go to Notre Dame Marcus Burton going off the bounce going up against a much bigger Defender and Mark Mitchell able to get the shot over the top but if youre Duke you want to make everything difficult for the fighting irage just like that Burtons really a little smaller than I I think the program size says too got a big heart though coach hes got a big heart hes a good player he he can get by people he but you see how Dukes guarding him theyre putting Mitchell on him now he takes it around Stewart and tried to put it high off the glass Sona recovered it on the rebound I still think Stewart got a hand on that one WD yeah look at Carri boo go get it Booth W St flush now that was a a mature moment for a freshman that he could turn and make that play thats he couldnt do that a couple weeks ago that thats a big time play now about that matchup when you got Sean Stewart who who son son of Yogi Stewart going up against Carrie Bo son of Calvin Bo so we got some former NBA dads children going out there yep that ball knocked away Burton tried to make the save and that will get us to the under four here at Cameron ninepoint lead for Duke and the fresh Carrie Booth gets on the board here at Cameron with a twoand flush Duke leads by nine when we continue on acc Network okay when you turn around youre going to see some more its been an interesting well lets say 48 Hours shall we Monday night Cory had a nice seat Virginia wow beat Miami by 22 60 to 38 last night Clemsons now won two out of three in Chapel Hill jym after never winning in 59 tries its unbelievable it was a huge win for them obviously the Virginia game they were out of the tournament a week ago I remember talking about it and now theyre like an eight seed they you know one game or two well I think you might have some input on this is what I like though for you now you get to tell me who you think has got a a real opportunity now to get in the get in this run to March well theres no question in my mind were going to have five teams North Carolina Duke Clemson Wake Forest and Virginia are going to be in the tournament and now its a dog fight between Virginia Tech pit maybe Miami Syracuse as to who could also sneak in but were going to have five teams in the tournament and we deserve five teams in the tournament all right your friend Joe lonardi today well I wouldnt go that far okay Im sorry North Carolina Duke Clemson and as you said Virginia miraculously has gone from out to nine and wake is in the first four out even after the big blowout win in Atlanta last now that that wont move them needle enough weight needs to obviously win a you know they need to win a couple games but at the end of the year looking at them with the eyes they pass the eye test theyre a good team and since Reed has got there theyve obviously been much much better Sona scores off the drive after a Ryan young basket I say that to then remind you folks State Wake Saturday afternoon on acc Network that rematch going to be a battle between those two teams and especially when you consider everything on the line NC State losing tonight against Pittsburgh a game that they have to have but weve talked about Wake Forest and how they can be that 15 that we should be able to count on getting into the N tourament there goes Julian roer on the trial that got swatted back from behind by his former teammate Ryan young at Northwestern Cory well he knows the move proor and a foul underneath I think roer going to be called for the push nope theyre going to get Zona Matt Zona 69 senior itll be his first its the fourth on Notre Dame by the way his dad played for Pat Kennedy at Iona back in the day hey Pat recruited me Florida State my god oh of course you should Proctor at the line yeah I mean the list of people that are your guy is long you know who really my guy on this beheim guy on my right yeah I know that first pro was good dont forget ACC gymnastics returns Sunday afternoon 400 I dont care what it is State Carolina and gymnastics will be just as just as wired up as any other event between the Wolfpack and tar Hills and weve got it for you on accn and always available on the ESPN especially when its at State no matter what when its at State its going to be routed yep four for Pro in the first half no coach ban really is my guy hes my he is my NC tournament guy also he is my resident braist Ive got a direct line I just ask coach beheim whos getting in whos not well I think were learning that well the ACC wins games every year more than any other league and wins more championships in the last 20 years than any other league we need to recognize that I think at some point so Micah Shrewsberry team trailing 11 they get a foul called on Ryan young thats his second fourth foul on Duke and here is Tay Davis at the line first one good okay Coach lets be honest here John sh talked about competing Blue Devils trying to bounce back from the loss at Chapel Hill the energy level of Duke tonight is where in your mind oh its good but I think you got to give Notre Dame credit they were on the verge of being blown out 155 head and scored in forever and now theyre ninepoint game thats thats good in this building when you come in here for the you know with a lot of these young guys first time yeah yeah thats thing steming the tie through that beginning of the game is RO was able to knock down the jumper but stemming the tide those first couple of media timeouts not being out of the game early helps as coach said getting it to nine was a big push but theyve got to find a way now to get some stops yeah you got to get some more points scored in the locker room too at the bottom line is if Duke makes threepointers like that theyre youre not going to beat them in here you got to hope that they miss a few for you look at Kev ji with a right hand nice move 610 sophomore from Centerville Ohio came over with Shrewsberry from Penn State its a great individual play by keba but coach could do you think that that is actually part of the Playbook from mik and Shrewsberry they had that one in in the design it it worked didnt it you take credit for it that ball got knocked away Proctor turns it over look at Burton now Notre Dame trying to convert heres Shrewsberry catch and shoot back rim Miss kesn gives the Irish a second chance go back to him they work the first time Proctor digging down nope theres Chi again oops and he lost it he wanted Jamie lucky to call a push on Ryan young and hes not calling that not today not any day yeah when you have this many opportunities just to dribble in the paint and no ones helping that means that you are not a priority on The Scouting Report theyre willing to live with their chances of you scoring dead Rock 10point lead under a minute to go first half for Cameron continues in a moment hey look at this what saved nearly 750 with that kind of money we could fly south except we dont migrate no Im talking actually fly sit back relax maybe work on my novel and I wont forget the little birds out there actually yes I will Wow money changed you just keeping it real do people still say that switch to Progressive and you could save hundreds to spend on whatever you dream up 10point lead for Duke as we rejoin you from Cameron already tonight Syracuse a twopoint winner at home against the Ville and Jaylen low hit two free throws to push Pittsburgh to a threepoint win in Raleigh the Panthers were 18 of 20 at the free throw line tonight you know Pittsburghs wanton a Duke now they w at NC State yeah you know theyve done some things you know they had a bad stretch of games but theyve overcoming right now and and one of the things that my guy Jimmy brackets yes Im stealing it Jimmy brackets has taught me is winning on the road is the one of the most valuable things to the committee correct I I believe its 100 one of the most important things you can do if you can get three or four Road wins and youre on the bubble and nobody the other teams dont have that youre getting in youre getting in Jimmy brackets you know thats going to stick right by the way speaking of Jimmy brackets look at your note here Jim Trail 20 to5 theyve outscored Duke 1813 yeah has Notre name theyve done a really really good job to be in this game they could have gone completely out in the first eight minutes of the game final half minute John sh teams got about a 5 six second differential shot clock to game clock and there is a hand check foul at 20 ft on kevi well that was the foul to give yeah but Im not sure if that was the time to take it you probably could have allowed more time to go off the clock and then take that foul again yeah theyre holding the ball so you can wait until they start to initiate their play to the basket then foul and now the shot clock off off and a 10point Duke lead roach lines one up spins out J The Rebound with four heres Davis with two Shrewsberry at the horn ooh and we got a foul yes sir Caleb Foster hit Shrewsberry as he cut it Loose to commit his first five on Duke and now Braden Shrewsberry to the free throw line for the first time tonight to shoot three that was a smart play by Davis recognizing he had more than enough time to find the shooter Shrewsberry is already locked and loaded hes going to let it go and has an opportunity now to put three on the board and make this a sevenpoint game heading into the halftime locker room and the one thing as a coach you always talk about dont foul the threepoint shoot you just dont thats thats a tough thre thats a transition way behind the line dont foul that so it looks like a half seconds going to go back on the clock remember if we get down to the details here clock stops when the foul is committed yeah so even though the red light went on as the ball was released Shrewsberry and Notre Dame got a chance to cut into this deficit braddens got seven to lead the Irish in this first half theyve got a nice back court for the future hey whats uh you and Michael Shrewsberry had a nice visit today coaching your son its not its not for everybody is it well its difficult its great and youll always remember the rest of your life is one of the best things that can happen to you but youre worried about your team and now youre worried about yourself too so its a its its its a challenge its a challenge but I its the best thing Ive ever done yeah how about coaching two of your son yeah how about that how about that yeah thank goodness Julie was around eightpoint game thats the final play of the half McCains three goes wide thatll get us to the half 3325 eightpoint lead for John shs Blue Devils here you treat everybody so great its unbelievable and I will tell you he is very well beloved in this building thats shocking well thats thats because they beat us most of the time theres a three by the K and on Q Jared McCain now with seven and that was the Freshman guard that we identified an open we talked about he and Marcus Burton both the leading freshman scores for these respective teams and McCain has been at his best at late but coach heres what youre talking about now the emphasis Notre name has to answer right yeah they have to score I mean when Duke starts making threes theyre really hard to boy look at Burton Fearless on the drive wasnt he ball got knocked out of bounds they give you a little hole in this thing so you dont have here we go we got a replay of you and the straw the strawless souvenir cup here all over all over all no it didnt work he spilled it earlier though and my wife who didnt pack my pants Oh no packed her pants oh godness and I looked at him and the thing is how bad I am I almost tried to put him on thats how bad I am was a good thing that you didnt have your pants because you would have spilled Coke on them least this way you spilled it on your on your sweatpants the review by the way you see the team te go to their resped benches here the review has to do with the ball being knocked out of bounds I didnt see it cuz I was drinking my drink all over myself but here heres Burton on the drive you see the kid is fearless in traffic here but its ji getting in the mix he and Philip filipowski right here is trying to determine who the basketball was actually off of well and also did it hit the rim which it did not so theres 39 left to shoot and heres the inbounds this is Davis look at this play right out front Shrewsberry missed everything the ball got knocked out of bounds itll belong to the blue DS but thats great underneath out of bounds action by Michael Shrewsberry and of course you know hes got a lot of Boston Celtics a lot of NBA experience so he showed a little bit of it on that possession yep that definitely had some uh some Pro flavor to it didnt it the same flare screen not available Shrewsberry guarded it very well keeping the basketball out of McCains hand but it gave Mark Mitchell an easy run to the basket allowing him to play oneonone in the paint keev a j by the way draws the foul it is his first or no Tay Davis I beg your pardon its Davis 13 not J 14 and here is Mark Mitchell from Kansas City Kansas by the way his first free throw of the night gives him five points Cory I I think we had an expect expectation line for Mitchell coming into this year yes of Health number one but maybe more production now hes averaging 14 a game and 7 and A2 against the league and by the way shooting 61 from the floor in conference play I I would say sometimes you dont have to have certain stats to say youre improved hes clearly improved hes clearly improved the this the difference for Mitchell is its whats happened in the and of course Duke has played so many Marquee games what has he done in those games he didnt have his best game against Arizona here he didnt have his best game on the road at North Carolina but we mentioned he had 23 and 14 at Notre Dame hes had some big games throughout this season but those expectations for not just Mitchell but all three of the sophomores that decided to come back to school for the Blue Devils and they havent been as consistent as I believe everyones was expecting especially John sh Philip palski by the way third foul Davis to the line hes now three for three for all of his points in the ball game Jims in hard when theres offseason expectation for a kid who you know had an impact as a freshman and Mitchell I still think is having an impact on this team especially what he does on defense I think the the key is his outside shot you know hes got to get that better if he can get that better then hes going to be really dangerous we also have to remember WD Mark Mitchell was a thre man last year hes primarily been a four this season for the blue b his is able to get one to go in the paint first points for Philip palsky out the way well and that goes back to what we were talking about the consistency Kyle filipowski a to 17 points a game but weve seen him so many times throughout this season have a game where he score six then it we have a Breakout 30point game 13point lead it was eight at the Applause break Davis this is Logan IMS a freshman against Jeremy roach three to shoot I has got to go off the window hit a couple of those Saturday night in the loss at pit not here roach oh Mitchell slipped the screen skip for Proctor three and what what a play by filipowski to keep it alive from behind J with the right hand nope and Davis out of there with it heres Shrewsberry straight away Applause same thing as the start of the game nor again cant score you have to score noted a shooting under 40 from the field on the season struggled also from Beyond a threepoint Arc and that has been the challenge for the fighting irvis this season we talk about them playing with so many freshman and guys who are new in their roles and is affected their offense much more so than their defense yeah both second half fouls on noted Amber against Tay Davis and here are the numbers and we told you the offensive stuff is not pretty in League Play especially dead last in all four of these categories on the season not Dame averages 14 turnovers per game coach thats a byproduct of Youth correct a little bit yes and and you know I you have to give them credit for their defense their defense they dont give up they keep playing even when they dont score theyre still playing hard on the defensive end and thats coaching thats a great hes doing a great coaching job with this team period yeah you can have seven wins and have a great coaching year you know and some years you can have 30 wins and not have a great coaching Shrewsberry knocks down another three thats his third of the ball game hes got 11 now I tell you what Michael Shrewsberry did a great job recruiting out of his own household you can pay him you can pay him oh yeah I watched you pay buddy at be jam dont think I wouldnt go bring that up 100 here here is the foul in traffic on Jive thatll be his third great ball move with Burton and you helping off the ballside corner everyone is against it especially when its a shooter in that corner by the name of Braden Shrewsberry whos already knocked down a couple threes now his third three on the evening by the way I I need to say this mikah Shrewsberry quoted in the preseason as saying that Braden gets his confidence from his mom hey understand yeah what dare I say that Buddys confident came from Julie no he just you know he he when you make shots you know how does how does a player get confidence right when make shots sure and they asked me once in a while when I was coaching well cant you give him some no he cant make anything I cant give him confidence its like putty if you cant make a 5 foot putt I cant help you you got to be able to make them then youll get confidence WD listen I dont know buddy beheim as well as as of course his father does but I know buddy well buddy had Confidence from day one he had confidence when he was playing for the Aly City rocks yeah Marcus Burton a three hes now in double figures well Buddys mother made him shoot on those tight cops when he was young I didnt do that which is why he got the confidence from jul no question there we go answered my question heres Burton brayon back for Burton the rookies handling it and left it on the front rim for no today that that felt like a bit of a momentum chance for the Irish that went by the board if he hits that at six yeah its already in single digits so I honestly would have liked to see Micah let I mean forgive me BR let that one go B palski could not finish ended up under the basket heres Notre name another chance and this is carry Boo for three its too strong so theyve had two cracks at it but if youre going to beat the Blue Devils in this building youre going to have to make threes if you look at teams who have one here they have shot the basketball extremely well McCain nice Jared McCain with nine and a bit of a stare for Shrewsberry no doubt about it was a stare down vetan ref wasnt going to call it I guess 11point game now I think thats your first shot at the official in this game coach no theyre this is a great crew theyre you know theyre going to let them play theyre not going to call that hes all the way underneath Carrie Booth almost 7 ft tall bothered by Mitchell recovered J swatted out filipowski nice Play heres the lead for flip Spin and foul by Burton second on Burton four on the Irish oh no Tony Green what are you doing oh look oh what are we doing the game ends up being 66 60 and our man ripped off the coat that is a iconic moment WD so iconic it has been in the jacket are you kiding got it here right here how long have you had this well I I keep it for special occasions I love it are you kidding me how long have you had it Ive had it for a while we save it save it for the big occasion the original occasion the original jacket we sold on an auction for 15000 for the charity is that right at your Gala in Syracuse right g yep y wow how about that that is an iconic moment and now theres a iconic jacket oh my gosh well you know I now lets go back Cory break this down for me okay let me break it down for you first of all the manager took a shot yes yes yes I mean thats a felony in a number of states were not going to talk about that however you see how quickly he moved WD yeah he didnt move that quickly when Im trying to get him through security coming back from and mind you were in waiting in the restroom line for 10 minutes trying to get back but he wasnt moving as quickly now yeah look at that huh I tell you what I was watching that game at home live I couldnt believe that and that was fun not as much fun as what were having right now Tay Davis on the drive hes got six now its his first field goal its a 10point game noted a had a chance to cut it to six twice filipowski had it blocked thats Davis on the rejection by the way jayen Blakes back on the floor here in the second half for Duke Mitchell pushed it up off the window and in but Blakes getting minutes right now because John C as he talked about he wants guys that are going to compete so hes had a different rotation in this game than what weve seen over the last few games he knows that Jaylen Blakes is going to compete whenever hes on the floor well Blakes of course playing for the first time in four games he played 13 minutes a year ago but he was a defensive stopper in Shys first campaign heres Burton little pull up on Mitchell boy he got a nice game hes hes a really good player thats a really good Defender against him and hes still got the shot good 10point game heres Philip palski double team now Mitchell and Carri boo will draw the foul that is first on Booth Mark Mitchell maneuvering on that short Corner roll able to finish off the glass and then Burton going up against Mitchell whos given away about a foot in height still is able to score over top of the bigger Defender so you agree with Coach that the height might be yes okay Im not even sure what they list him at but regardless its still too tall 511 Marcus B not even close whatever they list him at he hes not but Mitchells huge Mitchell gets his third free throw five in the game nine five and a half nine in the game now for the sophomore this young man and an early list of maybe potentially one of the more versatile players in the ACC left the second one on the front and I think if Duke is going to stay in that front group here guys Mitchells going to be a big part of it I believe Mitchell will be a big part of it but I also believe proor is going to be a huge part of that its going to be that sophomore class along with Philip palski that really Duke will have to follow youre going to get the production from the senior J and youre going to get consistent production from Jared McCain its those sophomores they will determine how much success this Duke team has proor all the way through with the right hand tyres nine now for Tyrese Proctor first points of the second half lead back to 11 for Duke Burton has had a couple terrific jump stops for baskets here in the last couple of sequences and Blakes knocked that away Burton had it couldnt control now Michael sh bar really Off the Bench about to call well that happened right in front of the coach and he was 2 ft away I dont I dont think hes wrong here is Burton now watch the ball move Music Applause here oo what do we think Cory right hand to Marcus Burton I couldnt see it that good I mean I I think I thought it was going to be Notre Dan Ball but after watching that Im not so sure yeah but youve stood in that spot before well we just showed it actually youre the coach you think its your ball no matter what happen it doesnt matter thats what hes thinking so 11point game on The Possession for Duke filipowski just bullying Davis look at this shot wow off balance and a bit Ric for flip thats about the fifth time weve seen flip go left and spin back to his right is that something that in the scotting report youre telling your team when hes going downhill no coach shwb said today were going to force him to take the tough shot over us and thats exactly what hes theyve done and theyve done a great job hes turns it over Foster for three too strong kesn couldnt get it Stewart does tap f for AP were going to get a timeout Michael Shrewsberry wants one his team Trails by 13 and Kyle filipowski sparking the Blue Devils not everyones training for a gold medal triple header of ACC basketball and this is a week from Saturday which by the way is Michael Jordans birthday hey 200 start Chapel Hill Virginia Tech Carolina 400 presented by food line Miami at Boston College and then Louisville at pit 630 all for you right here on acc network streaming live for you on the ESPN app we told you we got NC State Wake Forest as far as our ACC network coverage this Saturday from the Joel Steve Forbes his team last night taking names in Atlanta and listen that is a NCAA tournament team I dont care how you look at it what numbers you want to make that is a tournament team that Steve fors has put together in Winston s yep 100 100 right coach 100 that means it is Jimmy brackets Music appr man heres carrye boot sliding Baseline back out for Imes The Freshman step in two no good liking the drought in the first half coach Notre D getting good looks just not hitting shots theyre doing a great job on defense they just theyve got to you got to score points to win here here roach slides around at the foul line and heres Logan IMS digging out of rebound WD you talked about you know this being of course the first game after the Carolina game and how much energy is expended when you play against North Carolina the Duke North Carolina matchup y i coach I dont think weve seen Dukes best performance here either they may have a little bit of a hangup theyre just not going up against the same level competition that the tar Hills faced last well they all about making shots they they missed a lot of shots that they normally make and part of it I think is Notre Dame is a the defensive team theyre a good defensive team they gave him trouble at South Bend poose game theyre not letting Philip psky get to the basket it goes back to what Michael Shrewsberry when he talks about wanting to get the game in the mud I think at times Notre Dames able to do that sustaining it is different here is Foster on the steel and flush WD I was excited to watch that one I had the opportunity to Coach Kayla Foster when he was in sophomore in high school and I asked him simply can you dunk so I was waiting to see if he was going to get up on that one he gave us a little something slide sof very soft 15point game heres Booth teas one up from Deep Proctor had it lost it to J ja got away with one on that one that was a lot of arm on that too strong for Burton but those are the type of plays coach you got to take advantage of right you get that wide open three yeah theyre not going to get a lot of open shots when they get an offensive foul called by John GNE I think this is on a forarm extension on Ryan young and it is well Caleb Foster getting into the passing Lane and I Coachman oill another goth Mill used to do that name some horses are certain courses Kyle filipowski maybe in Notre Dame maybe that just didnt work sometimes Jim theyre just making him take the tough little shot after the spin move and U trying to shoot over him and theyre doing theyve done a great job on him if Kyle can get to the basket hes going to score all day so make him take that in between shot tough two and you know some games hes going to miss him some games hes going to make but thats Notre Dames best chance to win the game let him have those shots the coach you know when you have a guy who struggled against a team in a previous matchup do you think they often press a little bit is that whats happening with flip toight I dont know I I I just think he missed a couple early and then you start thinking about it heres truberry boy look at Stewart dig in and now heres filipowski and got Stripped by Shrewsberry so he did not get the easy basket and hell have to go to the line to earn the points and a great job defensively by Sean Stewart just getting his hand in the mix and the nice kick ahead to flip I would like to have seen flip not slow down speed up and take off on this one and have Shrewsberry have to meet him at The Rim in comparison to giving him an opportunity to strip him down low that is six fouls on Notre Dame its the third on the Indianapolis sophomore Tay Davis and here is filipowski and the back R miss when things are going bad then you miss your free throw too its just one of those nights sometimes look it we just passed the Midway point the ACC season right I think this guys First Team all ACC yeah I think RJ Davis is First Team all ACC Cory Im going go with RJ Davis is ACC player of the year but go ahead keep going uh I think PJ Halls proven hes probably First Team all ACC uhhuh but KY filipowski night in night out is at the top of the Scouting Report when Duke plays thats the guy absolutely as talented as they are 30 is the guy and hes the preseason ACC player of the year so he should absolutely be there at the top of each and every team scouting report and the the fact that the Blue Devils have a 16point lead without him playing well just speaks volumes to how good this team can be four to shoot IM is in trouble again with cord doing a nice job and he stepped out of bounds if Im John Char tonight Jim Im incouraged by Shawn Stewart whos come in and competed but Im also thinking about Ive seen Caleb Foster play well Ive seen you know kind of another effort maybe here from Tyres doctor that he was looking for Mark Mitchell has played hard theyve competed which he questioned Saturday night after the Los in Chapel Hill the defense has been good you know they they theyve competed I dont like it too much when people say they didnt compete because I think most of the time the players do compete sometimes thats a motivational tool coaches will use when you lose a game you dont want to say well we just werent good enough so you got to say something in that situation and say well we we got to compete better or something shoot that or something roach gave him their largest lead of the Night by the way now at 18 so are you telling us that coaches arent always telling the whole story when they get in front of us coach is that what you saying number one they definitely dont and number two the players are never sure actually whats going on so you dont you dont always want to ask them either Tay Davis couldnt finish rebounded by Roper and hell be left standing for three they just cant make a shot and filipowski is going to be called for the hold on Kev its going to be the fourth on flip thatll get us to a timeout at Cameron Blue Devils by Music 18 all right back with Cory Alexander and Jim baheim all right heres a look at the top eight in the ACC this is updated by the way to reflect the win earlier tonight by Pit in Raleigh and also the fact that Syracuse went to six and six tonight coach held off the cards who were hot shooting at the JMA Wireless Dome on a chilly night in central New York the cards are playing better you know they have some players they very slow start but theyve been playing better but you know you you just got somebodys going to emerge in there at the end of the year but you you know North Carolina Virginia do you know theyre going to be there Clemsons going to get back up there and wait for us but somebody else is going to emerge its not too early to start thinking about though Cory lost differential as it relates to the four you can talk about one and two and three all you want but the four teams that get the double by have proven to have an advantage since the ACC expanded beyond the uh the 12 schools but we also have seen a 5c winning twice that is correct Georgia Tech and Duke Georgia Tech and Duke jackets and pandemic Duke in Brooklyn what was Duke last year was Duke of five seat again last year uh Duke was tied for third last year they could have been a five seat could have slid down Id have to go back and look at that we had a foul we had a foul by the way but we know they won Brian Young its his fourth we know they won it last year that is correct they did and I dont remember them having a double bu I got to get our research they may have done it twice Georgia Tech did it without the Double B but there was a cancellation Duke was a four seed last year they did have the double b okay appreciate our producer Alex fortino with some sharp research there UA got okay there you go welcome thank we got we got the Cavaliers covered in this event didnt you get enough the other night heres Mitchell a line drive for hes zone of the re and the free throws a moment ago for morer make it still an 18point game he missed them Music both by the way were talking about ACC all ACC maybe were seeing two of the all rookie all freshman team members here tonight heres Mitchell kick out for Proctor and Marcus Burton and Jared McCain for sure I believe that is absolutely going to be the case seeing those two guys on the all rookie team this year the problem for Burton is the turnovers and again he has to do so much on the last possession just trying to do a little too much there where theres no opening trying to get through bigger Defenders fouls on Davis not Marcus Burton I believe and that is four on Davis all here in the second half and that is now seven by my count on Notre Dame got seven team fouls so one and one for Mitchell heres another thing when that all rookie team are there going to be two pit Panthers on that team because of course Bob Carrington who started out the the game I mean the season with the triple double he was spectacular all throughout the nonconference at the beginning of ACC play but of course we think we talk about I gu Jaden low who could be on that team also Mitchell missed the front end we just AR going to put five guards on there yes we are coach guards rule the world you were a guard what do you mean you played the point I yeah but I never dribble the ball heres Sona for three nope back rim Miss McCain the rebound Proctor he lines up a triple and Zona collects the deflected rebound of Tay Davis Notre Dame came in here Losers of six straight eight of nine and Zona missed that three duke has won three of four 11 of their last 13 theyre three and one at home against the league and 10 and2 overall and you look at noted a shooting 294 4 from the field how much of that is Dukes defense and how much of that is just the fact that not Dame is an inexperienced team coming into a tough envirment Bert Smith with a whistle from Music underneath its Tay Davis and thats five So Tay Davis is going to foul out dont forget a big night tomorrow itll start Taylor tanon bomb has accm live from William Neil Reynolds Coliseum in Raleigh one of the greatest places to play in ACC history Reynolds Coliseum was awesome Yep nothing against PNC however they dont get PNC rocking like they did a terrific womens game presented by Ally follows and then nothing but net after the game that means the Hall of Famer muffin McGraw Kelly gramlick Ivory lad Kelsey rigs all on site at Reynolds Coliseum tomorrow night here on acc Network all I know is I lost my last college game in RS Coliseum you did not know that I know that coach tell them who it was to final of the regional to Duke in we LED late in the game when was that March of when about 1920 was it no no 6 the year Texas Western won the whole 66 66 y coach beim and the orange fell to the blue doubles of Vic buis coach was day oh Marcus Burton stepping up knocking down the three ball noted Dame looking to try to see if they can get something going here 520 remaining yep coach was Da being on that team also yes he was thats why thats why we got that you guys were same class correct yes young turns and scores hes got four David only averaged triple double 29 11 and 10 jeez Cory I got a note that ties all that nicely together for you here okay well you always got a nice dou for under five here is Mitchell on the drive against kesn and it fell out six for Ryan young four in a Applause row and it has to do with the history of Notre D and Duke believe it or not because here is Burton and the Irish on the attack the first time that Duke and Notre Dame ever played was a neutral sight game at Chicago stadium in February of 1965 theres Carrie Boo for three his second field goal of the night this was the year before coach Bams final season right the game was 101 to 88 I like it in 1965 I like that no threepoint line correct the Irish were coached by Johnny D Jay Miller had 23 Ron Reed had 21 for noted name Ron Reed would later go on to play Not only in the NBA but pitch in two World Series for the Philadelphia Phillips okay the Duke team that night got a combin 67 from Jack Maron and Steve Venda yes and then got 21 from Bob ver thats the team we played in 66 burer had 25 and V Maron 21 the sync had 15 or 16 but Ill never forget that game we LED late and missed a layup and they came right down and scored and we just kind of just felt that may be this I tell you what I dont know any of those names and no disrespect but I know a guy that you talk about numbers especially for the Duke Blue Devils dick Gro oh yeah and you want to talk about a two sport star no question no question about that so we going to talk two sport stars of the history of Duke basketball you got to talk that name whose jersey happens to be hanging in the Rapp absolutely its its amazing when you think about Ron Reed though because he was what 67 something like that right Jim been that big yeah pitched in two World Series for the Phillies in the80s played in the NBA how long did Dick Roo do Pittsburgh basketball 40 years a wonderful Gentleman by the way just a tremendous tremendous man the nicest and we lost him a couple of years ago and hes just remembered so fondly of both Duke and in Pittsburgh and as Cory told you yep to Duke and Notre Dame tonight and it involves Micah Shrewsberry who was a brad Stevens assistant you see from 07 to 11 so that means he was a part of Butlers two runs including Indianapolis Cory in 2010 and of course thats the night that Gordon haywards upset bid spun out and Duke won the national title with John shy right who was a not a good player a great player a great player I dont think people recognize John shy scored over 2000 points in his college basketball career that is difficult to do that means youre getting busy as a freshman to be able to do that especially in a program like this y look back at that night sh had 15 in the national championship game that was a very good Duke team too Kyle Singler that team the who was the alltime winningest player in ACC history mhm until K Clark broke that record last year in his Five Seasons Singler did it in four 13 by the way for Braden Shrewsberry four of 10 from the floor his first twopoint goal of the night makes it a 14point Applause game heres filipowski to the slice on MIT what a good looking pass that was coach he is a very very highlevel passing and that action set up we saw that same play on the the first possession of the second half where McCain was able to knock down to three ever since then not a concerned about Jared McCain Mar having opportunities to slip right to the Rim 16point game Burton another jump stop short jumper good boy Mar Burton hes going to be a heck of a player hes got a really good game really good got 19 tonight on eight of 17 from the Music floor he gets to his spot and gets his shot which thats not easy to do for a freshman or sophomore junior Applause sometimes long three out front for roach Mitchell will clean it up against eyeses feels like Burton even though it might come in a losing effort is kind of pass the Cameron test tonight too cord yeah we knew he would not be afraid of the moment he and Shrewsberry definitely showed up for this game 11 now for McCain and Mark Mitchell with that last offensive rebound he double double so hes had double doubles in both matchups against noted a this year y nowhere near as many points in this one but still has had a big effect on this game 16point lead for the Blue Devils and a foul on McCain and Jared McCain freshman from Sacramento his first thats four on Duke look ahead the Blue Devils this is feels like an important threegame home stand for John shy BC here Saturday oh Cory oh yeah oh next Monday night oh big Monday baby well be here well be in the mix as Wake Forest comes in the Demon Deacons have been on big Monday before they were on the first big Monday of the Season at in Chapel Hill and it was not the performance that Steve Forbes wanted from his team see off the ball McCain is shaking up on the play heres a look Carri Booth the screen oh just kind of a Shrewsberry ran McCain into the screen and collision that got McCain and Booth colliding who did they call the foul on they didnt call a foul there is no foul called he had his hand up the referee had his hand up over there foul was called on McCain I cant imagine that theres being anything extracurricular on this one though I mean that was just a thats a good screen yeah he said a good screen McCain I think hits him a little bit with his elbow but I wouldnt I think thats you just let that go yeah I agree with you coach I I dont think anything extra will come from this itll just be the common foul I mean Shrewsberry does yeah I mean its a veteran play by Shrewsberry to push McCain into the screen thats what I dont like to see Jared McCain holding his head as he goes down it definitely was Shrewsberry that pushed him in thats a vet move right there thats good move so Jamie lucky and Bert Smith having the once over at the table and well see what they come away with here whats Music he well there it is so get called for an 11 for a flagrant one thats it and and shuber can only laugh at that thats not a flagrant one he pushed him thats all he did he pushed him I I agree I think if you walk away from that is it with the offensive foul on Michael Shrewsberry I believe that thats that could be the right call but you know look at Mich he can only laugh at that Coach I mean again I I I definitely did not see flagrant one on that Im not good on the rules either because they called the foul on but when you go to the when you go to the review you can change it if youre going over to look at the action you can change it if the foul is called you can turn it on to someone else if theres a flagrant action I didnt think it was a flagrant action but I did think it was offensive foul see that that must be why you call it a flagrant because if you cant just change it to a regular foul by the way Jared McCain so thats thats what hes doing got them both right as as a good friend of mine Coach K used to say the basketball Gods said that was a bad call and he missed both free throws is that right yeah right my good friend rashed wace simply said B dont lie the philosophy of Coach K and rashed Wallace is never really congruent first of all I would not quote rased hey thats my guy coach thats my God he was a great player but I wouldnt quote him well I dont know coach it was pretty you know hes very quick and efficient with the statement here is the foul line jumper that is roach and NES kind of fished it out as we go inside of a minute to Music Applause play Booth three spins out rootes the rebound notan got a lot of great looks in this game just unable to knock him down Duke didnt shoot the basketball extreme only four of 18 for three for them there Notre Dame Notre Dame actually shot it better 7 to 26 from three but only 345 from the field yep Mitchell fouled on the play thats Burton and couple of free throws coming for Mark Mitchell on Burtons third so coach as we get down now Duke of course with a 16point lead but still playing trying to score is this efficiency time is this what youre doing here right now I dont think so I mean I I dont think so duks duks in the tournament and theyre going to be a good seat I dont think you do that but I dont know I Mitchell the free throw dont forget nothing but net Saturday night after were done with basketball Kelsey r Joel Barry Luke Hancock Carlos Boozer will be there to recap whats going to be a seven game Saturday in the ACC theyll do it at 830 on acc Network and the ESPN app and Luke Hancock and Justin Walter is going to recap the three games on the card in the ACC when were done and by the way during the dead ball JT Kelly Thomas Crow Thomas Hatton and Alex Wade and Tony Sanders have checked in for Notre Dame nice Michael Shrewsberry you bring some of these WalkOns here you guys get to go up and down the floor a couple times a camera I
