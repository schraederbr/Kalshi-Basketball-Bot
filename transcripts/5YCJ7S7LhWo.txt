important matchup and a fired up Zoo you were trying to rile them up pregame a little disappointed with the Oakland Zoo they say its the zoo against you well let me tell you something that you is going to be Wake Forest they are a talented skilled offensive team Roger Ayers tosses it up Federico Federico wins the tap back to Nellie Cummings pit in white at home and up we go he told the Jerome land in the building he will be with us here later on this first half Music driving on Andrew Carr kicks for Greg Elliott boy hes got a good looking stroke you get a pink touch you collapse the defense Elliott moves to an open area he is a worldclass threepoint shooter 40 from the three in ACC playing threeyearold Marquette transfer you see his numbers for the season and now wait goes to work look out Demari Monsanto doesnt get the roll hes the best threepoint shooter in the ACC and he is a volume threepoint shooter Ive got here does a great job of relocating and being shot ready Barton skips into the corner Cummings backs it out for Hinson Cummings hes been cold recently yeah both of these teams play with really good space he is always expressive he connects a couple early triples for Pitt yeah I call him a floor gamer hes a power forward with perimeter skills can shoot the three terrific rebounder with a big physical body Matt Marsh the England native missed the Bunny at The Rim Marsh is a good Rim Runner and theyre going to put him in a ton of ball screens because he can tag the roller that opens up the three Hanson deep one wide right and out of bounds belongs to wake Jeff Capel hes got his team at 137 overall six and three in the ACC Joe Leonardi right now late January he has them in and uh we were talking about the starting group youve got dictionary definitions for all the guys Jeff Caples got yeah everyone plays like someone but also like the Emily Cummins hes a ball guard what is a ball guard a ball guard is a guy that can facilitate and score hes got to think facilitate first for tomorrow hes a ball guard but hes a guy that thinks Score first but does have the ability to facilitate averaging over four assists a game in ACC play Blake hits in the floor four gamer but this 15 older more mature place with great pace and great Trust Burton missed it in close Ken Hildreth back down with it the sophomores second leading scorer hes got the only two for Wake Monsanto good on his second attempt 41 he hits seven threes in the loss this weekend and were sitting in shoot around today and Jeff Capel said we are not going to leave Monsanto arrive on the catch make him put it on the floor really good execution by Wake Forest Cummings cant answer Andrew Carr the rebound hes got a big distribute first and then after he gets others involved the game will become easier for him gets involved defensively there Steve Forbes meanwhile its year three he is talkative as other we tried to mic him up he didnt buy that were still working on that for later on this season and a definition for his starting five as well yeah when you look at this Wake Forest team uh you know youre talking about a team thats young a team thats developing but Kyrie Appleby he is a ball guard and again a ball guard is a scoring fourth guard go over the facilitator and then youve got Andrew Carr as the floor gamer at 6 10 he can put it on the floor he can stretch defense uh hes so versatile and I think versatility for both of these teams youre going to see both of these teams play Four out but the court spread a lot of middle ball screens and then playing off of that penetration very similar in terms of the style of play for both ball screen defense and health defense would be key in this game are his Burton whistled for an offensive foul so both teams trade one of those with two guards we talked about right off the top Appleby and partner Appleby lets fly and he reigns one down shoot about 36 percent of the three really good off dhos Google handoffs and ball screens has a really good feel for the game second three for Blake Henson he had four of them Saturday against Florida State thats what makes him such a hard matchup Mike because youre talking about six seven big body rebounds the ball can beat you on the bounce up and stretch to defense I love Hensons game tipped Away by Federico or not the bounce loves the midrange too strong Applause we knew there would be threepoint shooting in this one it is not disappointing car no Federico clears it both teams will look to push both things will look to shoot the three in transition Elliott is second as well four triples for Pitt and a timeout wake Force Music Applause in transition youve got to find Greg Elliott where else simple class Pitt has knocked out four threes already here at home against wake and for the Panthers it is a much different shooting team from last year totally different shooting team out they play with Greta Spacey they share the basketball and theyve got shot makers but Steve Forbes is absolutely Furious because we sat in shoot around today they talked about running pit off the threepoint line arriving on the catch making guys put the ball on the floor and the start of this game defensive transition bang wide open three for Elliott paint touch kick out bang threepoint uh threepoint of her hits and so attention to detail you go on the road the little things right now the attention to detail for Wake Forest is not there and the result four threes to arrive on the catch is that effort or is it ball watching or some combo report well its its basically where the balls passed you got to move on the air condo pass so get the balls in the air so if you follow up with your eyes youre going to be late and then it is basically its effort stop the ball defensive transition get matched up know who youre guarding you got to run the pole with Elliott or hes going to bury threes all night down to Blake Hensons got two Nike Nikes into the game for Pitt Off the Bench and deviant Williamson for wake a couple very good sixth men here in the ACC so Mandy skips Elliott his third already done a great job they created the mismatch with Marsh obviously on sabandi sabandi gets a paint touch puts the defense in rotation which results in an easy three and Hildreth answers with two at the cup he is so physical and hard charging sophomore from England its like a tower point guard gotta take the back key down its got a little villain Noble in this game and since third as well and how about this start for Pitt all of its points from d it is raining threes right now youve got to close and now make the pit offensive players put the ball on the floor what a great start to pick and Jeff capels Squad car offensive foul its Henson who draws it kick out step in Bang what were seeing right now Mike is a really unselfish pit team getting pain catchers moving the defense and making the right play you mentioned unselfish you use this phrase with Jeff Capel today like the ball having energy and moving it and sharing it when the ball has energy you get a good shot good things happen but the ball gets stuck all right the result most times is a quick shot a bad shot a first side shot and a contested shot he felt like Saturday against Florida State they did that early on when they built a 10point lead and then maybe didnt do it against Florida State switching defense yeah what happened is Florida State is everything on the perimeter and basically whats happened is pitch is then seem to switch instead of moving the ball one more time getting reversed one more time they got stuck attacked the oneonone and really ended up taking a contested shot even though you have to switch you can get the ball reversed all right you can make an extra pass swing one more time and move these guys how about this drive right here heres Burt what does he do gets in the paint all right attracts too when you retract two they look basically playing a score on three behind Baseline out of bounds was drawn up with two on the timer and Greg Elliott did not get it off in time it appeared they will go to the Monitor and have a look at this Jeff capels already pleading his case theres a little negotiation going on most times they do not negotiated with officials many times in my life most times you lose its not a its in its not like a court of law where you know you actually get a chance to challenge the decision but uh you know right now I look at Pitt everything that Pitt talked about all right heres the lodge short clock Music that is no basket Music did not get an office that these guys want to come over here we can help them out all right guys official college basketball Great Communicator you have Roger Ayers on your game all right if you knew the game for some good handsome you just focused on coaching the team there were some other guys that you know you might say I might need to help him a little bit we get word no bucket you could have told him that could have saved us five minutes Mike whats your take on the start of this game pit shooting wise youll take that every time you dont think that six of eight from deep is going to be sustainable but an excellent start and what Jeff cable said to his team at the end of shoot around we need 40 minutes of energy because they got off to a great start Saturday as well so whats the challenge for pick Im gonna put you into coach and see now whats the challenge getting stops but Ill tell you what the other challenge for pit is all right you have the ball moving its got energy youre knocking down shots stay the course continue how did you get here you got here and Coach cable talk to us about this hes got here but we make selfish making the extra pass get paying touches and playing the head of Defense stay the course its got another pretty good look there for Elliott who misses that time from Deep wakes got it within six after that Marsh Lane and Marsh trying to haul in another one underneath to stay with the Deeks with middle ball screens very big part of Wake Forest offense good job of Marshall hes pretty good at making those dunks by the way I mean you think about it the number of field goals hes made in the number of dunks hes made its an incredible percentage so hes now got 44 made buckets this year 35 of them are dunks and about half of those on alley oops Applause Music that gets fouled by hits it Music uh that you could call this high percentage theres a high percentage Yeah you know like you put him in position to play to your strength so whats Marshall what whats his role out there hes a middle ball screener a slot ball screener and a rim Runner off of that and why do you roll hard you roll hard because if the defense tags that role because someones stepping out could say pie apple Bs at 35 or 36 threepoint shooter if you tag that role you give up to three if you dont tag the roll he gets it up so thats a big part of Wake Forest Stoppers so youre saying look past six points per game the the value he provides and oftentimes opening up that skip pass yeah he gets other guys shots kind of like what you do when you set me up hopefully successfully very successfully I told you this is gonna be the longest two hours of your life well we powered up on pregame pierogies since uh I left him which was what how long ago were not going to go there okay Im very well preserved for my age Dave Santos no off the glass and Hildreth the rebound wait trying to make it a onepossession game keldert attacking for two stopped the ball earlier and held just began using that big body and you know we talked about the last two possessions right good slip right there Diaz Grand Theft he is grabs minutes up last five games 11 minutes a game why because he has some left and protection at the rim and he is a very good Rim Runner and a very good passer from the high post side photo received from the Canary Islands so theyre playing Harvard as a driver good hard step out though Bryant yes Graham came over at corner drills one from the wig its a onepoint game floor gamer Baker can step out and knock down the three heres the middle ball screen here this is Bert at his best great pass Santos made Santos the sophomore from Geneva Illinois working the Baseline yeah really good job what happens come up that high ball screen Burton gets a pain couch Santos whose Defender turns his head easy scoring opportunity its really been important for Santos because he looks like hes ready to contribute has struggled making shots you see the ball go in thats positive Mildred thats not his playoff Target thats not his thing thats a settle right there thats a win for the defense too strong on a transition triple and Mildreds the board and thats a win from defense shot fake get a paint touch Get It reversed Music Applause great pass to Zach Keller The Freshman getting some more on him early in the season whos playing something very good Defender could step out and shoot the three another big body I like the substitution to play against Grand Diaz because I think thats uh a matchup that that he can hold his ground for Keller good catch underneath by Diaz Graham and he nearly got the role as well he will go to the line on the other side when we will have some royalty kind enough to join us Jerome Lane being honored tonight just moments ago during this break and nice enough to stop by uh cheers to you my friend cheers to you and Raph I cant one thing this is Diet Coke its not drinking diet coke after youre done how are you Im doing excellent whats it like uh 35 years its been since that moment uh just think man all accolades that I done here and they just remember to dunk more than anything I mean Im serious I dont even anybody knows AllAmerica NBA but that dunk that was an iconic moment what does pit mean to you though I mean you know you came here and helped basically build this program to a National Elite level what does pit mean to you well okay I was the best Robin on this team so I have to get most of the praise and to Charles Smith I mean he he really took a lot of Personality for the rebounds because he demanded a double team so Charles I was Rob the best property he probably ever had in his life no doubt about it how about that play Sean Millers plan right now by the way hes up 3924 against UConn so hes probably making a trip give to you today by the way his teams playing but what do you remember most about as that play was emerging what do you you have any recollection of seeing the play seeing Elaine what what was your thought processor well you got to think about I was up in the underneath trying to rebound and one son got the ball I took off because I know hes trying to give you a pass if youre running so I know if I get out there for because the music was ahead of me so I could get up there and head toward to me 32minute delay whatd you do oh at the halftime he was trying to get me to come you know run around the court do some goofy stuff in game I didnt know before the uh start the game I wouldnt do it unless they came out together thats pretty cool Matt do you know what thats lent today that would have been a great nil opportunity you couldnt did anything you know but these days I probably ran up to the Superman you know too small yeah yeah yeah but back then you couldnt do that Diaz Graham drops one in Pitts up by four Midway through this first half as we visit with Jerome Lane being honored today weve got the shirts on that were handed out to the first one thousand students in the Oakland Zoo the Pint glasses we had our toast here courtside at the peak when you watch these guys play what do you see like you you played on great teams this is kind of a little bit of a Renaissance the basketball I have seen before Canada took over yeah he took over before damn whos so bad I would turn on the TV at halftime none at least be competitive you know were very competitive I would be in the games you know what Im saying we got chances to win thats all Im asking for compete so I think hes on the right page hes going up you know what Im saying as far as getting a team to go just stay at an upbeat coming short he has Graham and clean it up Keller clears it for way okay were talking about how people sometimes forget how great your career was some people might not know your journey and come in here as well and then positional change the thought of a transfer as well by a new coaching staff that came in talk the fans through that uh Global freshman year you know as most freshmen hit a wall you know Im saying I hit that wall and I was struggling to get out of it and it was just a frustrating freshman year and then Roy Chipman uh quit and then bro Paul 11 is in so Paul Evans bring his for his recruiter Cooper I figured who else is with him so now me and Dimitris got to go Gore got to go to the second string and we didnt start ever since weve been here so by the end of by end of uh into two days of camp we got a joke we got a job back quick now there was a young assistant coach back in the day thats oh we had a pretty good career so far uh since leaving Pitt becoming a head coach our sophomore year John Calipari came in without John that team would have not gailed together because uh Paul Evans we dont have a respect for him I might have said 20 words or two years to pause I mean we just to get along we just to see eye to eye you know he didnt see eye and eye but Demetrius I mean so I mean but if theres one thing in this world I dont gotta like you but I can work with you Ill tell you what that team was really good I mean you talk about winning regular season Big East which was big thats Big East back in like the Big East one through bottom every game is tough but you guys were were that good and you guys played differently because you guys played a lot of post to post basketball right you know we played inside out you know we got to get the ball to Charles everything worked through him Ellie Cummings for three after an offensive rebound for Pitt up by four with less than seven to go in this first half Appleby gets struck by sabandi out in transition through the contact that hes got free throws on the other side Jerome thank you so much a lot of questions about this today yeah its been a long day today the byproduct of the quality of shot you get and how you get those shots the pitched in a really good job of sharing the basketball playing with spacing playing Inside Out playing off paint touches and making the extra pass Stephen threes are good threes you dont chase him you let him come to you and pit offensively has been absolutely terrific only turned it over twice you see these three guys connecting on those eight triples led by Henson other side Wake Forest has hung around Zach Kellers been getting some run Damien Williamson has knocked down some shots Off the Bench as well they initially put up three points for his shot in that near side corner and then they flipped it to a two after they went and looked at it during the break yeah you talk about William said he has been a starter at Wake Forest uh no longer starting but a very big part of this team because you need guys that can come off the bench that can impact the game and he impacts the game by coming off bringing energy being a guy that can that can score it so this game is I think Wake Forest has settled into this game so hit adds to the lead couple of free throws from Nike sebandian outfit extends some pressure after the made free throw this is used to basically make wait use a little bit of clock now all of a sudden theres only 20 left on the clock theyre staying zone right here good ball movement get a pay touch kick it out weak side offensive rebound from Marsh said shut off on the Baseline a cutting car goes into a spin on hits in cant get it to go just physical enough that hit defense to put a body on caller that both of these teams really excellent passing teams playing with good spacing share the basketball but this boot is a fifth three for Blake Henson hes got 15 and he becomes a matchup nightmare if he shoots it like this because hes got that big body you can put it on the floor I mean this has been really impressive and he had great energy to shoot around today Applebee answers Apple rimwood too you know coming off a loss A disappointing loss coach Capel talked to his team about kind of what they learned and then he had opinions on what they learned and I think that they understand energy energy compete compete compete and then share the basketball share the basketball and thats exactly what these guys are doing right now well how about this they got 13 assists on 14 makes here in the first half the balls not getting stuck the best teams make one more the best teams the ball doesnt get stuck the best teams offensively play for each other and defensively are connected to Appleby doesnt get the role Federico another rebound sabandi pulls up knock it down long rebound the car Williamson pushes Navy and Williamson one on three no they play like an older team because they are an older team and they got guys that have played in the NCAA tournament so when youre trying to get fixed I mean youve struggled for a couple years its not just going into the portal its finding the right guys the guys that fit identity fit culture and understand what it takes to be successful winning players and thats what theyve done paint touch kick out good replaced by Henson right there nice job of relocating off penetration and then William said he hes just got to choose the Appleby has just a good way to change speeds change direction move different ways to finish Music Hanson took that heat check three he almost spun down a sixth yeah Ill tell you one thing and uh he took a heat check through but Jeff Capel was not happy with the three again how did he get there he changed that he doesnt have to chase shots the way theyre moving the basketball like dude just play for each other you play for each other good stuffs gonna happen hey you were talking about the ages uh hows that for a veteran group five of your top six in the rotation Rogers top six and High character guys tough guys winning guys guys to trust each other and enjoy your time say it was last touched by Andrew Carr over nine percent of the points come from Juniors and seniors the thing that impresses me about what Jeff cape has been able to do hes taken the mailing companies who came from Colgate Bowling Green hes taken to Greg Elliott whos playing played at Marquette hes taken a Blake Henson and hes got him to trust each other and play together Jorge Diaz Graham one of the twin brothers draws a foul uh hit leads by 10 with under four to go in the first half at the peak oh through the transfer board on if you look what pitch been able to do 93 of the points are Juniors and seniors but 89 of those points they had went out and got the right guys in the transfer portal winning players guys that would buy in to trust each other play together and play winning basketball but its not just pit if you look around the landscape of college basketball whether its Missouri rebuilt in the SEC if you look at Kansas State in the Big 12 you look at Alabama Mark Sears the transfer Ohio University you look at around the college basketball there are teams Virginia Ben Vander Plies you know you look around college basketball and transfers and the transfer portal is having a tremendous impact but its not just collecting panel type its getting right guys pick your culture and want to buy into being winning players Nelly Cummings has been that in his career at Colgate comes home to Pitt he buries right there what is the 10th made three prepared this hat yeah belly comes playing really well today he hit kind of a wall a little bit because put a little pressure on himself coming home because hes its so important to represent this University but uh hes playing at a high level thats his second three a fifth for Wake Forest who remember they just saw Virginia Virginia hit 153 Saturday and we told you Pitt has 10 here in the first half yeah this will be an interesting halftime conversation that Steve Forbes he wont be as uh funny as he was when he sat down with him today George I can tell you that no very different and not as portable not as well hed be quotable but its nothing we can say on television foul is called on damari Monsanto that is hes an elite threepoint shooter a volume threepoint shooter a little step back right there but he is a right hand rhythm dribbler and if you see right there right hand boom and theres your charge and Santa really he gets into all his shots with a little step back or step heads but if hes going to put the ball on the floor its going to be with his right hand scatter report charge Applause and how about his bounce back eight points five assists yeah eight points did a great job of navigating that ball screen getting to a soft spot knocking it down when Nelly Cummings is playing at a good Pace Manila Cummings is reading the defense and taking what the defense gives him youre talking about a guy that let cook Colgate to the NCAA tournament the guy that understands winning basketball and has great pride in being here and Hitler putting on that Jersey hes got the ball up a dozen off the Monsanto Miss Music Applause Kelly Cummings really good job right there a little snake on that ball screen because Wake Forest is in drop coverage what does that mean that means theyre basically trying to protect the basket until the defender gets over the top of that screen he reads it cuts it back great decision by Nelly Cummings how about what Jeff Capel told us at shoot around today they came back from New York earlier in the season and Jeff asks Nelly if he was feeling pressure playing now for his hometown team Cummings said no and then he thought about it again and he said yeah I mean I remember the great teams here and he said and we quote I feel like theres blood on my hands if I dont get us back foreign Cummings is that that having pride in where youre playing putting on that Jersey is is great I do have concerns just across the landscape of college basketball but these young players are under a microscope and there is so much static around it uh whether its by their peers social media unrealistic expectation wanting to perform well so badly that instead of just playing and enjoying the moment having both feet on the ground that they kind of get ahead of themselves and its really good to see Nelly Cummins play at this level today uh and enjoy basically the journey in the process here at Pitt thats what Jeff cable said to him and were just playing basketball no doubt his head coach happy to see him performing this way in the first half Forrest is starting absolutely and I mean Pitts making plays but theyve really done a poor job of guarding the ball he would wake forests according to Roger Ayers last touch he says by Federico let me ask you something right here lets look at this play right here quiz number two for you Mike please this Wake Forest looks like a young basketball team and Pitt look like a physically mature experienced basketball I think thats a leading question a little bit well Im trying to help you I dont know if youre paying attention today it is a Young weight team as Appleby gets fouled hes one of the veterans again a lot of pieces who are going to be returning next season I mean if you look at this team Bradfords is a softball obviously Carr is going to have two years Monsanto has two years Hildreth has three years and this is a young developing basketball team Applebee to the line hey Saturdays are for basketball here on acc Network and the ESPN app this weekend the quadruple header starts at one Eastern NC State Wake then Duke Georgia Tech followed by number 24 Clemson battles Florida State capped off with Syracuse and the Virginia Tech back in the win column on the Schneider huge win right there Virginia Tech at home you dont just roll into Castle Coliseum and get an easyw that was a great win Honda Couture was absolutely terrific and you know Wake Forest theyve got NC statements NC State huge win because they could not afford to lose that game through Notre Dame you cant afford a bad loss this time of the year but youve got a great slate of games on the ACC Network youre talking about games that youll have impacts on NCAA tournament opportunities and building resumes terrific four terrific games right there Bandy went up with Jerome Lane like intentions right hand driver that scatter report youve got no spandy first and foremost is going to rip it and go he did have him I was going to say a poster but its an nft now right you uh you were picking on social media oh yeah we covered Twitter and Instagram free game yes we uh we tried times uh I dont spell as well as I need to and my daughters give me a hard time but we try to be positive be careful before you hit signal so bad hes got a half dozen Pit by 15 inside the final minute moves his first half 23 Zone Changing defenses car flashes and Carr finishes and hes got a chance at a much needed threepoint play for weight thats a good job going two for one right there for Wake Forest uh car with a good job catching it in the middle of that zone it changes defenses good recognition by Wake Forest Carr presents himself remember says you got to get a guy in the middle of the zone you know what you do you have to get a guy in the middle of the Zone through an open area that open area is usually by that ACC logo but youve got to seek that open pocket thats where Carr went he stamps the threepoint play hes got eight leading the Deeks along with Cam Hildreth and weeks within a dozen and looking for a stop here people will take that use it or lose it and wake just came back in a little one three one well take a 30second break and then right back to Pittsburgh for Pitt theyve got a 49 with the basketball and still a half minute until the intermission what are you seeing from Wake defensively well they just switched to a little one three one zone Im interested to see if they stay in that defense coming up the timeout uh its a 131 Lane Zone its actually a an old defense that Dr Roy Chipman played when he was at Pitt and Sam Clancy played a pit so right now theyre showing a one through one Tokyo put a big at the top hes going to try to distort passing Lanes on that guard to guard pass all right and then you see the wings are going to try to push the ball out I might try to get it trapped the king of this thing is coming back and a rebounding the basketball you got Appleby on the lefthand side you see the floor all right if it is shot hes got to come back and hook the rebound good job creating the tournament Clancy like pick from Hildreth who pushes and finds Carr he is fouled by Diaz Graham and Andrew Carr with a chance at a second threepoint play great job in one three one good job on the weak side if you look at the right side of your screen watching this ball reverses watch Hildreth on the right hand side hes going to read the passers eyes good steal hold on a second here Im not letting you get away with that you just compared cant help you to Sam Clancy pimp royalty Sam bam Clancy we called him Superman did he not play that spot in the zone he did but he can wait at the top of the circle and still take that diagonal pass away Sam Clancy and Hilton in the same settings thatll be the last time thats ever mentioned and who knows what we have in store thats why you got to stick around hit by 10 at the break on the strength of 103s teams in the top six in the ACC its pit up 10 at the break as we welcome you back to the Petes at Greenberg Mike Monica with you and pit we told you 10 threepointers in that first half and they were cruising Mike we talked to Jeff Capel prior to the game and he talked about having the ball having energy making the extra pass playing for each other getting paint touches getting the ball reversed step in threes are good threes paint touch kick out step in three bam Elliott knocks down to three roll replaced bring Hinson behind the to play bam threepointer get it into the Blue Area to the paint make an extra pass be shot ready it starts to defeat being behind the basketball all of these threes are byproduct of sharing the basketball and theyre all assisted threes on the other side Andrew Carr at the end of the first half he got involved back down the three from the Baseline then got in the middle of that zone with pit went Zone found an open spot at half and then running before I wouldnt be surprised to see Carr play some five because the most important thing that Wake Forest needs to do to get back in this game is they must get stops to get stops you must defend the basketball and keep it out of the lane and do a better job in defensive transition wont be surprised theyll start big but Wake Forest might have to come back and go a little bit smaller with Carr at five yeah theyve done some more of that recently some of the notes from this first half Demari Monsanto had three first half two of them on offensive fouls and his last two fouls he picked up in the final three minutes of the half so that bears monitoring as well he is out there for Steve Forbes to begin this out yeah two offensive fouls a really good scatter report charges what I mean by that in the scouting reports can say hes shot faking one or two dribbles right hes going to try to beat you up the dribble hes going right really good job Greg Elliott starts on Monsanto to begin the second half as they skip it for him he lets fly long rebound carems out toward Hildreth Elliott goes diving for it a held ball and the arrow points to pit and that was good ball movement right there for Wake Forest the kick out to Monsanto its almost like you know you live by the three you die by the three thats who he is but that was a great contest by Pitt running out and contesting that three threes Saturday the most CC player in a game this season Parton he had a couple of fouls so only two points for jamarius Spartan in the first half but its been paid you know hes not chasing anything Applebee goes slicing kept his pivot foot but missed the shot like the push by Appleby spacing off the push you guys got to do a better job of sliding to open areas chosen for Appleby of the first half on an average of 18 right now Steve Forbes taking someone out that is absolutely unacceptable acceptable if youre coaching Wake Forest in your garden Greg Elliott he cant catch just guard to forward pass step behind it no pressure no contest wide open three I mean thats just kyp right with someone like him who can shoot it that well 100 I mean youve got to make him shot fake close them to a shot fake and they can put her on the floor great passing once again by Pitt finding the open Lane Applause for Appleby tipped Away by Elliott with three to shoot for Wake a little pin down and look thats just a lack of communication right there that is just a soft screen no communication wide open three Music Elliott and Henson have combined for nine of pits 11 made threes Appleby hoist cant hit Applause you know pitch changed their defenses kind of philosophy you know in years past Pitts really extended your defense out uh tried to deny ball reversal pressure the ball a little further out but theyve done now is because of the way the game is appreciated because you dont want to put your opponent in the bonus that basically heals to the threepoint line trying to keep the ball in front force a contested shot and limit their home to one shot theyve done a really good job of that today again they got a steal on this at the end of the first half Applause the mark yeah last five games coming in using it more than they had to start the season for Steve Forks couple of extra passes to Hildreth for three good Edge to pass good better pass give up a good shot to get a better shot to get the best shot back to the 131 looks like on Santa tweaked his knee a little bit thats not good Elliot doesnt miss this one through one Im not sure whos on the Baseline yet I thought it was Monsanto who looked like he twisted his knee a little bit but Nepal goes to the corner that Baseline guys got to get out to the corner trade threes got to get stopped see the physicality of the uh see where the point pick up you see everyones basically Towing the threepoint line not as far out as they have and as far right pass theyve been out what what happens is if the more you get stretched out watch right here great pass by Applebee terrific job Monsanto watch when he lands and well try to find where perhaps he came up Lane Applause with three left on the shot clock from Matt Marsh lets look at this for damari Monsanto on the rebounding action here because you spotted it he came up the floor premising and then had to come out of the game He had signaled to the bench as well saw him receiving medical attention yeah he didnt even make a play on that pass to the corner whatsoever Wake Forest very good and underneath that abounds place there it is Applause ladies and gentlemen they call that forecasting about going to shoot around a lot of hours logged on synergy Applause and that can make the difference right at this time of the year still a basket you know this time of the year in Italy play kindergarten League Play soon to play close games in close games you got to steal baskets and thats underneath the side Deadpool and all the timeouts the dunking deak Matt Marsh with back to back you might get an ideal you know the dunking beat goes to Duncan for two thats all he does foreign Applause Applause Music sat down with Seth were gonna go a little coach to coach with Coach Steve Forbes last time you shaved your Dome uh this morning just for you well I would have waited before the game but um I did it for you because youre the king of chrome have you rolled into the draw on the motorcycle I have sat on the motorcycle no no anyone can sit on the box have you gotten back on the back of the thing like flipped it up couldnt be to drive it out for a college game day during coven on the football field but I thought Id run over herb Street and then I didnt want to get in trouble for that I would have liked for you to been coaching in the ACC then I I would have wrote it out backed it up and pointed the exhaust right at you thats like Brad Brown now wearing the you know every time we play that Clemson he would break out the purple over the orange jacket like he was supposed to be my boy and hed break out the purple or orange jacket I had no shot when that jacket came out when I think of fashion plates you should think of me I think its Steve Forbes coach the coach with Steve forums you know everyones got their thing uh Steve Forbes has the best when it comes to Fashion and the vast and theres a young Steve Forbes he was fighting a fight back then you see he had a little a little bit on the door okay what an amazing job he did Northwest Florida an even more amazing job and hes tendency dominating that conference he is not a good coach hes a great communicator a terrific teacher uh really cares about his players and there that that last picture right there you could see Steve you know at that age just give up all right clean it up he made the move we had him on bald men on campus on the ACC Network every single Friday where we actually will have Jay bills with us this Friday Knoxville Tennessee game day is going to Knoxville the women are having game day on Knoxville on tomorrow on Thursday and then we have our game day on Saturday and then were getting on a bus and were driving to Lexington Kentucky for the kentuckykansas game Kentucky obviously theyre doing four in a row and Kansas struggling a little bit right now with three consecutive losses Big 12 is a brutal conference it really is we have seen that especially over these last couple of weeks one three one again watching watching the Baseline thats it for them already Applause its a seven point game right now like wake has settled in and kind of done a better job getting a couple stops quality shots improving Hildreth with uh in between and then he tumbles he took his awkward fall he is down in a lot of pain monsantos already on the bench and hildred hobble they cannot afford that well tomorrows Burton had limped off as well remember hes been battling the knee issue all year Monsanto comes back in this is Burton defending Burton and Hildreth both on the same play here it is and then this step as he comes back up the court look at this oh I dont like that I dont like the look of that but well assume maybe we can get some information being tended to right now on the Wake Forest bench top of your screen it was good to see Monsanto is able to return for Wake down seventh sabandi tagged with a foul if you notice right now Wake Forest is not settling right now their paint touch paint touch paint touch attack attack attack one they want to get to the bonus and two if they can move the defense a little bit theyll be up to free themselves up for some shots heres another underneath special situation Applause Santos spinning underneath on Federico Elliott and Federico sandwich him and its Elliott against tank with his second foul Steve Forbes does an absolutely incredible look at the lefthand side its a little late into the play but the left side of your screen someone curled off at him then he curled Monsanto curled off the curler and and got an opportunity to score it he is a master I call him hes part hes part of the uh Iowa coaches Mafia one of his mentors Nick nurse who actually helped him recruit Cameron Hildreth whose dad played for Nick nurse in England and also coach with Nick nurse when Nick was coaching overseas the Brighton Bears I know you followed them back in the day who does you have a bright bear baseball hat yes and a pennant on my wall its always a good thing back to the one through one watch it right at the restricted area you see number four Williamson hes got to get out to those corners good cut right there passes a little hot to handle for Federico from Cummings hes now got it up top with 10 to shoot you see Monsanto on the right hand side hes got to push that ball out he cant let the ball get in the paint so easy Cummings too strong and then a pushup on the rebounding action and they get to Mari Monsanto and thats his fourth with 14 minutes to go and Ken Hildreth hobbles on up to the scores table to replace it yeah this game hes like a hockey player gets banged around just comes right back in I mean uh hes got a little toughness to him good execution right there its in short off the screen we know anything about cam Hildreth he is tough he did this in the win at the Joel against Duke back in December just fought his way back into the game when he had a wrist injury Applebee now Paul never got reversed both these teams right now like pit they got to get a ball over so they got to get a ball reverse and a pay touch this could be a middle ball screen eventually Applause so Andy pulls up instead and knocks it down spammy going to his right hand is hard to guard hard to guard when he gets to his right hand what are you talking about you look at his pit T well its Elliott whether its the Bandy whether its Cummings whether its Burton I mean if you look at the numbers their career numbers combined its absolutely mindbody in terms of number of games theyve played in the number of points theyve scored uh tough experienced team and Ill tell you one thing Wake Forest sticking in that one three one you like it I do after Williamson knocked down a three to cut it to five again to his right hand attacking the guy that rolled his ankle a little step back again Watch right there a little skip pass late tag big time three right there what you see in that play did you see the spacing how on dribble penetration if they help on the roller thats what we were talking about before if you use that ball screen and they roll and they help them roller that skip pass is available Applause thats it you see right there good job right there optically pushing it out see Hilder getting matched up we can see that play again instead of leaving Elliott in the corner because Elliott was behind him Elders kind of matched up with Ellie in the right hand side of the corner learning from that breakdown that began this happened Applause fivepoint margin still a long way to go here in Pittsburgh in a crucial game Mark poked it away and Appleby with the flux needs a timeout right here Applause it was once a 15point pit lead and wakes got it down to three and multiple turnovers getting pushed out at a rhythm were trying to split this tropical top thats a walk guermo Diaz Graham back out for sabandi Cummings knocks it down another ball reversal good job coming to stepping into that the one through one because theyre basically making that guarded car pass difficult and to go the forward pass difficult it basically creates indecision that was better durable penetration for a purpose of getting someone elses shot Cummings with three threes Pitt has 13 of them now 13 for 27 from long range fruits they cant see State transfer backing down in the post I love it when Wake Forest gets paid touches whether the dribble at a postop Bradford thats a big body dude right there heating cars about space and its a fourth hit turnover this half with Wake Forest on the move theyve got it down to four great offensive defense get deflections and get out in transition theres the deflection Appleby pushes it all of a sudden we got a little basketball game bam his left foot with Roger Ayers the official right there lower left hand side of your screen Watch What Happens right there he rolls it ah rolls his ankle guys got some tufty stuff had been hobbled he came back in he is sitting with four fouls weve got weve got 11 to go in a fourpoint game and Carr at The Rim makes it a twopoint March out of a timeout we talked about special situations what is special situations for basketball underneath that about side out of bounds atos after timeouts first play of the game first play of the half Steve Forbes doing a masterful job coming out of timeouts its going to be today lead clay youve got to find ways to steal Pockets like that Burton kicks Applause Music Applause Music Applause to shoot for Williamson shut up again by Henson so Williamson Jackson comes up short Henson got a piece of it that was a really good job for Henson a big Bobby moving his feet keeping the ball in front and capacity patience again from Burton off to Savannah thats like me trying to interrupt you that shot fake is so good but sometimes when I think youre gonna talk but youre not talking that doesnt happen its Mandy short weve got a foul away from the ball as well special situations ATO look at his Rook on the lefthand side of your screen youre going to see a little upscreen good bump screen right there and Carr really does a good job of reading and Burton gets in the paint can put the Eyes on the rim to shrink the defense really good job of spanning moving to an open spot dribble penetration you got to get in a window to be a receiver great job right there bye what a benefit you have to believe a guy like Savannah Off the Bench with all that experience you know 2 000 career points scored Applause makes it a seven point lead now picking the spouts what is he downhill driver doesnt settle physical driving and you use that word physical right off the top as physical a guard as you will find effort on the face up going to work on the Freshman Diaz Graham into a double at the window Applause so big so physical overpowering in the post but thats the deal then youve got to run a double at him and get the ball out of his hands back to the one three one good pass quick shot thats a win for the 13 for the one through one defense oh great change of speed oh man Tyree Appleby are you kidding you know what the kids would say he went into his bag oh that dude talked about changing speeds and changing direction goodness gracious that was one of those whoops Chris Berman would be all over that one now I mean that was whoops talk about changing great players change speed and change direction watch this right here okay speed boom change direction and youve seen a pretty incredible transformation from him just even since transferring in from last year at Florida yeah I think hes been selectively aggressive and Steve Forbes has given him the ball hes given that responsibility hes empowered him Edwards when you play to Purdue thats exactly what Matt Caney used to talk to him like Hey Im giving you the ball I want you to be aggressive I want you to be you but youve got to also be selectively aggressive make good decisions and thats exactly what time the Applebees doing and thats what how Steve Forbes has empowered him we talked with Applebee after shoot around today and we asked him how the years gone he said you know a ton of expectations coming into this season and joining this program and he said I still feel like were not getting the respect we deserve well you know you do that one game at a time you do that by being consistent anyone can do it do something once the very very best are basically the guys that do each and every night and thats whats happening in Pitt theyve got four Road wins I mean theyre four and one on the road in the ACC that is big time that last possession Burton gets a paint touch hits and comes behind hes just feeling it oh thats his seventh Applause now theyre going to get a stop they got to keep the ball out of the lap 34 points in the paint for Wake Forest 15 off turnovers thats whats keeping them in this game theyve got to keep the ball out of paint pit they got to take care of the basketball at the other end over back out for Williamson hes knocked down three triples fires up another and hits team and Williamson with an answer hey Mike theres some shot mating going on in this game well tell you one thing short clock early in the clock the guys making big time shots really good closeout right there on Savannah Blake Henson is feeling a bit seeing a big basket right here watch a middle of the floor Burke gets a touch base he hits it just relocating to an open spot and this one ball goes to the corner late closeout he gets behind the ball great footwork knocks down another three hes been terrific huge game for both these teams for Wake Forest the opportunity for a second quad one win for Pitt here at home a chance at a quad to win and boy did Blake Henson come to play its been absolutely terrific all 12 shot attempts from the threepoint line seven for twelve shot ready hasnt chased it its coming to flow of the offense and most of those threes have come off dribble penetration and kick outs really nice job of pick finding them spacing it and making the right play you know I Blake Henson he reminds me of another former great pit player Clyde ball first guy actually recruited to come play at Pitt really he was let pit two NCAA tournaments his most valuable player in was basically was the Eastern eightpack thing uh absolutely a mountain masquerina as a man a front Court player that can rebound the ball an elite rebounder a big cop shooter got it lead pit for three big huge games in the Big East against Saint Johns Georgetown and Syracuse thats Chris Mullen Leo routens and Patrick Ewing over about a twoweek spanning hes in a little bit of battle against cancer he is the toughest person I know theres no doubt my mind the way he carries himself and what hes all about whos gonna win this thing but coach ball were thinking about it we appreciate you and a big part of his success moving forward after you left it was because of the foundation you helped like guys to be in the Hall of Fame if he misses at The Rim after Hildreth had missed a reverse Appleby cant connect out of the corner wanted to tie it under six to go here at the Pete wake back little mantoman right now theyve got to contain the basketball special in his ball screen situations theyre switching that now comings off the bounce looking for somewhere to go finds Burton Burton offensive foul pushed off on Hildreth Applause so they have been in a lot of zone now they go man and they get a stop yeah watch on the right hand side of your screen all right you saw Greg Elliot they they were not allowing him to catch the ball which forced Burton to put it down great job of State between the ball and the basket you can be moving you just cant Step Up take that charge good solid defensive possession right there by Wake Forest all right was left alone hits and its a onepoint game Music having a hard time right now with that ball screw that triple handoff to the spread ball screen with the five youve got to be up on that ball screen a little bit higher you give hildren the chance to turn it hes going to create some separation back to the 131 got slipped away from Burton and now Hilbert then transition on a Euro gets it to go they say its an offensive foul instead on Camp hildred and Steve Forbes cant believe it lets take a look at this and again craving the turnover off the one three one that is close see in my opinion he stepped up into that you can move if youve established position but you cant step up into the offensive player thats a hard call its a bang bang call back to the one three one theyre getting a lot of deflections think about Pitt 34 points excuse me uh wait 34 points in the paint 15 points off turnovers a lot off of that one through one and thats like a turnover quick shot with that capable reverse or getting a pink touch or the ball to the middle of the floor underneath Carr had to gather and then he draws a foul on Hinson Music Breon Henson really good pass off the dribble obvious car struggled with the catch great decision by hildred Hildreth is really a crafty experienced player from internet with International experience hey Saturday is there for college basketball here on accn and the app this week a quadruple header starts at one Eastern NC stayed awake yeah and the Duke Georgia Tech Clemson Florida State and it wraps up with Syracuse in Blacksburg and how about Clemson how about Hunter Tyson how about PJ Hall how about that team being so connected and so tough fabulous Applause I knew they screamed the top of the Zone which gets a pain touch which forces the defense to shrink and Elliott slides right into the open spot thats really good execution great job by coach cable wake had not LED since 8 32 left first half grabbed the lead and then pit snatches it right back catch for marsh and he missed it with a left hand Marsh got to be much more patient there patiently if the defense collapses and you feel the pressure kick it out thats a great opportunity for a second three Mana man right here for Wake Forest notice Burton kicks out Applause Music Blake Henson is human fire tonight great job again to paint touch right here Burton knocks down that jumper and in next play it comes that little string music I guess thats string music what do you think hes playing were not listening to the same bees and it pales compared to the eight that hits so I mean youve got two guys right there 14 threes between them I give Burton credit cannot give Billy Cummings credit because when you have two guys that are shooting like that most importantly get him in Rhythm and then I get those both of those players credit because theyre moving to open areas and basically making themselves available I call it getting into Windows I think its going to go a little zone right here no one coming out of the timeout that not their back pain and Steve Forbes is going to run some type of play coming on this timeout and a fivepoint game three and a half to go app will be around the corner Barton sticks with him Appleby bounces for a cutting Williamson back out car off the shopping no Bradford battles on the boards Takes a Tumble and weve got a hell ball the arrow keeps it at this end of the floor with wake Force yeah really good job right there staying homework lets see what happens right there hit the side the ball goes into the post were gonna stay home were going to defend the threepoint line great job of contest got to finish it with a rebound dangerous situation underneath that abound so we know that Wake Forest has been absolutely terrific in terms of their execution watch Carr and then watch a Carl Williamson there it is in trapped along the sideline got it free to Applebee shoot Applause on Nike symante battling for the ball against Davion Bradford Applause one and one for Davion Bradford 54 for his career and he misses on the first really struggled with free throws this season in particular 32 percent coming in I would expect Elliott or Burton going downhill or something for Henson and the foul is on the floor meanwhile Demario Monsanto picked up his fourth foul at the 1351 Mark and he is still Seated on the Wake Forest bench Applause Music off the screen from Federico so Mandy directing around the screen offensive rebound Applause just two offensive rebounds again good job of getting to the offensive glass watch how apopee is defensively oh no thats a big fat shot Top Shot Tyree Appleby for three trims it to four and two ten to go still how good has this one been here in Pittsburgh Wake Forest and Pitt huge game couple of top six teams in the ACC and watch right here you get a little shot right there watch Federico right in the middle of the floor no one Cuts him out you dont cut him out hes going to get to the offensive glass on the other end this is just a big time step back and great job at Appleby on that step back getting behind the ball getting himself on balance and knocking down a big time shot its about 35 threepoint shooter he had been one for seven from three in this game now wakes got it down to four as we tick under two to go full screen back to one watch Elliot right there oh spins it out good clear out from Hildreth drawing a foul on Federico after just joining us down the stretch maybe youve been locked in on the Big East earlier tonight theyve had a good one going on there this is a big game for both these teams for Wake Forest looking for a second quad one to win for Pitt quad two here at home you know whats right around the corner February and when February comes you need to start racking the two things you got to do you gotta get wins against the field and you cant have bad losses this is an opportunity for both of these teams they continue to play well to get a quality win th misses on the front end 78 percent theyre not the bonus yet I believe Tyree Appleby might have just got a warning as well from Roger Ayers for his reaction after he got tagged with his third foul and thats good fishing and Roger airsman I got I talked to say about it home on the road Ill take Rogers every single night emotional play disappointed great officiating by Rogers not overreacting understanding the motion of the game and how hard these guys are playing free throws the rest of the way on both sides pit box four with the ball under 90 seconds to go turkey back out Henson Henson drives and lobs it too tall for Federico man you would think that Henson would have just pulled up and that would be his first twopoint shot with that but pulled up and knocked it down good job right now its a good drive got some self on balance hes got to throw that to the inside of the rim when you make that law pass its the right side of the fort this floor to the inside of the right side of the rib and thats a dump Applause 110 to go taking Savannah off the bounce Appleby throws it up drew a foul on Nikes savandy he draws a ton of fouls Mary Appleby has a good job of probing using his dribble and then pivoting to create angles I told you two of the top six in the ACC let me ask you here two of the top six two teams that are trying to build their resume enhance their resume but you look at the standings raise your hand if you had Clemson at 901 right you know what I mean and then Duke of North Carolina Duke really really tough loss the other night a little bit of controversial call at the end of the game Rick Whitehead going out you know people are talking about good they just havent been helping develop a chemistry that you need a substitution pattern to Define roles uh to be interested to see what happens with them moving forward right now this mechs been in the game its going to be really interesting cant settle if youre pit you got to play downhill and youre in the bonus do not set Burton summons the ball screen now driving on Bradford falling away no and ripped down by hildred and he draws a foul on Federico coming up the floor these fans are not happy with Dallas he came right thats a kg veteran European players God played professional in Europe hes played professionally overseas and that was just a smart veteran play of basically cutting the defender off and then playing through the play you know who did that another great ACC player Chris korchian when he was at NC State but he was unbelievable at him Holdsworth has missed two in a row in the double bonus right now and hes missed his last two Hendrick misses both offensive rebound Appleby and its coming back to Pitt as Appleby fell out of bounds great job aptly look at her righthand side his screen no block out by Hinson whatsoever foreign Applause unbelievable hits doesnt even step across at all we can show that block out again that ball goes up in a freethrow line you got to step across I dont care whos next year coming out of this timeout you know right now Jeff Capel interesting Nelly Cummings has been out of this game for a while because he comes back to compliment Burton obviously you want Elliott on the floor you want hits it on the floor both of those guys have been great I still think youve got 25 seconds on the clock youve got to make a play downhill if you can get to the rim get to the rim you can draw a foul draw a foul if you cannot all right thats when you kick out for a step in three but dont be surprised if Steve forums doesnt change defenses twopoint game 31 seconds left in what has been an absolute battle here at the P the game in which Pitt has led by as many as 15 that was late in the first half wake has battled back despite all the shot making from pitt knocking down a program record 18 triples caught back by turning people with the 131 defense by getting the ball into the paint by attacking the basket and some timely threepoint shooting now interesting to see Monsanto is still on the bench big lineup coming out Pitt now youve got Bradford and Carr I would think theyre going to put Bradford in touch some type of ball screens you put Bradford in the ball screen you cant switch it Burton or whomever can go at him and maybe get and get get uh create a foul a scoring opportunity or created to get fouled Cummings back in the game so interesting Cummings Henson Burton and Elliott they downsized basically eliminating the five right now Henson is the five uh which is creating a matchup problem right now at the Five Spot yeah this is a great opportunity to put Henson and Bert in a ball screen five and a half second Difference game and shot clock hit with the ball up by two jamarius Burton spin the leader all season for pick off the hints in screen Burton back out for Henson extra pass ings doesnt get it off its a shot clock violation and Pitt doesnt even attempt the shot wow got exactly what they wanted Hinkson they went a little late Hixson in a ball screen they get Henson thats at three that hes made all night makes the extra pass and then all of a sudden youve got to unsee the clock understand how much time is left on the clock at least get a shot on the rim unselfish play by Henson Steve Forbes takes his final timeout as wake will try to tie or take the lead with 61 to go on the road Balls going to be Balls going to be an Appleby Sands itll try to get the ball to Applebee on on the move and then get a step up ball screen where you can get Elaine and spray that ball out watch right here youve got to know how much time is on the clock heres the screen we said Henson drag two look at that he drags too which is exactly what you want to do with a ball screen made one more it just gotta understand the clock a veteran teams got to see the copper youve talked about sharing the ball and how key thats been for pitted but twice down the stretch has Blake Henson been a little bit too unselfish yeah I mean he had to pull up off the drive where he tried to get the ball to Federico and then right there I mean look youre back down eight threes you let that thing rip or again Cummings needs to see that see the clock hes got a good to wake up and step into it and knock that thing down like you like you want your team to be unselfish that was great execution they went small Wake Forest had a bigger lineup they put their biggest player in a ball screen that was Bradford great job great job as you saw that play Burton he drew two Defenders thats why you put some of the ball screen to make two defend Hinton maybe could have stepped in a little bit more on the catch first and foremost you got to get the ball in bounds and now Jeff cable will counter with a timeout after getting a look at what Wake Forest came out in remember with Wake Forest as well already two times this season theyve had buzzer beating heroics and through Carr against Appalachian State and Tyree Appleby at the buzzer in overtime against Utah Valley and Kyrie Appleby theyre going to try to get him the ball now the way they were lined up Wake Forest I suspect theyll be all theyll theyll really make it hard for Applebee to catch the ball thats a hard place to inbound the ball its a hard place to inbound the ball and catch it on the run because youre caught on the outside third of the floor so you know I would think my gut feeling is whoevers Gordon hellraith is going to be below Hildreth exactly in a protect trying to Corral Applebees right here you see right here Burton right here hes matched up the Hildreth youre going to contain and keep the ball in front now Southall back in the game who I thought could keep him on the side of the boat has to step up ball screen Applebee for three oh no it hangs out it holds Applause look good indeed for Tyree Appleby I really thought Pitt was going to try to force him to catch the ball on the sideline he got to his watch area he just rips against his left hand a little step up screen right there created big separation look at hellraith too thats a big time win for Pitt thats a tough loss for Wake Forest a high level game both coaches doing an incredible job got to make free throws down the stretch if youre awake Forest but basically the resiliency of Pitt to continue to keep on grinding really impressively big time win for Pitt they knocked out 18 threes and win it for Seth Greenberg and our entire excellent crew behind the scenes Mike Monaco sang so long Louisville Boston College is coming up next Music
