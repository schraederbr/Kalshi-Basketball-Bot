as head coach of the heels John sh in his second as head coach of the Blue Devils and its visiting Carolina with the first possession of the game as we are ready for the tip of our Sonic Blockbuster matchup Duke already switching some exchanges now Jared McCain Switched Off onto Harrison Ingram hes going to go oneonone in the post Ingram had a huge game against Duke back in Chapel Hill 21 points 13 rebounds and he knocks down the first shot of the game as we show you the start lineups brought to you by degree Proctor roach McCain in the back court Mark Mitchell playing great ball in conference play and then Kyle filipowski and a big key in John shs mind keep him on the floor filipowski will have foul trouble from time to time and hes battling with Armando Bott down low had his arms wrapped around him no call its early in the game but he got in foul trouble against NC State had to sit the majority of the first half only played four minutes that cant happen in this game thats why Stewart got all those minutes and he ended up playing extremely well bot with the left hand Carolina up for early and Armando Bott immediately body seeking he normally likes to go to that right hand over his left shoulder that time had the angle went to the left hand straight to the basket Carolina LED almost the entire game back at the dean doome LED for better than 38 minutes of the 41 93 84 Carolina trying to chase over the top of those handoff actions filipowski the spin and the fade away will go now filipowski has terrific feet he can pivot likes to spin when he puts the ball in the deck out of bounds a turnover gives it back to Duke thats a difficult straight line pass and pal filipowski doing a great job of trying to get position but here hes off of Armando Bott and Bott just gets that angle to get to his left hand and heres filipowski with that footwork able to Pivot and thats a difficult shot to turn over that left shoulder when youre righthanded player a lot of guys with a turnaround jumper like to go over the right shoulder just Applause easier roach to filipowski around and out and the rebound down to Ingram whos the leading rebounder of the ACC in conference games cormack Ryan with the quick release and buries the corner three thats where North Car ATA can be so difficult to deal with in transition with a catch and shoot strong drive by Jared McCain but he couldnt finish it back comes RJ Davis touch pass to Ryan same spot same result 102 Carolina that was like instant replay was that just a replay Ryan of course has played a lot of games in this series comes from Notre Dame so this is nothing new for him Carolina really getting out out on the perimeter to impact the ball and the friendly roll for Mark Mitchell second field goal of the night for Duke how good has Mitchell been an ACC play averaging over 13 points seven rebounds and hes overcome some early shooting woes now got the switch Harrison Ingram being guarded by Proctor good d by Proctor to stay in front of them tend to shoot Ingram trying to back him down banks at home tough shot anytime he gets a switch and has a guard on him hes just going to back him down go oneonone we chronicled to that today on college game day and already weve seen it twice first against McCain now against Proctor what an addition to the Carolina program hes been on the court and in the locker room as well Hubert Davis tells us hes the connector of the team Ryan in transition no call and then a steel by kadoo what a play by Kad and corm Ryan knocks down his third third three of the game John sh needs a timeout that was a spectacular play by Elliot Applause kadu what a start for the Tar Heels here at Cameron North Carolina has come out with its hair on fire thats quite a hair do that Elliot Kau has but not only getting the steel but having the presence to kick it to corm Ryan for his third three of the Applause game this is your invitation ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by the new 199 crispy tender wraps for a limited time only at Sonic senior night here at Duke for three players including the guy in the Middle with the number three jersey a fouryear starter and Jeremy roach with more heres Jess so Jeremys journey to and through Duke has been anything but ordinary so while being heavily recruited by Duke Jeremy tore his ACL back in 2018 when he was just 16 but coach Shyer immediately reached out and said hey you are still our priority fast forward freshman year was Co no NCAA tournament sophomore year he went to the final four during coachs K uh coach Ks final season and junior year named captain for Coach shs first year as head coach and led the team to an ACC Championship nowor year and Coach H says Jeremy has been extra special and their bond began back when he started texting him when he tore his ACL saying hey I see you Im with you and Im here for you hes had a terrific year on and off the court leadership and production but right now Dukes got problems they coughed it up again Carolina has executed beautifully at the offensive end theyre six for seven from the floor deflected off filipowski it still belongs to the heels and right now North Carolina is not only quicker to loose balls theyre first on the floor and North Carolina has actually bullied Duke a little bit you know when theyre trying to set a cross screen now you just saw the the turnover and then corm Ryan Dives on the floor and is first to the floor hes already got three threes missed that one balls loose botts got it and he calls a timeout right now theyre not 5050 balls theyre 100 Z in favor of North Carolina back to Cameron in 30 what a start for Music Carolina Stitch fix online personal styling straight to your door looking good Stitch fix style you can feel good news a house just popped up on the m Ms do you have time for a quick video tour that would be fantastic oh wow this place has the kind of space youve been looking for space space would be great expertise just one of the many ways an agent whos a real tour works for you cormack Ryan has come out in this first half and has been on Fire Two Shots in transition one off the steel and the pass from his backside from Elliot Kad and the transfer from Notre Dame has nine points in the first few minutes of this game that matches his total from the first game against Duke in the Dean doome corack Ryan has become more of a driver this year and if you run him off that threepoint line hes been much better at getting a piece of the paint Carolina ball with an early 11point lead here in this one Kido using the ball screen from Bott the drive the scoop and the Finish you know that Elliot kadu is not going to pull up for a threepointer there and Duke just lost him in simple ball screen action got all the way to the rim and John Shire has to be disappointed with the way his team has started McCain slips but theres a foul on Elliot kdo just a ball screen up top in the slot and Elliot kadoo able to turn the corner get all the way to the rim when you run that in the middle of the floor its so hard to help because youre helping off the threepoint line what does Duke need to do to settle down and and get a good look at the offensive end well you heard J Sims at the start of the game say value offensive possessions and Duke has not gotten the shot they want early on you credit North Carolinas defense it has been spectacular roor with a strong Drive in Finish you one of the things Dan about North Carolinas defense this year it is much more physical and they impact the ball with pressure they are more out in passing Lanes than the past several years that I can remember and its been a long time since youve talked about North Carolina and you led with their defense its usually their offense that youre afraid of and this year youre concerned about their defense they are ranked sixth in the nation in defensive efficiency per kenpom one thing they can always do as you know well Jay is get on the offensive glass yeah no nobody boxed out on the weak side it was both Withers and Ingram over there just playing volleyball after the Miss by Bott with oneonone in the post against Johan Stewart Hubert Davis also getting good mileage out of his bench this year whether its Withers Trimble jayen Washington it is a deeper team than it was a season ago we barely said RJ Daviss name and Carolinas up 13 already that shows you that theyre a pretty a pretty good club its not just a oneman show with this guy blocked from behind by Shawn Stewart Tyrese Proctor struggled in Chapel Hill against Carolina but just gives almost a little Euro Step gets into the lane and gets right around Armond Bott whos the best shot blocker for North Carolina but watch this weak side rebounding coverage you had just Kyle filipowski having to deal with both Withers and Ingram and twoonone rebounding is not what you want you have to have somebody crack down to pick up that second rebounder the lowski SS Washington has just come in for Bott jayen Washington the 610 sophomore out of Gary Indiana not playing a ton because hes behind Bott but very productive on a permanent basis and an early touch for him hes a face up big guy Trimble passed up to three is not really an outside shooter and then he stepped out of bounds yeah thats one even though hes not known as an outside shooter he can make a three and you cant pass that shot up hes actually shooting a good percentage just doesnt take many he is nine for 24 this year was just one for six last year from three as a freshman and he had 10 points and two assists in the first game against Duke in just 19 minutes and hes a a powerful guard can play the four spot if he has to but hes a really good Defender cant play with the ball in front of him Applause young the 50e senior he was part of senior night as well two years here after three at Northwestern roach and its going to be Shawn Stewart over the back Shawn Stewart just shoved Jaylen Withers in the back but North Carolina has done a really good job defensively Harrison Ingram did an excellent job there early on Jared McCain just a really good contest there by Jaylen Washington forcing Jeremy roach to finish a tough two and right now you know you heard Jess Sims talk about at the top of the top of the broadcast you know Duke wanted to run really good offense disciplined offense to get the shot they want and what can you cant even count on one hand the good shots that Duke has seen in this game because of Carolinas defense cormack Ryan has returned for Carolina and hes got three threes already nice Fe from RJ Davis and Washington slams it home that is a play Dan that Jaylen Washington would not have made last year he had that dunk he had some injuries last year remember that a similar dunk against Virginia then got hurt in that game he was busting out in that game but thats a big time finish by Jaylen Washington he is a talent G to go young Proctor young gets it back again McCain pulls up from 12et and knocks it down oh there Trimble did a really nice job there of running Jared McCain off the threepoint line he got the two but it was a contested two in the lane the important part for Trimble he took away the three Washington can shoot it as well misses the three roach pulls up for a transition Applause three now Proctor crossing over on Davis good job by pack Ryan with a high hand there on Jeremy roach just discouraged that shot and really good defense in the corner there by Seth Trimble to force a turnover stayed in front and then reassumed the pressure by Jaylen Washington coming into the game for arond Bott given really solid minutes and the excellent penetration by RJ Davis gets into the lane draws Ryan young and Jaylen Washington with an exclamation point on the play Carolina out to a got with the purpose you catch it in the pocket tell me raise your hand if you the ball to the rim yet tyres has one have either of you guys yet to the how many screens have we set yet thats our Coach K looking on here at Coach K Court watching this game and you heard John Shire talking really about things at the offensive end cutting with a purpose hard screens got to work to get open yeah thats really doing your work early youre not just going to find yourself open you have to work to get open and you have to work through physical Play Because North Carolina has been physical and theyve discouraged passes theyve impacted the ball theyve pushed Duke further out and when you get resistance you have to meet it with as much strength as they give it kads pass is stolen and proor gets them all riled up here at Cameron with the steel in the dunk and immediately after that happened Hubert Davis summoned Harrison Ingram to check in botts coming in as well Trimble from the free throw line gets the bounce thats where he operates is taking the ball to the basket hes an explosive athlete thats a strong driver you have to keep him out of the paint lowski has it knocked away gets it back now McCain whos been so good for Duke knocks down a long two well that was good strength by Jared McCain went right into the defense knocked it back and was able to step back from that open shot completely inbalance that was using his strength and meeting the resistance that Carolina was providing Here Comes Ingram Here Comes Bott for Hubert Davis John sh has put TJ power a freshman from Shrewsberry Mass into the game a really good outside shooter TJ power 13 of his 14 field goals on the season are threes but you can drive him Ingram drove Mitchell got it back and hit it but he is a beast 11 rebounds a game in ACC play and he takes advantage of every matchup that is in his favor the lowski thought about the three now trying to back down bot kicks it out Mitchell for three hes been making him an ACC play but it misses that one you have to give Mark Mitchell a lot of credit he started out the season one of 19 from three and teams were not even guarding him specifically Arkansas when they went on the road in the ACCC Challenge and the first game they played against Arizona here in the building Umar balow didnt even go out to go near him and he is really improved K with a drive look at the quickness that this kid has Carolina leads by 15 well you say that Elliot kdo is not a perimeter shooter hes a driver and still he drives I mean that shows how good he is putting the ball on the deck and getting into the paint past the Midway point of the first half RJ Davis getting set to check back in hasnt scored in this game and the heels have a 15point lead roach driving into a trio of Defenders and now hes caught behind the play its five four Ryan into Bott and they play on oh Bott missed it what a play by cormack Ryan to take on filipowski Mitchel nobody to pass to so hell drive it and draw the foul Elliot Kad is just a freshman and he just muscles past with great quickness Jeremy roach to get all the way to the rim and Harrison Ingram just playing Bully ball inside gets his own rebound off the block shot and still able to get that midrange shot in the lane he has been fantastic not only in this game but all season long now for the 39th year champ week continues tomorrow with three womens title games on ESP in the app the ACC Championship game is at one Eastern followed by the SEC Championship game and then the Pack 12 championship game caps a great afternoon what a day so many teams will be crowned and turny bound Dan right now North Carolina shooting 63 from the field in large measure because they are getting open threes in transition cormack Ryan has been fantastic with catch and shoot and theyre getting into the lane at will Proctor guarding Davis Davis tried to find a little bit of open space the accs leading scored better than 21 a game Ryan with a shot fake and a drive and he has it knocked away thought he got fouled filipowski for three offensive rebound McCain Proctor for three tipped up in by Philipi that was all started by Jared McCain one of the best guard rebounders in the ACC averages five rebounds a game had 11 rebounds against North Carolina and Chapel Hill a touch for bot and the fouls called on filipowski I think filipowski is claiming that Bott even though he was the offensive player might have hooked his arm they got all tangled up well Bott raised that left arm Im not sure he hooked him but he raised it up it was close to one and but but hes got him underneath thats where the call came from I dont think that rises to the level of a hook and hold but certainly one that way they would call a foul on here Davis loves replay he was thrilled with everything when we talked to him before the game except he didnt understand the music the players were listening to before the game he said I cant even make out any of the words yeah and then I said what would you play if it were your choice he goes not this thats right RJ Davis knocks it down and the lead is back to 15 for the Tar Heels another catch and shoot three filipowski the spin and the kick power for three and kdo is called for the foul hes claiming it was clean so itll be three free throws coming for the Blue Devils when we come back Carolina with a great 12 minutes so far here at Duke ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Coke Zero sugar is it the best Coke ever try and decide here in this one as well hes got six points three rebounds already and when Harrison Ingram plays against Duke its a family affair for more on that lets go down to jez yeah Dan when you combine the Duke UNC rivalry with sibling rivalry you get Harrison Ingram and his younger sister Lauren who just so happens to be a freshman volleyball player here at Duke so she wore his UNC Jersey when Duke played at Carolina last month but she told him she is not wearing a UNC Jersey here in Cameron so she went neutral and I I definitely think she went with the right choice thats a tough spot I mean thats a for her to be in I think shes made I think shes you know straddling that line about as well as she can shes doing it very well but I dont think anyone would blame her for supporting her brother it was probably it probably be easier to wear a Stanford Jersey in this in this game because Harrison Ingram started his career at Stanford before transferring to North Carolina but he is having a spectacular Applause year remember power fouled on a threepoint attempt he has made one of the first two hes getting a bit more minutes lately Shawn Stewart is getting a few more minutes lately there without Caleb Foster one of their guards another freshman he is still out wearing a boot has a lower leg injury as power comes out and Caleb Foster is an outstanding shooter so it takes away a threepoint shooter Duke got five guys that could really knock down shots Carolinas got three its RJ Davis cormack Ryan Harrison England so far ton Carolina four for six from three duks o for five Ingram the step in and draws a foul well that was a great job by Armando bot remember he had five assists in the first game in Chapel Hill and those you know the passes he made out of the post led to 10 points for North Carolina and that pass he made to Ingram Ingram was just outside the threepoint line and Kyle filipowski had to come out to him and he did a great job of Faking and driving and picking up that foul our ESPN NBA Sunday night double headers starts with the Knicks hosting the 76ers at 7 Eastern then Anthony Edwards and the twolves taking on LeBron and the Lakers in La how much fun is Anthony Edwards to watch well you figured he would be after how fun he was to watch at Georgia remember that game he had in Maui against Michigan State where he put up over 40 yeah he was great in the World Cup for the us as well he excels at all levels of basketball really good job just bumping Kyle filipowski so he cant get that low post position filipowski got bon in the air but he lost the ball it still belongs to Duke with t to shoot and even when Duke has had the advantage I mean he had that within two feet of the basket Carolina is still reaching in knocking it away they are really difficult to score against you asked Hubert Davis before the game about the the dedication to defense and how much he talks about it and he says he talks about defense twice as much as he talks about offense and in the last two years he estimated it was a 5050 split well you can see what theyve emphasized is what theyve become and they didnt just speak it into existence theyve worked at it and for this team that really struggled last year missed the NCAA tournament after going to the national championship game the year before you know theyve established a defensive identity first and then their offense flows from that theyre still good in transition theyre still good on the offensive glass and theyve got RJ Davis and Armando Bott two great players but they dont have the same kind of Lottery talent that maybe theyve had in past years but their defense has been just workmanlike all year long they keep you under 70 they beat you this year theyve won five in a row overall and on a number of occasions theyre keeping teams down in the 60s and what theyve done is disrupt any kind of Rhythm that Duke can establish on the offensive Applause end vot kicks it back out to Davis still lots of time lost it Proctor ahead of the pack to lay it in well thats two buckets that Tyrese CER has off of Carolina turnovers one off the rip steel and then Davis mishandles it Trimble turns the corner and he lays it in boy talk about too easy little bit of ball movement and all of a sudden the middle opened up like the Red Sea filipowski again banging with a bayot too strong off the glass Carolina Applause running Ingram Dr drives pulls up and missed the eightfooter bodies on the deck and back comes McCain Ingram went down again filipowski looks like hes bothered by something behind the play and now back come the heels and what an offensive rebound by Ingram to get a fresh possession for Carolina guess who Harrison Ingram he is a hard hat rebounder filipowski stuck on Davis open is Ingram good block out there by Young filipowski the rebound and its Duke ball well Duke has found it really difficult to score in this game but theyve gotten a couple buckets with tyres Proctor taking it the other way had a steal off a bad pass and then look at this just a a simple little exchange on the right wing and all of a sudden everything opens up and oo you seen that movie before yeah not a great look there filipowski to the bench Carolina up 12 Ted Valentine talking to filipowski Ted Valentine Bert Smith Tony Henderson the officials tonight in a very low foul first half there havent been many fouls Applause called four on car Carina three on Applause du boy cormack Ryan doing a good job locking and trailing on Jared McCain McCain gets just a little bit of space Andries the three McCain didnt give up went out to the left then came out back to the right and boy did he set his feet in a hurry good defense better offense nine for McCain soft touch in the midrange game for RJ Davis he can make every shot but the first thing you have to do is get him off that threepoint line make him take those tough twos you take your hat off to him for making it at some point in the ACC tournament hes going to surpass 2000 career points what a career he has had in Chapel Hill its really been amazing you know he took over a couple years ago from Caleb love the point guard duties or at least most of the primary ball handling duties and I think when that happened Carolina took off of course they had Brady manik on that team W up in the national title game against against Kansas but he has been as good as any guard in the country this year First Team all America without question W had it taken away McCain hes got help and is fouled before the shot no basket smart foul by cormack Ryan that saved to bucket Duke nows going to have to inbound the ball and play five on five really smart foul first foul on Ryan Applause well there are a lot of guys on both teams they dont shy away from the physical play theyll stick their noses in there wide open Proctor boy Hubert Davis cant be happy with that that was too easy looked like they were doing a little pre switching but just a simple swing to the left side and a wide open three and Duke is climbing back into it Ingram shut off by Young keeps the dribble alive cant hit it McCain to the free throw line two strong what great defense by Seth Trimble to stay in front and really put pressure on that shot transition three wont go for Davis young the Applause rebound and Paxton wuk of Carolina called to the foul with 319 to go in the half as duke is making more of a game of it right now Mr B well Duke able to get out in transition and primarily because of Tyres Proctor but just way too easy a terrific pass Tyrese Proctor much better in this game Stitch fix online personal styling straight to your door they can set their defense they cant turn it over and let Duke get out in transition again whats at stake tonight if Carolina wins they are the outright ACC regular season Champions if Duke wins each school will hang a banner each will share the championship and it would remain to be seen whos the one seed in the ACC tournament comes down to tiebreakers and what happens in a couple of the other games that are going on right now as Seth Trimble just got poked in the eye poked in the eye after he made a great deflection and a steel off a simple inbounds play on side out of bounds he impacts the game with his defense about as well as any player in the ACC just caught a little finger across the eye there from the left hand of Mark Mitchell right now on the floor Dan Carolinas basically got three scores Bott Ingram and Davis Mark Mitchell was assessed to foul on that play cormack Ryan has now just gotten up to go check in and he was instant offense in the first couple of minutes of this game here comes the back down got an Applause advantage Trimble passed up the three steps in for the two and hits it wow he passed up an open three for a difficult two but shot it with great touch Seth Trimble defense in this game has been exemplary Carolinas got Elliot kadell on the bench The Freshman has two fouls filipowski has been out for a stretch here for Duke Ryan young continues to man The Five Spot and Proctor draws a foul well Trimble picked up the foul but its like he was born in a stance you he was siding that trying to keep it to the right side and then just got into Jared McCain a little bit too much as he was trying to turn the corner just gapped it went underneath Ryan young but all game long he has been down low in a stance and to get by seventh team foul committed by Carolina so McCain to the line if you watched much Duke basketball at all youre probably pretty familiar with the numbers first eight games of the year McCain averaged about seven and a half points per game hes been at about 15 and a half points per game ever since he was very good against NC State at 16 points five rebounds and had a fourpoint play in transition that was spectacular and I dont think anybodys going to forget got that 35 Point out burst he had against Florida State he made8 threes seven of them in the first half and hes got a game high 11 already in this one Duke was down double digits for a while down by eight right Applause now Ryan driving on filipowski and draws a foul thatll be number two and thats really the difference in cormack Ryan this year versus perhaps last year he is not just a shooter hes got the shot credibility from Deep give you a little shot fith but he put the ball on the deck and went hard into the lane to draw that foul and he was body seeking against Kyle filipowski couple of huge pickups in the transfer portal for Hubert Davis Carolina in Harrison Ingram and cormack Ryan Jaylen Withers also a nice Edition hes coming in now veteran player from Louisville getting about 10 12 minutes off the bench in a backup roll and Jaylen Withers hit 43point field goals last year at Louisville hes only got three this year but hes athletic and can come into the game provides a a more athletic Dimension one of two and a ninepoint game this is a really important last two minutes of the first half can Carolina stretch it out or can Duke eat into this ninepoint lead roach back to filipowski proor Baseline the kick in the corner roach misses the three young the rebound wideopen Proctor boy young battling for it again but it comes down to BAC what a great kick out by Ryan young you cant ask for more wide openen three duke just didnt make it Duke two for 10 from three pull up Davis rebound bot boy a couple of pretty good looks for Carolina that wont go down but Duke ran RJ Davis off the threepoint Applause line a minute 10 to go in the half Bowski gives it to Roach right now Duke looks like theyre cutting at three4 speed roach with a nice drive gets the lead down to seven for the heels just had that Carolina defense lifted and no help side first points of the night for Jeremy roach on his senior night Ingram with a size advantage on roach no double Withers open in the Applause corner if Duke can get a score here you go into halftime feeling a heck of a lot better they are within Striking Distance they were down as many as 15 earlier in this game and its been methodical this comeback Proctor Beyond The Arc bot on him hell pull for three and Ingram the rebound and lots of time for Carolina to get a look Ingram a tough one in the corner Withers up and in boy if thats not emblematic of the first half just more alert and quicker to the ball to get that stick back Carolina has led wire to wire it was Ryan early and then a Miss three by Duke and an offensive rebound and put back for Jaylen Withers tough shot half Duke shot 37 and Bott and Davis are only three of 10 theyve got seven points and Carolina still up nine I think Carolinas got to go into Bott to start the second half J Sims had a chance to talk with John sh at halftime I caught up with Coach sh as he was coming out of the locker room and he said listen we had a horrible start and we gave them life early but he does think that they won the rest of the half so he said once we sto being antsy on offense and just started to settle in we made a h big difference and then the other thing we got to get those loose balls that yall were just talking about up there and those rebounds wellrun play on the first possession but filipowski cant finish it and its Carolina ball up by nine and Bott did a really nice job of ch challenging filipowski at The Rim to make him finish it and did so without fouling Ryan not shy at all misses the three and Mitchell down with a rebound for the Blue Devils Davis was the first cutter Ryan the second roach Ryan good defense but filipowski comes up with the loose ball and lays it in and maybe thats the kind of thing can that can get Kyle filipowski going in this Applause game Bott good deflection in Steel by filipowski just had his hand in the passing Lane for that little pocket pass winds up with Ingram on him the turnaround goes and two quick buckets here early in the second half for Duke pal filipowski playing Bully ball against Harrison Ingram didnt get pushed back and now its a fivepoint game who sat for a while in the first half with a couple of fouls is fouled here on the runner and he will shoot a couple I think thats the third foul on Kyle filipowski I think you are Applause correct good steel just getting his hand in the passing Lane that right hand and then playing a little bully ball against Harrison Ingram and he doesnt shrink against the physicality of Ingram just went right into his chest and finished it with the right hand kadell misses the first Hubert Davis talked to us about kdo the Freshman a five star recruit and said you know a lot of five stars come in and they say hey you Im pretty good and I was you know I was on this team and and kdo he said realize quickly whoa there are a lot of good players here and he said and he said kdo is perfectly willing to understand I can still improve Ive got to be coached as we welcome you back to this ESPN Sonic Blockbuster Carolina leading Duke by six Philip powski what a start to the second half for him oh Bott giving him some space thinking he would drive just gave a little jab step and pulled up for that three its filipowski 7 Carolina one here in the second half good d by Mitchell didnt let Ryan are in the corner Davis trying to shake Proctor takes a bump and finishes RJ Daviss handle is so good the crossover to get to that right hand but give Proctor Credit he is not allowing him open threes you make him take those tough twos the drive and the foul on B filipowski showing he can go to his left hes not just a right driver and he in this second half he has taken it physically to Armando Bott got a couple between the legs but that left to right crossover just gave him the space and thats a big time finish and then filipowski little jab step froze the defender Armando Bott then he pulls up for the three part of what makes filipowski such a difficult cover at times as he he can go after you inside he can go after you outside as well well hes at the free throw line now big day for lip readers there well you have to think that John shy and the entire Duke coaching staff challenged Kyle filipowski to be more of a factor in this second half he was knocked back in the first but hes come out on fire in the second one of two hes still got all eight dke points here in the early going in the second half you have to think that Bott needs to touch it down in the low post especially with filipowski having three fouls now there it is going right after him missed with the left hand Mitchell the rebound well even though he missed it I I still think Carolina needs to go and play through bot McCain do an open roach count it and its a onepoint game just D getting that piece of the paint collapses the defense and then they can kick it out Davis with an airball back comes McCain roach off the glass s battling for it but Ingram has it for the Tar Heels ell K looked like he was looking for a screen gave up the drive Ryan spinning into traffic and a foul is called cormack Ryan hit those three early threes but since then hes used the threat of the three to put the ball in the deck and seek out bodies to get fouled Jeremy roach getting it inside all of a sudden Elliot kadoo goes to the ball overh helps and roach with the wideopen three well there was clean a clean block up top but there was a lot of contact before that that Drew the foul Ryan knocks down the first so hes into well hes got 11 now in the game again the three early threes that Jay just Applause referenced all kinds of action going on around the ACC obviously this is for either an outright championship Carolina or a shared Championship if Duke wins theres another big one going on Wake Forest desperately needs a win theyre up seven late on Clemson everybodys going to the nations capital next week for the ACC tournament I thought we were going to Washington DC oh was that the nations capital yeah I think so I learned something new every day tough scoop there by kadoo Just Too Many Bodies one thing fock cant do is is overh help here and leave filipowski open a good denial by Cormac Ryan Kane has to back it out to Proctor T to shoot oh what a move and filipowski fouled by Ingram boy rather than just go in that handoff action what all the Defenders was anticipating just an inside pivot that gave him a lane to the basket what a the new 199 crispy tender wraps for a limited time only at Sonic lots of dignitaries in the house tonight including the Man For Whom the court is named in this building and rightly so of course the former head coach of the Duke Blue Devils the five time National Champion to Mike shashki his wife Mickey alongside and then uh the biggest name in an absolutely stack loaded recruiting class for next year the John shires bringing in Cooper flag is here Cooper flag the most popular export from Maine since Lobster just kind of a Doit all a big guy who can do it all right play uh 3 four five with a position L big yeah hes a hes a lottery Pick and he can do it all at his size hes reminds you of Christian leer the lowski to roaches you can see have combined for all 11 Duke points in this half filipowski eight roach three but filipowski just missed the first North Carolina needs to get Armando Bott going and often times what theyll do when hes on the perimeter theyll screen him into the low post or they can use a guard to set a little little on big cross screen to get him positioned in the post but I think they need to go to him funny how different games can be Bott had 25 points 10 rebounds and five assists in the first game back in Chapel Hill hes got two points four rebounds tonight now he has just doubled his point total and hes going to the line as well corm Ryan just set a little cross screen for Arondo Bott to give him a little bit of Separation Ryan young did a good job of pushing him off the block but he just went oneonone in the post Duke decided not to double and he just gives a little drop step got the contact and still finish that with the left hand I think Carolina very smart to try to get Armando Bott going in this second half and one thing that hurt Duke in the first game we talked about the five assists that aott had three of them were for three pointers they doubled him and hes good passer found the open man so uh Duke willing to go a little bit more oneonone but right after that play Ryan young came right back out Kyle filipowski came right back in and that very play that they ran we showed it on college game day as something Duke was going to have to deal with what a block witherss got all of that here comes Trimble challenging filipowski and the follow good for Withers what a sequence for him at both ends of the floor well by challenging filipowski not only could you have picked up the fourth foul on filipowski but he takes himself out of rebounding and Withers took advantage of it thats two stick backs in this game for jayen Withers and a block for b and a great look ahead for Ryan he will lay it in well Carolina is taking advantage of Duke in trans transtion Duke has really only had a couple transition buckets and its off the turnovers that Tyrese Proctor took the other way other than that North Carolina has limited Duke in transition all of a sudden a 70 run for Carolina and Jay Carolina turning defense into offense well weve talked about Carolinas defense Withers with the block that starts the break Trimble a smart play to take it against pH filipowski and that gave the offensive rebound and then Carolina has played Duke at the end of the season with something at the top of the league on the line an outright clinch or if they win they would share something riding on the result Carolina has won all eight times three of them here in this building thats a pretty good record and in order to win this one outright by winning in Cameron Indoor Stadium tonight it has to remain a defensive effort and thus far in the game Carolinas defensive effort has been stellar Duke ball McCain to inbound filipowski driving on Bott got him to bite on the fake and lays it in that was beautiful well they ran that similar Play Its just to get an isolation for Kyle filipowski so he can dribble to his right oneonone against armono Bott just a a superior shot fake at the end of that play filipowski now with 11 in the second half stood his ground defensively Withers came up with a rebound gets it back from Ryan and then turns it over well Withers should have gone up with that but what an alert play by Jared McCain to take it away what a nice pass by McCain he finds Mitchell Withers down with a rebound well Withers has challenged at The Rim on numerous occasions hes been so active Carolina getting good out of their bench players tonight as Bott lays it home Bott got the angle he got Kyle filipowski on the high side just sealed him off and filipowski could not afford to foul filipowski for three Mitchell the Applause rebound 11 in the half for Kyle filipowski 15 on the night Trimble good defense on the perimeter shot clock at four tough turnaround and here come the heels really good job by Bott ball deflected out of bounds and it belongs to Duke as Carolina comes up empty in transition filipowski getting to his right hand here with the inside pivot and this shot fake and then pivot just let Armando Bott fly by just a great play by Kyle filipowski on the other end Armando Bott seals off filipowski and then all of a sudden he has to go over Jared McCain with the left hand just a really good play to get an angle by Armando Bott Bott now with seven filipowski physically going at jayen Washington as soon as Bott left the game filipowski you could see decided that he wanted to try to take Washington right down under the bucket and when Philip psky got into Washingtons chest what that does is keeps Washington from being really able to jump to challenge that shot he wound up fouling but that physicality on the drive really made it for pH filipowski West Coast Conference tournament action continues tonight at 10 Eastern on ESPN two all a part of champ week presented by principal St Marys and Gonzaga safely in the field well see who plays them in the semifinals top two seats of the West Coast Conference get a buy to the semis so somebody can pull off an upset J and win that conference tournament maybe a three you would think a three bid leag for the the West Coast Conference you think the top two are safe they are absolutely safe both Gonzaga and St Marys are firmly in the field filipowski gone to the bench again young and Stewart up front right now for Duke Davis defended well by roach roach not helping off at all its been Proctor most of the game Trimble into the paint bounces off the rim still loose Duke has it a lot of arm there when Sean Stewart grabbed that rebound Shan Stewart has given the Blue Devils some very good minutes in their last three games becoming a bigger part of the rotation well especially against NC State at 12 points I think he blocked three shots in that game he was spectacular played 26 minutes filipowski had foul trouble what a steal by Ingram and hes fouled by Young that short roll is really difficult to deal with and Ryan young trying to give it up instead of taking it himself this city is under siege by an Army of Ghosts ACC mens Tournament begins Tuesday afternoon at Capital 1 arena in Washington DC there are three first round games coming your way on acc Network on Tuesday first game tips off at 2 pm as of Wednesday things move over to ESPN and ESPN 2 and with Carol if Carolina wins tonight theyre the outright regular season Champs obviously the one seed if Duke wins tonight with wake having beaten Clemson if Duke wins tonight and pit loses its game to NC State then Duke would be the number one seed if Duke wins and pit wins then Carolina would be the number one seed all kinds of complicated tie Breakers but back to wake for a sec that is an enormous win for Steve Forbes and the deak they had lost their last three they put themselves in real Jeopardy Joel lardy has them next four out I believe at the moment that was almost a must have for them beating the Tigers tonight no question and if Wake can win a couple games in the ACC tournament I think they will be in the field but cormack Ryan with another strong drive that gives him 16 points for the game that Tes ties Kyle filipowski for the scoring leader in this game what a play by kadoo and another example of a tar heel getting to the floor first but it winds up in a loose ball and a Tyrese Proctor three off a broken play well Duke taking advantage of that broken play but you have to give credit to kadoo first to the floor great hustle and now Shawn Stewart called for the foul John shy has Stewart defending bot down in the paint and Kad just beating Jared McCain to the ball and because Kyle filipowski was able to beat Harrison Ingram to it that led to a wideopen three for Proctor but B able to get that position on Stewart for the high low just not enough pressure on Harrison Ingram and again Stewart on Bott John sh told me this morning we just want him to be a past it also can help keep filipowski out of foul trouble but it results in a bucket for B well the one thing thats a two they are keeping RJ Davis from getting threes and outside of the first few minutes theyve taken threes away from cormack Ryan as well McCain just keeps on going and lays it in with the left hand well he got RJ Davis on his back and just kept him there in jail and was able to get all the way to the rim Jared m is a player foul before the slam that was a big time pass by cormack Ryan throwing it along the Baseline and old Tom Davis special just picking picking off RJ Davis off that handoff action and not letting him get back around in front and J those quick fouls on Stewart hes now got four and hes gone to the bench so Ryan young has come back in and young is on bayai John Shire obviously deliberately trying to keep filipowski away from Bott right now Ma Ryan for three boy what a pass by Armando Bott and cormack Ryan there was Zero hesitation talk about catch and shoot how do you take a catch and shoot away when its up that Applause fast there was one possession early in the second half Duke had the ball down by one they didnt score theyve never LED and Carolinas got it back out to 10 roach blocked by Ryan and then the foul is called Armondo baught oneonone in the post against Ryan young and Jared McCain caught a little bit in no mans land you just have to stick with cor M Ryan you just cant allow him catch and shoot opportunities but give credit to to Ryan thats just a great shot with a really quick release on it he could be streaky just four for 17 on threes his last three games but the three prior games 14 for 27 shooting the three cor Ryan definitely has this in him by my math thats over 50 by anybodys math its over 50 but Ill humor you a much bigger night here in the rematch for Ryan and it all started early I mean he really set the tone for the game as you said it was like an instant replay backto back identical spots and identical threes in the opening minute and a half of the game kadoo out of bounds Carolina ball lot of contact between kdo and roach was a good idea for that pass but I think thats something that Elliot Kad needs to just go ahead and finish again young guarding Bott botts going to go right at him loves to go back Baseline and hes called for the offensive Applause foul little too much with that off arm Ted Valentine with the Applause call knocked Away by kadoo Ingram hes got Applause Ryan Ryan forces it up and young commits the foul another great play by Elliot Kad to knock that ball away and Ryan has used his threepoint shooting threat to become a driver when its appropriate and his drives have been been strong just a little shot fake and goes right around filipowski and uses an extra little fake to get Ryan young off balance just went right into him number three on Young and an 86 free throw shooter back to the line for the heels and in a game where Duke has basically taken away RJ Davis theyre sticking to him just hugging up on him not allowing him anything not helping off him cormack Ryan has stepped into that boy and he makes them both 21 points on the night now for cormack Ryan he had a big night in this building against Duke I think he had 27 when he was at Notre Dame hes not unfamiliar with big knights in this building the 21 hes got tonight thats a season High here for Ryan the grad transfer Bowski working hard wants hes got Withers on him Bott thinking about helping boy a lot of traffic down low and Duke comes up empty great challenge by Bop Davis finally a little space and he knocks down the runner he has such a good middle game those floaters pullup jumpers and Ted Valentine going to talk to bot and filipowski about the extracurricular activities a quick conversation no fouls called just want to want to keep things from getting too heated RJ Davis just cutting Against the Grain and then driving into the middle and hes such a good cutter but hes had very little space in this game due to Duke dedicating a Defender to him whether its Proctor or roach they have been stuck to him all game long not helping off think you had some accidental alliteration there due to Duke to dedicating The Defenders it wasnt accidental Applause alliteration roach and he is fouled did they get Davis or Kad they got yeah number three on Elliot kdo one thing that Duke has done well in this game is theyve kept North Carolina off the free throw line Carolina averages about 23 free throws a game on the Season 22 in ACC play and theyve been nowhere near that in this game senior night for Jeremy roach who has not definitively said he is leaving he could come back for one more year this is his 125th game as a Blue Devil his 103d start he has more than 14400 career points his family looks on Duke bringing a little full court pressure Applause 221 stolen by Philip hsky Duke trying to get it into single digits passing and catching McCain quick release and Ingram with the rebound right Ingram is a Workhorse on the glass 11 and a half rebounds a game in ACC play right on target yeah hes got nine tonight Bott leads the league for the year with just about 10 vott kicks it out five to shoot kads got a create and they turn it over 715 to go in a game in which Carolina has LED throughout trying to sweep the regular season series from the Blue Devils trying to pick up a win here in a hostile territory and so far so good for the heels theyre up 10 from Notre Dame has been outstanding Ryan has 21 points hes six of 10 from the field and hes got four of North Carolinas five threepoint field goals made and they have all been catch and shoot threes he has to be made into a driver but when hes been driving the ball hes been driving it strong and seeking out contact and getting to the free throw line cormack Ryan is one of the biggest reasons that North Carolina has this 10point lead heading into the last seven minutes of Regulation the Tar Heels as a team shooting an impressive 52 on the game they shot 51 in the win of du FB six back in Chapel Hill that is a much needed basket for the Blue Devils Jared McCain with a three Jared McCain just got a little fade screen coming toward the ball and he was ready to fire as soon as he caught it he had 11 points in that first half been a little quiet in the second he needs to get Applause going RJ Davis held in check tonight four for nine nine points for the accs leading score theyre making him give up the ball Ingram and it counts look like filipowski fouled him but Duke is trying they call it weak theyre sending RJ Davis to his left to his weak hand he can still go to his left but he just did a great job of throwing back to the screener Harrison Ingram so he could have oneonone against Kyle filipowski who had to get back to him and just able to go through his legs get into the middle and spin off and picked up that fourth foul on filipowski with 636 to go in regulation 10 now for Ingram marking the 17th game in a roj hes had either double figure points double figure rebounds or both you just cannot keep the man down well and hes so good at going after a mismatch and that may be because of the NBA background of Hubert Davis spent so many years in the NBA playing for the Knicks and the Mavericks Jared McCains pretty good for a freshman isnt he hes pretty good for anybody like Jared McCain is afraid of absolutely nothing know I got my nails done with him yesterday I saw that very uncomfortable hes a unapologetically himself Ive been apologizing for that ever since I dont know that hes going to win ACC Rookie of the Year Marcus Burton at Notre Dame has had such a great year theres bub Carrington at pit as well but he certainly I mean hell be you know on the all rookie team all freshman team without question he has been main stay for the Blue Devils and Ryan was kind of getting forced out of bounds so he will use a timeout with 614 to go well be back in 30 Carolinas Leed wire to wire theyre up seven right now here at Cameron here Papa John we know our stuff so try our garlic epic stuff crust pizza made with our iconic garlic sauce

well a little bit later on tonight theres more great basketball coming your way the West Coast Conference tournament continues at 10 Eastern on ESPN 2 quarterfinal action Santa Clara s Diego San Francisco Portland for the right to advance to the semifinals against the top two seeds in The gales and the zags the championship game Tuesday night at 9 Eastern on ESPN thats in Vegas isnt it I believe it is a long way from here even as the crow flies thats my bit youve got your bit Ingram up Mitchell a very good Defender goes by him and draws the foul that was well done by Ingram showing he has a little shake to his game as well got Mark Mitchell whos an excellent Defender off balance and able to get to that right hand the fact that he gets so low when he drives he drives with strength and how much better is Harrison Ingram at North Carolina than he was at at Stanford I mean all of his numbers his efficiency way up from when he was playing out on the west coast Hubert Davis says his shot has improved so much he is Tops on the team in steals second on the team in rebounding first in League Play second on the team in threepoint percentage third in scoring and third in assists he can he can help you win games every which way and hes also a good Defender but his rebounding is next level good especially in ACC play I mean you get 11 and a half rebounds a game and three offensive rebounds playing with Armando bot who gobbles up rebounds like crazy ilowski a big second half for him as he continues to play now with four fouls and I think they need to go right at him hes guarding Ingram and that puts Ryan Young on Armando Bott now hes going to back down Proctor with the the mismatch good cut by Ryan Ingram couldnt get it to him turn around no young the rebound Proctor did the best he could just make him take a tough shot over you and dont let him get all the way to the rim young just steps in oh and in and out that ball was halfway down and popped right back out well Ryan young is a non shooter from the perimeter so Armando bot is just standing in the middle of the lane clogging things up nearing the five minute Mark Carolina leading by seven Davis from the Baseline left it a little short got a little staggered screen but Duke was there to take away the three and thats what they want to do make him take tough twos well it feels like a big trip here doesnt it roach left hand no but a foul is called on Elliot Kad and thats where Kad has to be a little bit more disciplined hes got Armando Bott back there to block or change a shot you dont want to foul when youve got a big guy right there to help you see arando Bott just camped out in the lane hes there to make that a really difficult too you dont want to bail out Jeremy roach and send him to the foul line number four on kdo and an 86 free throw shooter at the line that means 14 of the time you that being an example hes hes due to make this one Seth Trimble back in the ball game Carolinas made excellent use of their bench and how about the job Jaylen Withers did when he was in there eight rebounds hes only played 11 or 12 minutes but blocked a couple shots really impactful six points as Applause well Davis gets it over to Ryan its only a sixpoint game and theres four and a half minutes to Applause go Ingram the drive over filipowski he knocks it down boy what a shot by Harrison Ingram gets the defender going one way what a move by filipowski and hes fouled by bot number three on Armando B Carolina needs to keep going at Kyle Philip palski put him in a position to get a foul or maybe to back off just a little bit but he put great pressure on that shot thats just a big time shot by Harrison Ingram never took his eyes off the rim look at that concentration that is is filipowski 15th point in the second half his 19th point on the night and hes been at the line tonight four for seven pending this one now five for eight and again its a sixpoint game this 221 three4 court pressure puts Carolina in a position maybe to turn it over but it takes time off the clock and they dont have to guard in the half cour for quite as long so Carolinas got to get into something quickly and Applause attack Here Comes Ryan gets it off and hits another one Cormac Ryan with his fifth threepointer for the night Duke thought that Ryan was going to set a back scream and instead it was a pin down a counter Philipi with the response now seeing some shot making in this Applause game Trimble gets it over and now to RJ Davis guarded by McCain help from filipowski good pass Trimble another good pass and filipowski with not one but two rejections at The Rim they better get a shot up Ingram knows it young the rebound wa how about that defense by filipowski with four fouls two blocks on Bott backto back well you get a score here thats Applause momentum the crossover on bacot left hand no Ingram has it didnt get the foul because it was offense initiated contact good decision decision by Trimble to get it back out to RJ Davis Huber Davis calling a play Trimble in one corner Ingram in the other Ryan setting the ball screen now slides out of it got to keep an eye on him beyond the perimeter got the switch filipowski on Davis Davis goes by him filipowski got a piece of it from behind and it stays with Carolina no foul call Davis thought he was hit by filipowski no foul call but it is Carolina ball well there was no question he was hit he was looking at the official saying what do I got to Applause do and no call on that Music play car line with a sixpoint lead 209 to go core M Ryan has been the man 24 Four Points five for seven from threepoint range and shush them here at Music Cameron why watch the shot clock the ball never hits the rim but the shot clock was incorrectly reset so you can see there its at 22 its under two seconds never hit the rim the balls still loose the officials look at the Monitor and have decided it is a because the ball was still loose after that its a shot clock by Duke ball oh in a sixpoint game Duke gets a score here especially a three and all of a sudden theres a lot of game pressure on North Carolina going down the stretch but Jeremy roach turns it over and that threat is diminished hes trying to pass it into the corner and just kind of fumbled it lost the handle and now again Carolina they can milk the clock just a little bit RJ Davis showing some patience and a little horn set and now they clear aside Ryan wow it is his night six made threes for cormack Ryan boy how quick was that release you you say take away his catch and shoot but when he gets it off that quickly hes got 27 points in this game he just saved it but its off Ingram out of bounds Ingram wants them to have a look at it look how quickly cormack Ryan get get this off Jeremy roach couldnt even get a hand up it was so quick even his teammates are impressed what a night for Ryan three early threes and then three more here in the late stages of the second half the officials have gone to the monitor again to see whose ball it should be the call on the floor is dukes that was is a dagger first the turnover by roach and then the resulting three by cormack Ryan Duke had a chance to take this under six points now all of a sudden its nine that looked like to me it was off of Ingram but Kyle filipowski got his hand in there that might might be what Ingram was talking about but I thought it was off Ingram and it will remain Duke basketball but theyre down nine with just a minute 21 to go now again a win for Carolina is the outright ACC regular season title they would obviously go into the ACC tournament in DC is the one C Duke would be the two these two teams right now Joey brackets has them both on the two line right now for North Carolina Dan they want to be thinking defense no threes and no foul John sh put TJ power back in the game because of his threepoint shooting ability roach drives and kicks power in the corner and he hits it well you dont want to help off you get caught in no mans land on a drive that can give up a tough two and Seth Trimble was caught in between the lane and TJ power and thats exactly what Carolina did not want to give up now watch Seth Trimble this drive he help he helps in and gets caught in no man land no mans land he couldnt really help on the drive he wasnt going to impact that and as a result he gave up an open three I always find it so impressive when a guy who hasnt played in a while and I dont think tos played in the second half hes only played three minutes in the game you come in you get your first touch in like half an hour and you can knock down a three thats his 15th made field goal of the season 14 of them are threes still a sixpoint lead though for Carolina Duke has not LED for a single second in this game they got to within one about three minutes into the second half and right now Duke wants to put on full court pressure give Carolina an opportunity to turn it over the two possession game Duke doesnt have to take crazy chances and foul instead of the 221 looks like theyre going to go M Pau to windbound theyll try to keep the ball out of Daviss hands proor on him into Ryan back to kadu and they get it Applause over and Davis will watch the clock tick under a minute left in regulation you have to think that Harrison Ingram going against TJ power is something that Hubert Davis wants to look toward Davis and Ryan excellent free throw shooters if it comes to that Davis just throws it up bot gets it back to kdo goes are you kidding with the shot clock winding down did he get it off in time it looked like he did an absolutely broken play desperation shot by kadoo knowing the situation on the shot clock did he get it off in time it looked to me in live action like he did but it was close he did yep what a big play by Elliot kadoo I mean that was a fingertip away from being a shot clock violation but you see it leaves his hand before it gets to dou zero on those red numbers it was scored a two on the floor it did look I think it looked like his right foot was on the line they may be looking at that as well I dont think he was worried about where his feet were he just wanted to get that thing off but whether its a two or a three thats a huge huge bucket by Elliot kdo no maybe not is he behind he might be behind Jared McCains foot was on top of his does that count the degree of difficulty on this play was rather High not easy at all hesitated a little bit talk about a big shot cormack Ryan hitting that three after the roach turnover and what easily could have been a shot clock violation turns into a separating bucket for North Carolina that looks behind it they have signaled it a two which I think was the initial call on the floor so maybe the officials just felt there was not overwhelming evidence to overturn it either way its a huge basket obviously for Applause Carolina Proctor was barely back in bounds in time hes trying to go coast to coast and he will succeed still a sixpoint game 35 seconds to go smart just to get to the rim extend the game Ryan pushed off and is called for the Applause foul oh my a delayed call but that left arm did come Applause up so Duke B Lou caresa the famous coach of St Johns used to say its a Subway push keep an eye on power hes hit one three recently a good switch out by Bott just to take a take away the three McCain theres power Ingram the close out power the drive and he lays it in and its down to four 232 seconds to go Davis Trimble Ryan and they will foul roach will foul Ryan and send again a very good free throw shooter to the line five for six tonight 86 on the season and on a night when hes having a a huge game and seeing a big basket but Duke didnt have a choice had to foul him if they could do it over they would have gotten to Trimble before he passed it to Ryan no question yeah Davis and Ryan are not the guys Duke wants to see on the Applause line two Applause shots a 25yearold sixthe player who has played a number of games in this building before while he was with the Irish started his career at Stanford playing for Jared H but played one of his first games at the Smith Center and he came out firing tonight and really hasnt stopped back to a sixpoint game well Dukes got to think about a three here 15 seconds thats it proor kept Alive by filipowski roach and that goes in and it makes it a one possession game game with 58 seconds to Music go well you have a long shot by Proctor that usually leads to a long rebound and Duke able to get that rebound and get a three from Jeremy roach just knocked back out and RJ Davis didnt even really put pressure on it didnt a foul but right now for North Carolina theyll be able to run the Baseline and its about getting the ball in cleanly and target number one is going to be RJ Davis get it to their best free throw shooter Carolinas top free throw shooter in Carolina history and then cormack Ryan is option number two get it to your two best free throw shooters Davis 89 Ryan 86 one thing that Carolina has to keep in mind here if they get trapped they have the possession arrow so if you get tied up you keep possession and one other developing story line the officials are at the monitor again reviewing that last shot by roach to see whether it was a two or a three and also maybe looking at time obviously if this were changed to a two thats huge call on the floor was a three ball goes through the basket there looks like the clock is right and from what we can tell up here in The Crows Nest no changes that yeah thats a yeah so the three stands the clock stands no changes I thought kadoo was behind it too I was little surprised I didnt overturn Music that obviously a decent possibility these two teams will meet again next week and theyre going in is the the one and the two one way or another so they couldnt meet until the championship game on Saturday night but first things first and the first thing is get this ball in cleanly for North Carolina theyre going to go with this football play when you can run the Baseline you can do Applause this filipowski playing free safety back at the threepoint line send somebody long let a post outout maybe a slant got to get it in Ryans got it and is fouled Bo it wasnt routine but the end result is pretty good from Hubert Daviss point of view the targeted receivers were Davis and Ryan and the quarterback CAU got it to one of the two he wanted to usually you dont like to talk about the sadistic ground acquisition game it is a sadistic ground acquisition game thats nothing more than a crypto fascist metaphor for Applause war the Voya player of the game tonight is standing at the free throw line right now cor M Ryan having a career night on a big big stage that is his 30th point of the game and I think he just salted this one away two possession game with 47 in regulation what a game by cor M Ryan started it strong finishing it strong made them both just 47 seconds to go Tyler Zella this morning talked about nothing better than a quiet Cameron Indoor Stadium and its pretty quiet right now as this one comes to an end Carolina sweeps the regular season series from duke they beat him by nine in Chapel Hill they beat him by five here tonight they lead wire to wire and they are the outright a regular season Champions theyll go into Washington in the ACC tournament as the one seed Duke will go in as the two seed a welld deserved win for the heels here at Cameron tonight
