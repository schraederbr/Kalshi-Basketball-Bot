give you a little respect plus they need it psychologically also when you look at the sec theres only two teams rated nationally out in the sec so youre not going to get many opportunities so any way you cut it one in five you dont have to be a genius to figure it out you need some ws and they need a win badly here today Applause ready to go before about 3 000 fans 15 capacity of the yum center in louisville one change in the expected starting lineup for kentucky terrence clark whos been nursing a sore ankle the last couple of weeks is not in the starting lineup so youve got devin askew back in the starting lineup along with davion mintz in the backcourt well see what kind of a start kentucky gets off to dick as you know one in five beat moorhead state in their opener since then theyve lost to richmond kansas georgia tech notre dame and north carolina in desperate need of a victory here this afternoon well you know dan you dont have to really when youre studying the stats its very simply to see why the lost five in a row turning the ball over and having a tough time shooting the three as they come up empty the air and you turn the ball over it and you dont shoot well i mean that is a formula for illusion as for louisville theyve got car leaked jones back his second game back off covet protocols he was not in the lineup in their lopsided loss to wisconsin he did return in the win over pitt as the cardinals strike with the first bucket of the game itll be samuel williamson coming off a really good effort against pittsburgh a doubledouble with 14 points and 12 rebounds nice runner there by devin askew who dick even though he hasnt started the last couple of games has been playing a little bit better he had a nice outing against north carolina they really played well off the bench against north carolina they stuttered off kentucky with a little zone defense louisville and home white kentucky in visiting blue kentucky 3716 alltime against louisville including a win in overtime last year and rupp and to back it down his man is drawing the foul david johnson the sophomore guard for louisville a casually attired john calipari here in the holiday season and we had a chance to talk to him on the phone yesterday dick and he said he wants his players to have fun he wants to empower them he wants to turn more things over to them in the game and let them figure things out as a unit well he really he was very you know optimistic about the future even though theyre one in five he really feels confident that theyre going to go on a run and ill tell you one thing about him john calipari you talk about a guy that eats sleeps and drinks the game he does and hes been in situations like this before and has had a way of rallying in his players meanwhile for louisville third year as the head coach of the cardinals chris mack after a very successful stint at xavier we had a chance to zoom with coach mack yesterday and hes fired up for this game dick we talked to him about it he said he feels they should have won in lexington last year and hes you know nobodys feeling sorry for anybody else right now hes thinking about his team at five and one even though theyve had injuries even though theyve had covet issues and went on a pause for about 16 days he wants this one badly as well yeah he really does he said you know its important to us as well we want this win its on our floor i mean it was a lot of talk earlier this year he wanted to play the game on a neutral calibration no no no and the reason he wanted to do that because of coleman 19 eliminating a chance to have a packed house here at uh louisville Applause right now for the cardinals Music and dre davis with a three not there but the long rebound tipped out to him but he cant handle it and its kentucky ball i think one of the reasons youve seen some zone earlier they want to make sure czar stays on the floor now heres to himself in foul trouble thats been a problem for kentucky yeah hes already got one and isaiah jacksons already got one so that is something to keep an eye on they both fouled out in the loss to carolina in kentuckys last game and many of them are silly fouls really are i think the kids have a real tough time getting into playing that mantoman defense especially the young guys uh high school now tsars been the guy around the block started wake forest many of us thought when he came here that he was the answer for them down in a post and it has not been yet didnt score didnt even didnt attempt a field goal rather only scored two points in the loss to carolina a louisville turnover and its been a concern for the cardinals as well not as big a concern as kentuckys had with the turnovers theres sar with a good look a little bit strong in the rebound down to johnson and louisville just looking like a more complete team with both johnson and jones in the lineup at the same time a good look for a straight on three for williamson but it wont go down yeah that backward is really a backward that knows how to play if you look jones is really gonna impact Music knocks it down his fifth three of the season kentucky came into the game shooting only 24 as a team from threepoint range one of the lowest percentages in division one well the fivegame losing streak they shot 39 3218 turnovers 17 a game i mean you do that you really get to go to the losers locker room if you havent seen louisville keep an eye on number one carly jones as johnson buries the three the assist to jones johnson a sophomore from louisville jones a grad transfer from radford the big south player of the year last year the only player in the country to average better than 20 points five rebounds and five assists per game and dick in the early going hes been one of the best players in the acc as well yeah hes missed the versatility hes very versatile he has stepped in and lived up to the expectations espn had him rated as the number one impact fifth year player and i thought when czar decided and he was the player eligible and he would be number one but right now he has not played to that kind of a reputation sarah with a turnover davis misses the long jumper and a strong rebound by jackson another one of the freshmen for kentucky hes out of pontiac michigan the runner in the lane way short for davion mintz the grad transfer from creighton the guy who started about 80 games in his career with the blue james yeah he had an injury though didnt play the last season shot out of kentucky and they need his outside shooting he can do that davis tries to thread the needle and another turnover committed to buy louisville yeah thatll drive coaches crazy these two coaches really concerned about the turnover situation that three well short by brandon boston junior and now a chance to run for three days in terms of shooting the trifecta for kentucky shot selections first median time out of the afternoon carly jones and the louisville cardinals with an early threepoint lead on the cats Music youve been putting back a few and a few kentucky wildcats start a season one and five a big problem dick alluded to this earlier the turnovers in the fivegame losing streak get this theyve got 51 assists and 85 turnovers overall 69 is just 100 turnovers the only win was against morehead state now they did play a great second half against notre dame and they did play a good first half against north carolina but at the end of the day as coach cal told us yesterday dick they are what their record says they are and they got to find a way to get some wins well he sounds like bill parcells used to talk back and they need some doubles and the one thing he said you know playing tough people now we got to get some ws badly you know think about this though offensively theyve been held up to 65 points five straight games last year they were only under 65 one time and that was a loss to evansville in a shocking loss terence clark who did not start the game for kentucky because of the bad ankle is in the game off the bench in an impressive drive and a finish there for davion mintz with a chance for a threepoint play as we get a chance to tell you weve got an american conference doubleheader coming your way tuesday on espn2 and also streaming live on the espn app itll be south florida taking on penny hardaways memphis tigers at seven eastern and then former kansas jayhawk quinton grimes leads houston against the golden hurricane who have won three st three straight an aac double header tuesday night they wanted to keep an eye on houston theyre legitimate and the one thing about coach sampson he knows how to win and grimes has been terrific for that down as you mentioned from kansas johnson with jacob top in on him topping the younger brother of obie topping it a guy dick whos been getting more playing time the last couple of games one of the reasons is kentuckys a man down cameron fletcher not with the team right now suspended they do hope hes going to return but john calipari said he had to be away from the team he had to work on some things and it sounds like you know attitude being a good teammate uh selflessness those sorts of things and coach cal said that he has had a talk with fletcher with fletchers mom and with fletchers high school coach and they do hope that he is going to be a part of the program again going forward you know what it is a kid like that comes there hes frustrated frustrated over lack of playing time and thats the one thing you got to understand when you go to kentucky theyre going to have players theyre going to have people to compete with and you know john calipari like many coaches if you prove in practice you can play and can help the team youre going to play he wants to win as bad as anyone so the bottom line is you prove it every day in your work ethic and what you do on a daily basis in practice lance ware 69 freshman out of camden new jersey knocks down a couple of free throws for kentucky the wildcats back on top by one in the early going to the kfc yum center you know where gives him some physical presence on the interior limited offensively but hes very tough tenacious kind of player part of that recruiting class rated number one in america jones from the free throw line in and out and a good rebound in traffic by topic isnt great legs he could get up for the floor Applause Applause front recovering from knee surgery the sophomore out of fayetteville north carolina not shy into the game and draining a three well thats one of the strengths chris thomas yesterday coach back that he could shoot the block give him some water thats a big time turnaround and the post there from topping to tie the game at 11 as both teams start to get into a better offensive rhythm now well who gets a play in time theres no doubt about his brother was unbelievable at peyton last year hey nickleberrys not shy is he dick hes been in the game about 30 seconds hes touched it twice hes shot it twice hes my kind of guy man he might get a guy he doesnt want to be big man on camera she got a score he does give louisville more depth again theyve had a number of injuries samuel williamson missed a couple of games nickelberry just back yep and yes still without malik williams who would be their starting five hes out probably until at least late january after a broken bone in his foot and jacob topic making the most of the increase in playing time you know hes a kid thats going to get better and better because hes got things you cant teach his athleticism his quickness and hes got to refine his game in terms of his skills this should help him a little bit right here this early start hes had heres jacob the younger brother of ob topping the former outstanding player a dayton current member of the new york knicks top in transferring from rhode island hes a sophomore jones threw all kinds of traffic and he turned it over Applause kentucky leading by two the wildcats getting a spark off the bench from jacob topa to take the lead yeah mr topping really giving him some productivity baby im so ashamed over people saying their 20point favor but i tell you this i was text messaging with brian kelly about you know merry christmas and i said coach i feel the shockers gonna come on and he came back and said i do too hey every countdown today theyre capable of having a great game but alabama on paper and look at their roster look at the nfl guys first round theres so much talent hey you know we mentioned louisville playing without malik williams 611 would be the best defensive player and veteran player candidate last year was right up top one of the guys for six man in a year in a conference and im telling you another guy dan charles midland but they get him back hes instant offense bob schuster and i did the game against godzilla last year championship in the conference tournament and he played great against godzilla like about 20 and ill tell you he would be an instant impact offensive help for this louisville team yeah he is still out with a knee injury so they havent had williams they havent had midland they were without nickleberry until their last game without williamson for a couple of games and without carly jones for one game plus stick the whole team had to shut down for over two weeks because of covet issues so yes they are five in one but it hasnt all been smooth sailing for chris max crew so far the early going this season they got two qualities too maybe the western kentucky team is really pretty good with charles passi and they also beat seton hall in a tough game timeout on the floor twopoint lead kentucky if only there was a place nearby you could get one of these or these good thing theyre sold literally everywhere business is done im pretty sure you could buy them at a bank not sorry reeses oh no another pizza deal thats carryout only introducing the new 10 taste maker from pizza hut get any three toppings you want delivered for just one easy payment of ten dollars pizza hut no one out pizzas the hut dan shulman dick vitale happy holidays everybody kentucky and louisville the one in five wildcats the fiveinone cardinals twopoint lead for the visitors about nine minutes into the first half the game coming to you from the kfc yum center this is the last nonconference game for louisville they go into acc play after this theres another turnover and ask you with a strong drive with a finish and ask hes off to a terrific start today hes got seven yeah really playing well think of advantage of the chance to start again theyre going with a full car trap theyre trapped there and then forced the turnover good move by john calipari thats another trap did it make them really handle the ball theyre coming after it Applause this time louisville will get it over johnson to jones in a clean look at a three will go down carly jones barley is some quality player did a great job as you said earlier but he played at radford terrific player making big plays throughout the season thus far comes into the game averaging 16 points per game better than five and a half assists per game but a great rebounder for a guard as well better than six rebounds per game how about the work getting done by lance ware who has definitely had an imprint on this game in the early going well because that really makes a guy like california happen seeing the aggressiveness the way he was attacking the glass look at him right here good second effort he stays at the ball goes back up strong again says im gonna score man he scored right there hey you know you had the game you and jay had the game when they were blown out louisville by the wisconsin team and people said oh man 85 wasnt 48 lets play 37 played without jones i mean lets face it drones a big loss but they would still probably tend to beat wisconsin to prove that no fluke at all man with that win they had at michigan state last yesterday they are terrific and you and i were talking about this yesterday you know teams that are older you know given all the craziness and uncertainty and difficulties surrounding this season teams who were older and knew each other before the lockdown of the whole covenant situation figured to handle this better than teams that werent and wisconsin has five seniors in the starting lineup and a fifth year senior as their first guy generally off the bench they know exactly who they are yeah and they also average about 23 years in age they average about 23 years in age and thats a big plus and they really play well together they have potter twice was great yesterday against michigan state but theyre not good just because theyre old theyre good because theyre good too mean that the big ten is loaded right in wisconsins really good on any given day they can beat anybody last night minnesota beats iowa uh richard patinos clubs eight and one now to get marcus carl as my player at a knight square 30 and did a great job in some big threes they won that game in overtime over really an outstanding iowa basketball team youre making people up in toronto happy dick talking about marcus carr yeah i know hes a toronto kid i hey its christmas man i want to bring some cheer to you mr schuman hey thats two guys that seem to save marvel by the way but not for long it doesnt take long threepoint lead for kentucky as both teams get a little bit sloppy right now Applause you know dan kentuckys done a better job in terms of handling the basketball i think hes got to make john feel a lot better theres only one thing thats gonna make him feel better is leaving here with another win which should be eight out of nine kentucky over louisville the last nine yeah we talked about the good second half against notre dame the good first half against carolina we did mention they were right there with kansas with three minutes left in the game and only lost by three to kansas but at the end of the day as you said they got to get some ws yeah we did that game and they were right about it nice interior pass there from jalen withers to quince lazinski for the bucket to make it a onepoint game slicing did a great job getting free right there for that job was too easy slicing actually starting three games when the cardinals were down to about eight scholarship players coming off the bench here again this afternoon british defensive really making a struggle here by too much oneonone its been a problem thats always a problem with young kids coming out of the high school ranks understanding what a quality shot is and what did john calipari say it was yesterday dick that these guys have to work harder to get their teammate open set a screen make a cut do something to help one of your teammates instead of just going one on one well you know cal said youre going to learn how to create space for your teammate yeah thats a little part of the learning process but they do have talent three of their players are rated first round draft choices anytime youve got three players rated first round draft choices youve got to transfer seven foot who everybody raved about coming to school johnson with a three the assist to jones and louisville back on top and the one thing theyve got to really work hard on we plugged them at it with john yesterday as well they seem to be sparks there where they really play poorly in a spurt and allowed teams to go on a run against them they got to try to avoid that and we arent there but you can hear a little bit of noise again about 3 000 fans in attendance at the kfc yum center today for this game between kentucky and louisville nice work on the offensive glass and the putback for brandon boston jr he is the highest ranked of all the kentucky recruits to come in this year he was ranked seventh on the espn 100 coming into the season hes ranked number seven right now in terms of the nba draft and hes got to see a little bit more out of here how about carly jones think hes really getting things done right now well hes just a player thats got everything you talked about earlier dan his versatility rebound assist score just the quality perform has lived up to the reputation of making the move goal from bradford Applause Music mitch for three and down with a rebound is jones the cardinals looking to extend the lead on a bit of a run here slicing the kick great shot fake open look and way short on the three is jones to turn it back over to kentucky and take us to the next media timeout a twopoint lead for louisvilles they go back and forth at the yum center it started with david johnson banging down a three for louisville but then back to the other end the jackson drive and the boston putback its a twopoint game youve been putting back a few they might go out there and win this one the cougars really guarded the threepoint line thats where the game will be won dan dick back to you Music hi guys thank you happy holidays to you both look who it is dick the hall of famer danny crum is at the game today yeah danny crowd what a classy winner he was looking at 1980 and 86 he brought those two championships the doctors of duck mr griffin and company 86 never nervous perverse ellison dont mention his name to mr billis dont mention that name i promised jay i would not say that you played against purpose and they came up on a short end the dookies who had a great team that youre in a great year some of the early numbers kentucky just one for six from threepoint range they have cut down on the turnovers just three so far but notably just one assist on eight made field goals which is a very low ratio and again can they get each other open and get some easy look servicing it close and its back over to the cards you know start scoring inside last year 30 point games 25 against teams like notre dame and duke and right now i dont know he scored it in this game has he he has not you scoreless today over three from the floor third team all acc player a year ago about 13 points per game for wake he must think hes back in the acc this is the fourth consecutive acc opponent for kentucky and hes a great young guy everybody raves about him as a kid but he must be a little frustrated right there and chris mack cant be happy the cardinals five and one on the season as we mentioned in spite of all the injuries that theyve had the one losses you talked about dick was the lopsided loss against wisconsin but as you said theyve beaten western kentucky they beat seton hall they just picked up a road win at pitt and they go into conference play a week from today at boston college you know coach cables got a real tough time down there playing without the great champagne bigtime score and tony both guys are out of the lineup against louisville and louisville took advantage of the opportunity boston leans in off the back of the iron the tip by where wont go and then i think johnson tipped it into his own bucket yeah he really did johnson tipped that ball in guy nearest him gets credit for the Applause score and thatll tie it up at 21 and this three and down with a rebound it is kentucky ball not enough patience right there in that possession you got them a little too quick you mentioned about noahs sister kentucky a lot of its like oneonone play or off new offensive boards they got to learn how to pass and create opportunities for each other Applause sometimes this will happen dick you just try to tip it keep it in play and you accidentally tip it into your own basket Music Applause he created a leadership committee three players who he said wanted to take control of some of the things that he says are nonnegotiable about the culture of the program and he wouldnt say who they are but if you read between the lines he kind of hit it up a little bit then it would be yeah older players so guessing it could be mints it could be sar and a guy this is keon brooks is getting to play this year for the cats because of a leg injury tell you one thing people take for granted what john calipari has achieved what hes done in kentucky has been off the charts by the way hes the only coach to coach four number one overall selections rose wall anthony davis and carl anthony pass Applause a little better ball moving in here yeah ware gets a touch withers gambled where tries to get by him and he draws the foul foul lines really hurt exactly in some of the games the richmond game which you did thats his first team is out then kentucky pride chicken colonel whats up everybody happy holidays coming up on the jeep halftime report the big 10 had a full slate of games yesterday on christmas well get you caught up on those highlights also why jordan thinks iowa is a bit of a phony championship trust doesnt trust him uh in this game right now you got cards up too what do you see a bad kentucky offense something we expected but theyre fighting theyre competing on the backboard competing in the paint limiting turnovers giving that bad offense at least a chance to generate doing a good job handling carly jones as well dan dick back to you down jordan thank you yeah kentuckys out rebounding louisville theyve kept the turnovers down and the guy whos given them some good minutes off the bench and lance ware is at the free throw line for a couple now after the foul on jaylen withers of louisville yeah you know were certainly uh topping has given him some productivity off the bench thats been a plus for us and theyre not turning the ball over the freethrow line has hurt them in some of the games heard him in a richmond game big time richmond a terrific team walked into rupp arena got out there with a win it looks like richmond in st louis dick will be two of the heavyweights in a very good conference for atlantic 10 conference got some good teams a really good team minnesotas got a win over st louis as well im telling you that big ten and the big 12 theres no doubt in my mind those two conferences are heading shoulders right now over everyone else yes you see only has two teams rated tennessee as missouri Applause coming your way it begins this afternoon at 3 30 eastern time after us here on espn western kentucky taking on georgia state in the lending tree bowl itll be louisiana against texas san antonio on abc also at 3 30 eastern time and then later on tonight on espn the cure bowl undefeated coastal carolina taking on nine and one liberty jones thought about it the length of top it may have persuaded him to not take that shot and then he turned to be close today it is tough to win without guys that could make that perimeter shot it has become so important a lot of guys want to recruit these great athletes runners jumpers give me guys that make shots man thats the name of the game and basketball you got to make shots yeah and again kentucky one of the worst threepoint shooting teams in the country just 24 on the season from beyond the arc they are one of eight today louisville is four of 12 today so more than half of their points have come off the three ball well one or three usually 12 and what 1 and a half percent pretty good Applause david johnson with his third three of the game ball street up on top see right now theres not enough ball you got to move that basketball thats it thats a good pass right there and a good shot and a three ball for the assist to ask you ask youre really having a nice first half you know patience poised lit the points the three ps they were very patient there Applause will stay Applause i can see that here in lakewood ranch florida Applause wow kentucky a 32nd Applause yeah took over the game of the second half down at cameron to kentucky taking a 30second timeout here late in the first half again offense has been tough to come by for both teams louisville leading by two a chance for us to tell you about a great way to raise money dick for the v foundation yeah you know if you got my book right now you can autograph copy ill write anything you want in here you know we have stories here about kentucky louisville et cetera the last season i did it with the great dick hoops weiss howard schwab did a lot of research and its really a book that i love because its helping raise money for kids battling cancer every dollar dad as you know that i would make is going to pediatric cancer we have a nice check because all your beautiful people go for about 30 000 thats going to go out to the v foundation so i thank you so if you want a copy just go to dickbytowncom bigfightdowncom because theres nothing worse man and every day well i could simply tell you this i hope and pray none of you have to feel that bottom line is think about this 45 to 50 mothers and fathers every day hear four words no mom and dad ever wants to hear your child has cancer well we are all so grateful for all the work that you have done over the years to raise millions of dollars knocks down another three so hes made two in a row from beyond the arc and kentucky goes on top well thanks could make that three he screwed his body really well he did a great job by the way you dont have to go to good fight to Applause shooter in his time at creighton ray davis with a good look at the other end and ask you down with a rebound in traffic for the wildcats davis will good young freshman player his brothers gonna be going to school theres dad his dad coaches at a high school level in indianapolis ask you who reclassified from the class of 2021 to start college this year as an offensive foul hes called on brandon boston jr and dick hes just been unable to get anything going here in the first half a real instructor him such a bigtime high school player he made the transition went over to play sierra canyon played there played with the great zaire williams whos at stanford was a tremendous talent and they had you know lebron jamess son point wades son and he went there and had a great high school year yeah our guy paul being cardi had him written way up there jalen withers stepping in to take the charge and now the cardinals can hold for the final shot of a low scoring first half if the cardinals could buy time and get some wins im going to tell you charles middletons going to help this club big time especially offensively johnson inside withers with a bucket Music as the first half comes to a close at the kfc yum center Music masterpiece by either team to say the least but theyre both working hard they both want the win badly the cardinals did make five threes in the first half and thats the biggest reason why theyre holding on to a slender onepoint lead time now for the jeep halftime report along with jordan cornett heres dallin cotton thank you dan this is the g path time report welcome into our studios here in bristol thats jordan cornette im dylan cuff uh the cats have not been 15 since the coolidge administration 192627 that is a long time ago theyre battling right now theyre down one to their rival the cards what have you liked about the cats performance today the cats know who they are theyre not a good offensive team so youve got to lean into what your strengths are and with this kentucky team theyve got length theyve got athletes so what theyre doing is theyre fighting on the inside theyre winning the backboard theyre defending in the paint its energy youre seeing life from a oneandfive team you want to know why dallin its a rivalry game theyre also doing the part to not be overexposed by the talented cardinals backcourt everything going right as right as it could for a team as defunct offensively as the cats are yeah theyre getting contributions beverly wares been playing well toppings been playing well getting them extra baskets extra minutes but i would say defensively theyve been really good in this game in terms of managing carly jones thats a bad pass by the grad senior right here this is what a few times he got in the lane and turned it over theyve changed up defense i thought coach cow has coached a really good game they threw in some 23 zone right off the jump that got them on their heels thats you never see from him right there a great ball fake wide open air ball three theyve gone back to a man you saw some zone theyve kept him on his heels when he cant get and do his thing that really affects their team right now hes only one assist two turnovers five turnovers for kentucky yeah a team that gives that thing away 17 times in a game if your offense is bad its truly exposed when youre turning the ball over at that clip kentucky taking care of the ball allowing what is a bad offense thats shooting 36 percent from the field its giving it a chance in this game thats been huge one point game at the break well get more thoughts on that game coming up a little later lets talk about houston now theres six in the nation taking on ucf ucf coming up that winning at florida state last week jordan that was a top 20 team houstons top ten yeah and its a ucf team thats balanced that can really shoot it theyre a team that needs to be better on the inside a cougars team that generates second chance opportunities can the cougars uh get going on that front brandon mayhem with a nice cut and finish darren greene jr i mean when things are going like this jc its pretty good i mean the bank shot those are the kind of shots i used to get going and then act like thats what i meant to do now i will say houston started to turn this game around theyve got battle back the other way caleb mills nice and one he gets that to go they are down one with just under four minutes to go down in central florida when we come back here there was a full slate of games on christmas yesterday from the big ten in case you missed anything you missed some good ones well get to the highlights who jordan thinks is the favorite to win that championship this halftime report is presented by jeep theres only one here and marcus carr ended up with 30 on the day eight dimes but this one was the big one its big time but its a confident gopher squad that knows they can score against iowa because iowan doesnt guard iowa is very fun to watch offensively and i do want to give a hat tip to marcus carr and brandon johnson big time nights for them but iowa its great that luca garza is a great player and its cool that you can score 90 but you cant give up 102 you cant give up 17 threes you got to be better defending in transition protecting the rim and guarding the threepoint line or as fun as it is to watch luca get buckets it doesnt matter and you cant be taken serious as a title contender with that kind of defense brandon johnson you saw him make three threes just in overtime alone that was a big win for them he had 26 on the day going on to wisconsin at michigan state coach izzo and coach guard talking pregame demetric trice they were down nine jordan and trice just went bananas you know when youre around one of those couples and theyve been together for a long time they finish each others sentences and youre like wow thats what i want to be thats wisconsin basketball these guys are old theyre older than the chicago bulls starting five six guys are seniors in that first six four of them are fifth year seniors you take out your starting point guard you bring in a fifth year backup in tyler anderson thats the kind of wealth of experience the badgers have this was a fun game to watch on both sides michigan state is going to be okay but wisconsin along with gonzaga i confidently say they have the final four look they are two very different teams wisconsin and gonzaga but youre absolutely right they both could find themselves in the final four whoever that may be and whatever that may be played until then devon asks you having a big day seven points right now as the cats draw the cards by one hes got to put some points on the board hes too talented theyre going to find him but hes got to be aggressive and make move without the ball hes got to get absolutely free hes got to get free and hes got to call for the rock and score they need that big guy to start contributing cant always say well the freshman a freshman the freshman hes a veteran hes a veteran hes got the points in the book Applause underway in the second half sarr played 12 minutes in the first half for the cats 0 for 3 did not have a rebound nice performances for kentucky in the first half from jacob toppin and devin askew and leading all scorers was david johnson of louisville who made three threes hes got 10 points the only player in double figures as we go to the second half well kentucky got some help walked that bench from top and its also weird they came and they were very productive jackson was very quiet instead he played for kentucky he started off this year he was getting rave reviews from everyone but hes got to strike back to that level hes a great athlete elite athlete yeah he didnt score either in the first half so tsar and jackson neither one of them with a point in the first half for kentucky theyre starting four and five men and theyre only down one so thats a plus sign boston with a long two wont stay down the rebound ripped down to by jaylen withers of louisville in addition to johnson with 10 carly jones seven points and four rebounds nobody else had more than three again a low scoring game between these two williamson with a runner rejected by jackson thats what he does best and he did ask you to jackson well he deserved to get it back thats jackson thats what he was doing earlier this year great block shot hes a tremendous shot blocker and then he ran the lane in transition they got a back door i mean hes done some good things here this afternoon and now johnson turns it over so kentuckys defense coming out flying here in the second half and theyre turning it into offense at the other end one thing great job defensively i know thats gonna be a little upsetting to chris mack he told us that johnsons been around hes cant turn the ball look at that block great block under control give it back give and go and up we go up and away miss isaiah jackson baby Applause and then it was jackson starting it again so in the second half already dick jacksons had a block a dunk a steal and an assist on the bucket by boston whos now with the line and completes the threepoint play now they got to get czar to join him and if he joins him in jackson on the interior that would be a big plus remember this game is absolutely a must for kentucky they got to play their hearts out jimmy dice was telling me during timeout after the halftime something in texas pouring their hearts out this game is so big for kentucky psychologically emotionally theyre all a big blue nation theyre the most passionate fans this guy pours his heart out i mean if they played half as hard all the players and put their heart and soul in like calipari and his staff does they would win those close games theyve been losing isaiah jackson with another block his second already here in the second half and yes kentucky one in five for the first time in almost a century heading into conference play after this game they will step out one more time to the end of january in the sec big 12 challenge as they will take on texas a really talented team this year so thatll be a very challenging game for kentucky but yeah i think youre right nobody nobody in big blue nations looking for a moral victory today they want to walk out of louisville with a w absolutely you know you mentioned texas quick round had a great game against oklahoma state in the big win certainly shock has got a team of veteran team and theyre going to be tough on kentuckys number 10 vadio man says second team second got a push going against kentucky as you look at the nonconference schedule for the wildcats an easy win in their first one of the game over moorhead state but then the five consecutive losses granted two of them close but all losses nonetheless the game today against the cardinals and then the one we just talked about against texas came back from 24 and down against notre dame travel is the call on samuel williamson louisville cannot get untracked here in the opening minutes of the second half yeah really sloppy play right there chris you did a great job at xavier by the way xaviers doing a tremendous job right now coach steele i think theyre late one they lost a heartbreaker to creighton get paul scruggs playing really great for xavier the musketeers excellent program they like to pack it in louisville theyre not going to pressure you theyre going to pack it in make it tough for you to drive oh thats a sloppy turnover no reason for that turnover gives it right to davis and dre davis the freshman out of indianapolis will take it the rest of the way his brothers thats the prospect and he committed to louisville yep tay davis who will be part of the class of 2022 and now louisvilles stepping up again at the defensive end lob over the top jackson read it well and comes up with the steal and at the other end the lane will go for mints so thats three times already this half where kentucky has turned defense into offense yeah their defense is slightly giving them an offensive lift jones keeps the dribble alive slicing in the corner for free squared his body his shoulders for the basket shot in control zlatzenski didnt get a whole lot of minutes last year taking advantage of some playing time here Music and weve got a timeout on the floor just the third three in eighteen attempts on the season for quince lazinski but its a big one as it brings louisville back within one Music right now you can get a free

birthday today not only is it the holidays its also bart foxs birthday today so happy birthday to barton i know dick you are always in the holiday spirit well let me just say this you know you talk about john calipari we know hes a great coach hes in a hall of fame but hes also a guy that really cares about the community he does an amazing job teaching his players values that are important for example at christmas he raises a lot of gifts and he goes gets gives him all the businesses in town and then he has his players pass them out the people in need i think its great that this year they couldnt do it go hand in hand because of cloven 19 but the people came down and picked up gifts down there where they had him available i think thats great yesterday he had seven players on his house uh players had their parents here he let them be with their parents but those that did not he brought him to his house with his beautiful wife and family and really make sure they have a nice christmas time thats in second team third well this year maybe more than any other uh any gesture no matter how small could mean so much to people over the holidays as john calipari has a little talk with jackson about that post move for an offensive foul jacksons done some great things early in the second half but turned it over on the charge right there Applause hes been very athletic and we know that about it hes an elite athlete speed quickness jumping ability and now an illegal screen going against louisville to turn it right back over hes a trainer thats his second team called for the foul his second you know chris mayer cannot be happy when he sees it on the floor right now Music john calipari 11 and two against louisville as the kentucky head coach and cats have won three in a row overall but some of the last eight times against uh louisville this match seven should have had the last shoot up three with about a minute to go and get away from us in this series im speaking of between kentucky and louisville a wildcat turnover now now the cardinals back looking for the lead scooped up no good by jones and a battle between a trainer and boston and itll be a held ball you know you mentioned training his father dan jason osborne he played two years at louisville was a mcdonalds Music allamerican how would i describe overpaying on a used car its humiliating its expensive if you dont see me youre not seeing the most accurate price shop at carfax you wont have to overpay on a used car again shop millions of great deals at the allnew carfaxcom and a reminder weve got an american conference college basketball doubleheader coming your way tuesday night on espn2 and on the app itll be south florida taking on memphis at seven and then houston the number six ranked team in the nation at tulsa the golden hurricane have won three in a row that is nine oclock eastern on espn2 kelvin sampsons done a great job with that houston program they keep grimes transferred out of kansas has been big for them theyre in a battle right now though for the last time i looked but south florida was an improved team central florida im sorry central florida who had a big win over johnny dawkins kids had a big win over florida state gave them their first loss jj trainer thats his third team jj trainer of louisville and dick thats his third he becomes the first player on either side to pick up his third foul today you know hes being off the bench for that he had some good moments get seated all made a big basket late again they won that by one over kevin willard used to be an assistant to rick pitino there hes a freshman from bardstown kentucky twotime allstate in high school thats rebounded by dre davis we havent said samuel williamsons name a lot coming off a doubledouble against pitt and had a great first game of the season against evansville he is on the bench right now hes only got two points today hes a guy that from a louisville perspective youd like to see in their 30plus minutes really putting up some big numbers for mcdonalds allamerican yeah williamson and also johnson theyre two guys that have been around the block who certainly are guys that can really help them for kentucky number two chris mack was telling us how the sophomores are the veterans on this team i mean they had so many players from last year jordan warra fresh kimball darius perry stephen enoch dwayne sutton and your guy ryan mcmahon all of those guys are gone its not quite as brand new of a team as kentucky is but its pretty close oh yeah it really is especially nobody got those injuries happened to charlie malik going down williams hes been six eleven player defensive player bryan mcmahon gave him about threepoint shooter man he was lethal when he would get on fire there is not one player in this game today who scored a point in this game last year between louisville and kentucky well you know kentucky its a way of life they simply reload every year personnel wise itll at the same shooting three players charted to be nba first rounds half choices kids have drafted a potential athleticism not out what they achieve and accomplish because you look at the whats happening with questioning and certainly with the uh Applause clark with a pass fake trying to get inside soft off the window but it wont go jackson runs it down nice pass for johnson Applause draft choices i havent played like that when i think of some of the greats that kentuckys had over the years and its unbelievable so i would have to be davis in fact way to give me dad ill give you six guys my super six mentally kentucky guys that i like during the caliber era calipari era ill tell you this anthony davis john wall michael kid gilchrist demarcus cousins carl anthony pounds and i love the little guy when he played kyla euless i mean those are my six favorite i mean i dont even have booker in there yet because booker did not when you played a conductor he was coming off the bench how about david johnson with a strong drive so jackson picks up his third foul goes to the bench for the cats and then johnson with a layup to put louisville back on top well hes a guy that chris max has got to give his productivity hes got to be more consistent as a player chris was the ideal hire by the way when they had the situation looking for a coach louisville he was the perfect guy Applause ask you cant get by johnson topping a little bit strong on the jumper where on the offensive glass but cant finish it and withers wraps it up for louisville dont think about weird though very physical and very aggressive loofah by the ways won 12 in a row at home willing number 13 jones gets to the rim back to back layups for the gardens see this is what i talked about earlier kentucky goes through moments where they break down nobody rotated over nobody cut off the driving lane and carly went right to the goal left there for a laugh and certainly thats how to bring a smile to the face against the back it has been the guards here in the last minute or so first david johnson the high scorer in the game with a righthanded layup and then a car leaked jones who can hurt you so many different ways with the lefthanded lane to extend the lead to three you know the most dangerous thing on the floor dan is the basketball and players from the help side got to come over and close off those driving angles not just stand there and watch as the guy goes in you know he beats one guy hes fine but when you beat everybody thats no no man in the half court defense how about that carly jones is from cincinnati dick and of course chris mack was the coach and savior and when karlie was a kid he went to chris max basketball camps with him was there so mac may not have remembered harley the kid but barley remembered chris well its one thing it doesnt hurt to have that kind of advantage in recruiting but its time to recruit again i think theres a familiarity one thing you dont have to worry about when you talk about certainly john calipari though is recruited i mean i still got blue chip kids coming in next year the question is now i say you cant just win with the one and done unless theyre anthony davis zion williamson and their onceinageneration player youre going to have some veteran players who contribute and what really has disappointed me is seeing the performance thus far this year at olivier czar because i was expecting greatness from him i thought he was the final piece that they needed with their package after recruiting that great class mintz gets inside and draws the foul kentuckys scoreless drought is four minutes and 47 seconds right now but it has a chance to end that as he goes to the freethrow line introducing taco gifter by taco bell a service that lets you gift to taco for any reason or no reason at all number two on jalen withers and amidst the grad transfer from creighton heading to the line now for kentucky hes a guy dick who should give them stability and maturity and experience at the point again put up some very nice numbers says where goes out and sar comes back into the game now for the cats yeah you wouldnt expect i agree with you czar and mins are veteran players theyve played in intense competitive basketball ive been playing at creighton you look at mints czar over at wake forest as you said earlier baby second team all acc team i mean were not seeing that out of them we could say kids the kid the problem kentucky is they need their freshmen to be the stars look at those numbers i mean he had zero field goals against uh north carolina 19 minutes got him foul trouble so hes gone better than three halves of basketball now without making a field goal thats hard to believe when you watch the play last year where with a block and then williamson trying to make something happen gets called for the foul day one thing rear and topic are earning some playing time jackson got back to the second team kentucky basketball Applause ill tell you one thing you can look at the records its still kentucky and louisville when i hear that i get goosebumps are you kidding me thinking about all the greats that have worn those uniforms all the winning thats gone on two very proud elite programs yeah this year is obviously different there are only 3 000 people in the building and you and i are in our homes were not even at the arena but in a noncoveted year dick and youve done this game you and i have done this game together to walk into the kfc yum center or the walk into ruck the day Music so what should we do today Music Applause Music uh mom can we go to the beach should we just go see a movie yes im always up for a good movie go rogue in the allnew fiercely reimagined nissan rogue when it comes to home gate you got to have certain essentials as long as i got my family friends tostitos my famous nachos yeah were good and dont forget to put a little bend in your knees right now were just finding happiness in in the small things just being with the fellas watching the game you know i think its a very special moment you know we dont get to play but we get to watch it second weekend team in the ncaa tournament their guards can really go back to dan and dick in louisville all right guys thank you so while we were away the officials went to the monitor and looked at that last foul on olivier sar and a flagrant one has been assessed as we take another look hes trying to post up on trainer and got the right elbow right up in the jaw of withers rather now trainer of withers and sar called for the flagrant one well thats a good call right there theres no doubt about it i think just a bunch of frustration building up because olivier is a great young guy everybody raves about it you can talk about any coaches danny manning right down the line that had him hes just frustrated i mean think about it you said it dan earlier three halves now without a field goal north carolina in this game its its its hard to believe that its hard to believe it ill tell you that because hes too talented too skilled theyve got to be able to pull more down to the post Music introducing taco gifter by taco bell a service that lets you gift to taco for any reason or no reason at all just pick a gift personalize it with a note pay and send away only on taco bellcom or in the taco bell app 11 47 to go in the second half from the kfc yum center dan shulman dick vitale kentucky in louisville a flagrant one on olivier saw and again a limited number of fans about 15 capacity at the um center this afternoon and itll be withers to the line for a couple of free throws after that flagrant one on saw for the cardinals theres a redshirt freshman out of charlotte and uh the cousin of a great louisville defensive back and now an all probe with the green bay packers jair alexander withers is a cousin of his well it wasnt his dad his dad was a bigtime scorer in charlotte i mean three years dominating when he played out there so he comes to some good good genes hey the last time you know think about this kentucky seventh straight year last year with 25 wins will they get the eighth thats going to be tough theyve had 26 straight 21 seasons i mean john has done an amazing job there he lost four players average double figures last year quickly richards maxie uh higgins lost montgomery and sistine as well so he just reloads as always and a block is called there if its sar its his third and you made the point that the sec right now only has two ranked teams right tennessee and missouri the tigers off to a great start this year so there arent that many challenge yeah there are good wins out there but there arent that many opportunities for kentucky to pick up really noteworthy wins the rest of the town well thats why we said the game like this game and a nonconference game with texas becomes big to them because their goal is ncaa march madness theyre not playing to get in the nit thats their goal issue thats why this game is a must they gotta walk out here psychologically with a win a loss here six straight really i think is devastating you know great execution right there very efficient chris max club they get the inside layup nobody challenges them by the shot simple thunk i always thought ill tell kentucky has a problem that they go through spurts where theyre so deficient shot selection and deficient or defensible boston misses the three he is not shooting it well at all from the outside here in his freshman season nickelberry at the other end cant get it to go and a foul called on williamson thatll be his third you know anything nickelberry should have shot that job i thought hes a little more patient right now you got about a little bit of ropes right here look at the dump one nobody rotates over the gotta go to the basketball people help side you gotta go to the basketball nickelberry gave them a little lift here should have been a little bit more patient yeah a little more poised with teaming maybe led to points and in the first half dick neither team got close to the bonus there were hardly any free throws shot now already this half louisville has committed seven kentuckys committed six and were not even halfway through the second half so the free throw line is going to be important down the stretch well john tolach yes the nfl christmas day were on the phone talking with john calipari and he said weve got the closed games out we cant just play people close theres no moral victory here you got to leave with a w and loser their minds they feel they got to leave with a w yeah so lets see who wants it more in last 10 minutes one of two a gamehigh 13 david johnson leading louisville with 12 harley jones nine points four rebounds as he brings him into the front court gets it to go over the length of kentucky and hes into double figures now you know what i like about his game he understands what a good shot is very mature as a player i mean thats a high percentage shot hes under control as he goes in the lane hes not flying wild i mean right now youve got two guys rated to be lottery selections basically in boston and clark and you look at their numbers theres nowhere near where people would anticipate and expect and them uh in fairness playing with a bit of a tender angle he rolled it a couple of weeks ago has not been 100 did not start today has played but has not scored today now youre right about that in fairness to the kid he did have an ankle injury so theyre without a full strength clark theyre without cameron fletcher suspended from the team at least for the moment you can see clark is on the floor right now and louisville shorthanded as well neither team is complete right now and you can see that both are kind of struggling to find their way at the moment well im going to tell you what if louisville gets back malik williams at the end of january 611 and they get charles midland because im telling you i had him in that game against gonzaga and midland was a bigtime player williams by the way is the captain of the team two years in a row hes a leader and defensive player closes up the lane for you midland is a scorer i had him with san francisco against gonzaga their championship but bob was choosing and we were impressed i dont remember exactly the totals but i guarantee he was about 20 in that game and a tough loss to the zags who by the way today plays virginia talking about contrast to the styles yeah youre not kidding a good look by jones but dre davis cant knock down the three and down with a rebound jacob topham who gave the cats some good winners in the first half 66 rebounds now for topping as he gets a touch of the post got a mismatch kicks it out Applause kentucky still cannot buy one from beyond the arc theyre now 3 for 13 transition Applause stop the ball stop the ball its the first wall defensively in transition cant go up and down the floor like that like a fast brake drill and practice thats a nono man its getting dangerous time right now for kentucky williamson from johnson the fourth assist of the afternoon for david johnson who do they need a bucket right here tophams gonna try to give it to him and he will id say one thing he has really been effective today hes a kid that they were thinking about red shirting this year but they decided they needed him plus he gets that year eligibility because everybody gets a year this year topping off the bench with eight points and six rebounds for kentucky Music number 55 18 days they didnt have a game until they had to go play wisconsin and play in wisconsin the veteran team averaged about 23 years of age but theyre good forget about the age they just know how to play potter and try again yeah interesting to see in the acc this year i think were still learning about a lot of these teams how good they are what will louisville be what will syracuse be you know teams like nc state miami can they jump up from the middle of the league and get up into the top part of the league well find out a lot more as conference play gets going here in the next several days you know notre dame last year was over 500 in the acc theyre 11 and 10 if you try to win in the acc tournament theyre getting ready to play the pandemic hit virginia and you would expect them to be a lot better than what theyve played just for a veteran team now theyve got the key words in their lineup i didnt mind british clubs capable of getting some quality wins top it again turn around jumper got it are you serious they said this gets a year and two away its hes contributing right now hes a little mini version right now his brother obi i dont mean hes over homie but the bottom line is hes got great athleticism and he cant teach that but hes always here yep theres the zone very active two three he said hed play some zone davis with a good look from the corner misses the three offensive rebound johnson what a great play by david johnson you expect veteran players to step up what did chris mack tell us yesterday dan he said what i said to him i got a feeling even he sees himself what did he say he said i welcome dissolve and he is getting a big time performance from johnson look at how excited the bench was the sophomores got 16 points seven rebounds and four assists already in this game but you expect that from him their strength is going to be the perimeter gang right now carly jones and johnson johnson had that breakout game last year mention his name to mike what he did down here at duke was unbelievable i think it was his first start wasnt it he didnt think it was and he went for 19 and seven assists in that game down at cameron it is a seven point lead for the cardinals with eight minutes left in regulation a couple breakdowns defensively by kentucky now you get a little scared here about shots option now you gotta have a killer the veteran take over with the team to understand what a good shot is Music were so embarrassed we overpaid for this year clemson and ohio state in the sugar bowl owners of course will play for the national championship monday january the 11th i know one thing dad i know one thing my daughter daves gonna win and that is the fight song change wake up the end goes Applause you know were on the air now dick right you know people can hear you to isaiah jackson to the bench with four for kentucky ask you for the floater wont go and we got to foul Applause as theyre getting after it rebounding i think its against louisville ask you to do a good shot there hes really to me hes improving you know they keep saying that you know he reclassified what people fail to say thats his normal class because as an eighth grader he was kept for the extra year to get a little bit more maturity so really when they said reclassified you know he did but in essence that really was the class that he would have been part of top and misses the front end of the one and one and itll be louisville thats been a problem in close games for kentucky the freethrow line against caroline and also against richmond you can see the frustration in johns face the guys a winner man the guy is a competitor a fierce winner in the second half dick kentucky is five for 14 they havent made a three and theyve turned it over six times they turned it over five times in the first half six times already here in the second half now a louisville turnover and the third opportunity will finally go down for the cats a much needed bucket that was absolutely needed Applause their defense has really helped them more offensively in this game i mean their offense has been really a struggle city but their defense has led to some good transition layups yeah boston with a bucket hes now got seven and offense has been the bigger problem for kentucky so far this young season inside seven minutes to go jones nearly turned it over and he did you dont expect that out of the veteran you know when you turn the ball over you dont chew well thats a formula for failure top end for the miss louisville ball there one thing those three thousand fans are getting loud down there david schuman yeah can you hear him in toronto i can hear him a little bit up here in toronto oh johnson stumbling lost his balance loose ball to slozinski and a fresh possession now for the cardinals coming up with the 50 50 more and that always is a difference maker in a close game Applause having a guy like jones should be a big edge for kentucky coming down this stretch gets inside and lays it in again jones and johnson the backboard for the cardinals have controlled the second half of this game oh we talked about the top of the show how that back court could be special and theyre going to get better and better as theyre more familiar with each other those two guards have combined for 30 of louisvilles 52 points im telling you midland and malik williams with this team this team can be a heavyweight team i agree with you theyre one of these teams we could look up in february and say boy did they get good theyre theyre just gonna get healthier and healthier over the course of the year mints for three to bring them back within four has been a real plus here and you expect that from him now he could have his other buddy zarya to start to contribute Applause Music sitting in that zone now and jones seeking out the contact no basket fouled before the show well kentuckys number two thats his first when he wants to get inside dick he just carves out a path and finds a way to do it yeah he really does former player creighton boy they got a good basketball team had a real tough win over xavier former team of chris matt xavier 81 poor scruggs outstanding coach steele doing a great job with the musketeers Applause jones at the line for the Applause see i cardinals its a big plus to having to get the winning time the last five minutes to have a veteran player with the stability the maturity of a guy like carly jones youre not winning big in college basketball without great point guard play and kentucky over the years has had that with john walls with teagues you think about the aaron foxes the list goes on and on a great point guards have had bledsoe i mean where does it end and they think so much of them in the louisville program even though he is new to louisville yes hes a veteran guy a grad transfer but hes new to louisville but he is one of the cocaptains on the team thats the kind of impact that he has had on a lot of the newcomers ill tell you one thing kenny klein and eric lindsey do a great job cant thank them enough for all the material they have given us and preparing especially not being at the arena eric and kenny klein kenny yeah they are so underpaid ive said this from day one the sids work so hard the hours they put in they should get raises man they send us the game notes they answer whatever questions we have they set up the zoom calls with the coaches they text us information during the games if anybodys got a new season or career high do a tremendous job free throw line missed the first one youre down six less than five you gotta convert one of two for saar and its a fivepoint game with less than five minutes to go a little pressure here on the ball right now gets out of it and the finish at the other end Music Applause hes doing all he can keeping the catch right there well on kentuckys number on manchesters third tenth team foul that took the cardinals now got a gamehigh 19 points but another foul this one on mins its his third and jones is back at the freethrow line for louisville 23 hes missed the versatility rebounds assists scores scores under drive scores the open three just a total player and hes so team oriented everything he does within the team concept doesnt take a lot of wild bad shots big south play over the year last year stepping up to the acc and putting up big numbers for the cardinals one of two there and the lead is five each possession gets bigger and bigger as the clock winds down for kentucky who needs this win badly boston steps in it wont go battling for the rebound and a foul he did a great job right there boston coming up with the offensive rebound he showed his athleticism right there with that up and under that he tried rated canyon high school played with a great player there zaire williams was a star out at stanford weve been a quiet afternoon though for boston wouldnt you say dick seven points six rebounds and pretty quietly putting up uh those numbers they need more from that and he is certainly capable of much more than that and clark is much more capable like you said though dan the ankle we dont know how you know how much that really hurts the kid right now in terms of his mobility that one thing john calipari and his staff worked so hard but guys you know every staff i guess we could say about it all but they were the pressure cooker i mean lets say kentucky you dont win in kentucky its like really such a sad sad time and people really take it hard big blue nation fans care really care and such pride those jungles state they have lost five in a row since all the power conference teams and theyre down by three inside four minutes to go in louisville not going to get easier either go on a road they play a week from now to mississippi state Applause timeout is upon us its going right down into the closing minutes kentucky in desperate need of a win of a trailing louisville at the yum center Music 10 jc northwestern simply better defensively this year than they were a season ago but theyve got to fight on the backboard or theyre not going to get it done today 34 all there in evanston down in ucf right now houston and the golden knights battling right now up three the number six team in the nation well keep you updated as that comes final dan dick back to you guys louisville all right guys thank you 3 44 to go and to use a cliche it looks like dick its going right down to the wire with the kfc yum center the one in five wildcats the five and one cardinals both trying to here have a win the day after christmas and enjoy the holidays a little bit more ill tell you one thing darling jordan and seth working in that studio man working hard ill tell you one thing johnny dawkins club ucf they just talked about the game with houston they gave florida state their first al guys their first now will they do it and give mr samson his first down been some good games you know i mean you know not every game has been played obviously and its theres been some turbulence so far this season but there has been a lot of good basketball a lot of really fun games that have gone down to the wire in the first few weeks of the season yeah cleveland 19th cause of nightmare obviously for some but we still at least got some good basketball oh good offensive rebound isaiah jackson following up his own miss and slamming it home to make it a onepoint game well he showed that the elite athletes athleticism he possesses hes a great high riser he showed earlier this year hes getting rave rave reviews and then he went through a little slide and now hes back again because hes been very productive here this afternoon this game is big these three minutes are so big to john calipari and his basketball team theyre victims oh mr jones mr jones is in the house danny yes mr jones a little basketball he wants to play some hoots car league jones banking at home with a shot clock running down to make it a threepoint lead well he is under control at all times isnt he boston no he Applause line comes big will they make much free throws watch him i say it here goes isaiah hes a high rise a baby up up and mr jones says i just want to spew jay off the glass you know hes something hes not the biggest guy in the world hes not the fastest guy in the world but he gets where he wants to get carly jones looks like we got ourselves ones gonna come right down to the buzzer oh i thought you were going may lock smash around me there i was feeling it yeah youre a little bit like smash it oh yeah theres a lot of people in kentucky i can guarantee you right now chewing that male locks and killing it they need a w this would be the best christmas present that mr calibre can get if he can get a win here but mr mack says for me itd be my best as well as we set off the top of the show throw out the records one of the best rivalries in college basketball and again especially in the first half not a masterpiece offensively but it is close it is important and its going into the last couple of minutes in a onepoint game its very intense theres no doubt about it oh jones doesnt get it offensive rebound withers a shot clock violation is the call and its going to go back over to kentucky very surprised there with a kid like jones ended up taking a bad shot he left his feet here we go can the cats take the lead making sure they get a good shot hes vital shot selection when you get to this time and again is so important jackson no loose ball kentucky ball since its in the last two minutes theyre gonna go have a look at this one there yeah we cant tell from where were at but the bottom line youre in canada Applause that should be louisville ball right thats awesome looks like minson with his left hand yeah i like to see them with one eye from here in lakeman ranch florida basketball wow theres mints reaching for the ball and sure looks like he was the last one he touched it right there and i dont i think he was the last one yeah i dont see anybody else i think its an easy call Applause well just we got what we expected the game to go to the white was not smooth was not efficient wasnt the kind of basketball that these schools over the years normally play but its certainly intense and competitive chris back trying to go six and one john caliber trying to eliminate goal one and six one in five with the worst start for the wildcats since 19 26 27 all the losses to power conference teams but still but both of these teams really hunting a win here today louisville ball with just over a minute and a half to go and a onepoint lead patience really important understanding the right people to shoot trey davis feeds it inside and a travel is the call on withers it goes back over to kentucky yeah he lifted his pivot foot theres no doubt about it it was pretty good execution right there looked like they were in position to get a layup well drop down so we got our finished games weve been close they were close with kansas could not finish a really close carolina till carolina broke it open late boston misses the jumper jackson with a rebound it wont stay down but hes fouled taiwanese hooked to the ball you see the way he bounces like a small big ball years ago a boss to bounce like raising he bounces off the floor like that Applause jackson with some big big moments in the second half at both ends of the floor for kentucky and now hes got a chance to give them the lead he is two for two from the line today he has really been effective boy around that basket i thought that block shot he had earlier in the game and led to a transition slam dunk was big free throw line dan thats been a problem the richmond game they really shot poorly in that close game with richmond american conference doubleheader tuesday night on espn2 and on the espn app south florida taking on to memphis and that will be houston and tulsa a couple of good games coming your way on tuesday night houston number six in the country will they be undefeated at that game in a battle right now pressure from kentucky in what is now a tie game i got nowhere to go blue over time its early this afternoon you know its going to be jones making the key decisions on this possession he hands it off to johnson johnson and all kinds of traffic good and davis is fouled no youre right Applause Music come on you got to know the landscape of the floor hes out of bounds absolutely Applause taken by john calipari they have come back here in the last couple of minutes and now theyve got the ball and a chance to take the lead in the final minute of regulation you know this back cannot be happy the way theyve been executing the last few possessions yeah dick this is last year stephen enoch with a big bucket at rupp arena in a game that went back and forth nick richards answers in overtime with a minute 20 to give kentucky the lead ashton hagins with a steal and a dunk and the wildcats beat the cardinals in an overtime in a game that chris mack said to us yesterday quote they should have won they should have been able to finish it and come up with the win they were in position it felt like dick to finish this one here today but a couple of turnovers have put kentucky in a pretty good spot right now yeah really been sloppy down the stretch here he said in that game last year up three with about a minute to go and let it get away to go to overtime but ill tell you this this would be a tough loss remember now kentucky has won seven of the last eight matchups for louisville Music hell sprint there hell sprint its been a long time since he felt the victory of walking over shaking the undercoachs hand and now the question is can they get some good ball movement can they get a good high percentage look davion mintz has been the man for them he is leading them with 19 points hes made four threes today boston and topping are also in double figures and topping is in the game right now jackson came back out again olivier sar basically a nonfactory today one point one rebound they have turned to other people sars on the bench they have turned to others for offense for the second game in a row and lets see what kind of a shot they get got to watch the offensive rebound as well thats where kentuckys hurt a little bit louisville on a miss shot inside ten to shoot itll be ask you for three short and it belongs to louisville and a foul is called on the loose ball a kentucky foul and if its jackson he is done not a smart player 70 feet from the basket 70 feet not a good play right there Music boy a low percentage shot jackson out of the game sending louisville to the free throw line that possession could not have gotten much worse for kentucky you know jackson sticking his hand in here right from the referees cant do this i didnt do anything hes not gonna hand in him its a shame because hes been such a the freshman dre davis goes to the line he has not shot free throws in this game today he is at 74 on the season hes got two coming son of a coach his dad coaches high school at the indianapolis area wow misses the first wasnt close kentucky does have one timeout remaining well see how john calipari plays it Applause got him blocked out here too one of two in a onepoint lead it is come back into the game for jackson who fouled out and john calipari no this is chris mack my mistake chris mack using the timeout here is next to last move over the one point lead kentucky ball with 189 seconds to go very similar in a way to the northern game and it was czar with a little baseline jump shot that hit the rim and bounced off and i remember some of the text messages to mike bray if youd have lost that game 24 point lead i said you got to download grotto and do some praying down on the notre dame campus but ill tell you this right now 18 seconds it would be amazing if czar who has not done a thing offensively the entire game comes up with the big play most of the scoring has come from davion mintz with a a game high 19 well see what john calipari is drawing up for his team which is in such a desperate need of a victory trying to snap his fivegame losing streak you think his stomach is churning a little bit you better believe its turning you dont want no moral victories no we played them close we played them tough they need wins this is kentucky basketball hes had a few wins in his lifetime its uh denny crum court at the kfc yum center as coach crum looks on national champs 1980 1986 chris bacon yeah some of his players on that floor right now like griffin and that never nervous purvis there are a few nervous people in that in this building right now arent there yeah shot selection is going to be big here now getting the quality shot and watch the missed shot the missed shot many times is so dangerous teams get a little relaxed and the offensive rebound becomes the difference i think theyre going to go a little full court pressure here trying to take some time off that clock is asking with the ball the knight for dandys fairly well here today sar with a handoff gets it back baseline jumper oh oh same shot basically had against notre dame that was infinite that was said they got a good shot still five seconds left they got what they wanted they got a good look and it bounced around and it rolled around and it rolled off the rim for sar wow you know what i take from this game right now i mean you still got five seconds to play i find it mindboggling that olivier zaw has gone two games and not scored a field goal seven footer who put big points on the board in a number of games last year for wake forest Applause theres a lot could happen with five seconds carla missed a free throw last time he was on a freethrow line if he makes this one i know even though kentuckys not a good threepoint shooting team i dont allow him to take the look at the three you found i fouled each team with a timeout remaining Music Applause so one last opportunity for kentucky if they could somehow knock down a three and tie the game but will louisville even give them that opportunity i know i would i know a lot of coaches against two different philosophies and i i respect those that go the other way so you just play tough defense but im telling you if im on that sideline i dont like the percentages of whatever seem to be in terms of shooting threes i know kentuckys not a good threepoint shooting team but something for a little magic a little luck once in a while why take that chance let him throw it in take a couple seconds off follow put him on the line for two blocked out yeah thats the big one right thats the important part you gotta do that didnt this happen last night in the uh the minnesota iowa game right marcus carr hit a three late to force overtime and he went on to score 30 as the governors came up with a big win over the hawkeyes that was a big win theyre eating one richard petitos kids they beat st louis as well hes having a great year of the travis ford a former kentucky leader mark pope doing a great job former kentucky player at byu hes not going to be cupcake city for gonzaga that lead anyway lets see what goes on here try the batch up top into inbound in fort kentucky nobody on the ball for louisville five seconds to go where he wants to give it to a shooter they get a decent look but it wont go down for brandon boston jr and kentuckys losing streak is now at six they fall to one and six on the season for the first time in over a century as louisville picks up a threepoint win at the kfc yum centers very frustrating right now for john calipari and big blue nation losing this close game they got a week walk they dont have the game with south carolina
