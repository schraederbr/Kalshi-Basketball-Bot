the Cal Bears are in the white they average 82 points a game at home 77 when theyre not at hos Bears control the tip DJ Campbell back in the starting lineup after missing some games with injury hes number three Mar Soko the big man number 12 and thats sasoko inside who got a bump no call and the shots off both teams are going to look to really impose their will 10 ft and in Cs first play trying to get the ball inside Rex Steiner shoot Johnson lall and potit the starting lineup for the hokes as they turn the ball over Tyler Johnson got a little too quick and the California Golden Bears will start sto yakovich Campbell blackshire Soko and the jack knife who does it all Reus petritis sto yakovich coach mentioned second in the conference and scoring over 20 a game had a nice game the other day against the Cavaliers sto yakovich his first shot is off sooko tried to get it petrius did and got fouled and Reus petrius will give the Bears who lead the conference and going to the free throw line made free throws at 18 a game theyll get a chance for two here coach well I think youre going to see a game where 10 feet and in its going to be very very physical these are two teams that um you know are really good rebounding teams theyre good blocking out teams but anything inside youre going to get hit theres going to be a collision so playing through contact when you have the basketball will be a key and then also staying out of foul trouble will be important for both teams p triers played two years at Air Force had a triple double last year plays as hard as anybody uh if youre looking for him you can look on the floor as much as you can upright cuz the guy will dive for any Music ball malal potit is the man handing it off to shoot whos off and Soko wrestles it back for cow really a good look staggered screens shoot getting a wide open shot right there theyre going to take that offensively DJ Campbells for a shot sooko kept it alive shoot on the ground and he is tied up jump ball Arrow will go to the Applause hok on that play right there Lal didnt get the rebound but everybody jumped up and started coming down and he would just be he just started his Ascent just keeps going and going he didnt Learn Basketball till he was 16 coach and I said when did you learn you could jump high he goes I I just start jumping and and I noticed everyone was below me makes sense Applause Rex Steiner runs it down leaves it for potit and then he tackles petritis and thatll be a foul on malal poti I think Pos a real key to this game his ability to get inside get angles around the bigs of Cal I think is really really important that one right there it didnt turn in his favor but you cant go just over the top hes going to have to get around 98 wins for Mike Young at Virginia Tech won 299 games in 17 years at Walford heck of a coach bringing his team out Applause here sto yakovich with eight on the clock sasoko keeps it Applause alive the extra pass to blackshire petritis offensive rebound hes fouled throws it up and a smart play by petrius extra shots multiple shots already a theme in this game I know Virginia Tech is going to focus on hitting box outs a little bit harder pursuing the basketball but if Cal continues get second shots its going to be a long night for Virginia Tech so far its try to two free throw the rest of the game nothing you mentioned it already hustle plays for petritis thats what he does bringing energy to start the game this Virginia Tech team coach been out here since Monday played Stanford on Wednesday saw alcatra on the off day will play today and finally head back to blackburg tomorrow the definition of an extended road trip Applause Johnson lobs it up for lall who got fouled and thats the one thing Virginia Tech can do coach is throw it high above everyone else to the walk absolutely and it was a you know its a a screen and roll there late in the shot clock but its moved the ball side to side breaks down the defense a lot of good off Ball action right there and then the screen and roll I mean thats a lethal uh situation when you have somebody that has a 49in vertical thats just you just throw it up to the rim somewhere up there and you know hes going to be able to get it Music Lala 78 free Music Applause throw knocks it down and here comes the sub and this is the Super Sub Ben Burnham who against Stanford on Wednesday coach went four five from three three made his first four threes in the game can absolutely shoot the heck out of it almost 50 shooter uh for Cal I think its going to be interesting to see how they defend him potentially some switches but Id be surprised if he gets any open Applause looks black Shir for three in and out Soko great offensive rebound boy mtys playing well but that pass over and back as it just went over the head of Andre sto yakovich I can already tell you at the timeout coming up in 52 seconds Virginia Tech is going to be talking about not only boxing out and hitting but pursuing and getting those Applause rebounds Burnham inside lost it got it Applause back Tyler Johnson defended well but the shot went in off the glass on sto yakovich big strong physical move really a good offensive rebounder right there though shows he has a lot of skill as well tied at four early coming up on the First Media timeout under 16 great block and here come the Hokies Rex Steiner lets the defender fly by and sto yakovich pins it but they call Goal tending on Cal great job gritting out in transition Andre stovich that was goaling but he is a a really good shot blocker as well so not surprising that hes going up to go challenge that one two great blocks in the one sequence Patrick westler the 7 foot sophomore had the one for the hokes hes in there now at number Applause five patrus tips in his own rebound no good Burnham comes down with it so does wesler Applause Music Applause burnam off the glass and Virginia tchs up 84 really a smart move by Virginia right there Burnham had a maybe a look over a smaller player but instead of settling for three drove to the basket and a little sixfooter size over a smaller player its going to be an easy shot for him eight nothing run by The hokes Who Trail 4 nothing to start this game Campbell Fades away no good Rodney Brown number four is checked in C said a little bit the first few possessions they did a great job scoring at The Rim getting a little tougher now Rex Steiner for three its 114 Applause Tech on the road thats a way to start it right there start out a little bit slow with some offensive boards but now offensively theyre heating up I do think Cal is a good passing team their assist numbers are not great but they are going to have to move the basketball and be unselfish this game because the Virginia Tech help defense is really really good Campbell threaded the needle that ball did everything but drop its not going Cs way right Music now Brown Jr with a turnover off his foot and we will get our first timeout but so far an 11 nothing run by Virginia Tech they are on a roll on the road theyre getting ready to go back to blackburg but maybe not before they hit some oh for 10 and field right now once they were able to secure the rebound which at the beginning they werent cuz there were four offensive rebounds for Cal but its just turned in then to uh offensive possessions 11 points in a row they attacked the rim well and then threepoint shot has to 11 pretty quick Cal Bears are 0 for 10 their only points are four Reus petritis free throws 0 for 10 from the field but coach there could be an answer theyve inserted their Super Sub number zero Jeremiah Wilkinson who averages double figures and gives them instant offense also 34 Lee Dort has come in for Marty Soko dorts are really uh a great Advantage between he and Soko just continue to have great siid and that as you mentioned Wilkinson ball in his hands right there not shy but that one off wler the Applause rebound right now a lot of tough Twos for Cal we need try and get the bra to get to the free throw line or get some clean looks from three Brown knocks one down 13 straight points for Virginia Applause Music Applause Tech St yakovich Off the Mark thats a clean look those are the ones you just have to knock down Applause Rex Steiner perfect boy playing with a lot of confidence see one shot go in little midrange right there Virginia Tech again playing loose playing free have an attitude on the road to can go being aggressive Joshua Ola Joseph hangs in cant get it to go Dort got the rebound got it taken away by Applause brown brown stops pulls up a rare Tech Miss ol of Joseph with a rebound I think every offensive rebound for Cal happened in the first two minutes since then I think Virginia Tech is securing all the rebounds and thats why theyre able to just do what they need to do on the offensive end sometimes getting long rebounds for Fast Break Applause points Wilkinson and the Freshman connects finally the drought is over after 4 minutes and 39 seconds Im dating myself at Old Vinnie Johnson from the uh Detroit Pistons back in the day instant offense they called him the microwave Wilkinson right now can heat it up quickly and thats exactly what they needed he leads the nation among freshman scoring at 124 wesler Jump hook counters right back 177 tech Virginia Tech is just comfortable right now they made a couple tough shots and now its getting a little bit more comfortable Cal needs to make a stand Applause defensively St yakovich the runner no good Dort got it blocked from behind by Tyler Johnson but they call a foul and Lee Dort will go to the free throw line for two good shot there another tough midrange according to his son his dad has never said you played a great game his mom always tells him he plays a great game but evidently the dad is into the tough love category that sounds about right that sounds about right great great family though Cals going to need to find a way to disrupt uh Virginia Tech do something to make them uncomfortable now we see a fullcourt press and uh trying to change the Rhythm a little bit but the Comfort level for Virginia Tech is way too high so maybe a little bit more ball pressure maybe doing something with some ball strings Christen Tucker 22 is in Spencer Mahoney 7even is Applause in and its just easy Hoops for Virginia Tech as poti gets an easy one yeah with those kind of angles hes not going to miss those really a a ball screen situation where poor at the end potit at the end easy layup Applause four on the clock Wilkinson got a good look but couldnt get it to go yeah they would take that look in terms of the situation right there got a really good Applause look Virginia Tech using ball screens now a little bit more and going back to potit I mean theyre going to have to find a way keep him off the free throw line but I I wouldnt be surprised if Virginia Tech continues to goes back to him potit is just a big strong guy coach I I think hes hard to defend well exactly and on the on the rule on this ball screen situation both Defenders end up going to the basketball you get there late if he gets around the rim and has any kind of angle you can count those every Applause time potit at a monster game against Miami in fact he had the gamewinning hoop they were down by two in the final seconds got a pass from Hammond delivered and made it finished with 22 made the free throw and they beat Miami by one and is the same play we just saw in the Highlight right there screen and roll sometimes is a coach dont over complicate it keep it simple screen and roll as a happens the defense has to try and make a play Virginia Tech they dont do this often but a one two a little soft press right now try and keep Cal out of rhythm go over the top to Applause Music Applause Mahoney well Rises for three cant get it the wall is fouled on a rebound Ill say this Techs playing great defense coach well they are in the ball screen situations Virginia Tech is showing hard theyre showing aggressively which allows for the big to roll to the basket and what happens is the lowest man on the weak side is committing all the way in so Cals either going to have to find the guy on the weak side and move the ball to the weak side but they continue to just try and attack with the dribbler or with the obvious first pass its not going to be there because Virginia Tech is over loading Applause Music that have made eight of their last nine field goals and nine of 10 and young drops in the tear drop well we know youre not going to be winning on the scoreboard when the other team has a advantage of 67 from the field Virginia Tech the timeout with 70 and Cs at 7 it should and now the free throw I mean the free throw line is the one thing thats keeping cing the game right now right but at some point theyre going to have to make some shots and get the double digit percentage wise sooko gets to go to the free throw line and shoot too but they get to the free throw line a lot one of the reasons is good passing I think a focus for Cal right now is is really the idea of its going to be hard to make a play by yourself and thinking about making a play for the others finding a teammate playing really unselfish basketball thats going to be their their Avenue to Applause success with Cal extending the pressure a little bit now theyre going zone for the first time I like it change the Rhythm change the Rhythm Cal also has really good length on the Baseline Applause po tips it out they get a fresh 20 you know they gave up a good looking shot right there but the reality is sometimes just playing against the zone changes thing theyve gone back to man for the end of this Applause Music possession good try this with the board Tucker is fouled by shoot I really like for Cal to go to that zone just to change it up it wasnt necessar a great possession of how they played it but just a different feel they end up giving a couple shots but they missed them and now the whole uh you know feel for Virginia Tech is hey were playing against the zone is a little bit harder we didnt score I I wouldnt be surprised if Cal stays in his Zone going back to the other end Music Applause Defender fell down but sto yakovich lost the ball Cal keeps it might have been one for Andre stovich just to to shoot It Wide Open right there decided to drive it into traffic Mark Matson of course played at Stanford hes a twotime AllAmerican there now in his second year at Cal went to four straight NCA tournaments as a player went to a final four he really does a nice job running a program you know believes in culture and developing players twotime NBA champ hes won everywhere hes Applause played that was an example of how high lall can Applause get young Off the Bench and on the mark the way I evaluate both ends right now is Comfort Virginia Tech is extremely comfortable on the offensive end and C is not everything is deflected everythings under durest theres not a lot of clean passes and on the Virginia Tech side everything is comfortable passes are in the in the right Music pocket and thats what they need to do set up easy Hoops like that they are two of 19 from the field well and what happened there that was an assist making a play for somebody else Drive draw the attention get it to the next Applause guy problem is Virginia Tech isnt missing now and potit he you know they played way off him at the threepoint line but hes comfortable shooting the ball from 15 ft potit has Applause six to sooko offensive Applause rebound petritis everywhere but couldnt grab the ball on the tip I think developing a mindset right now for Cal you are not going to score by yourself its just going to be too hard theyre too physical theyre too big you have to make plays for Applause teammates great challenge Cal does have really good length challenge ing shots lets see if they take your advice coach and get an assist on this possession multiple sides of the floor is always good I like the ball in STO aovs Applause hands well that was a oneonone play that wouldnt have had an assist but he did a nice job of drawing the foul the Hoops have come easy for Virginia Tech and they are shooting the ball 64 they made 11 of 17 and Cal cant buy a bucket for the hes its at the end of the day the priority has to be looking to your teammates now I will put some of the onus on the teammates as well off ball cutting I think would be a huge huge emphasis right now because if youre just standing out there uh youre easily able to to get rotated to they can find you its not necessarily going to create Advantage but if theres dribble penetration or something that gets into the paint if youre off the ball making a making a cut because Virginia Techs help side and help defense is tremendous the way you make him pay for that is get cuts on the weak side stovic had 23 on Wednesday against UVA hes averaging over 20 second in the conference he has two points so far no field goals two free throws all right so 131 something a little bit different right here again changing it up just some kind of different feel Music Applause Virginia Tech with a offensive rebound and they had only one now they have two call had six but that was pretty timely and it may have been his own FL flavor that fouled him but they called the foul on Cal well thats when you know things just arent going your way it was his own player really well maybe they called sto yakovich for the reach but his own player shoved him in the back that 131 they ran just now its uh you know something unique and different again uh I like the idea of changing it but you have to be able to cover the backside uh lob right there and so a little bit more active a little bit of length they have a a roster in there now that can really do some different things because they are so long but I think the activity level needs to go up I wouldnt be surprised right now petritis is known as the energy guy the hustle guy they need a spark you know and I maybe its an offensive rebound or a dunk or a loose ball or a charge but somebody needs to to give c a spark and then you can build off of that maybe the spark will come from Javon blacksher there we go that was timely to say to Music Applause Music least Cal back manto man now in a little bit better pressure I like this try and push up Applause Brown was brown was floating towards the Applause hoop you know right now its searching you know the coaching staff the players for Cal you know I like the idea of the coaching staff searching you know trying to find something but the players you know they need to take some ownership here and really provide the energy it doesnt matter what defense you run whether its a zone or its a 131 one or two three Man Press if its not coming up next right here on acc Network in the ESPN coming up next right here ONN analis bestch everys G look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week Applause get some weak side movement hard to get a closer look than that coach no thats they theyve had some good looks and and what you find now is you know human nature does kick in when youre so youre struggling so much on the offensive end you know human nature its hard to play as hard as you can on the defensive end but the really good teams are able to fight Human Nature too easy for Virginia Tech well fantastic off ball cut by Johnson dribble penetration defense looks the other way not going to get a better look than that is it days like this when like a team is three for 23 youre like you know talking about its not that bad might be better than coaching thats exactly right St yakovich has just been off today so so far hes 0 for five from the field and now 0 for six no such issues for Virginia Tech ball is going through at a very rapid Pace in 66 of the Applause Music Applause time I think the messaging for Cal right now is simply play as hard as you can on the defensive end you know itd be awfully timely right now to get a steal get something in transition but the only way youre going to get that is is the effort and all of a sudden Virginia Tech is making more of an effort on the offensive class coach Music yeah 3317 hoky on top under four to play in the first half record a record poor shooting day so far for the California Golden Bears three of 24 from the field two of nine from three you know I think one way to address this is uh you know I I like the idea of emphasizing making plays for others you know and and and finding guys and trying to get a little bit more cutting but if I was Cal right now I think Id really focus on the defensive end and find my my five guys that are going to lay it on the line play as hard as they can and create create energy on the defensive end now I will say on Wednesday Stanford went nine minutes without scoring a field goal and trailed Virginia Tech and came back and won in the second half and when you have bench performances like that Mahoney with a three this is a lead that could get crawled back I mean as bad as it been coach its only 14 points yeah and it was moving without the ball really nice flare screen after after a ball screen but the movement and making a play for other an assisted basket really nice this could be a spark you get a stop and a score now a little bit momentum got three minutes going in a halftime itd be a dream for Cal to get this to single digits mahons a freshman from Brooklyn had a couple real good weeks of practice according to Mark Applause Matson under 3 minutes left in the first half both teams one and two in ACC play Cal has a very quick small lineup right Applause now want to check that coach I said one and two both teams one and three both teams though looking for their second Conference Applause win thats a high quality shot get it to the guy that just made one thats what the steel energy and a rare easy hoop for the Golden Bears easy baskets have been hard to come by and what happened they got it on the defensive end get a deflection get a steal get an easy basket hopefully that for the cow Bears can spark them you hear coaches say a lot its significant to be down less than double digits at half is that a real thing coach I think it is even um just from a the mental part of it the mind set um theres a little bit of a mental barrier and thats going to be a foul on Virginia Tech even these last couple possessions the feel is theres a little bit more energy guys diving on the floor weve had four or five guys falling diving on the floor this is I think a really good way for them to try and get back into it is create energy on the defensive end see if that can get some things on offense that are some easy basket cuz it has been really an uphill battle on the offensive end Spencer Mahoney the 69ine freshman from Brooklyn is really giving Cal a spark and everybody wants their minutes everybody wants to play and right now if youre a golden bear the easiest way to get on the court is simply provide energy dive on the floor try and take a charge good hard box Music out and mones provided that spark right now Cal has as many points from the free throw line as they do from field goals Music yeah the free throw Lines been about their only friend right now Applause right and the offensive glass has been a little bit friendly too Applause young the freshman and really a silly foul by Mahoney because that did nothing to impede that that bucket you know cal cal looked to to foul him at half court but it didnt work should he have grabbed him there in the back court yeah you know in the NBA they call that a take foul and uh you know it would have been a nice way to kind of stop the break what you cant do is make an intentional foul though you have to make sure you go uh for the basketball otherwise could be an intentional and then thats the worst of all all worlds but I think he had an opportunity there probably to just reach in right absolutely and you know and coaches you know treat that differently and how they how they coach that how they teach that but uh you know a lot of times when it takes away a a guaranteed two points thats something you want to do Virginia Tech takes a timeout well take a break too just for 30 seconds well come back 3923 Cal on top Cal Music trailing down by not be 3923 Virginia Tech over Cal a minute 11 left first half we talked about what Cal needs to do if youre Mike young what are you telling the hokes with the little hes in the stands to do in this final minute 11 well if you can pull pull together one more stop right now youre really looking at the clock as well if you can get the ball back you know with about 50 seconds left you may be thinking two for one Applause um and that would be I mean they definitely have an option right now for a two for one in about 10 seconds 43 on the clock ideally get a shot up and be able to get it back did you always like the two for one I became a huge huge fan of it yep and uh they get a shot right here really good play good options and I think they should be able to still get a two for one re Steiner can shoot he has 10 so really good Savvy right here by Cal they understand they were going for the two for one but the trius did not inbound the basketball theyre rolling it still so the two for one never happened for Virginia Tech really a heads up play by Applause Cal but a 19point lead for Virginia Tech Applause crosses off dor with a big rebound had it stripped and thats how the half will end thats its kind of a holistic uh problem right now and so what I would start with is simply V coach Matson is really talk about energy energy energy energy see if that can spark the team to really getting some stops and then getting multiple stops in a row thank goodness cal made 10 of their 12 free throws they average a league best 18 or else they wouldnt even be in this game as it is their Trail by 19 well think about this if you were Cal and you said youre 10 of 12 from the free throw line you have eight offensive rebounds and only one turnover and it its just uh statistically its really been you would not think youre down by 19 if you said that you would not think that by any means but the other it kind of shows the other stats are are abysmal at this point well you mentioned hustle plays right youre down by 19 youre going to have to get all the 5050 balls and out hustle the other team correct theres no question about it there there has to be a spark from somewhere and offensively player movement and ball movement it has to happen uh Virginia Techs defense is too good if youre stagnant or if youre trying to just go Applause oneonone blacker down so its a five on four re Steiner left open and Toby lewall with the offensive board for Virginia Music Applause Tech Tyler Johnson with an easy hoop 4423 Hokies Virginia Tech from last year to this year has really improved their rebounding especially on the offensive end and a big part of that is Johnson you just saw that right there big strong body and knows how to really pursue those boards Steiner the steel the Dipsy do no good and Soko with a rebound on Wednesday one thing that I think really helped Cal was you know Inc increasing the pace of the game getting some Tempo DJ Campbell absolutely but if you can start getting some things in transition maybe get some easy things in transition the problem is if you dont get stops on the defensive end it makes transition offense a whole lot harder Music Campbells first Applause bucket young inside strong move I think there there is an emphasis to push the basketball but it when you have to take the basketball out of bounds it takes you an extra two three seconds which really perch your your primary break or your secondary break blacker in and out petrius right place missed the easy layup stoak finally on the board with an easy put back couple offensive rebounds you label those hustle plays P trus right there keeping it alive thats dakovich his first field goal of the game but coach to your point they cant play you get one I get one theyre down by too many its uh theyre in a dangerous spot right now as well theyre going to have to find ways they have to find ways to get stops the Virginia Tech to already have 48 points almost halfway to 100 is not not in Cs BETs best interest to say the Applause Music least blacker open in the corner the shooting woes continue for the Bears I will say this half offensively the looks theyre getting are better uh you know theyre theyre off good passes their clean looks from three of theyre driving to the basket at the end of the day the balls got to go in the Applause basket young thought about passing it shot it missed the entire Rim St yakovich has had big second halfs coach you saw one so lets see if he heats up in the second half he drew the foul there well just saw him make it get an offensive rebound uh put back which probably builds his confidence this time down looking to back his man into the post so I think two things one is uh being a little more aggressive but also confidence can go up you see the ball ball going in the hoop confidence can go up if he makes a jump shot here pretty soon I wouldnt be surprised if he has another big half like he did on Music Applause Wednesday now blackshire Waits gets it to sasoko Applause Music 7 for 37 from the field for the Bears the wall drew the contact a late whistle but it is the foul and theyll call it on Joshua Ola Joseph yeah Ola Joseph I mean thats going to be a you know an unfortunate foul he thought he was straight up but I think he did get his arms in there um what you dont want to do is bail out somebody thats thats off balance I thought lall was a heck of a drive but at the end of the day hes off balance its probably going to be a tough shot just dont want to bail him out Ola Joseph I I think if he says Square to him you know wont get the foul called there but turn Tosh shoulder its going to be a foul Toby lall had three crazy dunks at your old home at Maples Pavilion uh one of the reverse variety had 15 points played two years at VCU didnt start playing Hoops till he was 16 soccer player originally from London measured at a 49 in vertical lead you heard that right 49 in I mean you talk about somebody with a huge huge upside still you know learning and getting reps with the game but really has good instincts his his form looks good on a shot has a chance to be a heck of a Applause Music player Cal Moving the ball better now and St yakovich left alone and then sasoko tried to sort of wrestle way wesler and Soko will be called for the foul so well take immediate time out hoky still in control 4928 bears trying to generate some offense tomor all right Cal trying to change it up again getting into a press little two21 Music Applause now back into his zone right now deflections are like gold if you can find a way to get your hand on a basketball there you go get the turnover just as you said it coach and now try and turn it into easy shot on the other end create Tempo they want this game to start going up and down both teams playing loose and free and fun and they get to the free throw line Wilkinson draws the foul and thats the recipe for a comeback right there on the defensive end get deflections try and push in transition get a good shot going to the rim or an open shot from three fairly early in the shot clock great job attacking the rim getting fouled now youre have an opportunity to score two points with the with the clock stopped have your defense set potentially get in your um press again coach a big win uh a big game here needed because Cals going to head back and have to play at North Carolina and at NC State next week thats going to be a long unusual road trip for you know Cal team heading back East for conference play I think they head out on Monday and theyll be there a full week obviously not easy plays places to play great Traditions out there but they sure love to have a better taste in the mouth than what they have right now back in their Zone same attitude find ways to get deflections thats not it Burnham is an instant heat check off the bench this is their largest lead Applause Music Applause 5129 Ola Joseph a three for Cal really good player movement really good ball movement on that possession ball got from one side to another multiple off ball screens gets wide open shot early in the possession they might have had a layup as well so alich wasnt able to make the pass it was good offense see if Cal can make two possessions in a row after a stop Campbell in the corner and steals it from Tyler Johnson misses the layup thats the exact play they need they need a steal but they need that ball to go in it is just just tough tough tough stuff right Applause Music now potit with the floater you know I dont have it in front of me but if we looked at the entire game how many times theyve been able to string stops together its not a lot if to get one stop Virginia Tech has found a way to score on the next possession um and Cal thats you have to find ways to get multiple stops in a row b on Tyler Johnson who was holding sto Applause yakovich lead Dort in Soko takes a seat theyre out of bounds plays right now a lot of times they do look to go to sto yakovich I wouldnt be surprised with a couple of good screens DJ Campbell its really good offense they put stovich in the corner so they cant help off of him allow Campbell to go isolation get every else on the weak side really a welldesigned Applause play Rex Steiner to potit again we just saw that play all right theres one stop lets see if they can build it multiple times on the defensive end all the Joseph for three could it could it be just a little bit of momentum for Cal right now momentums only going to stay if they can get a stop right Applause now good box out by Ola Joseph there we go two in a row lets him get out in transition Music and one its easier said than done but its hard to get out and play in transition like they did the last couple possessions without getting stops they got backto back stops on the defensive end right now in transition Ola Joseph easy step in and then were attacking the basket Andre sto yakovich getting to the rim getting to the free throw line where he is extremely proficient if he can make this free throw 13 points seems like a pretty manageable number right Applause now Cs on a seven nothing run theyve scored on three straight possessions and youre right coach they probably did not do that once maybe two straight possessions in the first half defensively building out their pressure a little bit to half court playing manto man crowds getting into it 12 minutes is a long time Rex Steiner off Music Applause Wilkinson up under acrobatics the whole field now has changed they got their multiple stops in a row offensively they got a couple of baskets the vibe the feeli the Mojo everything has shifted in Cals favor right now the lead down to 11 it was 21 westler oh all the Joseph thought he got it clean he may have it sounded like it was all ball certainly the fans out here did second half a different story California Golden Bears are walking up and Wilkinson basketball a really welldesigned out of bounds play by Mark badson and then were sharing the basketball going one side of another defensive stops have allowed transition baskets a three by Ola Joseph a drive by Andre stovich an athletic scoop by Wilkinson and the 10o runs complete now 12 minutes left in the game 11 points all kinds of of things can happen all kind of possibilities for Cal and right now after a timeout Id like to see Virginia Tech kind of get organized stop the run and they can do that right now on the free throw line well if you told Virginia t theyd be up by 11 1130 left in the second half at Cal theyd probably take it but if you told Mike young youd be up by 22 and then youre up by 11 we saw his face at that time out he wouldnt take it there is some frustration there and uh you know the the the biggest thing I can say is Cal found a way to get multiple stops in a row you cant make a run if if Virginia Tech continues to score and so on the defensive end I think thats where it started and then the confidence Builds on the offensive end Applause out of the timeout right now a design play Sing Andre Frank really nice play by Mark Matson off ball screen great cut by Andre stovich great response its a 10point game if youre just joining us we are at hos Pavilion Dave feldin and Jared hos Cal and Virginia Tech meeting for only the second time Cal won the lone meeting 33 years ago both teams looking for just their second Conference win Virginia Tech lost to Stanford on Wednesday they play today then they head back East Cal had a very good win against Virginia on Applause Wednesday lall acrobatic there I wouldnt be surprised to see Virginia Tech put in lall in some ball screen situations hes such a high flyer and they can just throw it up to him that last foul on the Baseline the only way to stop him was really to foul him that was his first field goal Jared he only has five points on one made field Applause Music Applause goal ball is swung from one side to another gets to multiple sides obviously thats an advantage for the offense lall somehow in his mind he was thinking about dunking that same thing was just too far away which says something for him Cal has five straight scores on this end of the floor see if they can keep that going great move by sto yakovich just didnt finish all the Joseph got it was tied up and then Tyler Johnson took it away from him wow what a move just didnt Applause Music Applause finish theres a screen and roll right there Ali oop the wall went and got it had to come down shovel passing too much traffic here come the Bears Wilkinson no good ball tip no good Ola Joseph runs it down Ola Joseph cant get it to go petrius cant get it to go Wilkinson again finally attack in the rim what great body control right there by Wilkinson it was great defense there was contact but certainly not a foul elevated hung in the air and made a finish that was just cow out hustling but to speak to coach Hs point you got to get a stop and Rex Steiner doesnt let Applause Music them coach Matson coaching hard over there getting the exact situation he wants on offense calling the play but also making sure the Personnel are in the right spots Wilkinson splits the defender beautiful move hes in double digits with 10 coach Matson orchestrating right there great job getting Wilson the ball going downhill used Andre stovich as a Applause Music decoy Young Trav I really like this this lineup right now with Ola Joseph uh and petrius two energy guys right now really cool then offensively Andre sakovic slipped out of a screen drew a little bit of attention Wilkinson splits the double team right down the lane unbelievable body control Wilkinson doesnt start but a lot of times he finishes and you can see why I mean coach Madson wants him on the court four turnovers in the second half for Virginia Applause Tech this lineup for Cal you have a really nice mix of really good Defenders with energy but also uh scoring punch with Wilkinson Music stovic Wilkinson with his magic and the lead is single digits feed the hot hand feed the hot hand single digits means a big deal right now eight minutes eight points very doable time out Virginia Applause Tech we will go to break two the Cal Bears have some momentum theyre down by only eight well wishes and prayers to everybody and so many people been Applause displaced inside here at Harmon 5850 Mike young at this time out I wouldnt have been surprised if he really talked about the idea its a conference Road game there has to be an expectation the team is going to make a run thats okay what they can control now is their Applause response young in trouble headed stri sasoko to the Applause dirt jump ball Virginia Tech with the whistle so another break a TV timeout this time still 5850 and Cal still Within made 62 in the first half but Cal on a 217 run in the second half so a different story brings them within Applause eight the lead is now six well I was going to say the backtoback timeouts were really timely for Virginia Tech to reset but they dont score on one day sakovic gets the layup momentum continues for Cal St yakovich with a slow start now has 11 in double figures and a turnover by Applause Tech Virginia Tech only with three turnovers in the first half thats already five in the second half now part of thats due to the increased pressure first basket after the timeouts stovic going downhill having another really good second half looking to build on that again stovich for three on Q its a onep possession game a nine nothing run for Music cow and now we will see what this Tech team has made of Brown no good petrius runs it down Andre stovich has done a great job attacking the rim the entire night not settling for jump shots has a rhythm building his confidence that last three was in Rhythm not forced really good goes right back to attacking the rim petrius tried to tip it kept it alive Soko no good but M sasoko draws the foul my sooko is an interesting story he is from a tiny village in Molly he played at Michigan State had a great career there while he was there he took his nil money and gave it back to his hometown because as a person on a Visa he is not allowed to make profit or collect money so he gave it all the way to his town a small village and it started a school he used to have to Jared walk 90 minutes to school and 90 minutes back they built a school right in the village where the kids can go to right there then he built a hospital because anyone with any type of ailment had to go more than three or 4 hours to get that done he got running water so mty sasoko a hero in his hometown just he he went back there and I said they must treat you like your Michael Jordan he goes they do he goes its kind of a fun feeling but its a better feeling knowing how I can give back to my family and he does really amazing great story from a great for a great person and a great story for this comeback with Cal who Trails by two on another Virginia Tech turnover Mike young right now telling his team maintain composure settle down I do think Virginia Tech has a good look their huddles are really good their communications really good they just need to play better and now that the the script is its flipped Virginia Tech has to find ways to get stops ball will stay with Cal bear fans wanted a foul you dont get Applause it the last out of bounds under play Cal had a really nice play an isolation Drive lets see what they have for this one wouldnt be surprised if stovic comes off some screens again Applause Madson barking out the instructions Here Comes Wilkinson downhill lays it in and we are tied that same actions has worked multiple times now A go screen a fake screen from a guard coming up gets Virginia Tech off balance Wilkinson going left finishing at The Rim the cow bears were down by 22 points with 15 minutes left in this game Lal for three silences the crowd sure does what a big shot what a big shot you know at this point 5 and a half minutes left time and score starts to become into play a little bit every shot every play is magnified stovic no good sasoko saved it but it goes to Tech Music I really think cows run started on the defensive end and thats what they just have the mindset right now find ways to get stops young off the glass the lead back to four and timeout C really a fantastic response by Virginia Tech Mike young has to be proud of that well take a 30second break well come back should be a great finish here in Berkeley six a tough shot by Young too he has 12 points on five of 10 Applause shooting a fivepoint gain 458 Applause left Wilkinson ran it down DJ Campbell off the F Wilkinsons left hand drives has really been a spark nice pass out that time wide open shot for Cal thats its going to be hard to get a better look than that te find to use a little clock if they want young switches to the other side and its another hoop for Applause Music Tech three straight scores right there seven nothing Run for the Applause Hokies the game but especially the second half has been a game of runs and right now C needs to flip it really quickly and get back on a run of their own and they need a stop Applause Music here poti dunks it nine nothing run with the exclamation point wow that run happened quick great roll straight to the front of the rim nice pass btis going to be hard to stop when he gets that Applause close yakovich hammered and hell go to the line and we have our last TV timeout Virginia Tech coach moving the ball well doing a great job and after they move it theyre getting into ball screen situations we talked about the pick and pop now its going to be a pick and roll right here theres nobody in the country is going to stop that basket 5867 Virginia Tech on top Applause Music Applause we e Applause Applause all right Taylor thanks the story here a game of runs Cal Trail by 22 points tied it but now Coach House another run by Virginia Tech well what a timely three the pick and pop with low and then its going downhill young with a strong finish do it once do it again really strong finishes at the rim and then this is as strong as it gets right there with potit again there arent many players in the country theyre going to do anything once he gets it that close to the basket the response for Mike Youngs team has been really really good meanwhile that sto yakovich ho excuse me coach ends a 2minute 20 second scoring Dr getting a couple shots right here getting back to seven and then its going to get back to the same thing find ways to get stops for the Golden Music Bears so here comes some pressure saw some token pressure in the full court with is fine and then the half court right now I really think Cal increasing pressure exactly forc them to do something they dont want to do and they did an offensive foul on Toby lawall the try is finding ways to impact the game doesnt always have to be Applause scoring so L just shoved petritis right in front of the raft that was an easy call very easy call stovich no good the rebound by Virginia Tech a tie up petrius with a hustle play and the Bears have the arrow two winning plays by petrius you know denying over here is a push off on Virginia Tech but ends up getting a a turnover and then on this end Miss shot ties it up gets another possession petrius makes winning play after winning play Applause Wilkinson waves off the Music Applause screen and Tyler Johnson fouls Applause scov the problem there is six seven seconds left on the shot clock you dont want to bail him out get him to the free throw line right here you give him two free yeah stop clock I was going to say 3 minutes under 3 minutes now you sevenpoint lead the clock becomes your friend if youre Virginia Tech get a couple more stops but putting them on the free throw line stop clock Cal with 16 free throws they average 18 most in the conference theyre in the double bonus and stovic 17 after the quiet first half the lead is five I expect Cal to be extremely aggressive on both ends of the floor anytime they get fouled theyre going to be shooting two free throws on offense and right now finding ways to get deflections being aggressive on this end of the floor Music the steal by petritis up ahead stovic slams it home unbelievable petritis has come up huge obviously a great finish by sto yakovich but three winning plays by petritis theres a reason hes in the game two minutes left threepoint Cal deficit late shot clock young with eight on the clock the long three off sto yakovich got it back we have a game timeout Madson he almost came to the center circle to call it last two minutes the coaches can call a timeout keep this out why we take a look at a a pretty nice second half so far from Andre sto yakovich you know hes done a nice job just getting himself in the game by going downhill first getting easy baskets first some nice play calls where theres some off ball screening hes driving to the basket and then this one right here hes in Rhythm hes built his confidence the step back three really doing a nice job creating shots for himself and uh you know he he could be used right now certainly to be able to take the shot but he would be a heck of a decoy as well or put him in the corner where people are not going to be able to help off of him so he can add value even if hes not shooting this next shot he averages 20 a game he has 20 so 140 is what theyre settling on 140 left in this game in regulation we should point out could be an overtime scenario Virginia Tech I can almost assure you that they said bind away and put a body on petrius keep him off the offensive glass so now theyre going back to the monitor we thought we had it all settled and now maybe theyre looking to see about the shot clock violation Mike Youngs going to use this opportunity to get a couple more instructions to his kids you know statistically Cal has 15 offensive rebounds which normally say that is a you know big number its too many but the number of missed shots theyve had makes it so its not quite that okay so what were told now is if it was a shot clock violation which we believe it was theyll add some more time to the clock coach because that time should not have run off this is so it could be more than a minute 40 on the clock its why get they get paid the big bucks why we wait a reminder that next Saturdays ACC Network basketball triple header Virginia Tech host Wake Forest at two Eastern then Notre Dame in Syracuse square off at four and finally Cal takes on NC State should be another great day of Hoops on the ACC Network as we try to figure out exactly how much time will be left and lets be honest this is kind of critical with this close game and there much time left yeah you want to make sure you get this right you know and during these these breaks both coaches are talking about Tendencies and making sure everybodys on the same page throws for about 20 seconds right during the the sequence and the time lapse we just had to f all right the clock 133 after all the dust has settled cow ball down by Applause three petritis in the corner really a welldesigned play Andre stovich used as a decoy right there Wilson going downhill to get a wide open shot Applause Music not surprising Virginia Tech milk in the clock some looking to go inside potit down low going against Soko potit and Soko and petit with the hoop Cal chooses to let Soko defend oneonone right there they dont help down they dont double down poti with the big time Big Time jump hook you know its interesting as it comes down watch Cal nobodys digging down nobodys coming down to help theyre leaving Soko and hes proven he can guard people oneonone so its a rolling the dice there those are two big bodies at the end of the day heck of a right hand jump hook potit with 12 and three rebounds and already another clock situation that theyre trying to sort Applause out and well get a quick explanation maybe Applause that so 598 added an extra second c will certainly look to score score early here if they can down by five under a Applause minute St yakovich down by three great Patience by by stovic using his size to his Advantage young thought about it 30 seconds left in the game 14 on the shot clock at this point you do not want to F oh right as you were saying it coach late shot clock you dont foul right no with that with it no and so theyre not going to the free throw line 20 seconds on the shot clock with 7sec differential I think were going to be fouling quickly and often now if youre Cal get him for the shoot free Applause throws so a couple more of the first foul is going to put them on the sideline next foul will be a oneonone right so if you want to be aggressive and see if can get a quick trap maybe but I would anticipate them fouling Music quickly all right time now to take a look at todays Dynamic play of the game brought to you by T price a dynamic play of the game I think I have a feeling I know what itll be how about malel potit rolled down the lane that was part of the 90 run it capped it whats the strategy here poti averages in double figure points and is their best assist man has not played tonight certainly he would be a guy who was handling the ball right now in this scenario with Cal out of timeouts really coach Matson has let them know offensively what were what theyre trying to do just in case theres not a dead ball situation that ball was almost picked off by DJ Campbell theyre hoping for the dream situation theyre going to look at it review it yeah he threw that inbound pass very late coach and he did not see Campbell coming over there really a tough spot to throw the basketball if youre going to throw it backwards you might want to consider throwing into the back court because that half court line is another Defender oh its hard to tell there yeah I think its going to be hard to overturn Id imagine this will stay with Virginia Music Tech like you mentioned the pass was just a little bit late you cannot get passive you cannot get conservative for Virginia Tech because you know Cals coming after you right now anything passive will probably get punished Music this does serve like a timeout for both both coaches Virginia Tech talking about their out of bounds play how theyre going to get the ball in bounds they dont need to worry about a whole lot other than that just making sure they dont turn the basketball over and Applause Cal this is probably the best angle we have and I agree with you Jared I think its going to be too hard to overturn so coach matsons probably spending just as much time right now talking about what theyre going to be doing offensively um you know assuming they dont get a steal and a layup something like that make or Miss theyre going to be at least down three what are they going to do on the offensive end trying to do it quickly and theyll have their press set up as well right theyre going to be down three and how much time will they have the ball if they get it back and theyre down three well hopefully if they do this right its going to be 24 25 seconds cuz you dont want any time to run off foul immediately they dont get and now finally Ola Joseph fouls Rex Steiner Im not sure if they were trying to get the ball passed to a specific player but you know thats 6 seconds you cant get back so the next foul will be oneonone for Virginia Applause Tech may have a chance to get a quick steal but you do not want a lot of clock time to burn off right now Applause the lob into the wall lost his footing went to the ground got rid of it brown got it and they call a foul on Joshua ol Joseph that turned out well for Virginia Tech that looked like it was a disaster waiting to happen did potential turnover potential travel potential torn ankle by lall all of it Applause Brown is 0 for two from the free throw line tonight yeah that could have been a problem yeah you dont love throwing the inbound pass to a jump to a jump ball right Applause there now remember Rodney Brown Jr played his freshman year at C and now he has a chance to try to seal their face his former teammates probably giving him a little bit of an earful right now but he should be used to these rims to say the least oh the kind Applause roll so now when you get it back youre down two possessions coach you dont care whether you get a three or two right just something quick youre going downhill as fast as you possibly can if you have a wide open three thats fine otherwise youre putting your head down getting to the rim hopefully getting fouled but you are not taking a lot of time here not a lot of passes St yakovich scores easy no timeouts they have to get up and press right now they know that and they commit the foul really well executed play right there now you really need youre relying on Virginia Tech to miss some free throws for Virginia Tech make your free throws probably eliminate threes on the other end theyre hoping this clock runs as fast as Applause possible so Brown who just made him goes right Music back short arms it its short in the wall got the rebound but travel Mike young cant believe it Mike young just did a full downward dog fall and now he wants a time Applause out athletes box outs collisions a lot going on on this one right Applause here wow the trius got one in the face right there L going up and up and up and up and up there was a lot of things happening there well it worked out about as well as possible watch coach young the top of your screen hes just and then the downward dog the life of a coach the life of a coach well the last 20 seconds here could not have gone better for Cal down five points with the basketball they drive in within 10 seconds get a layup now they have the basketball back after a Miss free throw so have a chance is pretty good you drive into the hole strong looking for a foul in a threepoint or you looking for a threepoint shot youre going to have to be awfully quick Im not opposed right now if you can get the ball up quickly maybe pass it ahead you know if you can get a shot with four or five seconds left at The Rim thats fine right now I would probably look to take a three if you can get one and uh you know and again if you can if you can get somehow Advance it with the pass get a shot at the rim and hopefully get fouled but theyre not going to foul you at The Rim right now conversely if youre a Virginia Tech would you foul uh yes and its so I always like the magic number being about 8 seconds 7 seconds so if it comes in in the fullcourt situation I really like Virginia Tech looking the foul right now in a perfect world if it gets down to 5 Seconds 4 seconds the only thing you have to make sure is make sure theyre not going up in the motion of shooting right I love the idea of Cal can advance the ball to half court with the pass this is a play they worked on these plays that shoot around they know what theyre doing even without a timeout 97 seconds left ball goes back to sto yakovich theyre down by three sto yakovich passes it out ball tipped he had a layup but went to DJ Campbell for the three and the ball was tipped 34 seconds left really good discipline by Virginia Tech not getting sucked in right there as a set play this is also going to be a set play they know the time and score this is something they work on all the time now obviously shooting a three sto yakovich for three the T no good and Virginia Tech holds on what a finish what a comeback
