moments away the officiating crew Jeff Clark Keith Kimble Nathan frell a threegame losing streak for Louisville trying to snap that and a week full of rumors surrounding Kenny pay pepperine coming off a win over UC San Diego it is the second alltime meeting between the Cards and the Waves by the mantoman defense and this is where youd like to go get it down inside to Huntley Hatfield and see what he can do on the low post here he is to the Post reverse Lan didnt get it to go stays with it follows with a bucket heres the starting five for Pepperdine presented by Food Lion Mallette aay Moore Anderson and kabali whos back for his third game after missing a lot of time with an injury and Louisville as well opens in the manto man nice collapsing defense there really good rotation Brian Brandon Huntley Hatfield stepped out on the guard and everybody scrambled around in the back really nice play Jumper short corner is good that was Mallette and the starting five for Louisville presented by Food Lion Johnson white Clark James and the at forementioned Huntley Hatfield a lot of Youth in this lineup for Kenny pay back to Huntley Hatfield inside blocked shot there that was kabali Dan well kabali is an excellent shot blocker and this is one thing that Louisville has to try to avoid Pepperdine is a team that likes to get out and go and they can shoot the three in transition particularly Mallette so you dont want to give them transition opportunities if you can avoid it yeah mlet can really fill it up the Junior from Alam California already five points for him a co captain on the West Coast Conference preseason team had 19 in his last game its a really good offense that Lorenzo RAR has over there in pepperd now mlet is a guy who can shoot the ball he shoots the ball very well from two from three hes an outstanding free throw shooter as well tyar Johnson controlling the rock into the paint kick out good look from three knocked down by Mike James the red shirt sophomore from Orlando well you see James there hes not a great threepoint shooter but if he can catch and shoot with some room he can be pretty effective Play No Good rebound Clark quick to the basket aggressive move it was knocked out of bounds we talk about Lorenzo RAR the former Washington coach now at Pepperdine his second stint with the waves Dan its a guy whos been around the game for a very long time yeah he really has he knows what hes doing as a coach Music and hes hes his his team has had some injuries this year which has slowed him down and that is a great job inside thats why Tyler Johnson is in the game he passes the ball very well Louisville is looking for better passing and they certainly got it there drawing the defense kicking it to the open man no doubt Dan Johnson had three assists as a traveling violation there on the waves but he had three assists on Wednesday night against Arkansas State and what was his first career start how about this creation W this is a great job driving the ball to the basket and Mallette just loses Trey white on the outside mlet turns his back on white and white cuts to the basket thats an excellent move following the basketball James already hit one triple that time not going to get it to fall Anderson on the Corral inside blocked out of bounds by Huntley Hatfields and now Kenny Payne second season at Louisville theres a lot swirling around the Louisville area about his time right now as the head man of the Cardinal but you know what he told us earlier today we want to show the fans that were still connected were together and this is a basketball team thats going to give great tremendous effort in a program that does love each other Kenny Payne is amazing he can remain positive but he does and theres Johnson Johnson comes in you know in his last seven games and Counting today hes already got one assist but in his last seven plus games hes got 30 assists and only 13 turnovers and there is another good play as Louisville is getting the ball inside to the basket Trey Whites second basket the transfer from USC he had 10 points on Wednesday night and the response jumper theres aay we said AI shoots almost 60 inside the arc he can drive the ball to the basket hes very very good in the midrange with that pullup Louisville team who has struggled offensively throughout the year a great start to the season went two and one Johnson tees up a triple that rims out rebound of the waves and Malik Moore you can see Pepperdine really would like to push the ball thats a great job by Huntley Hatfield to pull that rebound down limit pepperine to one shot white again nice feed inside Louisville early able to get to the bucket but white in particular has been able to find openings inside six points for wide early Lille by four Mallette has it ripped away transition opportunity for the cards midrange jumper KN going to fall from the elbow good look though for Huntley Applause Hatfield Louisvilles done a pretty nice job defensively so far keeping Pepperdine out of the lane something theyve struggled with so far this year Dan points in the paint and issue for Louisville and a lot of their losses another nice feed and a foul as Clark will go to the line on the other side well early on the Cardinals playing with energy and effort up for at home the creu in frost box with a McNugget buddy in

Time Lorenzo RAR and his group Music had you see the images there Dan and uh one of the greats in sports history and I love that quote there by Muhammad Ali and a chance to really learn about fighting tooth and nail a finding way to be tough as Lorenzo RAR now in his second stint with Pepperdine hes been at Pepperdine hes been at Washington hes had success wherever hes Applause been and thats thats great they came in early and if youre going to come early you may as well go to one of the really good museums thats a fun Museum the Muhammad Ali museum and one of the real at the lot great Personalities in Sports oh absolutely you talk about getting here early Dan how much of that has to do though with trying to get acclimated coming from the West Coast in the Pacific time zone well has a lot obviously but its cant do that all the time there theres no classes going on so you have the opportunity good rebound by Huntley Hatfield and once again the Louisville defense prevents that dribble penetration when you talked about them giving up points in the paint it hasnt been back to the basket kind of points its been guys driving the ball so far Louisville doing a good job cutting that off traveling violation on the Cardinals and Kenny Payne talked about not letting something that goes wrong in the middle of a game totally derail the 40 minutes that youve played theyve had some good first halfs Dan so far this season theyve played well you look at the game against Texas you look at the game against Indiana and Virginia Tech and they have had good Spurs of basketball just consistently havent been able to put it together well thats what you do theyve got nine newcomers and thats what normally November and December is for is putting things together jumper goes down to cut the lead to cut the deficit I should say to four and speaking of the inexperience Louisville 299th when you look at Ken poms D1 experience average of just 12 years out of 362 teams a lot of youngsters and a lot of transfer portal pieces a Applause pay locking foul Applause there Dan you and I talked earlier this week just about inexperience sometimes you take one step forward two steps back with teams like this and and it seems like thats what Kenny Payne is trying to endure here in year two trying to put things together and and in this day and age we put an awful lot of emphasis the net rankings make November and December I think over overly important you coaches have to have a chance to put their teams together foul on the floor as white went for the rebound hes a little slow to get up it was called on 13 cord stanbury 63 red shirt freshman from Bermuda Dunes California white has a transfer from USC white has been very active so far nine double figure scoring games on the year for white matter of fact against Arkansas state that was the first time all year Trey white didnt score at least 10 points James rolls off offensive rebound the big bodied Huntley Hatfield good ball movement James puts a guy on skates inside the paint lays it up it will drop through louville doing a really nice ball job reversing the ball from side to side and then attacking the basket theyre playing basically Five Guys out leaving the middle open and it has worked for them so far Dan just five assists against Arkansas State on Wednesday theyve got four assists already in this one thats one of the things they needed to be a better passing team theyre a very poor shooting team and one of the reasons is they dont pass it very well and that was not bad defense right there that was just really good offense by Ethan Anderson and Anderson averaging nearly seven points per game very experienced fifth year senior hes played at Wyoming and at USC former teammate of Trey white and Louisville Im not sure that Louisville early in the shot clock wants to be relying on the threepoint shot they are not a good threepoint shooting team this is where they need to go oh Huntley Hatfield muscles it in and hes got four Applause Music sixpoint lead for Louisville another stop and now a chance to push they want to fly down the court all the way to the rim its Curtis Williams an outstanding Applause freshman top prospect in the state of Michigan last year and hes a guy that Kenny Payne thinks can make an impact and thats what you do youre onun the court you make easy baskets you play defense thatll get the coaches attention its an eightpoint advantage good Defense Forces a short jumper James measures out the defense kicks it out to White NOW Huntley Outfield James steps into a three and knocks it down this is very good from Louisville early forces a timeout by Applause Music Music pepperd Music hey deal lovers heres something new having good taste shouldnt cost you a

a Greener more Equitable future for everyone learn about our commitment to the Next Generation Music Music Louisville playing really well on a 20 to6 run and a lot of it has to do with Huntley hfield theyve sort of played through him nice pass out to Mike James again a stand still three and nice assist by Huntley Hatfield hes got six rebounds thats his first assist and this is something that Kenny pay knows is really important coming into the game Louisville has only assisted on 41 of their field goals and that is a very low number but today theyre shooting 67 shooting 63 53 excuse me from the field because theyve assisted on 23 of their field goal attempts better shots means a better shooting percentage better passing means better shots already more assists than they had on Wednesday night against Arkansas State theyve doubled up Pepperdine early on kabali exited the game pretty quickly before the first media timeout back in there and you just see the presence that he has Down Low Dan he picked up a quick personal foul and they didnt want to risk him getting to really fast and Huntley Hatfield is out of the game and they go right after a COR for Clark Drive kick white and a foul called Im we get a kick kickball Im not sure that Mike James should have passed up that three you know when you get a open three out of your offense particularly James hes a really good standstill threepoint shooter catch and shoot guy Im not sure he should have passed that one up here again theres lot of room to operate one we one hard no but the putback by Applause White Energy already picking up here early as Kenny Payne said weve got to play for we and not me team basketball so far so good how about the reverse laying oh and Js pretty good ending AI is excellent and he can really get to the basket and just because theyve contained him so far he can put a lot of points on the board quickly Clark reverse laying no another offensive rebound for Louisville but its ripped away in transition for the first game of the season its Javon Porter the sophomore from Colombia hes got a heralded family both of his brothers of course Michael Porter Jr jont Porter played in the NBA Michael Porter winning a world championship with the Nuggets well Javon Porter is a very highly skilled inside outside kind of player he shot he made 34 threes last year he shot 34 from out there hes this is his first action hes coming back from injury hes preseason all WCC this is going to be a very important guy for Pepperdine moving forward Music stanbury connects and the Louisville lead down to seven bad pass inside intended Applause for that shots not going to Applause fall hard to make a shot when you hit the side of the board white blocked its Kula Bali again hes had at least three blocks in each of the last last two games now Caleb Glenn got a good opportunity but as kabali an excellent shot blocker Porter three off to the left its over the backboard Louisville has been able to get the ball pretty close inside a nice catch Inside by Caleb Glenn but he was off balance he had to take a dribble that gave kabali a chance to recover and kabali is an outstanding shot blocker car Kola Bali from Molly transfer from USC deep three doesnt connect all hitting the ground hard a pair of players looks like James took the brunt of the contact with the hardwood boy he landed it looked like he landed right on his tailbone thats the other thing l has done pretty well so far here early in the game were only 12 minutes in but theyve done a nice job preventing dribble penetration and rebounding the basketball so you want to play this game well you got to be ready mlet with the long three in transition and James gets knocked down by Porter and I didnt see who that other Pepperdine player was but James got on the wrong side of that Ls done a nice job moving the ball so Music far sharing it and theyve been able to have a good offensive half at least so far Johnson that time able to connect on the floater Mallette can stroke it missed that one by a ton though quick shots here the last couple possessions for each team another turnover for pepperd so far louville in command in the first Music half Senor mayor with this Tower I will make pizza world famous and you yeah you can see Towers like this in Rome in Venice in Florence but these ones round no I dont know maybe a Red

your party started for Less at Music Target holiday season fast approaching Tshirt time as well the Yum Louisville up 17 pretty solid first half Mike James already hit a triple in this game its a Cardinals team Dan thats doing a nice job from Beyond The Arc uh in this one but you look look at the two teams disparities on the year well we said Louisville is not a very good threepoint shooting team theyre shooting a little bit better today pepperine actually shoots it pretty well from out there and so Louisville not only have they done a nice job cutting down on dribble penetration theyve really limited the three how about Curtis Williams there though from downtown and when you get opportunities you take advantage of them and Curtis Williams hes only coming into the game hes only five for 19 from out there so thats optimistic him shooting the ball but it goes in so it all works out his minutes are increasing over the last two games the top 80 consensus recruit coming into the year didnt shoot it that time drives behind the back pass and it turns into a giveaway and a turnover Porter kabali fouled we talked about the fact that Louisville doesnt shoot the three very well but in this case really nice job by Williams to catch the ball ready to let it go got to get your feet set you got to be ready and that time he was nice pass by Caleb Glenn and thatll count as another assist for the Applause cars clanked from kabali came to the United States before his sophomore year of high school only began playing basketball at the age of 14 in his home country of Molly well he missed the last half of last season and the first part of this season with injuries had not been to the free throw line very many times this year but again as you mentioned this is only his third game and weve got a lane violation I think Mike James stepped in early he did did indeed Dan when you look at this waves team as Kenny pay continues to coach his team in the first half AI is a really good player mlet can score it and then you get kabali and Porter back in there how do they fit in with the likes of Gonzaga and St Marys outwest thats a thats a tough thats a steep hill to climb out there Pepperdine has a long way to go you know theyre trying to put together some talent but Gonzaga has been dominant out there for forever and St Marys has pretty good program Santa Clair is pretty good this year San Francisco thats a tough League be really hard for the waves waves to make progress out there this year cerine hasnt made the NCA tournament since 2002 although in 2001 Lorenzo RAR did lead them to the postseason where they won the college basketball Invitational nice put back again Huntley Hatfields been active around the rim Louisville continues to do do an outstanding job thats their sixth offensive rebound theyve had 10 second chance points and Huntley F Hatfield already has eight rebounds in this Music game double digit lead for Louisville kabali stays on his pivot foot cant get the shot from the Block to go that was last Touch by Kabal itll be Louisville basard Hunley Hatfield got a break right there he left his feet but somehow was able to avoid the foul Lorenz standing around for Lorenzo roars guys right at the moment and thats not the way they play their best basketball theyve got to move it and attack the basket off the dribble and a big second half against UC San Diego in their last game ended up winning by six Clark caught on his pined foot out to white white pom Fay Clark now behind the back step back thats pretty and he Applause connects he stepped out of Applause bounds this situation where Louisville just has enough patience there didnt try to force anything that is a very difficult shot not bad defense that time by pepperon but better offense and theres pretty good offense right there too tyar Johnson into the scorer column his first points the Freshman from Brooklyn they force another turnover do the cards active on the defensive end that was one of those situations where the waves just got in one anothers way and the ball went out of bounds but Louisville its amazing the game seems so much easier when the ball goes in the basket and Louisville has been putting the ball in the basket in this first half 48 from the floor a COR for called for the offensive foul the 69 sophomore the Nigerian you know he wasnt really ready to catch that pass it was a tough pass but when youre following the driver to the basket you got to be ready for that ball to come back at you and because he didnt catch it right away he then wasnt able to put it right up to the basket and that resulted in him draw getting the Applause charge Moore firing midrange jumper that wont fall jump ball as white got in there forced the tie up pepperine has stayed in the manto man cor for poked away stays with it Johnson has it rejected W and a great H thats heck of a play right there James no put back by Clark but it was the hustle in the effort of Tyler Johnson that started that Applause off Louisville in command defense turning into offense cards by 17 there is a lot of information out there the truth Hamas is a terrorist group Hamas oppresses the people of Gaza uses civilians as human Shields and steals their basic supplies to use them in a war of Terror even when given the chance at peace Hamas broke the truce our community needs to stand

no doubt well 22 turnovers a game is a lot of turnovers to force actually closer to 23 than 22 no doubt a lot of questions about how the team would look with Haley van lith moving on to LS you so far so good oh what about so far so good Houston Mallette is a bucket well he is a high volume high percentage shooter hes a guy whos going to get his shots and Louisvilles done a you know theyve done okay with him but theyve really contained the other players Mallette has nine to lead all scores already a thousand Point scorer just two years in his his college career now in his third they force the turnover waves running in transition aahi four straight for Pepperdine and thats one thing that you dont want to do if youre Louisville you dont want to start turning that ball over because thatll give Pepperdine some confidence if they can get out and run and get easy baskets Williams white the former Trojan left and short a COR for another offensive rebound for Louisville the eighth of the afternoon Williams confident looking stroke couldnt connect another offensive rebound and how about a Manuel aor for well aor for he just took it right away from aay and aay we showed you one of the top rebounders in the country and a COR for just took it right out of his hands nice play the core for 11 minutes against Arkansas State Dan earning the trust of Kenny Payne that was a season high for the Nigerian mismatch inside if they can find it instead crosscourt pass leads to an open three and its knocked down that was Ethan Anderson and thats not the strongest part of Andersons games but thats a basket Pepperdine desperately needed James said no way now pepper I think they gotten some confidence after those easy baskets in transition and Anderson we said hes not a great threepoint shooter only shooting 29 from out there coming into the game but that was a wide openen look correspondently Louisville in the last eight games has been phenomenal on on threepoint percentage defense under 30 one of the best in the country Pepperdine just two of nine they have the ball here after the Miss more kick Anderson no good and Clark rips the ball away again thats probably not a good shot even though it was open in transition but again Anderson is not a particularly good threepoint shooter one James under a minute to play in the half hes fouled on the aggressive drive and aggressive is a good way to describe the way James has played on both ends of the court so far this afternoon he already has eight points doing a nice job driving the ball to the basket this will be his fourth his first free throw attempt of the game Applause game James knocks down the first heres our Friday night mens basketball double header that begins at 600 pm Eastern PJ Hall 13th ranked Clemson hosting Queens University at Little John Coliseum and then Marcus Burton and Notre Dame host the Marist red foxes AT purcel Pavilion in South Ben should be a good evening of Hoops right here on accn and the ESPN app Clemson of course dropped out of the ranks of the unbeaten yesterday losing a very close contest at Memphis to a very good Memphis team myself and coach Mark Adams will be on the call for that one against Queens on Friday night from Little JN AI cant connect after a couple of made free throws from James has Louisville with a comfortable 14 point Advantage Clark gets across the midcourt line and and calls the timeout and so Kenny Payne will draw something up right at the end of the half Marshalls buers travel far and wide to hustle the best deals on amazing holiday gifts so you dont have to its cash this is Italian leather European Applause chocolate Applause we get the deals you gift the good stuff strong first half for Louisville and we look at whats at stake the Cardinals Dan they need a win they need to feel good about something especially with Kentucky on the horizon and Pepperdine theyve struggled on the road and last true Road wi you can see it right there 2021 against University of San Diego for Louisville they just have to continue the growth process and when youre starting with so many new players sometimes you take one step forward and two steps back and then you got to make those two steps forward again its just not going to be a smooth process but if Louisville can play like this with this kind of intensity and thats going to help the process a lot very strong first half for the cards when theyve had to have it here in the Kenny pay era ball is loose picked up dont want to turn over right at the end now the waves plenty of time shot clock off and a blocking foul a called on the Baseline as Moore was driving well it doesnt really hurt Louisville because they only had four team fouls thats the 15 foul they did a nice job that was a pretty good concept trying to get inside to Huntley Hatfield on the other end he just didnt handle the ball 5 Seconds Fade Away jumper not there put back not there Huntley Hatfield has a chance for a heave oh and he nearly made it a Music Music in the basket and the ball has been going in the basket and that certainly helps thing and its important for Louisville to maintain their defensive intensity and continue to get the kind of ball movement and player movement they did in the first half first halves have typically gone pretty well for Kenny Paynes group this season its been the second half in which they have struggled Arya mudi Dan boner our entire crew here from the Yum Center first meeting between the two schools since 19 50 when they met up in Malibu and there is the numbers shooting the basketball on the Applause Music Applause year turnover right out of the gate well you dont want to get to be too big Daredevils in this situation you get down the court and you make the easy play not the tough play that was an open three in transition by Moore whos a pretty good threepoint shooter so a break for Louisville there Huntley halfeld left it short got great position down low he did and I I just think he not only has to get great position but I think the Lille to be really successful Huntley Outfield has to be able to score in the low post to give the Cardinals a threat down there Mallette hits the jumper hes into double figures leads the West Coast Conference in points per game so far this season at 18 great feed and the slam from Huntley Hatfields just a nice job slipping out of that screen right there and getting down the lane and I dont know how you can lose a 610 guy but pepperine did cards by 14 Mallette Strokes it off to the right though the rebound to White former Trojan white with The Rock was Pack 12 freshman team member looking again inside that one ripped away he to a drive to the bucket and a easy two four more and this game is a long way from being over and you simply if youre Louisville you do not want to turn the ball over and allow Pepperdine chances at easy baskets Clark no good from that left corner waves transition oh how about that block from Applause Johnson kindly returned from kabali thats a really good defensive play by Johnson and I thought he got a little over anxious because he makes this block and now is going to get the ball and hes going to go down and make the play on the other end Kola Bali was standing there waiting for him appreciate his enthusiasm though third block for kabali three straight games that hes played hes had at least three blocks strong Drive Hunley Hatfield going to the line Hunley Hatfield goes right at kulali and draws the foul again I think Huntley Hatfield has to be aggressive down there I thought he did a nice job the double team didnt come and so he tried to make the oneonone play we saw him in the first half with the double team kick it Applause out louville has made it an effort to get to the line you see their numbers there D aggressive Drive is usually rewarded well not only do they get to the line but they convert when theyre to line has been a big part of their offense only five teams in the country get more of their points from the free throw line than Louisville Music does Clark pull up rattles out Pepperdine with a chance to cut it to single digits and theyll get to do it from the line as Moore has been to a great spurt here to start the second half for the waves well Lille you know theyre taking some tough shots they took a lot of good shots early theyre taking some tough shots but also a little slow getting back on defense want to remind you accm with Mark Packer and Taylor tanom weekday from Marks charte studio in his basement at four Eastern theyll continue talking college football and have the latest from around the conference right here on accn and the ESPN app now Pepperdine is making a little bit of run at Louisville right here and I think this is an important situation for the cards to get a good shot see if Louisville can respond they have struggled with the response for much of this season its an 8 to3 run to start the second half for the waves and Louisville turns it over Huntley Hatfield wasnt ready for that passal working against Huntley Hatfield Moore slips it back to kabali turns did he drag that pivot foot he did and he Applause walked he dragged the pivot foot because Louisville did a nice job scandling back on defense the Pepperdine created an advantage but Louisvilles defensive rotation was very good and I think thats what forced the travel by kabala he just got going a little bit too quickly big three from James to stop the run James continues to play very well and that is his third threepoint basket of the game indeed it is 13 points for Mike James five straight games now in double figures for the redard sophomore from Orlando Florida oh foul call its a late call itll be more at the line when we return but Mike James inside outside that three has Louisville up 12 uhoh its the southeast mini golf mixer champ do anything cool this weekend mark Music Applause Mark I just stayed in thats cool

of the ACCC from the Yum Center Louisville 45 pepper dine 30 33 and Kenny Paynes Cardinals trying to figure out this second half and trying to get win number five which would put them at more wins than they had all of last Applause Music season Miss despite all the complaining around here there has been some progress I mean this is a team you already mentioned they played very well against Texas should have won that game played Indiana very close and youre just going to have every once in a while youre going to lay an egg and they did on Wednesday night against Arkansas State but they have come out here and responded pretty well up 11 it will stay with Louisville Dan we asked him earlier today do you think that game against Texas when a hits that fadeaway jumper from the midrange elbow did that hurt the psyche of a young team and he said you know yeah a lot of times with young teams its about not letting one game turn into two and being able to respond and thats going to be the key for Louisville as they continue throughout this nonconference portion of their Applause Music slate and the nonconference is quickly drawing to a close see Im just not so sure that thats a good shot by Williams I know hes made a three but he comes in as a very poor threepoint shooter Music wonder if he made one there in that first half all of a sudden thinks hes hot and he wants to try another what a pass inside and its more and the lead back into single digits for Louisville and pepperdines done a better job getting inside in this second half Louisville really cut off the inside in the first half but Pepperdine has been chipping away here in the second half a lot of it has to do with Louisville shot selection James got a good look that time just couldnt connect aay Euro Step and pepper dine as close as theyve been in a while now when you score it forces the other team to take the ball out of the basket and that gives you an opportunity to set your defense but Louisville

Network I love this time shop Ks big holiday sale savings this big wont last long only at k Lille dominated the inside scoring in the first half but here in the second watch this play there are three white shirks who just sort of Wander Over toward kabali they didnt really help they didnt really help out Huntley Hatfield sort of had him defensively but by with those three guys turning their backs on the ball and just wandering they left somebody wide open and Pepperdine made him pay for there you get look Pepperdine has already scored as many inside points here in the first five plus minutes of this half as they did in the entire first half that was the issue Dan for Louisville against Arkansas State on Wednesday night especially the second half when the Wolves just got to the rim at will and at times it was just a layup drill for Arkansas State and so thatll be something that they look not to repeat if youre the Cardinals in the defense against the waves well hasnt been a layup drill in fact most of those points havent been scored with drives to the basket theyve been scored in transition or scored on a play like we just showed you where the ball goes inside uh the L defense loses coverage and then somebodys able to get inside open turnover for Louisville they were one for their last seven before that possession well Huntley Hatfield uh he was looking for James and James was over there open but Huntley Hatfield a very good pass Pepperdine outscoring louisv Vol by seven so far in the second half they have the deficit down to seven mlet one of the best scorers in the West Coast Conference and now more Mallette lets it rip front iron louville continues to do a really good job on the defensive boards now they have to get a good shot got a great shot the hoop and the horm Huntley Hatfield to the Applause line now this is a pretty tough shot by Huntley hfield but a nice job to cut to the basket find the open area now that little flip over the head thats not the easiest shot in the world but Huntley Hatfield did a nice job getting to an open space and thats a basket that Louis will badly needed and Huntley Hatfield another double double if he can be a big factor inside I think that really helps Louis hes had some nice games Dan 119 against Texas 149 against Virginia Tech 20 and 11 on Wednesday night had a 14 rebound performance against Chattanooga earlier this season and Hunley haffield has a double double again here today with 12 and 10 foul on Mike James Music Mallette drives cut off looking for help turnover poked away white pushing it up Court great ball movement open three Clark couldnt make him pay from that left corner guys good work active defense another turnover behind the back white jamed it Applause home thats really good job in transition defense you missed that three that youre able to get the steel and come back and theyve built the lead back to 12 the love that goes in into a Subaru comes out when Subaru and our retailers

12 this situation where sky Clark missed the threepoint shot but didnt hang his head he got back on defense and created the steal maybe didnt need to throw that pass behind his back but it all works out just fine and thats a tremendous fast break opportunity but again the whole thing was set up by Clark who missed the three got back on defense got the steal white with eight and the Cardinals defense has forced 11 turnovers Dan theyve turned them into 12 points really good defense in their domination of the offensive boards those two things have been the keys to this game fade away no Huntley Hatfield rebound number 11 and there again theres an opportunity where the defense collapsed they didnt let aay get all the way to the basket and the result is they come down the court and get an easy win themselves Clark to Huntley Hatfields its a 7 Run for the Cardinals what a great response by Louisville the league got cut to seven and theyve blown it back out again Hunley Hatfield has 14 and 11 former fivestar recruit having himself yet another nice afternoon great defense once again for the Cardinals and a really good job securing the defensive rebound Williams yes from way

well individuality often complicates things Red Bull gives you Music wings its been a 10 Run for the Cardinals over the last two minutes and change theyve hit their last three shots but whats going to make Kenny Payne happier Dan a 3minute scoring drought for pepper dine so offensively getting it done and defensively they have held the waves well in pepperdines last six possessions since they cut the lead to seven theyre old for four shooting theyve shot contested shots theyve turned it over twice and that contributed to that 100 run how about that move from Porter Javon Porter first game of the season 611 sophomore well everybody talks about how skilled this young man is and this is a nice job really a great move to keep his pivot foot and spin back toward the basket and thats Lorenzo roars got to be over there licking his chops that when Porter gets completely healthy they have him back in the lineup on a regular basis no doubt top 100 kid out of high school fourstar recruit averaged 12 and seven last season before missing time with an injury now a charge on white well white white is a slasher and he did that a little bit too hard Huntley Hatfield I wonder if hes got a back problem or something but hes worked pretty hard today I dont think he needs any extra on the sideline major Difference Maker when hes been in the game for Louisville Porter three ball rattles out rebounds there for the Cardinals it was Music Glenn nice jumper there from Williams who continues his strong afternoon hes into double figures a new career high Williams is a guy who comes into this game averaging fewer than three points a game Anderson cant hit the three Glenn looked to be shaken up grabbing his face in the eye area jaw area well I think he took a pop but I think it was friendly fire he gets in the lane Glenn number 10 and its Williams who smacked him in the face so Williams has been aggressive all the way around he has you cant commit a flagrant on your own player can you thats not thats not possible Huntley Hatfield back in the game good sign for Louisville as is a COR for James Williams has the hot hands have a day young man 19point advantage and 13 for Curtis Williams he made five threes coming into this game hes made three in this in this afternoons contest blocked out of bounds and Williams shoots these threes like with more confidence than maybe a guy who comes in shooting five for 19 should have but thats what Shooters do they shoot the ball and they dont worry about what their shooting percentage is theyre just anxious to let it go and he has been very productive today thats thats another piece of good news for Louisville Kenny Payne told us today we need Curtis Williams to be good for this team especially when he plays within the flow of the offense hes done that this Music afternoon three ball not there for more and Louisville up 19 9 minutes and change to play they continue to do the cards to control their own defensive boards Huntley Hatfield is fouled hell go to the line for two more he has been a load to deal with for kabali in the waves down low he Hunley Hatfield has done a great job moving without the ball and that time he just got great position he got so far under the basket that kabali really had no choice but to reach around and fou him knocks down the first free throw in its a great freshman class that Kenny Payne brought in Back to the youngsters as you see Huntley Hatfield in the day hes had second double double of the season but Dan four players in the top 100 brought in by Kenny paint and theyve all contributed in various forms this season Curtis Williams having a Breakout game here today great effort forces the jump ball and thatll be another offensive rebound for Louisville well again it takes time to develop your players it takes time to fit all the pieces together and as Ive said before its not always going to go smoothly there will be ups and downs James muscles his way in just too strong 22point advantage Porter how about the skill set on this kid well we said he made 34 threes last year thought shot 35 from out there and you just cant defend the three that set screen the same way with Porter in the game you see Williams the confidence he has on that drive in the dish as Huntley Hatfield back to the line and Williams in that freshman class number six overall recruiting class took a hit when Trenton FL the festar decided to go to Australia instead of playing this season with the Cardinals but they figured it out and Dan youve talked about it it does take time you have to continue to give a coach some time to be able to build his culture his foundation and get his guys that he recruited into his program and into his system oh again theres this is a very this is a very tough place a very demanding fan base a tremendous tradition here at Louisville and its not always easy to be patient 20 point Advantage nice drive and finish from Anderson very little of that before in this earlier in this game Louisville for the most part has done a nice job keeping Pepperdine out of the lane Huntley Hatfield left it short Coral to Zone Miss and he is lived at the free throw line here in the second half Cardinals little energy boost in control over Applause Music Music pepperon Music buddies I present to you the Kerwin frost box Ill take that y buddies lets get that

these ones round no I dont know maybe a Red Bull will help you see it from a different slant yes I got it well build it like this perfect Red Bull gives you Music wings an 18point Louisville lead a lot of it on the shoulders of this guy right here he he has scored 16 points back to the basket play cuts to the basket following the driver tips it in screen and roll okay dunk we can do it that way too and again finds the open spot after one of his teammates drives catches the ball and lays it in again he has really done everything you want your big guy to do you can see was 12 14 from the free throw line its only 47 today which is you know a down game for him from the line hes a really good free throw shooter comes in at almost 76 but hes got those 16 points hes got 12 rebounds hes got two block shots hes got two assists cant ask for much more from your big guy than that Dan its a conference full of great big men right of course Bott at North Carolina PJ Hall at Clemson but Hunley haffield has a chance to emerge as one of the better big men here in the ACC this season well certainly if he plays the way he played tonight hell be a candidate for Applause that here he is again double team came kicked it out Williams tried the no look pass and back to the big man alyu ball a little too tall for white now get going a little too fast right there Porter no from the wing Glenn lays it up and score check that James lays it up Mike James has had himself quite in afternoon now with 17 well lots of times when you miss the three you get that long rebound its the same as a turnover Louisville made him pay for it at a careerhigh 25 points against UNBC in the season opener for Louisville did James turnover for thats really good defense here he is Showtime timeout taken by Lorenzo RAR and Dan it has been defense to offense here for the Cardinals well the last time it was a long threepoint Miss but that time its again the defense collapses I think that was Anderson on the inside he just had no place to go tries to kick it out and Louisvilles in great defensive position their defensive rotations have been very solid today here Anderson gets inside James comes to help the balls kicked out Williams is ready for it and James has already taken off the game as Ive said before is a lot easier when the ball goes in the basket and when you get this kind of opportunity the ball goes in the basket a lot L wolves hit eight of its last nine shots and you look at the second half today and this is going to be much better for Kenny Paynes group a young team that has shot the ball well here in this second stands up in the final 20 minutes we have 27 field goals and 16 assists in in those 27 field goals and we showed you earlier that on the season they were only assisting on 41 of their baskets which is a very low number but that hasnt been a problem today Kenny Payne talked about how they have to share the ball better and move the ball better and theyve certainly done that this afternoon Im talking to Mark Andis of ESPN radio over there in Louisville this week just trying to get a gauge of what things are like for Cardinal fans and he said when makes it even tough ER in this whole scenario is Kenny Payne is one of us hes a national champion here with the Cardinals and people are rooting for former players when he got the job and certainly this is a big step in the right direction for the Cardinals because theres a very big game coming against Kentucky on the 21st on Thursday night one that usually divides families and households thatll be a a really big step for Kenny Payne in his tenure you just have to get your team to play well and they have played well today now the question becomes can they do it consistently and can they do it against the kind of opponent that Kentucky will represent Kentucky you know they beat North Carolina yesterday they have some big wins theyre currently playing like one of the top teams in the country that is a very very Steep Hill for Louisville to climb Dan no doubt theyre going to need this guy to play very well on Thursday night Huntley Hatfields who has gone up against Kentucky in his career during his time for Rick Barnes in Tennessee and you see whats upcoming it is a murderers row as it usually is in the ACC doesnt get easier youve got the five games there three of them are against ranked teams and that that pit team has some big wins that is another excellent basketball team how about the J coach capable is done over there in Steel City well he didnt get it off the ground right away either Pits program was in a tough way and Jeff cable they gave him enough time to get it going and they he has rewarded them his players have rewarded the Pittsburgh Administration for their patience just takes a while sometimes oh what a crossover Johnson Tyler Johnson put him on skates well thats way its gone for Louisville today they take it after the kind of difficulties that theyve Applause had Cardinal fans love them some Tyler Johnson the top 100 recruit Kenny Payne said hes a small guy who plays big and is fearless his second consecutive start of his career and protects the basketball well going to be important as will this kid Curtis Williams the Breakout game of his young career The Freshman from Detroit and we talked about the fact that Louisville is not a very good threepoint shooting team theyve knocked down eight threes today in 15 attempts youll take that every game and one for aay but here is tyar Johnson highlight real play Dan well he gets himself its a nice job dribbling the ball to get back beyond the threepoint line and keep in mind that Tyler Johnson before that shot was 5 for 24 from Beyond the threepoint arc on the season he had Mich play with a lot of confidence no doubt and you you mention it when shots are falling theres just a different aura about basketball teams and it spreads down the bench in the roster

bell of Louisville on the Ohio River well Louisville steam boating Pepperdine here by 30 and it has been just what the doctor ordered for Kenny pay shots are falling theyve played good defense and a game looming against Kentucky on Thursday night this is a a step in the right direction for the young Cardinals theyve shot the ball very well theyve dominated the backboards they forced turnovers Im not sure that at this point this Louisville team can play much better than theyve played Applause today hits a pair of free throws hes got 17 and five weve had a lot of fun here on acc Network today AR mudi Dan boner our entire crew from the m center Glenn one of those heralded freshman he scores from the right block again they continue to get the ball inside Glenn big strong kid just muscles it inside coach Payne son xan pay in the game right now for Louisville as well there he is 23 shaken up took a pop in the face for theing number five Huntley Huntley Hatfields afternoon is done and he gets a round of applause from the Cardinals faithful well he tied his career high with 20 had 12 rebounds so has the double doubley one and as we mentioned before hes got a couple assists hes got a couple of blocks only committed one personal foul so played really good defense without Music Applause fouling kabali hits the front end Dan Kenny pay told us today we dont want to leave it to interpretation from the outside on if this team is playing hard and scrapping and clawing what has impressed you most about the Cardinals here this afternoon well Louisville came out and played with great intensity and when you play with that great intensity and the shots start going in the basket it just builds your confidence and your intensity doesnt Wan the most impressive thing I thought was early in the second half when pepperine came back and cut it to seven points you wondered what Louisvilles response would be well their response was to tighten up on the defense they forced a couple of turnovers they were on a 10 run and put the game Out Of Reach trit Whites into double figures for the 10th time on the year and white is a guy weve said before hes more of a scorer than he is a shooter and thats just a really nice job to get inside the defense to keep your pivot foot he rebounds well for his position this is his seventh game on the year with at least six rebounds that triple is good for Malik Music Applause Moore not a lot of offense for the waves today travel over 2000 miles as Glenn couldnt convert the layup couple of time zones they got into town a day earlier than usual to try and acclimate to that time zone difference it is 1100 am start time over in Malibu where Pepperdine is not a bad deal go College in Malibu huh no have you been to the campus Dan I have never been to the campus I have seen pictures of it and it looks beautiful I was there over the summer visiting California it is gorgeous as Aiden MC comes into the game it is truly it is like going to college on a resort unbelievable over there for lenzo RAR and paper dine now both teams bringing in some deep reserves and getting into their Applause depth now play has become a little bit sloppy here stanburg played earlier actually made a basket earlier in the Applause game Stanberry hits the first as Louisville again we we look ahead to the game against Kentucky on Thursday night that is going to be the next real opportunity for Kenny pay and these Cardinals for a marquee win on the season Dan theyve played well against some of the bigger names on their schedule Texas Indiana Virginia Tech they have competed at a high level in all three of those games now theyre going to have to compete at a very high level against Kentucky but I think shoot the ball like this they can stay in the game against anybody no doubt Kentucky looked very good against Carolina yesterday in Atlanta and thats a pretty good North Carolina team and at Kentucky you know theyre playing a lot of young kids its scary to think about what they might become if they continue to improve like that kdo kid quite a bit young North Carina North Carolinas got a talented team theyre just still putting the pieces together I think theyre going to improve as the season goes along as well you know they had a chance at the end of that game a very unfortunate turnover took away any shot they had and maybe tying it up there at the Applause end well on this afternoon Louisville flexes its muscles its been a crazy week for the Cardinals for Coach Kenny Payne but for 40 minutes of basketball they took care of business against pepper Dy and the biggest game of their season upcoming on Thursday final few seconds take off and Louisville fifth win of the Year surpasses last seasons total and the
