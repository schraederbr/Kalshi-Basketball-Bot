been something and between Mike gray and Tony Bennett it goes back to the days of coach Bennett when he was at Washington State and we are underway the Cavaliers with the basketball first in their home whites and on what is expected to be a big day for Kihei Clark hes got the basketball first Armand Franklin gets it back out to a wide open Ben vanderplas it rattles out on him and the rebound by The Freshman JJ Starling will dribble it up Im honestly surprised that shot did not go in two hours per game Bennett vanderplas was out getting shots up and I know youre thinking to yourself why was I here that early they were serving food but he was knocking down shots early in this game shocked to not see that one go down but vanderplas is going to get a number of great looks now youre here doing sports center hits talking NBA talking college hoops we are in the midst of it February is turning into March shortly as we take a look at the starting five for the whos very familiar faces all across the board Clark and Beekman tremendous pesky backcourt 12 combination they also rack up the assist but not there on the mislayup by Jaden Gardner normally won a gardner finishes off God has scored over 2 000 points throughout his career over a thousand rebounds he doesnt miss many easy ones like that now former East Carolina Pirates spent three years at ECU leski Off the Mark rebound vanderplas for Virginia its been a big change the last several weeks having Van Der plaus start and a much diminished role in a reserve role for Kaden Shedrick how do you think that has gone and evolved for UVA Corey well its its benefited Virginia on the offensive end and we talked about the fact that they havent been scoring as much over the past five games but yet when you have been a band Applause on the floor he is a floor spacer and theres another guy that youve got to be account for knocking down three balls and opens up opportunities for Kia Clark for Reese Beekman to be able to get into the painted area because theres just more space in the middle of the floor when youve got Vander Plus on the floor so vanderplas is making his 10th consecutive start on the flip side though shedricks role in the last nine games off the bench including a dnps only averaging 10 minutes a game and less than two points and two rebounds a game hes still an excellent shot blocker but whats his role going forward Corey Virginias going to need Cadence Cedric moving forward no question about it youve got so many quality bigs that youll play against in the ACC and of course moving forward into the NCAA tournament he will be very much needed for his team to be successful with the shot clock at three cormack Ryan buries the jumper and its interesting we talked with Mike gray pregame he talked about how his team just seems to be so much looser on the road and theyve actually played better and been more competitive in row games than they have at home and they certainly were competitive the last time out Tuesday at Cameron Indoor Stadium losing a tight one against the Blue Devils Reese Beekman on the board for UVA and thats an encouraging sign for Virginia Reese Beekman did not make a field goal in their game Wednesday at Louisville two of 17 in the last two games so to see him get on the board early has to be an encouraging sign for Tony Bennett yeah the Wahoos survived that game against Louisville 6158 on Wednesday using a 120 run late in the first half to build a lead that they were able to for the most part maintain the rest of the ball game no surprise shot clock again down and jumping into the passing Lane as Reese beatman for his first steal the trail three is missed by Armon Franklin I would have loved to have seen Reece Beekman attack the basket it really was a oneonone scenario early in the year he would take those has been a little hesitant as of late in attacking the rim and finishing good looking stroke in the midrange by Marcus Hammond the grad transfer from Niagara nice pull up by him again into the midrange as you mentioned and of course doing it against one of the better arm ball Defenders that youll see in college basketball he was twotime firstteam all Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference with the Niagara purple Eagles averaged over 18 A game A year ago so he can fill it up heres Beekman Catch and Release long rebound fought for Gardner and Les schewski tied up and the possession arrow will go the other way and theres Mike gray 23rd year as head coach at Notre Dame and as we talked to him this morning Corey it hit me since he left DeMatha as an assistant under the Hall of Famer Morgan Wooten hes had only three stops of course he was a long time assistant under Coach K at Duke and then the fiveyear run as head coach at Delaware and then 23 years in South Bend IN that profession college basketball coaching to stay in only three places over that long a period of time it says something about you it absolutely does it says a lot about Mike gray and of course if you ever have an opportunity to sit down and talk with Mike gray take advantage of it one of the best conversations you will ever have is so much so that Coach K actually came to his first college basketball game because Mike gray was there and thats the benefits I was expecting to see after getting up shots two hours early today coming out knocking down the three ball first three for the grad transfer from Ripon Wisconsin and I notice you keep calling him Bennett I assume most of the audience understands why but its worth telling again you can tell it feel free his given name is Bennett after Tony Bennetts father who was the coach at Green Bay back when vanderposts father was teammates with Tony Bennett and I always say Bennett to pay respect to of course Dick Bennett the great coach Bennett his Dane Goodwin drops it off to Lubin the block the defense on one end for Virginia and then Reese Beekman finding Bennett band Applause whos good for three the University of Virginia the seventh ranked Cavaliers with the early lead over Notre Dame and head coach Tony Bennett has made his name Nationwide on defense his teams between Washington State and here at Virginia have led the NCAA in scoring defense seven times as he has a few words for Kaden Shedrick coming into the ball game now for UVA and a sparkling record again this year Corey at 204 overall and their four losses were against very good opponents absolutely no bad losses for Virginia this year but Doug one of the amazing things when you look at this staff for Tony Bennett Virginia has won 12 or more ACC games for these six consecutive season wow and when you look at the losses for Virginia the Houston game was the only loss theyve had at home this season but on the road at Miami at Pittsburgh and at Virginia Tech all very difficult places to play and of course Miami and Pittsburgh both at the top of the ACC along with the whos this season and in a more recent run I saw a stat a week or two ago that actually Miami has the most conference wins of anybody over the last what was it three years no that is over the last 3738 games so two years plus yes when you when you really look at the numbers and you go back the last 10 seasons outside of Duke no one even compares to what Virginia has done within the conference in ACC basketball no question Miamis had a great stretch over the past two seasons but when you think about Oak sustained Excellence youve got to think about whats happened in Charlottesville over the last no question I wasnt looking to diminish or put Miami on a parallel I was just saying oftentimes the the country thinks ACC is Duke and Carolina but clearly thats not been the case in more recent times than what coach Bennett has done is nothing short of remarkable here in Charlottesville and you cant forget about Florida State right but while those other programs have dipped here and there they have not done that at all here at UVA well we have another full afternoon of college basketball today on ESPN in the app number five Kansas hosts number nine Baylor in a Sonic Blockbuster at four Eastern 3 Central and then Syracuse will host Duke its another great day of Hoops I believe there will be some special tributes to our god Dickey V at your alma mater this evening I would hope so anywhere dick goes its party it absolutely is that and of course you know we get to do what we do because of Dicky B he made our jobs very popular always thankful to be able to share airspace with the goat well those there will be two people in the dome tonight who are instrumental in the growth of college basketball on ESPN of course talking about Jim Boeheim as well Kihei Clark with his first made field goal a young man who has been very instrumental in the growth of this Virginia basketball program when you think about that Kihei Clark continues to shatter records throughout the program well Kihei is the career leader in games played in minutes played now the winningest player in ACC history and today can pass John Crotty for the alltime assist record in Virginia basketball history and John protti is in the building here this afternoon and we plan to have him join us on the broadcast later today and by starting this game Kihei actually broke the career record in starts for UVA I love that move right there normally he could get by most cars is he send straight words in a circle finding Franklin in the corner unable to knock it down but kieh Clark has a its almost like a Smitty you know the Steve Smith move thats so famous but he sets guys up and so hes so quick that you think that hes going to turn his back and just goes right papi Kane Goodwin picks up where he left off but Cameron the other night a completely different look for Dane Goodman the last shot he took on the opposite corner he hit the top of the backboard with that one this one was all bottom of the net his season High 25 at Duke on Tuesday his first three here averaging over 12 per game Beekman off the nice feed from Clark and whose back court is clicking early here in Charlottesville and Kihei Clark with the assist Applause closer and closer to the John Crotty record he has now tied the alltime record again with all these records we do have to mention that its in his fifth year of course after an air ball on his first three finds the ring thats one of the things Virginia is going to have to be very careful of throughout this game Notre Dame averages nine threepoint field goals made per game second in the ACC they can shoot the basketball and Nate lasheski when he gets his looks and absolutely take advantage of it Shedrick out to vanderplas thought about it working on Matt Zona Franklin from the corner got Applause it you start talking about threepoint field goals you can also look at Virginia who was at the top of the league from a percentage standpoint shooting 38 from three so the whos definitely capable of knocking down big shots from Beyond The Arc especially in this building yeah the Hoosier four of nine on three so far today Notre Dame three of six 1713 Virginia with the early lead is Kihei Clark kicks it out again the next assist for Clark will set a Virginia record Beekman off the front iron rebounded by Trey wurtz III that is Langston Wertz III and hell dribble up I like the aggressiveness Im seeing from Reese Beekman early in this game hes not looking to be passive hes actually looking to score Virginia needs him to be more of a force on the offensive end and hes approached this game the right way well theyre the top two in the league he and Clark can assist the turnover ratio they are number two and three in assists per game behind Tyree Appleby of Wake Forest this is a tremendous backcourt on both ends of the floor for Virginia it absolutely is that as is Dane Goodwin playing tremendous basketball throughout his recent stretch off to a good start five points for him already in this and oh by the way Dane Goodwin is playing in his Notre Dame career record 153rd game same number for Kihei Clark for UVA Franklin short Zona got a hand on it here comes cormack Ryan for the Fighting Irish Applause so here is the tying assist as Kihei Clark draws even in career helpers with John Crotty who is in the building and will join us when we come back Music the first time you made a sale online was also the first time you heard of a town division welcome back everybody John Paul Jones Arena 1715 our score Virginia and were pleased to be joined by John Crotty who for the moment as John joins us you share the alltime career record and assist Kihei Clark one away from moving past you welcome what do you think about when youre watching one of your records go down oh look its its mixed emotions uh its an incredible timing first of all amazing to be back here uh this is my first game back uh after all these years of having played and graduated in 91 but you know having an MBA job I dont get back often so its amazing that its all come together here and I get to come back and and see this its a its a record that Ive taken great pride in holding but Ill tell you Kia has been a great player for for Virginia winning a championship um doing things the right way the way he competes every single night and just you know the person that he is off the court Im Im always rooting for him so its its bittersweet you know I I look I I really appreciated holding the record but Im really happy that this is the quality guy that has an opportunity to break it and very well deserving hes got the ball in his hands now and could do it any moment well as one of my big brothers I get to brag on you so now we think about this you has 683 assists in four years Kihei Clark and congratulations to him for tying the record and you know when he breaks it which is going to happen the most likely tonight as Reese Beekman has a nice finish great to see him getting some of his explosion back but kiheis Ash his record will have a asterisk beside it that is according to me that is also according to Tony Bennett Ive talked with coach Bennett about that earlier today it takes nothing away from Kihei but the fact that hes had the extra time to be able to break all these records has to be acknowledged so now when you think about your time at the University of Virginia and now you look back your first time back tell me a little bit about the program that youve seen Tony Bennett built over the past 14 season just awesome amazing Corey what hes done and great to have you here too man its awesome to have another guy who who played here and excelled at such a high level but you know Tony to me has just created that stability and hes built on on such an incredible program of of guys who are coming and getting it done and doing it the right way competing hard I mean when you look at those banners there and what hes been able to accomplish year in year out I mean to me hes one of the top two three college coaches uh you know in the game today and and the quality of person he is I think he teaches these young guys you know how to act and get ready after after college so I think hes done an amazing job and look this team competes every year right I mean theyre theyre in it their defense their hardnosed every year thats going to keep you in it and when they can get the shooting going they can play and beat anybody absolutely and of course youre working with the Miami Heat now after a very long 10year playing in the NBA and Tony Bennett told us a story about you earlier today at rookie transition Tony it goes and gets on the bike to get some extra work in before everyone gets going he looks out the window and theres a guy outside running Sprints that happened to be you you had that mentality you always had to be the hardest worker God mentality right yeah I look thats how I did it that was how I was able to stick around for 10 11 years and and you know compete at that level and you know how hard it is its its razor thin margins of you know athleticism and and execution but man being a mentally tough player and someone that you know brought it every night was what I in myself in and um its amazing seeing Tony and thinking about you know another point guard he was weve played against each other for about three years when he was in Charlotte and you know how its come full circle hes basketball circles are very small right if you stick around long enough youre like Kevin Bacon you got six degrees to everybody well when we learned that you were going to join us today I wanted to ask a couple of the other former Virginia guards about your legacy and well talk about that when we come back as the man to my right John trotty is about to go to number two on the alltime assist list stay with us were gonna have a little fun about some of the best point guards in Uva history people one of them to my right John Crotty part of the 1000500 assist list and there have been some great point guards who have played in this program Ive got two of them with me along with John Crotty of course Corey Alexander whose name does not appear on this list not enough games my guy only 85 games throughout my career half of what Kihei Clark will end up throughout his career so I will not be on that list but uh fortunate to be a part of a great fraternity of you know Big Time UVA point guards and I followed this guy to my left right he left and left a spot for me to walk right into and play my God Dougie fresh the other Dougie fresh Doug Smith wasnt too happy about that but um you know had the opportunity to come in and you know replace John of course and you know really kind of follow up on a legacy that he had created along with many others before me and you know Barry Parkhill was the first of the great Virginia guards back in the early 70s 1972 ACC player of the year and he still works for the University as an assistant athletic director and I asked him yesterday John about you and the first thing he said was you are the most underrated who in program history he thinks so highly of what you did here again as you reflect back what do you think most about your time in the early 90s playing for Virginia well look the the time that era of ACC basketball was outstanding um it was you know a conference where youd consistently play Home and Away against everybody on the point guards that you played against every night no matter what the school were high level guys that you know a lot of them went on to play at an NBA level so for me it really helped raise my game and create an amazing competition night out so I remember the rivalries a lot and I remember the great um you know camaraderie we had as a team coach Terry Holland uh Dave Odom who is an assistant Jeff Jones who wound up being an assistant and taking over my last year so you know a lot of positive memories of my teammates and Brian Stith of course whose jerseys retired here and um you know we we were very competitive we always gave it everything we had out there and I think we represented the school well all right so whos the best point guard in program history you can go ahead and tell me no ones listening Jim at least you and me tell me theres a lot of good guys a lot of good players and you know I think that speaks to you know Corey being able to play at the highest level and I remember watching Sean Singletary I thought he was one I love the way he could score the basketball um you know Id like for Donna how Donald had competed to um you know my my thing and looking back on on my thing was just Virginia gave me such a great platform to develop myself I mean I I had to do more with that team those teams I had to score more than if I went to a Carolina or something like that and I think it actually helped me become a better allaround player and ultimately a better professional and helped you stay in the NBA for a very long time we had our battles of course the San Antonio Utah Jazz days and of course a number of times with running into you when you were in Miami so throughout the league and you were able to get there as you you continue to you know could be that guy that went out and worked the lunch pail guy worked harder outwork everyone on the floor so now one of the things that theyve asked me to do is to give my list of the greatest point guards in Uva history all right so Im going to start it with this at number five you look up you see the 44 in the in the bands Sean Singletary hes my number five okay at number four Im going with Harold Dean okay very good who had a great career and it may be even more underrated than crotch yeah I agree at number three Im going with tajarone won a national championship here was all ACC and number two Im going with my guy John Crotty Jerseys finest there you go and number two and of course the best point guard to ever play at the University of Virginia scoring over 2 000 points and over 750 assists Dawn Staley is number one and that will never ever change it will always be the top point guard to ever have played at the University hes wondering where he was going he started ripping off ripping off the stats Music agree what a Lego see she left here and now she still continues to coach him up at South Carolina I mean to change that program and team and do what shes doing what shes done at South Carolina is amazing and of course you were here with her for three years I was here with one how many times did you look at dawn and say I dont know if I could actually do that yeah which he just did on the floor so quick and fast and with the basketball uh you know really to me ahead of her time in regards to the way she was able to break people down off the deck and you know played uh from Philly played with that edge that a lot of those players have coming coming from Philadelphia uh just a great competitive for Mac Ryan beats the buzzer but misses the shot again the Virginia Defense clamping down I talked to Anthony Solomon last night at Notre Dames shoot around hes another former Virginia guard whos on staff with Mike Ray and he said if youre talking about the greatest point guards in program history youve got to mention othell Wilson two final four teams in the early 80s as well maybe hes not the first you list but hes also in that conversation thats a great Point those were great teams back then too and the final four runs and Coach Holland and Ralph Sampson and get to see Rick Carlisle too from time to time as he coaches in the association and he was involved in one of those final fours yeah Odell Wilson was definitely one of the guys that I watched of course while I was in high school I was watching JC do his thing and again weve talked about you know the lineage of point guard play and again it will culminate right now with Kihei Clark at the point to when he breaks the record of being the alltime leader in assists even though there will be a axis beside it props to Kihei for what he has been able to accomplish yet but the one thing that I will say that Kihei has done that none of us were able to do he won a national championship he sure did he always will be part of that list no matter what and again Ive said it time and time again and of course I loved you but Kihei is my favorite point guard of all time to watch at the University of Virginia look he is he is a great winner I think thats a thats an incredible Legacy to have in that lets never forget that pass he made to d d Katie right when uh that game looked like it was over and he was such a young player playing on a big stage um Kia was and made the right plays at the right time to lead that team yeah coach Bennett was talking to us this morning about that pass and about kiheis role on that team he said he was the perfect player he was the perfect player on that team as the Freshman to help with the older guys and he talked about kiheis heart that for five years hes benefited from the fact that Kihei has as big a heart as anybody yeah I agree and just his ability to be even killed to me and have great composure at a young age which is hard to do when youre playing in a league thats this intense and at that high a level to come in with that kind of maturity AC one of 23 active NCAA Championship winning players winding down a marvelous career wed like to thank John Crotty for joining us what a treat for us to a couple of uvas great point guards of all time thank you I appreciate you having Music TJ right after this we have a really good Sunday afternoon college basketball double header on ESPN in the app we start with turquavion Smith the number 23 NC State hosting Armando bacon North Carolina in one Eastern then its number two Houston led by Marcus Sasser hosting Kendrick Davis in Memphis which is on Joe linardis bubble so big games all around with just over two weeks remaining in the regular season with Corey Alexander Im Doug Sherman you and I will be in Raleigh for that Carolina NC State game Joe lunardi is going to join us and according to his metrics Carolina is now on the wrong side of the bubble they are the first team out as we began play today so in his estimation Carolinas got to win four of its last five regular season games and then probably do a little damage in the ACC tournament if they dont want to miss out on the field of 68 well a disappointing loss for North Carolina on Monday night and when you consider you know a mini grin against a very good Miami team not to say that Miami couldnt beat them but its North Carolina has been very good on their home floor throughout this season and so taking that loss really put dampers on the NCAA tournament chances in comparison to coming up with what would have been a huge win three ball by Isaac McNeely misses Virginia on a 103 run broken by that shot by cormack Ryan the Irish had been struggling over the last nine minutes thats just their second made field goal in that time and a confident shot by Cormac Ryan this is a young man who has put up big numbers especially on the road you go back to him scoring 28 at Duke a couple seasons ago and pretty much taking over that game and with a shot like that I will be looking with the best basketball in my hands to get another one soon yeah he made eight straight shots in that game it was quite a show that unfortunately for him he could not replicate earlier this week but you see cornback Ryan now encouraging his team not only the threepointer but the nicest system the chess who gets the layup and just like thats a fourpoint game between these two teams and the great Hands by comeback line on the turnover knocks it away from Kihei Clark the normally shorthanded point guard for Virginia final minute of this first half and a foul on the entry pass that went out of bounds you can see a look on Kihei Clarks face a little frustration after committing the turnover and theres what Joey brackets has at the moment Virginia hes not sure they can get up to the two line of course it depends on what else goes around but they have put together an extremely solid resume this year Corey well and Im not sure why they cant get up to the two line when you think about their losses outside of Virginia Tech theyve lost to teams who at the top of the country and top of the league you think about the Miami laws of Pittsburgh loss both on the road and Virginia Tech on the road and you lose to a Houston team in this building none of those losses are bad losses and so itd be interesting to see if Virginia continues and wins the ACC and goes on to wins HD tournament I would expect to see them and day too OluKai golf is for those who prefer to walk the course Virginia 29 Notre Dame 23 the seventh ranked Cavaliers looking to keep pace the top of the standings in the Atlantic Coast Conference with just a couple of weeks remaining in the regular season meanwhile for Mike Ray and the Fighting Irish is two and 13 in League Play they have played mostly close ball games but youre judged by your win loss record theyre looking to just take it one game at a time and try to build some momentum heading to Greensboro for the ACC tournament but looking for a bucket here to build some momentum going into the half to see if they can make this game a little bit closer Marcus Hammond beats his man off the bounce and lays it in with two seconds one second and there is a little momentum for the Irish heading into the locker room the Irish closed the half in a good fashion you think about going back line knocking down the three to lay it by leszewski and of course the last layup to make it a fourpoint game halftime at jpj Music but I do believe that that record will be eclipsed throughout this game and Kihei Clark will be the alltime assist leader at the University of Virginia by time this ones finished now Clark and the Cavaliers come into play today with a share of first place in the ACC standings trying to keep pace and stay ahead of the pack around them Dane Goodwin getting the start in the second half missing on the turnaround Applause Goodwin Ryan and JJ Starling the starting five for the Fighting Irish Franklin had a quiet first half inside the van der Pauls who finds the cutting Gardner who had it roll out and I can count that that is at least the third easy layup that Virginia has missed throughout this game we saw Jaden Gardner miss one early Bennett vanderplas off a nice move to the basket missed a layup and then to start the second half another normally sure bucket for Virginia coming away with without any points a gardner played only eight minutes in the first half because of a couple of fouls that quarry was only a second field goal attempt of the day Ryan off the catch and shoot he stays hot to start the second half and this is the leader for the fighting Iris Cormac Ryan is the guy hes their vocal leader hes the guy that gets them going and right now hes come out with a nice bounce to a step here to start the second half threetime captain of the Fighting Irish out of New York City just over a minute in here at John Paul Jones Arena Applause Park tough pass star darling knocked it away second turnover kie a Clark rare to see him turn to basketball over as mentioned in the first half Beekman is best in the league and assist a turnover ratio Kihei is number two they combined three to one assisted turnover ratio and again they hit it done at both ends they take care of the ball they take the ball away its an unbelievable combination they absolutely are that in my opinion I believe they are the best back for it in the ACC when you consider what they do offensively as well as defensively but of course a lot of competition in Miami with both Nigel pack and Isaiah Wong in that group youve got of course jacquel Joyner and jaquavion Smith and what should be the best back for in the ACC residing in Chapel Hill with RJ Davis and Caleb love but right now my opinion I think Kihei and Reese are at the top of the list with a pair of free throws Notre Dame is on an 112 run from the first half to the second half and were tied at 29 Virginias largest lead was nine and now trying to retake that lead vanderplas with a bad pass into the backcourt and its another UVA turnover not a great start for Virginia in this second half two turnovers and a missed layup and now Notre Dame with the opportunity to take the lead and youve got to remember this Notre Dame team the more confidence they build and Mike Ray told us they are a better team believe it or not on the road theyve been more competitive and Nate lasheski feels like he has an advantage attacking benevaneplus off the bounce the second time hes done it and the second time this resulted in two points and Corey this is Notre Dames largest lead of the afternoon the Run continues Clark and theres the first Bucket from Gardner and more importantly that is a new alltime assist Mark for Kihei Clark at the University of Virginia and prematurely and again this was not by Design but theres confetti falling from the ceiling now its left over confetti from a concert here at jpj but its been so much of it falling and it happens to fall right when Kihei Clark drops off the recordbreaking assist to Jaden Gardner so the officials will spend some time cleaning the confetti up off of the floor my guy Ronnie Weidman before UVA comes out and catches a piece with his clipboard but stopping the time for the crowd here to acknowledge Kihei Clark for coming to alltime assist leader with 684 assists and as they celebrate him on the Jumbotron the crowd at jpj comes to its feet celebrating number zero in white under recruited originally committed to stay out west at UC Davis got a late offer from Tony Bennett he flipped and the rest is history five years of brilliant basketball here in Charlottesville I am not going to allow you to butcher that story that way because thats not the way it happened Tony Bennett did not offer Kihei Clark when he was committed Kihei Clark decommitted at peach jam after winning a peace Jam Championship once he decommitted then Tony Bennett offered him a scholarship Tony Bennett is not unethical to do something like that thank you thank you but I stand corrected I just dont want anyone thinking that Tony Bennett is going out offering guys who already committed to go to other places Clark put on a absolute show at peach jam I believe that was in 2017 and he was spectacular and after that he knew his recruiting would pick up significantly he commits and off ultimately ends up here and starts when the national championship team and makes one of the biggest plays in Virginia basketball history your new nickname may be the butcher by the way there is Kihei Gardner in offensive rebound by the way Notre Dame still has no offensive rebounds for the ball game which is really something even though they are last in the league in that category yeah they still averaged over six offensive rebounds per game but Virginia not giving them many opportunities as JJ Starling gets a good look just unable to finish it Clark to a streaking Beekman little hesitation Cormac Ryan defended it well but Franklin kept playing takes the bounce pass and throws it down and lets go dunk it I can respect that Omar Franklin coming in making sure there will be no doubt left after he comes off the rim tough shot Beekman clears the glass dribbles up himself with numbers cut off by Goodwin whos going to be called for the blocking foul Applause Virginia playing a bit faster Kihei Clark getting out on The Fast Break finding Reese Beekman who attacks the basket and then of course Armon Franklin continues to run and finishes with authority making sure there will be no mislayup on this trip off the nonshooting foul Beekman gets it back denied by lasheski plenty of time on the shot clock Music Gardner spins Baseline Goodwin fighting he was touching the basketball though while he was laying on the end line no change in possession so the shot clock remains at 12 UVA basketball theres Kihei the southern Californian and again you say in your eyes Kihei is your favorite he is my personal favorite yes my personal favorite point guard here I just can appreciate the way that hes attacked the game the way that hes you know carried himself throughout his five years at the University of Virginia and the fact that hes been a such a winner Isaac McNeely soaring Above the Rim but he couldnt finish and another missed opportunity as Dan Goodwin attacks at fonts for Matt Ryan surprise Ryan didnt pull up a three on that possession Virginia has missed its last eight from long distance but look at the mismatch right now Nathan PA Clark guarding Nate masheski Notre Dame figures it out but it should open up a good look good win cash is in just as you say Corey well thats great offense by the Fighting Irish when you recognize you got a seven footer with a five nine guy guarding him get him the basketball forcing forcing Virginia to double team its going to open up an opportunity for someone on the perimeter that someone happens to be Dane Goodman who knocks it down and that is our seventh lead change of the game Franklin makes it eight leads changes putting the whos back right and the dunk has gotten up on Franklin going now and hes starting to pick it up on the offensive end of the floor and for Virginia to be successful theyre going to need to have Franklin and Gardner both firing on the offensive side of the floor Applause Hammond with a tough turnaround make that tray worse exclu excuse me and words gets it back manzona getting more run here in the second half for the Irish Works going to work along the Baseline and rarely do you see guys beating Kihei Clark off the dribble but that time Trey works with a nice move in shielding Kihei with the body to be able to get the easy layup Applause John Crotty in the building to watch his record be broken by Kihei Clark now John Crotty number two Kihei Clark number one on the alltime list for assists as he drops it off to Jade Gardner for number 684 Music giving number seven Virginia a ball game here at John Paul Jones Arena Fighting Irish finding the range led by once again today Dane Goodwin he was so good off the bench in the second half especially last time out against Duke and hes been doing it here theres Trey wurtz along the Baseline as well the Irish can score the basketball they absolutely could score the basketball this is a very good offensive team and you think about the fact that there are six graduate students on this Notre Dame team this is not the way that they had envisioned their season going but at the same time one of the things that Mike Bray wants to make sure he gets across to his team is lets finish this the right way there are still people watching their eyes upon this program a very proud program traditionally and lets finish it up the right way and again Mike gray is stepping away from Notre Dame I dont think this is the last time were going to see Mike gray on a sideline this is one of the best coaches in the game and again I think its just a time for a change of scenery with the Fighting Irish but I would love to see Mike gray continue to coach although I could see him on a beach with a cigar for a few months no that is that is absolutely an opportunity for him as well and you talk about a guy who really just takes in the environment his name mashewski knocks down the midrange to tie the game once again Mike Bray told us about he was walking down through the downtown mall here in Charlottesville yesterday a nice night out last night and his team is having a optional shoot around but he goes into a gospel concert on the downtown mall and sticks around for the concert and takes a picture and sends it to of course fellow coach Leonard Hamilton who owns a gospel recording label and uh he he made it very clear that there was some juice going on in the gospel concert last night I just finished reading Mike Brays book keeping it Loose hes still keeping it he does that youre talking about the only coach that I can remember showing up with shorts on yes to go along with a uh a polo shirt to coach a game two seasons ago at North Carolina Goodwin gets the roll once again tied at 40 a piece and now these two teams trading buckets and of course this favors Notre Dame if they can continue to find something on the offensive end that Virginia has difficulty guarding thats a plus for the Fighting Irish because we have seen Virginia go through those scoring lulls and Notre Dame has always struggled to defend throughout this season wurtz uses the screen from Zona Ryan gives it back to works Applause Franklin and McNeely in the backcourt right now heres Beekman as well working from the high post area boy Gardner has put together a remarkable career he joined the 2000 Point Club opening night against North Carolina Central and grabbed his 1 000th career rebound against Syracuse Corey he and Trace Jackson Davis of Indiana the only two players currently active in college hoops with 2 000 points and 1 000 rebounds Jayden Gardner has been a great not good a great college basketball player third Team all ACC a season to go and again for Virginia to be successful and get to the heights they want to get to this year theyre going to have to follow him on the interior as they score for three off the off the from Gardner Applause Gardener shots like that that started the season for Virginia and as they come to the end of the regular season hes starting to pick it right back up Liberty Mutual in Wake County North Carolina Jaden Gardners been able to get Buckets he also gets to the free throw line a lot weve gotten a taste of that here this afternoon Corey we absolutely have Jayden Gardner missed the majority of the first half with those two fouls but it has been Ultra aggressive here in this second half just the way to Virginia needs him to be to be successful and you look at the Twos Company you mentioned early the only two active division one players with over 2 000 points and 1 000 rebounds Jaden Gardner Trey Jackson Davis only one difference between the two though Dougie fresh Jackson Davis has done it in four and again it doesnt take away from Jayden Gardner but there does need to be an asterisk beside the records beside the books that the guys had the opportunity to play another season liszewski with another offensive Rebound in the stick back the Irish back to within three lasheski now with 15 points and Virginias done a great job throughout this game of not giving up those offensive rebounds and just like that Notre Dame starting to flex his muscle on the glass and coming up with Second Chance points should mention that in only three years at East Carolina Gardner Remains the eighth alltime leading scorer in Pirates history I mean he has really had one heck of a career in two stops I believe if Jayden Gardner had stayed at East Carolina he would have shattered every record available to him throughout his time there but Im sure there are many Virginia fans happy to see him wearing white here tonight no doubt hes been on a roll lately for the whos last six games shooting 53 percent averaging 156 rebounds a game hes got eight points eight boards so far today Zona teeing it up we dont see enough of Matt Zona really for me to say that he has that in his repertoire or not he shot it confidently so Im sure he can make the reason but Im not sure if thats the shot they were looking for him at that moment well he had one in the first half is only of the year now one for four on the season Franklin with the layup Goodwin turned down the corner three instead brings it back outside 9 36 remaining in the second half Notre Dame with the basketball down by five and you mentioned Dan Goodman turning it down thats much to the dismay of Mike gray who has won it thank Goodman to be more aggressive take more shots he turns that one down but it works out for Trey work so he attacks the basket gets to the free throw line and an opportunity to make this a one possession game thank you mama can we get a puppy mom please girls pets are a big expense maybe try switching your car insurance to Progressive you could save hundreds thanks TV dad well think about it okay look what I found it listen to your TV dad drivers who switch and save with progressives save nearly 700 on average I have moderate to severe Crohns disease now theres Skyridge Virginia Cavaliers did you just say campus its still a campus its not you can call it whatever you want its a college you call whatever you want but you cant call it whatever you want while youre here oh I cant and I just did here on the grounds there you go and you cant say freshman sophomore junior senior first year second year third year fourth year you can save freshman sophomore junior senior when it comes to basketball or Sports all right and Academia it is first second third and fourth year as Trey Works does not allow for bacon here as you hear the booze ring out at jpj yeah free baking for everybody if somebody on the opposing team misses consecutive free throw so the two loudest cheers weve heard in the building so far today was that one with bacon on the line and at halftime for the baby race the baby race was awesome Place erupted by the baby race baby number seven went to work and it was the great move by dad total blowout but the great move by dad to roll the car keys to Mom baby number seven who already had a huge lead took off race was over and I was walking off the court with one of the uh forlorn fathers trying to talk up his baby who came in woefully off the pace now weve got another piece of confetti thats just fall into the floor so now again youve done some research Corey that confettis been up there since when February the 5th and shout out to Kate English for letting us know that it was a journey and Toto journey and Toto concert here at jpj which is of course is a great concert venue and the confetti is left over from this so appreciate Kate looking out for us no doubt making us look intelligent Hammond with the turnaround yeah Toto big hit Africa was a big song in the Sherman household back in the day okay great concert Carrie Underwoods going to be here in this building on Friday night I heard that on the radio last night once again great concert venue Applause vanderplas thought about it could close out by lusheski Kihei thark feeds Franklin and a foul is called against Goodwin who says he went straight up but Pat Driscoll says no its personal foul number three great cut by Franklin I saw that one coming new Kihei was going to throw him that one about five seconds before it happened and when youre playing with the alltime assist King in Virginia basketball history you better be ready for that pass coming your way he passed John Crotty earlier here this afternoon for that Mark and so now here is Franklin playing through a broken nose had it taped up last time out no tape today and he gets the bounce looking ahead at Notre Dames matchup next Saturday check that weve got a college basketball double header coming up on ESPN in the app that is fantastic number nine Baylor number five Kansas a Sonic Blockbuster four Eastern three Central then Syracuse hosting Duke at the Dome its another great day of Hoops over on ESPN Baylor Kansas the last two national champions of course the national champion prior to that we are calling right now the Virginia Cavaliers with no you guys yeah exactly tournament in 2020 Virginia was able to hold the Reigns for two seasons Kihei Clark with the takeaway under eight minutes to go whos up by four and now theyll pull it out and work some clock look for a good shot Ryan Dunn is back on the floor for Virginia the one thing Virginia has not been able to do they have not really been able to separate themselves from Notre Dame throughout this game and it really hasnt been because of the offense its been about the defense Clark missed the shot and then the foul is called well take a break with 7 41 remaining got a good ball game his number seven Virginia gets pushed theres number seven finding mom way ahead of the rest of the field and this was an absolute blowout when you get an opportunity to see the baby race no balance there unlike the balance scoring that weve seen from Virginia throughout this game I see what you did there Hey listen Im not you being educated for nothing my man you look at the Virginia scoring balance our mom Franklin with 12 points Reese Beekman whos LED Virginia and field goal attempts today with 11 Kihei Clark with 10 Jaden Cartner will be the next who most likely in double figures Bennett vandiplas with only five and both all his points came in the first half but Virginias been thats been a recipe for the whos this season they have had balance scoring when theyre normally successful to make it to where no team can really key on one guy they dont have a guy in the top 20 in the ACC is scoring but they have four guys averaging close to or over double figure all right Cory I got a in the armor for your alma mater here for all the good things weve said about the whos theyre not a good freethrow shooting team Kihei Clark just one of two on that trip they are 10 for 13 today but the reality is theyre next to last in the ACC at only 70 percent and thats one of the things you know when I walk through jpj and Im talking to many of the Alum here and people who were around many many years ago to watch me play basketball they ask hey can you go out there and make some free throws for us well one no because I actually wasnt a great freethrow shooter in college so Im not going to call it I know you know I was a low 70s mid 70s guy yeah I was a much better freethrow shooter in the NBA but also youve got to play defensive play for Tony Bennett and I am not about that level of Defense so youre saying coming out of Oak Hill if coach Bennett was the head coach here at Virginia you might not have offered you because he knew you wouldnt defend for him um Im not going to say that I believe he would have offered me but I also believe he knows that I wouldnt play the type of defense that he wants me to play so Im not sure how much he would have recruited works misfires from the corner nice rebound by Armon Franklin at 64 200 one of the grown men out on the floor grabbing what was uh now the 12th Miss Ed from the threepoint line in their last 15 shots for the Irish and now Gardner with a mismatch kicks it out to vanderplas a nice look ends up being the right play I initially thought that Gardner without the double team should have gone to work on Cormac Ryan but Jaden Gardner makes the right decision and now vanderplas is eight points two away from being a fifth guy in double figures luccheski gets him right back Nate lasheski having a big game hes now got 18 points to lead the Fighting Irish and luceski had 16 against Virginia a year ago where Notre Dame was able to beat the whos in South Bend so hes found some success against Virginia over the past couple of seasons and in the last month as Kihei misses badly on the three lasheski has had some brilliant shooting games January 21st 7 of 9 29 points against Boston College and then earlier this month against Virginia Tech he put 33 on the Hokies six of nine from distance and Nate luceski over his last four games averaging 24 and a half points per game so hes been playing great basketball as of late and if you know today right now you may want to see if you can get him a couple more looks theres words followed by Clark that is number one on the Virginia point guard come back Ryan just going pick and pop with Nate lasheski lacheski finding that corner and no hesitation from the cheski knocking down the three ball mashewski from way downtown not that time dont mind it you know you got a guy whos shooting the basketball well hes playing with confidence hes hot dont mind him taking that shot at all expect Ed vanderplas and leszewski with another rebound keeping the Fighting Irish right there down five of the basketball under five to play Applause then when trying to back down on Reese Beekman rising up weve seen him do it time and time again at Notre Dame you knew what he drove it from that right wing exactly where he was going no help from Virginia and youre basically playing oneonone 35 and Up Style Dan Goodman backing down Reese Beekman and going over the top of score Applause Music Applause Franklin drives on lasheski turns shoots no good stand defensively by Notre Dame it absolutely was a great job by Nate liszewski after getting knocked off his line coming back to contest that shot a chance for the tie zewski missed it got a good look though and he has been hot a great look at Tony Bennett not happy about the look that Nate liszewski was able to get Applause Virginias trying to protect its space atop the ACC standings came into the day tied with Pittsburgh for first but being pushed to the max Kihei Clark the drive its back to a fivepoint game talking to Tony Bennett pregame one thing that he told us of the many things that hes loved about Kihei Clark its his big play Big Shot mentality hes not a guy that takes a lot of shots but he makes and takes a lot of big shots three minutes to go good one over Gardner no Beekman with the weak side rebound Applause Music Applause trying to work on luccheski goes around him missed it Gardner missed on the tip in lachesky tips it out here comes cormack Ryan Irish down five Applause Hammond takes the contact puts it up and in timeout Notre Dame Notre Dame one possession away right now trailing by three in Charlottesville looking for their first win ever in Charlottesville and weve got two guys going at it in their fight to the Finish Dane Goodwin and Kihei Clark both with big baskets and both have played over 150 games in college no stranger to tight finishes Music Virginia 55 Notre Dame 52 the whos trying to keep Pace with Pittsburgh and the others at the top of the ACC standings and Virginia continues to excel in ACC play another opportunity for a regular season Championship which is of course no rare feat for Tony Bennett and his Club but seeing Pittsburgh at the top of the ACC you have to smile be happy for Jeff Capel his staff of course Timo too Jason came from Milan Brown they have done a great job throughout this season and right now Virginia and Pittsburgh along with Miami have been the class of the ACC this season and by the way Pittsburgh plays later tonight five oclock on acc Network at Virginia Tech Miami meanwhile is home against Wake Forest coming up at the top of the hour and you can see that on acc Network extra Bart misses the shot lachesky clears the rebound Applause Notre Dame has been here time and again on the road in a tight ball game but is yet to win a true Road game Corey this season and yet to win ever Applause in Charlottesville so a couple of records right here on the line for Mike gray in his final visit to Virginia as the head coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish third foul on vanderplas with five on the shot clock which resets now to 20 again their last four true Road games Notre Dame has lost by four at Duke lost by two at Georgia Tech lost by three at North Carolina State and lost by five at Syracuse and they theyre used to playing close games but right now Mike gray wants to see if they can win a close game and a great chance for him them again a top 10 team here at jpj today lasheski off the nice screen and roll could not finish and with just over a minute to go UVA will walk it up thank you Clark sheds the defender doesnt shoot instead brings it back out to vanderplas Applause to shoot here goes Clark to work kick to the corner Beekman got to put it up on the runner no Irish rebound 35 seconds in regulation if youre Notre Dame you dont mind a quick three if you get a good look at it on this possession they didnt get it Virginia got back defensively Hammond draws the foul on Clark and will head to the line to shoot two best possible scenario outside of knocking down a three for Notre Dame is getting to the freethrow line opportunity to put points on the board more importantly set their defense see if Mike gray goes with some full court pressure right here to try to speed up Virginia and get it turnover before you commit the foul only a 62 percent foul shooter Hammond Conley knocks down the first out of Cardozo high school hes from Queens New York and hes got a big second free throw upcoming down two Zona will come back for Notre Dame replacing Hammond who just made a pair of huge free throws and now Mike Bray going to call the timeout and discuss how he wants to go about the pressure on Virginia trailing by one see if they can get a turnover Virginia basketball if youre the Cavaliers what are you doing if youre the Irish what do you do well for Virginia you want to have been a band Applause taking the basketball out of bounds hes not the best freethrow shooter within this group and you want to get the basketball into the hands of Reese Beekman or Kihei Clark but the problem with getting the last one has a Kia Clarke as a smaller guard a trap affects him differently than it does free Speakman so if right now if Im Tony Bennett I want Reese Beekman with the basketball if youre Notre Dame you want to try the Trap and foul if you have to yeah beekmans your best free throw shooter if youre Virginia they get it into Gardner who is only a 65 foul shooter but its a nonshooting foul thats the 16 foul on the Irish now again if youre Virginia I think youd want to get it into beekmans hands you absolutely do it with the thing with both these teams neither of them foul much so youre going to have to keep fouling to get into the bonus and that should be the foul that puts them into the bones but you have to file kieh Clark who hasnt shot free throws great down the stretch here recently but hes a guy thats been to the line and been this position so often Tony Bennett is comfortable with him being there yeah 75 percent on the areas four for six today Music Ryan Dunn will come back in replacing vanderplas either way the Fighting Irish should get the basketball back with a chance to at least tie big first free throw Clark will get the bonus nicely done for number zero in white 15 points for the fifth year senior but its still not of utmost importance right now for Notre Dame to get the three they can take the quick two and play it the same way works good one for the tie no Gardner has the rebound for Virginia and he is foul the Irish have made only four of their last 18 threepoint shots Corey and Virginia stepping up getting the job done defensively again Tony Bennett substitute and getting Ryan Dunn in the game and Dunn makes a strong defensive stand putting the hand up contesting Dane Goodwin not allowing him to have a good look resulting in a missed opportunity for Notre Dame well when you need to get a shot late in a game Virginias not the defense you want to be staring at but still opportunity for Notre Dame down three doors open and the foul is committed by Gardner before Wertz could get off a shot so well have a one and one I love the strategy it was a great foul by Jayden Gardner right there and of course it was done intentionally he knew exactly what he was making happen on that possession to not allow Notre Dame to get a good look at the three and still only 39 seconds remaining difficult to get multiple possessions at this point and I never understand Corey in those situations why a coach wouldnt foul well theres always the risk of making the first one and then executing your lot for the to get the tip out on the second free throw right here so now again if theres a way for Notre Dame in which Mike Bray is going to draw up right now to miss tip it out a threepointer beats you now and thats oftentimes why many coaches dont go that route because the worst thing that can happen if a team does make a three is Utah and go to overtime which you would much prefer that in comparison to making the first free throw tip out a three beat shoot and you walk off losing a game that you were winning up three so late Music well we have a really good Sunday afternoon college basketball doubleheader on ESPN and the app well start with turquavion Smith and number 23 North Carolina State hosting Armando baycat and North Carolina thats at one Eastern and then its number two Houston led by Marcus Sasser hosting Kendrick Davis and Memphis right there on Joe linardis bubble big games all around with just over two weeks left in the college basketball regular season Music so how do you go about a good Miss free throw that you can then rebound and get a shot off to either tie or potentially win it here well these would be the equivalent to special teams in football these are situations that coaches practice oftentimes at the end of their practices but what you want to be able to do of course you got two guys on offense who are not going to be on the on the free throw line so when you think about it youre going to want someone from one side to immediately Sprint over so they scream or the big on the other side Miss and find a way to either tip it in and tie the game or tap it out to one of your guys beyond the threepoint Arc to get a look at a shot that can beat Virginia here on this floor and this is not a good offensive rebounding Notre Dame team words at the line lasheski and Zona are the two Irish bigs along the sides of the lane just two offensive rebounds as a team for Notre Dame today words no back to works Goodwin for the win couldnt make it and Virginia survives that is why many coaches dont choose to foul it worked it worked Notre Dame got exactly what they wanted just unable to make the shot but if that shot
