the Blue Devils Bert Smith AJ Desi and Eric Lewis on the whistle here at Cameron and away we go and seon James a transfer from tane whos from Sugar Hill Georgia gets us started here is the Freshman flag the Up and Under on shoot and its two nothing dke and heres a little pressure offered by John shs team and through the back court heres one of the Freshman this is Ben Hammond from Fairfax Virginia who is of late averaging about three assist to ball game and pretty good shooter from behind the line headed to the 10day break for the hes the hokes need to hang on to the ball and theyve got to make shots obviously Migel potit the first offer to the rack and he is fouled on the play and its on Cooper flag itll be his first first foul of the ball game and that will put potit the GR transfer from Rice whos from nearby Reedville North Carolina to the free throw line at Applause 71 were just underway at Cameron indor Stadium its great to have you with us with Dan Bon West Durham game two of our ACC Network double header number four Duke in Virginia Tech here at Cameron Indoor Stadium and despite the students being on holiday break Full House on hand as meijel potit ties the ball game with a couple of free throws Cooper flag scored up and under on the blue Devils first possession and then drew a foul and potite knocked down the free throws and your all caught up just like that proor on the drive and too strong last up by malat Virginia Tech is very good in their mantoman defense they do a great job limiting dribble penetration and Duke really likes to initiate their offense with some screens and some dribble penetration so you watch Virginia TR tech try to force them to the perimeter Dan the Hokies have had a hard time with turnovers and Duke sensing a little bit of that I think with pressure here too absolutely you see you watch for Virginia Tech play on tape and they have struggled with the press in certain games L for shoot heres the Freshman Hammond back out front for shoot but qu the ball ises with under 10 seconds on the shot clock yep on the drive this is Tyler Johnson had it blocked malw seon James in transition skips kiple three ball rimed off potit the rebound now you wont try youll see Virginia Tech trying to push it up every time they dont mind getting down the court quickly but they do not want to get in a track meet with Duke today poti high post malawat hedging him defensively now Hammond back for Jaden shoots Triple A back rim Miss and lewow gives the hookes an offensive chance and stepped out of bounds as he reverse dribble back into the paint and a turnover for the hokes and of course Mike young now in his sixth season at blackburg 97 wins in blackburg 396 in just a marvelous coaching career that dates 23 years Applause kiple double team there flag nice quick look thre it off the glass trying to get it to malok James the deflection Proctor tes up a three malawat kept it alive briefly Johnson collects the rebound for Virginia Tech now Johnson is an outstanding athlete a big strong kid playing the guard spot whos a a really good Applause rebounder freshman from Orlando is Tyler Johnson and that ball got knocked away Sho had it lost it kiple with the turnover turnover number two on the hokes and the L from malat ill timed and last Touch by the hokes and John shy of course in his third season has won 76 of his games fastest coach in Duke history to 60 wins Dan you and I were talking earlier today he has done an exceptional job job in following the legendary Mike shashki you know they always say you want to follow the guy who follows the guy who follows the legend but John Shire doing a great job on his own reaching foul I mean theres Mike Shi yep coach Ks here today A reach in knock away no foul call good seats too coach Applause nice in the corner why hes there on the front row so he couldnt get in these seats if he had to sit in the bleachers somewhere 3 minutes and change gone in the opening half Hammond inside potit oh what a collision at The Rim maloks rejection kiple thought about it oh malok shouldnt couldnt hang on now the Hoke tried to flip the floor shoot off the Hammond screen I thought Ben Hammond might pull the trigger there instead for Virginia Tech will settle in now this is one of the things that John sh was talking about temperament of the offense by Virginia Tech poti has it rattle out and heres Duke on the attack were still 22 and almost four minutes in Blue Devils are one of four the hokes 0 for three and can nipple to miss rebound flag down malawat off the glass maybe slightly out of his character well a little bit I mean all he does is dunk it but that thats his fourth threepoint attempt of the year and hes actually made one yeah so heres Hammond off the ball screen of potit inside feeds lall for the dunk so Toby La 58 field goal shooter averaging almost 11 a game to lead the hokes pushes Virginia Tech in front hes really good around the goal but that was a great job by Hammond to draw two Defenders and leave lall alone Quick Pass flag the catch dunk and foul on the wow Cooper Flags got all four Duke points nice look from seon James Blue Devils with a chance to take the lead when we come Music back we were just laughing about malawat shooting that long three in transition sometimes maybe your best idea is to throw an inside to flag now Cooper flag five Virginia Tech 4 as we play on here at Cameron great to have you with us and happy New Year by the way substitution Rodney Brown Jr a sophomore transfer from Cal into the Hoke lineup he wears number four Patrick wesler hes number five and thats Brandon re Steiner who draws the foul Bert Smith tickets Malik Brown with his first thatll be the second on the blue dos there is brown by the way who up until a tough day against St Joes had been averaging about 12 points a game in the previous two for Mike young you can really see the Blue Devils are trying to apply a lot of pressure y to the ball they brought Caleb Foster on the floor with Malik Brown during the timeout heres Rex Steiner back for his sophomore campaign in blackburg theres a catch and shoot from Jaden Sho and Virginia Tech is a very dangerous team when making make threes you know this weve talked about Mike young in his great coaching career this team at Virginia Tech it is the worst team hes had in terms of assists per game and its the worst team hes had in terms of turnovers per game and so if youre a team that sort of controls the tempo and shoots threes you cant be given the ball away look at kiple kicked to the corner Proctor missed the three shoot the rebound for the hokus Rex Steiner shot fake from Jaden shoot how about another one spins out and ultimately flag kept it alive what a great job by flag I mean he could feel himself falling out of bounds but he waited until a teammate was open and then just handed him the ball missed the three wesler kept it alive for the hok now of all the things that flag does well at this point in his career hes only a 25 threepoint Applause shooter Rex Steiner with can nipple Defender the hokeys really have the floor spread yep tend to shoot heres Brown Jaden shoot a triple and missed everything that might have been a little quick in the rotation so Proctor will check out for the Blue Devils Mike Youngs going to hustle and see if he cant get Jaden young into the ball game and the reason hes doing that as you see number three in the white right there for the Blue Devils there is Isaiah Evans the 66 freshman from fville who can flat shoot it well I I swear I saw him up in the hallway before the game and he was getting ready to shoot so thats what he does he comes in the game and hes ready to let it go yep heres flag alone drops it Applause in there is such a smooth flow to the game of Connor flag its its just amazing yep already all eight of Dukes points belong to the Freshman from Newport Maine heres Brown and now theres Burnham whos checked into lineup Ben Burnham for the first time for the hookies hes a transfer from Charleston and a foul called and its on Cooper flag itll be his second wow we talked about how flag struggles sometimes shooting the three but this time hes going to come up to the top of the key gets his feet set gets Square to the basket and knocks it down now as you mentioned he just picked up his second foul you dont really need to go for the steel right there you can get the Trap and force the guy to give up the ball there oh save by Brown and burnam somehow collect and then goes baby Skyhook for his first point well Brown was trying to he stole it he was trying to bounce it off somebody and went right back to the Hoke yeah Malik Browns a walking defensive play Dan oh there heres Evans this is going up rattle around rebounded inside and Gillis from in front the Purdue transfer from Newcastle Indiana Mason Gillis pushes Duke back in front game starting to feel a little bit more like the blue Devils flavor Tempo wise I think with almost 8 minutes gone first half Jaden young a three Caleb Foster the rebound Brown for seon Applause James now Evans off the top ski into the corner Foster heres James back for Isaiah Evans nope and boy nicely done hoks got Rodney Brown to keep it alive this game is being played with tremendous intensity on both s hookies there I mean here again theyre 40 ft from the basket and the clock is under 10 seconds Rodney Brown now against Malik brown spot up three got it okay what do I know yeah stay up top there boner I got my 73 wow wow Rodney Brown on the board with his seventh triple of the year in Virginia TCH to Point Advantage Malik Brown seon James Baseline I do not know that there is a more valuable threepoint per game scorer in all of college basketball than Malik Brown yeah he really sees the court he passes the ball well hes everywhere defensively Mike young called him a master deflector today theres a soft runner for the basket Rodney Brown warming up hes got five in a row Brown has really started to come on he had some had some setbacks injurywise in the pre season uh before you know in in practice preseason practice and that set him back but he has kept fighting and he is gradually now making big contributions to the Hoke oh it sure is I mean 66 he weighs 185 lbs Evans five to shoot Caleb Foster on the initiative Baseline missed everything thing cleaned up Gillis again hes fouled by wesler as the shot clock went off so Patrick wesler draws his first thats the second on the hokes were going to go to a timeout just ahead of 10 minutes to play in this first half Virginia Tech by two uro Music previous play is under review to see whether the shot occurred before the or the fou occurred before the expiration of time the call on the floor has been confirmed on Virginia Tech number five Duke will shoot two free throws when were your Zoom play Music sh Music Mike shashy the head coach after Bill Foster the head coach before Bill Foster Bucky Waters now Neil mahe was in inter room for one year 197374 but Bucky Waters Bucky one of the great Personalities in the history of the ACC y for years was an analyst on acc Jefferson pilot package the only the only question I have about Bucky was his ability to evaluate talent because he actually recruited me well then then we do have questions four points for Gillis after the free throws malat after the brown Miss couldnt squeeze the trigger hokis and blue Devils tied heres potit oh he left it Le the hammer to No Surprise Toby Les got two field goals both on dunks and its also not a surprise with malyra poti thats his 16 assist on the season for a big guy he passes the ball pretty well heres James from the corner three and last Touch by the Blue Devils the Blue Devils now one for 10 from Beyond The Arc Hammond does a great job maintaining his pivot foot and the Duke defense just a little slow getting back yep malow watcha can see him in the background running up the court and thats the reason they had that wide open opportunity inside 611 freshman Patrick gangba has checked in from Manasses Virginia averaging about 11 minutes of ball game for Coach shy he wears jersey number 21 proor has returned with canle in the Duke lineup so Gillis and James round out the five on the floor for John shock Hammond weaving through traffic up off the glass and got his own rebound this is a very good offensive rebounding team in Virginia Tech although Hammond isnt one of their top offensive rebound yeah Brown potit young L whos got it in the corner working against Gillis double team coming Hammond thought about it and almost turned it over heres leow and a foul called on Toby low as a shove out there to chase the loose ball second on lewow third on Virginia Tech comes with 826 to go in the first half Duke has struggled on the offensive end but their defense has so far been very disruptive for the hokes yep its the hokei defense thats keeping them in the game they we talked about the fact they wanted to cut off the middle and force Duke to shoot threes thats exactly whats happened neither team has shot the ball very well Duke is at 31 and Virginia Tech at 40 theyve hit one more field goal theres a long Miss by the blue doubles proor now off the reset flag with the two fouls for three and add one 11 for flag and a shot at the rear fourpoint play this is one of those situations where if youre poti you go out there and you put your hand up but you dont jump into him that you see that play all the time go to one side or the other or stop before you get there but if you jump toward the shooter youre almost always going to run into him before he comes back down on the court and thats a foul so here is flag you see four of five from the floor four for the 11 two threes in the bucket as well rest of the team two of 13 for six points and Cooper to the line after the foul on potit and the free throw good a dozen of Dukes 16 or 18 rather and back to a twopoint lead on the fourpoint trip Hammond working against James good job by gunga to help out on the Trap and last Touch by Hammond Ben Hammond Dan the list is long and distinguished of young guards that have come in this building and dribbled right into a trap and a turnover ensued Duke will have it when we come back Music Des Paul the six program in Northern Virginia oh boy Dan happens to every young guard doesnt it wow its a great play by Proctor because Hammond dribbled out of one double team and he dribbled right into another one because Proctor jumped off his man and got him John sh course loves it at the Duke bench and Mike young knows the the turnover problems the hokes have had and last couple of years Dan probably a little heavier than he anticipated I think wow this year in particular I mean his team does a great job hanging on to the basketball they do a great job passing the basketball and that those two areas have been points of weakness at times for his team this year so theyre still trying to work on that and Duke is one of the best defensive team team in the country flag will fall away and another one for Cooper flag largest lead for the Blue Devils and flag now with 14 he is five for six on the floor two of three from behind the line and thrown away by potit and theres an unforced error just as were talking about turnovers there we see turnover number five and as I say theyve actually done a really good job so far today hanging onto the ball but theyve turned it over two consecutive times you see the number nationally 324 there goes Proctor on the drive and a foul will be called I think this is on potit and thatll be two on Migel potit five on Virginia Tech just ahead of s minutes to go in this first half and thats a great job by Proctor West to pass up the three duke has been shooting a lot of them in transition and he passed it up and he drove it right to the basket yep proor at the line and and the first one is good now I want to tell you a week from Saturday we got a heavy lineup for you on acc Network Florida State at Clemson at 200 presented by food line Dan and I will be in Raleigh at the Lenovo center for the Tar Heels in the woolpack and then late night so to speak actually 300 Pacific Time 6 Eastern the hes and the Golden Bears from hos Pavilion in Berkeley were going to get to see Mark matsons golden bearss next Saturday night at Clemson Dan and I are looking forward to seeing Cal in some of their early play of course they played just one conference game so far tomorrow there at pit 2216 in the corner Johnson now with eight to shoot thought about it bumps it down Burnham the catch score nicely done Ben Burnham second field goal that was great Patience by Johnson and Burnham bails him out cuz Burnham kept moving yep fourpoint lead for the Blue Devils Gung B front against wesler heres flag on the catch kiple straight away first points for the Milwaukee rookie KH kiple now if theyre going to do that what are you supposed to do you try to bring another guy to flag and he kicks it out and kiple shoots a three Applause yep thus three and a half assist a game too for Cooper flag Dan Fall Away Johnson flag a rebound well the two leading assist guys on this team are flag and canle yeah theres a lot gunga couldnt handle it on the attempt from James so heres what youre talking about right they run another guy down there and theres the kick out you saw shot come over what happened canle Reiner rotating got to get there right waso had to drop down inside because Wexler left his guy gunga inside and so shoot had to rotate over so they didnt dump it down and that left kiple all alone like I say what are you supposed to do ask for a six guy waiver right lead is seven under six to go and the Blue Devils offer some back court pressure here and this is brown who gave him some nice minutes in an earlier sequence of the half he really helped them with their ball handling Rex Steiner Brown wesler and Jaden young with Burnham but they just cant get into any of their offensive stuff early enough in the shot clock to force pressure on the Duke defense eight to shoot heres Rodney Brown Rex Steiner three ball to strong can nipple the rebound now if youre Mike young youll take that shot every time K nipple back for Evans strong with the three Brown kept it alive flag in the corner Evans tees up another one sure so time slim has got a triple the lead its largest for the Blue Devils 2818 Music 10point lead for number four Duke here just ahead of five minutes to go and Cooper flag leaves the Blue Devils in scoring and Dannys pretty good Distributing well look at that I mean hes got 14 points in the game hes all alone and yet he throws the ball down to the corner passes up his shot Im not sure it was a better one but its a really good threepoint shooter letting it go that is really an unselfish play Isaiah Evans 23rd three of the year for the Freshman from fville North Carolina who went to North Mech last year in the Charlotte area averaged 28 points a game and had 62 in the state playoffs to break Chris Paul state record for points in a game wow and brown the master deflector its exactly what Mike young was talking about his ability to deflect the ball not necessarily steal it but put the ball back in play for somebody but when you deflect the ball it disrupts the Applause offense backourt pressure and heres Rex Steiner Brandon averaging just less than eight a ball game in his sophomore campaign Burnham the catch and Fires for three wesler had it Evans ripped it away here goes proor kiple three away nope front rim missing Brown collects didnt really have his feet set Rodney Brown a little hesitation in CER will be ticketed for his first thatll be the fourth on the Blue Devils Dukes defensive pressure against the ball has been really good that last time down the court there was a switch and Wexler was mismatched inside against Proctor but the hokes could never find it yeah flag out Mason Gillis in invariably the conversation is more people watch the Blue Devils play in conference play Dan is going to be about where does this Duke team defensively fall in now we got a long way to go before the story is finished right or even maybe we started in chapter but Id say theyre off to a really good start at that end of the floor I was impressed with the way John Shire was talking to us today how he said yeah yeah I know that our stats and numbers are really good but I think we get a lot better defensively that is a scary idea yeah because the one thing that is going to happen and you can see it happen in sequences here in this first half is where they are offensively theres a kick and burnam left for three and Caleb Foster gathers the rebound and now thats the kind of a shot that Virginia Tech wants Gillis will try and hit ninth three of the year for Mason Gillis hes got seven Off the Bench he has started very slowly from three this year as well he and Foster both and you know theyre going to get better as the season goes on and we get a foul out the midcourt area another look at the exchange that duks into the floor and Duke gets down the court very quickly and thats not a fast break but thats in Applause transition when youre getting back youre trying to defend the basket your opponent in this case Proctor makes a crosscourt pass and you just cant get close enough to Gill Ste put any pressure nice pass inside wesler and one nice delivery of the ball by Rodney Brown Patrick Wesley the field goal hell shoot a free throw and the Blue Devils posting this 13point lead Virginia Tech five turnovers Dan but Dukes got eight points off the five as you see flag to the bench and Patrick wesler will shoot free throws after the foul a moment ago on Mason Gillis threepoint free throw left on the rim here Virginia Tech trying to apply a little bit of pressure mhm theyve got brown Burnham Hammond Jaden young and wesler on the floor and theres a three that rimmed away for Tyrese proor now 48 on the season of Dukes field goal attempts are threes so they dont mind shooting the three now is going to be on Comm malawat thatll be his first six now on the Blue Devils I think thats an seven thats seven Im sorry Dan free throws I think its an indication of the kind of pressure Duke is trying to put on the ball normally you want well even now you trying to put pressure on you dont want your Center out there beyond the top of the key picking up cheaper yep first points for Applause wesler wesler showed you hes got pretty good hands inside he can score close to the goal second one is also good by the way he only played a half dozen ACC games a year ago 13 games overall about 4 minutes a game so hes essentially freshman right in terms of game experience Mal watch could not hang on to the L thats a couple of times now Wes weve seen him not be able to hang on to that ball there goes young feeds wesler again try to Burrow under against malat hoki ski it to the perimeter for young Brown off the screen nice pass back for wesler couldnt finish got his own rebound Hammond a step in to got it Ben Hammonds first bucket that was a nice shot by Hammond but the whole thing is created by wesler and his battling inside yep sevenpoint lead for the Blue Devils inside three to Applause go flag kiple and James come back to the scores table to check in for the Blue Devils on the next dead ball Gill couldnt handle the bounce pass from Foster it might have been a little low and Away turned over by the Duke no matter who you are when youre coming into this building what you want to do is you want to at least stay within Striking Distance and thats exactly what Virginia Tech has done they have forced Duke into some very poor shooting and they havent shot the ball well either but they have really withstood a lot of the Duke defensive pressure only five turnovers as you said and thats less than half of what they have on the season Duke just committed their sixth down and heres Hammond Jaden shoots come back on the floor for the Applause hes hell work against kiple Duke makes it really difficult for you because they switch everything yep Brown nice all the way down took the contact couldnt finish it and now Browns going to commit a foul trying to compete with Proctor thatll be the first on Rodney Brown Jr from Paris Cali who started his college career at Cal and then decided to get in the transfer portal theres some portals that are different than others the 2300 mile porter portal is one that Im curious about he went from Berkeley or actually Paris California to blackburg Virginia is 2300 miles but he stayed in the ACC thank you I knew I could set up my man tonight for that on the drive James lost it last touch AJ Desa says it belongs to Virginia Tech Bert Smith going to help and itll stay with the blue de well I think Burnham was standing out of bounds when the ball hit him Im not sure that buron was able to get out of the way but it looked like wesler was the guy who touched it last anyway and Applause they will put the ball in play on the Baseline with seon James flag against burn all the way in scoop cant finish second Miss of the day for flag that was a tough shot yep five to shoot Proctor dancing gets all the way to the basket wow four for proor how about that just when you think youve got him contained there he goes yep first field goal hed hit two free throws earlier in the frame lead nine feels like a pretty big 75 seconds here for the hokes brown off his foot nope guess not cuz it stays with the Hokies two to shoot and thoul thrown away with one on the shot clock six turnover on Virginia TCH and heres a look at the proctor Drive well he just goes right by Wexler re wesler reaches out and sort of gets in the Rex Steiners way and theres no help there yep ninepoint lead tried to go to flag kiple recovered his own throwaway James proor a Music three James the rebound and the stick back Second Chance points for seion James how many times have we seen it in this building Wes yep a team is hanging in there with Duke and then the last two or three minutes of the half Duke goes on one of their patented runs 15 second chance points by the Blue Devils in this first half of their Applause 35 second differential here Dan too much dribbling yep Brown heres Burnham thought about it one to shoot three ball got it over the top of canle Ben Burnhams got seven that is a big basket and its an eightpoint game and a timeout taken here by the Blue Devils so well step aside for a half minute wow he is he is a very good scorer West two years ago at the College of Charleston he was one of the leading scorers in the country coming off the bench he was an all freshman team in the CAA yeah I mean hes a good player yep a year ago averaged a dozen points and hit 37 from three he had 12 games in another cougars championship by the way in the CAA he had 12 games of 15 or more playing for Pat Kelce and hes getting his sea legs here in his second AC DC game it feels like kiple on the final play of the half at the foul line got it five for kiple to go with eight rebounds now common did do a pretty good job he had a couple of rebounds as the Hokey start the ball at their end of the floor here at the beginning of the half and here is shoot the Duke transfer and Migel potit miss the Bunny come the rebound I actually thought it hurt Virginia Tech in the first half when potit had to go to the bench with foul trouble right and seon James I think is going to need a little attention from the veteran Duke basketball trainer Jose F think he maybe took one near the nose so lets see what we have here Sho just into shoot didnt even know he was there thats incidental contact will play on well its certainly not a foul but no its its not a foul but the contact was but theyre going to give him yeah time to stop bleeding y he had a good cut man down there Jose fona has been here 20 Seasons with this program and umpire Eric Lewis well the rule is that your bleeding has to stop before you can go back in the game nothing further on the play and we get the confirmation from Bert Smith hes our referee now you can have blood on your uniform it only has to be determined whether your uniform is saturated and you know who makes that decision your own trainer okay so if its like a bad player then the absolutely the uniform is saturated but if its one of your good guys then it never gets saturated heres flag I have a question as a followup sir by heres flag on the drive oh Proctor nice move and the lob they couldnt get Mal watch again how many times have they tried the lob for the big fella from the Sudan well that time he didnt get his hands on it the other couple times hes gotten his hands on it and hadnt been able to hold it by the way do you tell us the saturated Story Only to confirm that if it had ever happened in your career your uniform would have been saturated therefore you theres no question but all you got to do is watch some of of those old highlights of people like Tyler hansboro where there wasnt a blood rule y good point L the rebound Duke the Miss still a 10point lead for the blue does its going to be interesting to watch The Freshman Hammond here in the second half Dan its an ACC game your first road game right well the interesting thing Wes youre still in the game youve given up all those Second Chance points youve given up those points off turnovers but you are still in this game lwow cant finish and he just he just had had any luck at all guys and white have something to do with that too heres kiple out of the corner Hammond the Applause carum poti now for shoot against kiple hed like to get shoot coming off a screen to give him a chance to catch it and let it go hes not going to beat anybody off the Dr created three Hammond Baseline tried to scoop it up and oh my but that was ripped away Tyler Johnson with seon James and theyre going to call a foul on Johnson The Freshman from Orlando itll be his first first of the half on the hokes here well I guess you know you take a look at seon James and James ends up on the floor you figure well nobody can do that well he did he one hand had the ball the other hand hand him by the neck yeah that might be a foul foul on Johnson and off the foot of before mentioned Johnson Duke comes into the game they are ninth in the ACC in scoring offense at 79 a game they are number one in the ACC scoring defensively at 58 and2 points a game theres a drive and bucket for James R PO let that one go because he didnt want to pick up his third foul and again I think Virginia Techs initial defense has been good enough but now you get got to get down on this end you got to get some better shots and you got to convert skip from Hammond L a three and malat tried to keep it alive and almost ended up in the front row over there now law can shoot it from out there but hes best around the basket but heres James just driving the ball the basket and you can see potit step away because he doesnt want to pick up that third person foul tell you this about seon James he is listed at 66 220 lb a grb transfer from T Lane and Ive heard a lot of descriptions about the way he plays the game theres a ball fired right inside for poti the one that Mike young gave us this morning might be the best Ive heard so far when Mike young goes hes a tank and Foster or rather proor off the Miss heres flag now now oh my catch nice dribble back in lay up good theyre talking a lot of things about Cooper flag one thing that does not get discussed as much when you see him in person is how good his footwork is as a basketball player the Virginia Tech bench objected to that footwe but he was over there calling for a walk may have gotten an extra step and can nipple almost with a terrific take on the lot for poti count them off here for me Dan lets see well its wheres your pivot foot okay right I dont know that he ever moved that pivot foot I think that was good yeah you know just because it looks like a walk doesnt mean it is and the officials and the officials what theyre trained to do is unless theyre 100 sure they dont blow the whistle yeah Hammond for Johnson hell back down on kiple and I think this is going to be on KH canle it is his first first of the half on the blue down that that sequence right there was sort of the Virginia Tech offensive game in capsule theyre doing a lot of dribbling because Duke is forcing them this is the team that passes and moves the ball and if you can get that kind of a team to do more dribbling and they want to do then that helps you but Virginia Tech just cant get inside how about the steel malat to flag to James for the dunk hard to throw it in over malok and theres a lob low headed knocked Away by malawat and a three out of the corner theres lall thats a big basket now can Virginia Tech string a couple of stops and scores together well Toby L Wilds got his seventh three of the year and his third field Applause goal kiple on the drive fell off the rim Proctor back down the lane for the hammer woo 15point lead now for the Blue Devils and no more emphatic Basket in this ball game than this one right here Tyrese they ought to give you more than two my man they really Music should monary by the way were hours away from January 1 tyres Proctor helping us get started by the way okay hi how about Applause this what Weston once again we talked about it at the break Virginia Tech stopped him the first time but an offensive rebound and then the hokes could not get organized defensively again and and a dunk like that can be just demoralizing it Juiced the building for sure and now with the lead Brown on the floor for the first time in the second half he wears jersey number four for the hokes the Cal transfer with lewow shoot Patrick wesler there and heres Rex Steiner for three and L while inside Couldnt get the second chance but does draw the foul I mean malawat is such a presence in there yep his second foul second on the blue doubles he committed the foul but you get the ball down inside and you have to deal with him are you kidding Toby Lew is 68 218 lb Junior transfer played at BCU did not play basketball until he was 16 years old he was a soccer player in his native London and he misses the front dont forget womens basketball on acc Network every Thursday it starts this week a double header 600 Eastern Virginia techos Florida State blackburg and then Stanford SMU in Dallas at 800 on acc Network back into the two for La well laow is he does a great job getting to the basket and screening roll situations but Duke has totally cut that off today 14point lead for the Blue Devils Blue Devils have the original starters out there for Coach shock flag might have been deflected on the way to Cooper heres Brown and look at leow flying of basket Toby low six and a half now double figures in the ball game he is really athletic hes noted for his work ethic and he certainly is a Run and Jump kind of guy Applause yep 12point Duke Lee proor rex Steiner trying to stay in front here goes flag down the lane and hes going to draw the foul wesler draws his second second on the hokes here you go Dan W Virginia tchas had very few opportunities in transition and you want a guy to finish in transition I I picked him yeah and flag is going to go back to the free throw line and he is so good taking the ball to the basket yep and everybody tries to get out and you know take his shot away as he said he hes shot the three pretty well today but coming into the game hes only 25 but boy you get too close and he goes right around you know its interesting our friend Joe jilo who of course is in the media here we used to work at the news and observer now Coast a very popular podcast with Joe ovus said back in the fall if youre thinking Zion youre thinking the wrong thing because this guy hits all the marks Dan I mean he comes into the game today leading his team in points rebounds assists and blocks and number two in Steels right behind maybe the best individual defensive player over 66 in the country right I agree thats the youre talking about well maybe the best 69 defensive player turns of steals and Applause brown flag was 17 now by the way four to shoot Rex Steiner in trouble Fall Away on kle and it goes first points for sophomore Brandon re Steiner and if you got to work that hard to get every basket youre not going to score very many that was outstanding Applause defense K nipple heres flag working with 18 Proctor takes off Baseline hand check foul will be on Jaden young first on young third on the hes another look at the work of Brandon Reiner this is an unbelievably difficult shot I mean you cant defend a guy any better than canle just did Foster in the ball game hell put it in play for pro you know Proctors a guy for this Duke team whos had a great year so far nobodys talking bate Browns first points yeah Proctors second best threepoint shooter in the league coming into the ball game with 42 well hes the hes the point of that defense theres L again he rolls in a three well Wes its still only 11o game and youre still in a situation where you can get a couple of stops and a couple of scores and then suddenly be comes very interesting Applause yep so Toby low trying to add to it and that ball got knocked over the in line out of bounds I dont think anybody knocked it I think that uh Brown just sailed it theres a look Le out of the corner gives him 13 he had 16 in his ACC debut against Pittsburgh did this 68 Junior transer from London well you mentioned he came into this game West only having made six threes on the season shooting a very respectable 35 thats a nice job penetrating by rexer Rex Steiner sometimes gets himself in trouble with a little bit of over penetration but that was the perfect amount right there heres brown with young heres Burnham who leted him in scoring at half time back to L and he scores wow thats where L is almost impossible to guard you know malat is in there can frighten him but nobody else in the game could dke K yep back to a npoint Duke Advantage Toby L wild carrying the hes here five straight no look inside for Browns skip out Evans is returned hell skip for Proctors three nine for Tyrese Proctor and like that its back to double figures first assist for Evans this year Well Evans isnt in the game to get assist I knew that was coming heres Brown at 16 ft and Malik Brown the rebound of the Rodney Brown Music Miss flag against Burnham Evans out of the corner thats why hes in the game yep half dozen now for the Freshman the lead is 15 now six straight for the Blue Devils in the last half minute Burnham and he rolls it in N now for Ben Burnham we were talking about how well the wall does that screen and roll and he actually was open on the screen and roll that time but Malik Brown so covered up rexin ER that he never saw him and so it took a tremendous effort by Burnham to get the two points flag working against burnam takes him on the dribble with the left hand and scores 20 now for Cooper flag and a timeout Duke lead is 15 were almost 9 minutes into the second half and a moment ago Isaiah Evans out of the corner and then Cooper flag all the way to the rack here at Tamp Music 20 or more this year Dan here this afternoon well and he does it in a variety of ways he can get his back to play with his back to the basket he can shoot the three he can hit the pullup jumper and he can drive the ball all the way to the goal flag just has he has everything I think you want and an offensive player seven of 10 from the floor couple of rebounds hes got four assists and the lead 15 for the Blue Devils all that and he had two fouls in the first seven minutes Applause absolutely but he just knows how to play the game you know if youre a very valuable player you got to get in the game and you got to play in foul trouble and you have to figure out how to do it and he does it really well Caleb Foster and Malik Brown knock it away Hammond runs it down 12 on the shot clock now shoot heres Brown down low potit squares up on Malik Brown rolls over the right shoulder and scores with the left hand Elijah potit first field goal of the game with 1037 to play and thats the hoks second leading score hes just been taken out of the game by foul trouble and malow watch and the pressure bu has been able to put on the ball if the guards cant see the throw inside its hard for poti quick Spin and score for flag again we just talked about it hes so versatile that time back to the basket real quickness didnt overpower anybody in there but it was just so quick you couldnt get to it 22 now for Cooper flag theres Jaden shot missing on a three coming up on the 10minute Mark in this second half Duke winners of six straight La Brown The Catch and it fell off the rim from Malik Brown I swear to goodness Wes he looked back and he was going to pass that ball yeah Applause Hammond poti again nice look theres Johnson flag got there defensively thats a hell ball possession going to go to the Blue Devils we step aside at Cameron 15point lead for number Music 42 seems there below North Carolina Louisville Stanford Florida State Notre Dame Wake Forest how are they going to be able to move up because the net the way the networks just doesnt give him the opportunity yeah its going to be an interesting January because really youre going to get a sense of where the league is collectively as conference play unfolds and AJ deai has just put lets see what we have here I want to make sure I got this Music right the ball was recovered in the back court so its a 30 so its a 30 not a 20 if you recover the ball in the front court its 20 but they recovered it in the back court so its third there we Applause go theres a bounce pass flag caught in a double team how in the world did he catch that I dont Im not quite sure look at this right hand shot no good Le the rebound seon James by the Ways got a career high 10 rebounds today hes tied his career high to go with his eight points James is one of those guys who really helps you and he helps you even if he doesnt score whoa malat Deni potit and heres Foster ahead oh spin and cannot finish got it on the deflection and the save and draws the Applause foul one more look at the rejection sliping to Glass here well again potit has really struggled with malawat cuz he just knocks the ball away and that allows Duke to get out and go you know malow watch he slaps it off the backboard he didnt knock it out of bounds and thats KB Foster from Harrisburg North Carolina now 12 of 20 at the free throw line on the year interesting today John sh spoke about a guy who he thinks can help the young guys on this team along and young guys being not just freshman but guys whove transferred in yes and he he talked about Caleb Foster and the value of a year ago to now being paying a dividend this year well you just saw the kind of things that Caleb Foster can do hes very good taking the ball in the basket he handles the ball very well and and a foul on Foster now he gets the foul there but hes also pretty good defensively too yep so the Third on Duke and the second on the sophomore Foster who averaged 6 and A2 points and shot 41 from the floor last year in conference play he did shoot 46 from three 17point game Hammond working against Evans now le wild down the lane again and hes going to draw the foul but I think James is going to get the foul you thats one of those situation if youre James you just get out of the way malawat is coming yep you know why James is trying to block that shot I have no idea first on seon James fourth on Duke and Toby L to the line for those of you that have followed ACC basketball a long time its spelled like lall and the former gy lawall of Georgia Tech theres the free throw quick reminder to you and Im telling everybody at got nothing but net Justin Walters with Muffet mcgar Kelly gramlick and of course Ivory L thatll be Thursday night 1000 wraps up a full day of womens basketball for you on acc Network and the ESPN app so Le wild will go back to the line at Virginia Commonwealth Toby was referred to as leall Brian Cox their fine basketball sports information contact Dan when Toby came to Virginia Tech they were confirming pronunciation he said its La so those of you who followed the Rams knew him as Toby lall he is Toby laow because thats the way he prefers the pronunciation and were happy to oblig as well absolutely yeah very very few things is important about your your name that is common malat and that is Cooper flag with another fabulous assist five assists now for flag malow watchs first points of the game 18 points the difference now with 740 to go flag has five assists hes got two steals hes got a block shot yep and traffic knocked away and he picks up a turnover flag resets took it on the drive and we get a foul on the drive from Bert Smith thats going to get us to break the foul on Hammond his first five on the hokes but heres flag and malat the twoand flush here in Duro uh Dan do not play a conference game in this sequence here they played the other night beat Longwood in Dallas to kind of set the table theyve now won seven straight games flag on the L they will be an interesting challenge for the Blue Devils Moody Coliseum is a very small Arena but it when it gets packed it can be very interesting and SMU is playing really good basketball ter are theres the Drive Burnham had it deflected pulled away by seion James weve been talking about how well Duke has been playing defensively and they will have to play well defensively against SMU but theyre going to have to put some points on the board because youre not going to hold down the Mustang oh the Mustangs come at In Waves offensively Proctor for James Tyrese on the drive tried to scoop it draws the foul and its on Rodney Brown another look at the Baseline out of bounds here well Virginia Tech you know theres a lot of movement by Duke and Virginia Tech just loses Cooper flag and if youre going to lose somebody maybe flag is not the guy you lose six fouls on the hokes its the second on the sophomore Rodney Brown that puts Tyrese Proctor from Sydney and New South Wales at the Line 6 and2 for Proctor hes in the double f I really really like where Tyrese Proctors career is kind of going down absolutely well you made the point this morning I mean Proctor is one of those guys who has had a very very solid November and December and nobodys talking about it yeah hes four for four at the line hits both free throws he and James have been really good together yeah yep Brown now to Young Jaden back on the floor Rodney Brown will tend to shoot there just no room yeah kle doing a great job nice help by Brown heres potit left hand scores six now meijel potit thats a good thing he squeezed that off when he did because if he didnt Cooper cup would have knocked it into the Cooper flag would have knocked it into the third row thats right I mean flag I mean hes so active defensively he has such good instincts on the drive canle and Applause one now kiple handles the ball a lot for Duke and you forget that he is 67 and weighs 220 lb and he can take you inside and he can power you to the B he is a mismatch nightmare for a lot of teams Wisconsins Mr basketball out of Milwaukee makes it a threepoint trip by his standard averaging 12 and A2 pretty quiet night seven points now or eight points with the free throw round after the foul on Rex Steiner a moment ago well canle only one for six from Beyond The Ark mhm theres Young and the three rattled out for him heres flag kiple will try one for you Applause Dan just make sure the mechanism still works I think he shoots the three better coming off screens but in transition when he can get his beat set he almost never misses yeah and theres a foul boy flag took one contesting and Wes when you talk about somebody getting your feet set in transition its much easier said that said than done he got himself stopped before the ball came so hes able to catch the ball and go right into a shooting motion not having to worry about getting his feet sent so the foul canle second fifth on Duke for five to play and the difference here now Blue Devils on their way to their seventh straight 11th overall lwow rattles in another three and a timeout taken by Virginia Tech that is 19 for Toby lewow 450 to go and a timeout taken here and regardless of the outcome the Hoke got a feel feel pretty good about where Lew is hit 23 earlier this year against Delaware State hes got 15 in the second half and 19 in the ball game so the Blue Devil and we talk about the SMU game on Saturday in Dallas and Dan thats a quad one game for Duke well you know the quad one if you play a game if you play a team at home then its 1 through 30 if you play them on the road its 1 through 75 and so uh SMU is 30 so Duke is playing them on the road and you see of course but because because the ACC has struggled so much yeah as a conference in the nonconference portion of the schedule you see nine of the nine games Duke has are quad three and they have one quad four game this today is a quad four game think about it you got a game in Dallas on Saturday and then next week Tuesday night youre playing pit in this building its a pretty youre going to jump right in it with those two arent you four and a half to go heres Proctor with 10 on the shot clock and James the catch double figures now for seon James well with the with the way the league has struggled in the nonconference portion of the schedule youre actually encouraged when you get to play a team like pit or Duke or somebody because theyre the ones who give you the most opportunity to advance now theyre the ones since theyre the hardest to beat yeah yeah of course the Panthers and Blue Devils heres flag after the turnover hell leave it proor will finish another assist for flag his Applause sixth three ball for brown good Rodney Brown with eight now Applause and its 7753 with three and a half to go hoks just never able to get anything off the ground offensively James the skip can nipple in traffic fouled and thatll get us to the under four mayia timeout of Cameron Duke 7753 when we come back see if Duke can and Virginia Tech can finish it off in Jacksonville and Charlotte resped free throw by canle he looked excellent by the way in the glasses I look excellent in very few things free throw by kiple good on both ends and thatll take KH kiple out of the game and here comes Darren Harris a freshman from hearnen Virginia and Ben Hammonds going to come to the floor and Patrick gumba is

front court now Gillis is another another guy who has not really shot as well as they expected him to shoot y wesler fights for space and will draw the foul and it is on before mentioned Patrick GBA
