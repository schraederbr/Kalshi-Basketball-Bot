And both Harris and OCorey on absolute heaters entering this afternoon Officials Ron Groover Shan Hull and Kell Miller Wake Forest with the ball off the opening tip Deaks snapped a fivegame losing streak with a win at Georgia Tech on Wednesday Stanford after dropping five in a row has won two straight And there is Juke Harris 26 and 10 in his last five games Spillers down low gets gobbled up and Stanford with the ball Starting lineups for the Cardinal Benny Geler coming off a careerhigh 21 Wednesday at BC and Okori who Tio talked about two points away from setting Stanfords freshman scoring record Theres Ryan Uggerwall in a bit of a shooting slump Six for his last 26 Now Okori with the shot clock inside of five Step back three Its good And with that he sets Stanfords freshman scoring record And he continues his hot streak We didnt have to wait long did we Anish he has been outstanding all season long 519 points Thats big time And by the end of this game were going to show you the list of the guys hes passed A lot of tremendous players in a Stanford uniform But how about Miles Cole They need him to be good too He has doubled his scoring average from last year the Purdue transfer with a chance at a threepoint play Strong right hand drive You said it Purdue transfer Hes played in a lot of highlevel games and Wake Forest for them to be at their best with Nate Calmese out of the lineup for the foreseeable future Miles Coven has to shoulder some more responsibility for this Demon Deacons team And Steve Forbes he recognized the talent brought him to Winston Salem This is a guy thats been up and down though And sometimes when you get a little bit more responsibility theres an adjustment curve that comes with that added responsibility And Coven starting to feel a lot better as of late You mentioned Nate Calmese out indefinitely with a grade three ankle sprain So 10 in Golden Black Sebastian Akens gets another start at point guard Calmise has now missed four games in a row AJ Rahosi the up and under and able to draw the foul Neither of these teams very adept at drawing fouls but both already going to the line as Spillers picks up his first You see Nate Calmese there in the back and we were there whenever he suffered that ankle sprain up at Pittsburgh and its been a while since hes been on the floor A little bit of an adjustment process Sebastian Akens number 10 in gold a transfer from Denver from Concord North Carolina About an hour and change down the road Uh they have to run things differently with Sebastian Akens at the point Youre going to see a lot more set plays than what youre typically used to seeing One out of two for Rajosi who had been a 32 free throw shooter prior You look at the starting lineups for Wake Akens again getting the started point guard Harris coming off backto back double doubles off the bounce Cooper Schweer is there No shot clock reset Akins the show and tell and hits Got to love it Was a big time player in the Summit League last year at Denver Coming a little closer to home with Cows going down They need him to play well Jeremy Den Smith into the game Rajosi slips under Schwagger Thats a little bit of an awkward game right Division three transfer Lmont Scripps started his college career playing in the fraternity league at Washington State Now a starter in the ACC You tell me how that works out Hes enjoyed his college experience Im sure but he just plays so hard and its an unorthodox type of game He walked on to Washington State earned a spot after going to open gym day and Kyle Smith was impressed and then Smith brought him to Stanford after a year in the division three ranks Cory wants it instead Its Geler 21 points a careerhigh on Wednesday Six threes in that game Now Jeremy Dent Smith through the trees Spillers corrals nearly went out of bounds Here comes Kulvin Really like the halfcourt physicality by both teams on the defensive end of the floor Kulvin aggressive denied Gets it back Shot clock down to 10 Kulvin and contact down low They might get Roi going over the back Id really like to see Trayvon Spillers be aggressive on the offensive glass Youre going to get some driving lanes and some angles against Stanford As long as you move the ball from side to side thats going to open up Spillers on the offensive glass to be aggressive there And he shoots a really good ball from the free throw line You want him playing with a certain level of physicality 11 points a game five and a half rebounds And for Wake Forest this is a team that has struggled on the glass But in Stanford the Cardinal not exactly one of the top rebounding teams either You know what Stanfords big not super athletic in the front court Wake Forest is small very athletic in the front court So you kind of its theres going to be a little bit of a clash If youre Wake Forest you want them really aggressive trying to get to the glass Steve Forbes has always had a few guys in the front court that attacks Uh they need that from Omaha Belaloo They need that from Cooper Swigger to be assertive on the offensive glass Back inside to Rahosi The kick out Dent Smith Extra pass to Geler Too strong on the three The rebound to Juke Harris Really nice defensive possession for Wake Forest from a scouting perspective Threeway switch on the backside Not leaving anybody open Got to score here Schwagger able to draw the foul Saw that he had the size advantage Immediate timeout Onepoint game early on Happy Valentines Day from Winston Salem Lot of great players in a Cardinal uniform Okorei cements his name at the top And over the last two hes been even better 31 points a game And when you look at his season hes averaging almost 22 and a half per game Currently that would rank second all time amongst any Stanford player in any season Only Adam Keefe who played a long time in the NBA Yep averaged more points in a single season than Okori I mean what a fine out of Brewster Academy Oh Cory was wide open Rahosi never saw him Shot clock down to seven Now O Cory Stripped away Thats what Wake does well They turn you over Belaloo lost it trying to go behind the back Tell you what Benny Giler over the last few games has played really well The kick out Aiden Camman knocks down the three His ninth triple of the season Career 30 threepoint shooter Youre in transition defense You have to communicate Even with Stanfords four and fives Camman for my money one of the more underrated players I think hes going to be really good for Stanford Nice drive by Got to be able to finish it You got to go up and try to dunk that ball Cam providing resistance at the rim Okorei uncontested Matador defense Ill say this you watch Benny Geler off the basketball guarding Juke Harris He is so physical on every single cut Number five on the right 45 Not looking to let him touch the ball at all Making somebody else beat you Thats the plan in the open floor Anishh somebodys got to take the ball Better communication Not really sure what Cooper Swagger is thinking right there Wall the ball off Even if youre going to match up you have to show your chest and your arms wide to at least discourage a player of Okors caliber from getting downhill Been an issue for Wake this season Last in the ACC in defensive efficiency An opponent shooting 53 inside the ark Long three Jeremy Dent Smith It rattles in 149 eight unanswered by Stanford Couple of strong defensive possessions by Wake to open up Since then Stanford pretty much getting anything they want at this point Juke Harris has been quiet early on Now hell launch from three front rim Ryan Uggerwall the rebound Okori over Akens Hes feeling it He had 40 last Saturday against Georgia Tech 22 on Wednesday as of this game He told Okorey Hey its on you now to really be a complete point guard Its something Okori really didnt do in high school a whole lot Make your teammates better That was the message to his star Leadership team first knowing the other four guys on the floor their strengths making them better Tell you what Wake Forest is all out of sorts right now Oh Cororey feeling it Not that time And a rebound to Mai Mason who last time out at 17 points his best game in ACC play Wake has missed its last six Stanford has scored 11 straight Omaha Belaloo zero and gold Former McDonalds AllAmerican This is Carr He knocks down the three to end the bleeding Hes starting to see more minutes of late with the injury to Nate Calise And rightfully so Im a big fan of Isaac Carr His best days are ahead of him of course just like any freshman But at the same time he comes in hes a connective piece He runs your show and he can make shots He was a number one player in the state of Oregon last year Comes cross country and has been a valuable guy over the last couple of games Jeremy Den Smith that is way off that hell hear the chorus cheering Jeremy Den Smith a division 2 transfer He will pull him deep And I think at this level anish he kind of has to because the size differential is a lot different than where hes coming from at the division 2 level He was a high level scorer first team allAmerican at that level But your game has to change because the size and athleticism of where youre at now in the ACC Wake three for 11 from the field Carr picked up the bounce looking for help forced it up and its good Five points off the bench quickly for the freshman Isaac Carr Playing off two feet poised inside the paint Its what you got to have Isaac Card I tell Im telling you Anishh this kids got a bright future Just a really solid player for the Demon Deacons Cameman looking for help Geler trapped in the corner The skip to Dent Smith Cameman with two and fouled by Spillers And thats two fouls on Trayvon Spillers when one of a kind And I also want to point out his impact on young people as well with team CP3 on the EBL circuit Hes helped so many young people get college scholarships and teach the game and move it forward And a lot of those players Jude Harris was a part of that program as well So just a lot of good things coming from Chris Paul and Im sure good things are going to continue to come from Chris Paul and his family You cover the NBA with the Hornets When youve watched Chris Paul over the years as Okori gets another two hes unbelievable What were the defining traits that you felt made Chris Paul a great point guard his competitiveness his willingness to be a leader on each and every team he played on Even Anishh even when it was uncomfortable to be that leader he was not afraid of to be combative with teammates in order to put his guys over the top to win I I think if you pick one thing him Isaiah Thomas the competitors edge that they brought to each and every game Mai Mason may have gotten away with a travel on that last possession Okoris got 10 of Stanfords 19 Came down low Size advantage on Belaloo Called for steps Kyle Smith beside himself Im not sure there was a whole lot of doubt here Were going to see it One two I dont know It was pretty close Pretty close That all being said Stanford switching now to a two3 zone Theyre going to mix up their defensive coverages a little bit Schwigger you have to be aggressive in the middle of that zone Tough Heres the freshman from Belgium Oscar Hilte turns it over Wake Forest excels at turning over its opposition They do it at one of the highest rates amongst ACC teams Look at Gilers offball defense swarming so physical Hes giving up a lot of size Sure Harris 0 for four from the field Kicks it outside That one rims out for Schwiger Camman cleans it up There comes Okorei Defended by Mason Now picked up by Carr Say this Carr is a pretty good on ball defender but hes got his hands full right here Okorei hit the side of the backboard Hell runs it down Uggerwall wide open Catch release No hes been struggling with his shot Heres Geler now Too strong Tipped around Carr the rebound Wake does give up a lot of offensive rebounds One of the worst defensive rebounding teams in the ACC cheering Mason lost it Theres a lot of contact there And Juke Harris youre number one on the scouting report Theyre going to be physical with you That was a lot right there But Im telling you every cut that he makes is being met with physicality from a smaller player in Benny Giler number five And that guys not backing down from anybody Harris still looking for his first points Hes 0 for four from the field They continue to let them play Schwagger had it go out of bounds No call It stays with Wake 13 to shoot Its been physical Gelers battling Still physical Harris down low that time just brass knuckled his way to the basket Absolutely did Wake Forest back in this game on a 92 run Embracing Stanfords physicality and the defensive intensity has picked up Cabin cheering draws the foul on Marcus Marian Theres a lot of physicality on one end of the floor down here to our left And were seeing the same game you guys are back at home Not a lot of contact for Cam but sometimes you need to be the initiator of that contact Heres the Wednesday night ACC Network slate Number 20 Clemson Tough loss at Duke today They come here to Winston Salem to take on Wake Forest And then Virginia heads to Georgia Tech About a month away from selection Sunday ACC looking like around a an eight bid league right now And you got some teams Cal Virginia Tech on the bubble Stanford A win today for the Cardinal would qualify at least for the moment as a quad one win It puts Stanford back in the conversation and Mason knocks down the three He showed signs of life the other night against Georgia Tech Starting to get a little bit more confidence and I talked to Steve Forbes at Shootaround today He said you know Mai Mason its all confidence right now Played really well against Georgia Tech You you dont want confidence to be the thing with an older player but theres still es and flows especially if youre going to transfer in Uh finally starting to get his footing Went five for seven against Georgia Tech Thats huge for him and huge for this team 17 points his best game in league play Cin from the outside that doesnt go Jaylen Thompson on the offensive rebound but he touched it last Physically imposing guy I think a guy named Marcus Marion number 11 right there that was in your screen Like you want more out of the Danish forward I mean this was a guy with a lot of expectation Just hasnt been the tough guy of the group needs to help out on the on the glass today So far though Wake Forest not bad in that department Mason almost a 3se second Heres Mason again cheering Dent Smith there for the rebound Stanfords gone more than four minutes since its last field goal Okoris carried to the offense Four of six 10 points almost turned it over Gets tied up Gets rid of it Long three Den Smith Stanfords had a lot of those bailout shots where theyre not really into their offense and then they go yolo late I I absolutely agree Is that sustainable Thats what you and I were talking about in the break and Im not so sure it is But you know when you have big time shotmakers those things help If youre Kyle Smith and a coaching staff youre thinking weve got to find a way to get a little bit easier shots We get a whistle down here on the end of the floor and it has been physical for both squads But youre right I I think Wake Forest has been doing a good job of getting shots within the flow of their offense Conversely uh I feel like Wake has done a decent enough job They just have to close out and finish possession so they can get out and run and initiate their offense Not a ton of open looks for either team Attention to detail has been pretty good Its been physical Jeremy Den Smith to the bench after picking up his second Harris the straightaway three Hes got five Hes made his last two after missing his first four Okorei to Giler Add it around Knocked out of bounds applause by Stanford Hey Isaac Carr Hes in the mix man Like put that young man on the floor and hes made good things happen so far Just a really big fan of what hes capable of He is plus eight on the day when hes been in Wake has been better And its the little things Its going after rebounds Its setting the offense Off the Harris miss 13 of Stanfords 18 shots have been threes Theres Donovan Young out to Geler and another three This time it falls for Benny Geler Hes not going to force the issue but I like the offensive play there for Stanford or how they were playing for Stanford Not necessarily the offensive play per se but how about this Mai Mason Mason Strong to the 10 Hes got seven to lead the Deaks Washington transfer who spent two seasons at Rice Played really well against Georgia Tech We talked about his confidence level is starting to raise Sometimes you need to think less Just go Mai Mason knocking down some shots and driving to the cup Stanford again late in the shot clock Young from the corner Short Mason and Harris with a disconnect Just sloppy play right there Those are things that you need to clean up It is a dead ball turnover sure But those are the types of plays that drive you crazy between your leading scorer and a guy whos transferred whos a senior Like you cant just give away possessions Ill say this away from the ball Wake has been pretty good defensively I I mean theres theyve strung together a couple of possessions where theyre swarming to the ball Like thats a tough shot That is a tough shot by Ben Aguilera But their scouting defense has been really good eventually Like you just got to cut the faucet off when it comes to making tough shots contest late Stanford has not had a whole lot inside in settled sets and Wake Jewish collegiate athlete in the country and he told us a few weeks laughter ago this award which is sponsored by Manise Chevz comes with two things One a cash prize The second which his mom is very excited for is if he wins he would appear on a limited edition moatza box Thats big time stuff big time stuff And when we asked him about it the first thing out of his mouth hey we would love it Any help you can give me if you could mention it So there you go Benny Big fan of Benny Geler You know whats interesting Anish is like we have an awesome job Being able to meet some of these young people at the beginnings of their lives and how well put together they are Had the opportunity to interview a couple of players from Wisconsin last night on the field of 68 Vinnie Geler like so impressive Ryan Uggerwall as well like and were talking to Ryan Uggerwall about private equity Yeah exactly Ryan I cant you know when youre talking to a Stanford guy I know I cant spell it and hes ready to work in it So like its just unbelievable and the really cool part of our job that a lot of people dont know about Give him the Heisman Leheisman moment for Benny Geler as he knocks down the deep three I tell you what this kids a great story Former walkon Yep now a captain first year as a starter senior out of Palos Veres California Validictorian outside the LA area The validictorian of his high school as well Thats a good call And my man has range Thats not just from the logo Thats almost dead center of the F He can really shoot the basketball You see why hes carved out a role here at Stanford And its not just his ability to knock down threes and hes good at that dont get me wrong but look how physical he is I I mean youre going up against a player with size and Juke Harris He is in his body the entire way I I mean it is relentless That time Belaloo set the screen to free up Harris No call Harris from the elbow knocks it down Seven points for Juke Harris the third leading scorer in the ACC And that man is a bucket Its been a while since Okore has scored more than eight minutes Hes got 10 Interesting about Okore too is like well look at it and be like well hes just kind of floated through this game He ends up with 25 points Happened a couple weeks ago at Florida State too Its just willing to let the game come to him a little bit Why not GELER WITH ANOTHER DEEP laughter THREE 43 threepoint shooter Hes had a heck of a road trip Yeah hes adding to the reel Had 21 on Wednesday Six threes against Boston College Hes been terrific 11 points today Three triples in the first half Kovven lost it Gets tied up with Geler whos been everywhere They have yet to signal held ball Now they do And possession arrow to Stanford Dealers scored the last 11 for the Cardinal Youre right I mean hes on a heater He has insane range and he has just enough bounce game off the bounce to create and he shot you saw it at the end of the shot clock there Jump shot right around the ACC logo not his game per se but willing to take whats given to him From the team perspective devils advocate there have been a lot of those shots and a lot of them have gone in for Stanford Yes weve talked about it How sustainable is it to live like that for 40 They havent gotten a whole lot inside Okorei tried Hell take the offensive rebound Came and a blocking foul called against Wake Forest and Mai Mason I dont know if Mai Mason took it to the chest I He was outside the restricted lane Not a ton of contact Not a ton of contact but he did have position Take another look here Was that enough for legal guarding position Did he get there in time It looked like it Looked like it So the line it did look like Cam was off to the left So Thursday night womens basketball double header on ACCN UNC at Blackburg and then Stanford visits Miami Stanford has done most of its damage in the first half from three Eight for 17 from long range Omaha Blue back iron He scored in double figures in three of his last five games Geler feeling it He gets it right back Ill allow it After a couple of threes he hit he was feeling himself Quick heat check and you know youve been good off the on the offensive glass O Cororey blocked by Schwagger Now you take the first best shot Youre not in a position to where you go one shot Stanfords going to get the ball no matter what Look at this defense Geler all over Harris forces the turnover Numbers for Stanford Geler Cam lost control And we get a whistle I think we goending call Bucket will count How about Stanford though out in transition Cameman tried to get the foul Goes off There was no need for a goalend That wasnt going in Thats a run by Stanford Lead is nine Thats their largest of the game Final ticks Heres Harris Geler has been all over him Harris lets it go Air ball And thats how the first half ends Benny Geler both ends of the floor Absolutely Defensively he has been terrific and hes knocked down shots early on Did not score in the last eight minutes for the Cardinal but they had 43 points Wednesday combined in the win against Boston College Akens nearly lost the ball and then did lose the ball So Sebastian Akens who started at point guard remember no Nate Calmese normally the starting point guard out indefinitely with an ankle sprain And Stanford theyve now been without their number two scorer Chisum Oara for a while And Kyle Smith told us before the game theyve had a transition period figuring out what this itineration of the team is without Okara Well they found it and its with their ball movement I I think thats first and foremost They have to be really disciplined offensively And you see the ball movement typically really good Raosi gets called for a travel there But always the second side of the floor as long as its not in Okors hands Thats how Stamford finds shots in the half court Their ball movement is crisp and theyre able to find some decent looks Almost had another one right there prior to the travel Say Stanfords defense has been phenomenal though I I mean you can see where Wake really misses Nate Calmise Spillers with the deposit slip at the bank Thats the bank laughter Well done Anish Thanks for playing Pros pro Heres Geler Coven comes way out to defend him He hit a couple of long threes in that opening half Cammons open Keeler with three with two Yolo That one a shot clock violation And we talked about it Thats a tough way to live And Stanford again continues to live with those long threes late in the shot clock Yeah youre absolutely right But the problem for Wake is theyve been hitting those long threes at the end of the shot clock Keep up the intensity and continue to contest I thought Miles Cove in that possession terrific on the ball defense and if youre going to get into Benny Giler you have to make him handle the ball and change direction That was a terrific example of that Drew Harris on the give and go to Spillers resulting in a turnover No thats a foul Foul call that this was really good offensive play Juke Harris continuing to handle the basketball as we have a stagger screen coming Juke Harris continues to work the chip a little bit too late Its going to be a foul on Rahosi Thats three on Rahosi They go right back to the slip screen Coven denied at the rim and hes quick Okorei cant get it to fall Theres Akens and he is fouled by Geler on the reach in So couple of quick fouls on Stanford If youre Stanford though transition take foul They use those a lot in Europe Its a little bit more difficult because the fouls dont reset at the end of the third quarter But you slow them down you get to guard in the half court and thats where Stanfords been pretty good today If youre awake have you found a little something with that screen and roll a little bit but it always comes back to Juke Harris and Geler knows that hes just playing face up not letting him touch the ball Spillers took a spill Akins working on OCorey Geler in the passing lane Hes been everywhere A little bit shocked that they came out with Sebastian Akens at the point guard position in the first half as Isaac Carr makes his way to the scores table I thought Carr played really well in the first wall off the hesitation Kee cant handle the pass has it stripped Harris now Kovven Wakeake wants to run and Geler picks up his second foul Defense turning into offense And if youre Stanford driving baseline you better get somewhere because if youre cut off and get trapped in that corner makes it really really difficult Were going to take a look at it Good defense Theyre swarming the basketball Juke Harris with the advanced pass and Ger just going for the ball Nothing dirty about it Just a hard nose play in transition D one Miles Kovven 86 from the free throw line And we remind you coming up next the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the ACC Cal over BC Chris Bell hits six threes Notre Dame got a huge game from Cole Serta 37 in a win against Georgia Tech Duke Cole Sas had some games like that Hes had some big games Yeah Knocked down what Seven threes Duke knocking off Clemson Blue Devils now 121 And you know we kind of saw this a few weeks ago Florida States coming Oh yeah theyve won four out of five They won again today knocking off Virginia Tech We told people weeks ago buy low on Florida State cuz theyre coming And Luke LS and his staff have done a terrific job adjusting on the fly to the college game Thats a tough shot And he still knocks it through some more than 14 minutes and picks up the foul So something to watch We havent reached the under 16 media timeout Stanford has already picked up 14 fouls Well it was very physical in the first half And Im not saying they were getting away with a lot but a lot of bodies were flying and referees looking to clean it up early here in the second half Sounds like youre saying they were getting away with a lot I didnt say it You did laughter Touche I think this is a big point You want to talk about the most improved player in all of college basketball I think Juke Harris is the guy And you look at some of the other names Paul Joay some of those guys that have really improved theyre doing it in conferences that are not the ACC Juke Harris has shouldered the load as a primaries option for this Wake Forest team a year after averaging like five points a game Hes been terrific Third leading scorer in the conference coming off backto back 2010 games 23 and 13 against Georgia Tech 251 against Louisville That doesnt go from the outside Hey Anish you made a great point Stanford was living on shots like that in the first half And Im not going to sit here and say Wake didnt have opportunities to play good defense but Oh wow Nice play Here comes Heilte the big guy GOT THE BOUNCE ON THE DUNK ATTEMPT Better to be lucky than good sometimes Its a line drive in the box score Here comes Spillers The turnaround going right over the shoulder Points off turnovers Thats the name of the game right now 144 McForest has been good when they played in the half court I cant do that Cory how do you like that A chance for a threepoint play Hes got a chance for a threepoint play right now Yeah Okore has been terrific And he breaks a single season record for scoring for a freshman in Stanford history And you just continue to see why His ability to attack the rim get guys on his hip and finish Hes so crafty at drawing fouls I think thats the thing that sticks out a lot about him too And before the break I said Wake was up eight Stanfords up nine now I apologize These things happen Life TV Anish sometimes youre told there wouldnt be math and they lie to you Well thats right Heres Juke Harris now at the other end Strong to the 10 and he gets the answer O Cororey with a chance at a threepoint play of his own Love that action to get you Caris going downhill Were going to take another look right here Little grenade for him to come up and get the ball going towards the baseline And he uses his speed and length to finish over the top This guys a special score Vinnie Gelers done a nice job staying in his body You got to find ways to give him leverage to where he can get going downhill and use that size to see over the top After a slow start Harris has a dozen Wake a perfect 12 of 12 from the line Jeremy Dent Smith division two star at Cal State Dominguez Now Okorei again Shot clock inside of five Okorei splits the D and draws the foul Man how quick he made that move on Miles Cohen right in front of us I mean the change of direction Well see you in a minute And Im not sure there was a ton of contact He hits the ground but my goodness the ability to change direction Whos that remind you of Im trying to think in my mind 62 a generous 185 lbs He might be lighter than that this guy can score in shot creation whether its for himself or for teammates at the next level is going to translate Yeah Kyle Smith alluded to the fact thats the next part in his evolution as a point guard He knows he can get to the 10 at will but now can he create for others But today a big game so far 17 points And you go back to December he goes for 32 against Colorado Thats the Stanford freshman scoring record Breaks that record against UNCC with 36 Broke it again last Saturday with 40 against Georgia Tech Beloo wide open but no good Stanford has led by as many as nine Okorei doubled Heres Donovan Young Young inserted into the starting lineup the way Chisimo Parro went down Okorei lost it Loose ball picked up by Omaha Belaloo Its been a fun matchup today Geler and Harris Big size advantage Beloo cheering and the foul on Okori And that is 16 fouls on Stanford 14 minutes to go One more foul on Stanford Wakes in the bonus Corys still on the ground I think he got the wind knocked out of him Were going to take another look at the play Beloo trying to post up You take one hit I think if you take if you try to take the charge on the second bump sometimes thats where youre going to get it Taking it on the initial one is the referees less likely to give you that call A breather for Okori 17 points to lead all scorers and he had scored seven of Stanfords last nine Harris sets the pick for Mason You know I would like to see theyre going to call an offensive foul on a moving screen It I would like to see Juke Harris as a screener And the reason I say that is because every time Benny Geler is playing offball defense on him hes completely facing up on him Use him as the ball screen guy to put the defense in a jam and get somebody else downhill because they are completely faceguarding him Not worried at all what anybody else for the Demon Dinkas is doing You can create advantage situations when youre not the guy chasing the ball down With OCore on the bench Stanford turns it over and Ao as long as Okore is on the bench the question for Stanford how did they get into their offense I think thats a big question I mean for Stanford just who else can create a look off the bounce because Wake Forest today even though their defensive efficiency in conference play has been not great You can still find ways for those guys Harris draws the foul Thats what he does Juke Harris coming into the game had taken more than a third of Wake Forests free throws Always an attack man Nice offensive set for him to come get the ball Telling you I think theres a way for him to be utilized as an off ball guy not just trying to chase down shots but as a screener because theres no help on the guy hes screening right I I think you know that was one way like I wasnt this on ball dynamo creating shots But what I did understand is if I set two really good screens for Trevor Booker way back when yesterday year 20 years ago it hurts to say that he would get a couple of shots first After those first two possessions I would start to find looks You could have embellished You could have gone with a few years ago cheering Truth hurts Facts dont cease cuz you ignore them I My high school coach used to say that all the time When the legend becomes fact print the legend Right Oh Cororey is back in there Geler to the bench Donovan Young not close and away can cut it to a onepossession game Jukes got 14 Mason back to Harris Catch release That one off the top of the backboard Our pushing Jaylen Thompson has it stripped away cheering Wake so good getting steals Active hands Isaac Carr has been a bright spot today Spillers backs down Thompson almost lost it Corrals beloo missed it but he gets the foul and that is 18 fouls on Stanford So Wake already in the bonus and now Stanford getting close to putting Wake in the double bonus And that was the right call Youre late on a rotation Belaloo gets an easy gets an easy look at the rim and you undercut his lower body on the way up Our next All Access the ACC Light premieres Monday night and features Stanford swimmer Tory Husk Georgia Tech womens basketball guards Briana Turnage and Savannah Samuel and Wake Forest womens basketball guard Milan Brown That is Monday at 7 Eastern One out of two for Belaloo and Wake 15 of 16 from the free throw line Stanford has made 16 shots from the field nine from three Ben Smith through the contact from Carr Mason trying to deny Okorei and Stanford turns it over They are right off of the bubble You win today Quad one win That could put you in that next four out Now you could start talking about selection Sunday in March Oh thats absolutely right In one of the weirdest resumes that youre going to see three quad three losses a bunch of quad one wins This just adds to their four This would be their fourth quad one win or excuse me fifth Theyve had four This would be their fifth quad one win How do you keep them out if thats going to be your metric and you look at the opportunities coming up Two quad ones left on the schedule Wasnt the case last year Anish last year fewer quad one opportunities in the Atlantic coast This year different story Yeah A team like Wake Forest 3 and eight in conference yet again for the moment a quad one opportunity for Stanford Those win values could change Schweagger muscles it up Wake is within two and in the midst of an 81 run applause cheering If they can keep Stanford out of transition Wake has done a pretty good job in the half court defensively Juke Harris picks up the foul Third a team foul Stanford really struggled with turnovers over the last four minutes Oh Cory man he can do it himself 19 for the stud freshman You know when you talk about cars you talk about 0 to 60 You can talk about that with Ibuko Cororey as well Unbelievable acceleration He was not a big time recruit He has turned into a big time player Beloo on the back door cut Lot of contact but terrific play on the offensive end for Wake Forest Get the ball to the middle of the zone Cut from the corner Nice finish by Beloo cheering Rahosi puts it on the floor and beats his man to the rim Stanford by four He just plays hard I think thats the biggest thing He averaged big numbers last year at the division three level but he brings value because nice cut again off the bat off the high post entry cutting to the rim Harris ran into resistance Cory shrugs off the screen now calls for another one The activity level defensively has picked up especially here in the second half for Wake Forest They forced turnovers They found some opportunities Just gosh you got to be able to stay in front against Ibuko Cororey in the last 7 seconds of the clock because thats really what this game has come down to for Stanford He is the guy who can do it Hes had some big shots of the gamewinning three against Virginia Tech Stutter step to the 10 using the window Not there It did not hit the rim No shot clock reset Doesnt matter Wake Forest ball contest without fouling Thats the big thing because hes hes settling for really difficult shots and Sanford has made a lot of these really difficult shots At some point do the law of averages come into play Harris in the high post Shot clock inside of 10 Juke Harris that hit the rim and Spillers fouled That is the ninth team foul on Stanford One more and Wake is in the double bonus the rest of the way Kyle Smith in disbelief Not a ton of contact there One thing to keep an eye out on though with Stanford when theyre in that 23 the second that ball goes into the high post they trigger back to manto man So if youre wake you have to know that If you want to get rid of it and run some of your man sets get it to the high post see if they match get it right back out you can get into your sets or cut away from the ball as theyre trying to match up which is what theyve had success with over the last three four possessions Spillers gets the front end Stanford has sent Wake to the line now 17 times The Deaks have made 16 And this is a very good free throw shooting team 76 as a team Spillers north of 80 Gets them both Twopoint game 912 to play cheering applause Crowd getting into it a little bit applause cheering Oh Cory is bumped They get Spillers Thats going to be his third round Spillers need to keep your composure if youre awake here I I know the emotions are high Like youre making a run by being solid on the defensive end If they make a tough shot fine Youre doing a pretty nice job in the half court with your scout team defense Stay in front at the end Jaylen Thompson defended by Belaloo Shot clock down to five again Thompson the three Its good Stanford with its 10th three of the game Jaylen Thompson Thats a big time shot We can look back at that one later in this contest Wake making a run The Cardinal today 10 for 23 from beyond the ark just to take under 44 Keep an eye this ball gets into the high post If it does theyll trigger right back to manto man They go inside to Spillers Likes that little hook and the rebound coraled by Rajosi He is fouled and that is the sixth team foul on Wake So one more and Stanford will be in the bonus Interestingly enough these are two teams that dont go to the line a whole often in conference play Been a lot of free but its been a physical ball game and both teams have been assertive with some of their drives to the cup Now comes down to a free throw competition I like chances with that but it just comes down to your defensive discipline and do you maintain some of those things Maloo to the bench He picked up his third Cameron in and out Harris the rebound His fourth board Hes got 14 points on four of 13 shooting Carr drives on Thompson through the trees Locked out of bounds Itll stay with Wake Forest a couple of teams possession and not having Nice at the end of games is hurt weight as of late But they just need to get over the hump here and take the lead just once and I think this crowd might be able to carry him through But nice play Spillers is fouled and that is the 10th team foul 735 to go in the half and Wake two shots the rest of the way about Mai Mason This balls going to be swung around the perimeter Here comes a ball screen You turn it down You see the defense leaning Nice cut from the corner And Traymond Spoiler hey thats one that as a coach would drive you nuts Put the ball in And I understand Wigs a good free throw shooting team but take three I love Spillers mentality I saw him play at Appalachin State Not a whole lot has changed in terms of the allout effort the tough man mentality just really having to play out of position a lot of times this year at the five spot despite being only about 67 He was a big time rebounder at App State and again now you go to a bigger league as you said more size to deal with Nine points today three rebounds Wake 18 of 20 at the line and a one and one coming for Stanford which is in the bonus Schwagger picks up his first foul So Wake in the double bonus Stanford in the bonus And Roosi one of the worst free throw shooters in the country 32 Youll see why applause he entered the game for his career to 18 for 56 Thats not great Spillers backing down Came kicks to the corner Three is not there Came the rebound Wake three of 14 from deep You pass up a shot thats an easy catch and shoot and take a tough step back three Its not what you want Five And the scout report on Juke Harris says Were going to be physical Were going to be in your face And if you make him over the top fine But Stanfords done a really nice job on him 14 points Every single one of them have been hard earned Oh Cory to the 10 Another chance at a threepoint play and that puts Okorei over 20 points for the 14th time this season I think this comes down to Im just faster than the guy guarding me A little bit of a miscommunication on a screen nonscreen swi switch situation but he turns the corner and you can forget about it Just so fast Anish I think thats the thing that sticks out more than anything else Its the threat of the jump shot but its the flatout speed that comes with it And he had a little bit of a stretch where he wasnt hitting the threes Well that has reappeared for him The threepoint shot its opened up his ability to get to the basket And one thing weve seen all season Tio it seems he can get to the rim at will whenever he wants Whenever he wants and its almost impossible as for your big guys to stay in front thats a good shot And a couple of possessions ago before that timeout he had that opportunity passed it up for a step back three Catch and shoot Mai Masons at his best when that ball doesnt touch the deck and he fires away Terrific shot for him from the corner And hes settling in 17 points last time out 10 today In his previous five games 11 points total Okorei at the other end Nothing there cheering Telling you Isaac Carr has played pretty good defense Theres been a couple of miscommunications outside of that Sometimes all you can be is there And how about two for a dollar for Mason Almost Carr tried for the rebound Thats an over the back foul on Cam And with Wake in the double bonus Two shots for the freshman Isaac Carr whos only been to the free throw line nine times all season Just does winning things You look at the value he brings to the team one of the two players on the squad thats it thats a positive in the plus minus Wednesday night on ACCN Clemson looks to bounce back from the loss Duke today they go to Wake Forest Colby here at the Joel and then Virginia taking on Georgia Tech whos for the big one today against Ohio State out of the Big 10 big one tonight at 800 in Nashville neutral sight game I like the initiative to try to play somebody out of conference during this part of the season Were seeing Louisville do that right against Baylor Sure cheering Thompson almost lost it Recovers gets to the tin Beloo got a piece Hell missed it completely Stolen away by Geler Who else Hes outstanding I I mean always in the right place at the right time Thats a killer though If youre awake youre close you get a stop youre making a run youre feeling good Shot clock down to six down to five Its Oori Picked up his dribble Came over Spillers front rim Carr is there for the rebound Wake can tie it with a three Uphill DHO You got to attack Terrific pass Better block Juggled and it comes to cabin Geler says Lets slow down Gosh they cannot get over the hump Anish it seems like every time Wake Forest is right there Stanford gets a big stop Theres Oori to the rim Hell had it cheering Crowd wanted a walk Looks like well get a foul instead on Wake Forest This is tough right here Hell take so big and physical You have a crackback block out And the guy beside me does not agree with the foul call but I actually think hell take go straight up to get the rebound The foul occurred after he got the rebound and then pushed back Neither here nor there Wake Forest gets the ball anyway 57 free throw shooter Hell take misses Wake with another chance to tie it with a three Corner three Mason rebounded Came Good offensive play call Screen the corner in for one of your better shooters Got to knock it through Less than four minutes to go Stanford by three Both these teams have played their share of close games Okorei against Harris the two stars O Cororey dips underneath and gets the roll Hes got 24 He is so crafty A timeout by Steve Ford Continuously attacking off the bounce trying to get to the rim and draw fouls Hes so crafty But J Carris here What do you set up for him to get a good look Vinnie Geler has been all over him Geler chasing around Harris as Carr dribbles And theyre going to get a foul on Geler He tried to stay with Harris grabbed his arm and for Geler thats his third And for Wake thats two shots And Geler thinks that hes the one who got grabbed because he is beating Juke Harris to the screen I I think if youre Juke Harris you have to change your speed coming off these screens right Because if youre just going full full go Gelers getting in front of the spot and youre just running into him as hes able to knock it through Were going to be able to take another look here Look at Ger down on the bottom Hes trying to beat him to that screen Theres a lot of tangle up there Good job Juke Harris being assertive but you got to change you got to change your rhythm coming off staggers right You cant just sprint off everything Change your rhythm Keep the defense honest This is a big stop right here If Wake Forest can get a stop cheering the momentums coming cheering Okorei against Mason Okoris got 24 Picked up by Carr Off balance too strong and Harris flying in for the board Great defense by Isaac Carr Just stay in front Make him take a tough shot Wake has trailed for the entirety of the second half Beloo off the shot fake and fouled at the rim by Heilte Omaha Belaloo a 72 free throw shooter to the strike Belaloo who cant shoot it decides shot fake deck it that ones close from our angle we couldnt see the other hand but it looked like hell take right there on top of the ball Third foul on

accelerates too strong cheering and a foul is called against Wake Forest It is Belaloos fourth and Stanford now in the double bonus Cam only a 68 free throw shooter Thats been the difference in the game Wake 23 of 26 at the line Its kept them in Stanford eight out of 12 Eight out of 13 Bit of an unfortunate foul I mean applause womens basketball double header on Thursday UNCC Virginia Tech Stanford at Miami Came with one out of two Wake can tie with a two take the lead on a three They have not led since it was 96 about four minutes into the game Harris with 16 Isaac Carr has played big minutes whos hit the big shots for Wake this season Harris down low AGAINST HEILTE GETS BRIE AND WE ARE TIED at 61 cheering Terrific patience by J Harris around the rim Finally Wake Forest able to tie in this one Oori threw some contact You get the sense its going to be Okore and Harris cheering Mason denying Okorei A lot of dribbling by Cam Keeler lets it go Offensive rebound Ugger wall loose down low Its going to Wake Forest Terrific job Mai Mason once Obuko Cororey got rid of the basketball complete denial up on the top and they were trying to look to get that ball back to him at the end of the shot clock Mason whos been up and down this year playing well today and a nice job on that possession Juke Harris with 18 points Third leading scoreer in the conference matched up with Okori Its been a battle of these two Gaylor against Harris Harris through the contact HES GOT 20 Wake cheering with its first lead since it was 96 applause cheering An 81 run by the Daks Timeout Kyle Smith and Stanford Such a good possessions He has Wake Forests last eight points has come alive in crunch time and it comes down to this guy Cororey set him a ball screen They throw a second defender at him Okorei spins it Dent Smith for the tie Left it short Harris had the rebound Its knocked out of bounds and a foul called against Stanford applause And who else but Juke Harris Jeremy Den Smith he had the shot from three Got to be ready to go I love the adjustment by Wake Forest You send a second defender at him Make somebody else beat you at this point Here come Youre going to take another look Trayvon Spillers comes up flying at the ball Youre going to leave another guy open Sure Doesnt get much easier than that Little bit off balance fading away for no reason Ball ends up short and J Carris has an opportunity to make it a twopossession ball game here at the end Hes been spectacular Seven for seven at the foul line Seven for eight Need this one Need this one One out of two Wake is up by three Now if youre Wake Forest theres a lot of time left So if the clock gets under a certain threshold and Stanford has not shot do you foul I I think you play it out for a few I mean you got 26 possessions No excuse me You do cheering Oh Cory hell launch front rim The rebound to Juke Harris with another chance to ice it at the foul line You got 20 You had 26 seconds Little bit too much time Both teams in the bonus I I think you still play it out And I think that was a tough shot by Ibuko Cory Dont need the three in that situation I think theres too much time and Wake Forest has shown a tendency to turn the ball over Give yourself a chance on the defensive side Now Juke Harris eight of Wakess last 10 points We get a timeout Its a two possession game Wake played 31 minutes here today just doing his job Six points four boards three assists zero turnovers And thats where they needed him Over the last few games his minutes up with Nate Calm injured both free throws good A

today Second half its been all Juke Harris and all Ibuko Cororey These guys have showed up in crunch time Thats what you pay to see Thats exactly right And in the second half like nobodys really helped out a Cory all that much I mean hes the only person with more than three points on his team In the first half it was Benny Geler helping out In the second half he hasnt been able to get it loose I like what Wake Forest did Throw a second body at Okori Make somebody else beat you Now whos going to back off except for Mason Two possession game less than 10 seconds Oori time winding down Den Smith lets it go and Wake Forest rallies from nine down at halftime to knock off Stanford 68 8
