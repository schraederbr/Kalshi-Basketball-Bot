AA tournament for the second time in 3 years boy wouldnt a road win here be huge for them Roger a bird Smith Tommy morresy the officials and thats the tip of our Sonic Blockbuster matchup the Blue Devils with the first possession of the night Seth Trimble guarding Cooper flag hes given up a lot of size and an easy one is flaged by seon James seion James sets a little screen then wide open slipping to the basket the North Carolina starting five again four guards including Ian Jackson an outstanding freshman as become a big time score for them and a nice five from Elliot kdo to vanen Allen Luben to get the heels on the board Duke switching everything and vanen Allen Lubin set a screen right at the free throw line similar to seon James just slipped right to the rim Kau an excellent passer the nipple coming off a screen lays it up no good and the rebound down to Trimble and as Jay said Carol will look to run at every opportunity moving an undersized fiveman really for Carolina former Notre Dame Fighting Irish former Bandy Commodore RJ Davis nice pass into Kad but look at the size that he is dealing with and he turns it over well when kadoo drives the Baseline Kanan malow all seven2 of them came over from the weak side and just created a wall and Dukes helps side rotated very well there was just no one for him to pass it to the five Carolina starters average about 63 in height the five Duke starters about 68 they are noticeably bigger at every position P nipple to flag too strong but a Applause foul a little open side screen and roll to get flag rolling to the basket and Cooper flag is such a difficult match up sets a little screen then rolls a nice little hook pass to get it to him Vel Luben hits him when he goes up but with that open side its so difficult to tag that roller and Cooper flag is such a tough matchup because of his size his length and his skill level other than that he doesnt have much going yeah it really doesnt but he has been living at the free throw line especially over the last five games he shot 51 free throws the last five games his teammates combined 61 over that period is numbers in conference play are crazy over 25 points per game his last eight games he is John Shire and Company tell us under the weather he has been fighting it the last couple of days as he misses both preos who he may not be physically quite at 100 but is obviously in the game for the Blue Devils Tyrese Proctor guarding RJ Davis theyll switch quite a bit theres a switch right there but RJ Davis always seems to have size on him this season Kau into the paint floats it up up short and the rebound to kiple Duke pushing Proctor for three and tipped back out by Applause malawat they play on seon James will step back in Miss the three Mala watch Applause again flag yes Music North Carolinas going to give Duke that many opportunities you get two offensive rebounds and three shot attempts theyve shot 33 but they still came away with three points because of the offensive glass can Carolina keep Duke off the glass and get out in transition to get some easy ones back door pass taken away by flat look at that pass and James will lay it Music Applause in BO what a big time Reed defensively to steal that back door pass just beautifully done by Cooper Applause flag you expect Duke to switch one through five most of the night yes y take a look at Cooper flag here on the left side of the floor just takes away that back door pass opens up and then hes able to take it the other way and just threads the needle between two Defenders and after this pass cross SC from K kiple he catches it ready to shoot but that was after two offensive rebounds where Carolina overall had played pretty good defense they just didnt clean it up with an offensive board Jaylen Washington into the game for the first time for the heels kadoo off to Washington softly off the glass and good beautiful pick and roll again with an open side that was a great catch and finish by Jaylen Washington he needs to have a big game in this one again he did not play missed the game because of a knee injury against pit on Tuesday night Carolina had the lead late but lost by eight to the Panthers Carolina in desperate need of some quality wins so far Dukes transition defense has been pretty good getting back making Carolina play five on five in the half court thats advantage to Here Comes Davis he has not had a great year shooting the ball and this is Fifth and final season but noticeably better the last four games look at the size hes dealing with with malawat on him Trimble with three to shoot gets it off and hits well thats a heck of a shot by Trimble there only three maybe two seconds left on the shot clock and thats the kind of tough two that Duke wants to force a midrange jumper over siiz Duke by one just over four minutes into this one here at Cameron flag posting the immediate double open is Proctor count it Bo how about that you bring the double and he can see right over the top of it and makes exactly the right crosscourt pass the skip beautifully done and now his second steel of the night up to Proctor for the Applause slam Cooper flag already has four assists in this game and were less than 5 minutes in and hes really done it two of them with defense making Steals and then basically acting as the point guard in transition the heels need a big night from Jackson that three around it out and flag down with the board boy a lot of tough shots for North Carolina flag will try a three and hit what a sensational start for Cooper FL thats what sick looks like what a start North Carolina doubling Cooper flag he immediately turns around throws over the double to a wide open Tyrese Proctor and then his second steal of the game leads to an easy bucket to Proctor again and then knocking a three down in transition its been all Cooper flag again heres Jess Dan I caught up with Cooper flags mom Kelly flag pregame and her smile then and now says it all she said before every game she texts CP go early and go often as a reminder to be aggressive and make things happen from the jump something I know coach sh would definitely agree with after giving him the feedback after the last game against NC State about being too soft yeah we were talking to John CH today and I said to said to Cooper during the lab that he was know kind of being a little sought he said not kind of I told him he was being s and he said the best thing is just said his flag responds to that wants the criticism and boy is he off to some kind of here Applause tonight and that was all started with the defense of Malik Brown who gets his hand on the basketball constantly hes got thats probably 87 or 88 deflections that hes got on this season even after missing the last four games and that has started Dukes transition so far its been defense that has dominated the turnovers that Carolina has committed and that Duke is forced as led to three really easy baskets Malik Brown back after missing four games with a knee injury a very important defensive player among other things off the bench for the Blue Devils there he is almost swiping it away from Trimble the Blue Devils have seven baskets flag has scored three of them and assisted on the other four left hand RJ Davis no shot clock reset Applause Dukes helps side is positioned so well theres really nowhere for Carolina to drive it without Duke bods being there and look how hard they are having to work to get a shot off Davis misses the three brown with a Applause rebound flag Brown kicks it back out to Proctor K nipple will try a three and hell hit and Duke is absolutely on fire in the early Applause going tremble left alone and the three wont go down hi nipple again its a six steamed to nothing Run for the Blue Devils right now Duke is getting anything they want but its primarily because theyre getting stops on the defensive end its been one shot and out if Carolina even gets a shot Drake Powell in Off the Bench gets a good look but he cant knock it down Jaylen Washington with the putback to snap the drop what North Carolina really needs here is a stop a re rebound so they can get out in transition cuz going against Dukes half court defense is not a winning formula no matter whose numbers you look at Duke one of the three or four best teams defensively in the nation as James is fouled now lets take a look at KH kiple here you see him on the right side he is wide open and nobody recovers until its too late I mean RJ Davis comes out closes out when hes already in his shooting motion and hes got such a such good Poise in the lane and an excellent shot fake you know K kiple has probably been a little bit overlooked with all the Cooper flag love and all the Cooper flag love rightfully so the canle is having a great freshman year as well no question coming off a 19point game against the wolf pack on Monday flag will six as the sixth year Mason aillis one with the new boiler maker another are they a very good bench you bring guys like Gillis and bik brown in Off the Bench the shooting possibilities of Isaiah Evans theyd love to get Caleb Foster going as well to round out that rotation but right now here comes Foster as James will sit Foster was the starting point guard at the beginning of the year just hasnt been able to make shots like he has in the past and John shy are hopeful that if he sees one or two go through the net itll get him heated up in the second half of the Season well seon James his emergence has been really important for Duke because he gives them a really physical point guard and again switching everything Proctor now on to kdo Washington the screen tipped out of bounds Malik Brown about as good as there is in the nation at deflections so disruptive he just keeps his hands active when hes guarding the ball hes swiping at it all the time he swipes at it when he gets in a passing Lane just an excellent Defender shot clock is at four Washington is fouled by Gillis and a Timeout on the floor 803 into this one Duke is shooting almost 70 and they have a commanding early lead really a family affair his mom Sher nordgard canle is still the alltime leading scorer at the University of Wisconsin Green Bay and dad also Khan kiple is the second leading scorer at Wisconsin Lutheran College KH actually credits playing his dads mens league and learning how to play off the ball toate open but the canle kids are a starting five which means Khan has four younger brothers who are also deeply invested in the sport including pager who just got his first division one offer to Toledo as a sophomore concept watching pager play is his favorite thing to do outside of playing Mel of course and Mom shares the same sentiment about con she said watching my son play for Duke always gives me the chills every time he takes off his warmup shirt for the starting lineups I get teary Jess thank you I mean whos having more fun than the canle family watching their oldest son P play here at Duke four more basketball playing kids including kid kiple how cool of a name is I mean we got to keep an eye on kid we got to stick around long enough to call some of his games Music Applause must be some good uh good games on the driveway at the P nipple household Washington playing very well again missed the last game with a knee injury but did not start tonight but came in Off the Bench and has played very well and has been most of the offense so far for Carolina as Hubert Davis comes out of the timeout in two three Zone theyre just trying to protect the paint because theyve been get up giving up so much paint but Duke moves the ball so well if they penetrate it they can find some openings canle the three wont go Malo watch another offensive rebound and canle is fouled and is heading to the line theres that shot fake often times in a Zone it can be difficult for blockout responsibilities and North Carolina gives up another offensive rebound malawat gives it back to kiple and just a great shot fake by KH kiple whether hes on the perimeter or inside hes very good with that fake you have to stay down and cant leave the floor till he does you talked about how with all the attention on Cooper flag the nipples excellence in his freshman season may have been overlooked a little bit 13 points per game 2 and a half assists per game 87 prepro shoot one of the top threepoint Shooters in the league fifth in the league in threepointers made and makes just under 40 of them hell make them hell come out and flag back in Applause North Carolina going in a horn set they like to exchange up top and then get into a ball screen and then theres a back screen Howell back to kdo whos got malawat on him again Duke switching everything kdo driving on Gillis Howell lost it Blue Devils in transition Applause malat with the left the Cooper flag faked the skip pass crosscourt and then was able to find malow watch as the trailer just such Poise in transition from Cooper flag assist number five of the night already for flag Davis a nice find Kad buries the three and for North Carolina to have any chance you got to believe theyve got to score in transition and Jay theyve got to make some three and they have not been a great threepoint shooting team this year well that three was a rhythm three because RJ Davis was able to drive the close out get into the paint that was important to generate that shot and now Ian Jackson fouls Tyrese Proctor as he was taking a three didnt allow him the chance to land and Tyrese Proctor has not been shooting the ball as well of late as he did earlier in the season Proctors five of his last 23 from three heading into this game but just didnt give I Jackson just give didnt give him the chance to land just cracked him just a bit as he was coming down the Junior from Sydney Australia playing more off the ball this year the Blue Devils hoping to capitalize on his outside shooting and as Jay mentioned not shooting as well lately overall 39 from threee on the season averaging just over 10 points per game but overall hes had a great year and especially on the defense ENT hes been a a really good Defender for Duke with his ability to guard multiple positions and again the positional size that Duke has is really unlike any other team in the country it starts with a malawat at 72 in the middle but you know seon James looks like a 66 linebacker hes the point guard Proctor is 66 Gillis is 66 kiple 67 flag is 69 behind everybody on this team is huge and theyre versatile thats the important thing is they being able to switch one through five is a luxury Trimble gets a good look and the rebound down to Foster oh look at malow run the floor he just sprinted down Court Foster into the paint Scoops it up no good flag the follow out of bounds to Carolina like they got a foul on Cooper Music flat is first just the Third on due Carolina has committed five just past the Midway point of the first Applause half Luben hand off to kdo boy what a recovery Caleb Foster got a piece of it but then out of bounds back to the heels but they it feels like there are arms and legs everywhere for Duke R just every Duke Defender theyre not worried about their man theyre playing the ball and after this little back door play a switch and then a terrific recovery almost like a Veer switch by Caleb Foster just an excellent job to knock that ball away you look at other great defensive teams certainly Houston is certainly Iowa state is and there are others but in your mind Auburn is but is this the best defensive team in the country theyre theyre a very good half court defensive team theyre among the best teams Im not sure Id say the best but theyre right there like marquet is they forced a lot of turnovers one thing Duke doesnt do is they dont force turnovers but boy they really contest shots and make you take a lot of tough twos Luben trying to post on malawat back out to kdo shot clock at seven the drive and its swatted away the Cooper flag took away the three and then everybody took away the two Isaiah Evans into the game a guy who can light it up from the outside Isaiah Evans is a flamethrower Turn Around by flag malawat another Applause rebound well even when North Carolina has inside position on the glass Dukes just going right over the top of them they are just dominating the glass and dominating the paint at both ends of the Applause floor and as Im sure you can tell in front of your TVs it is some kind of loud right now at Cameron BAU the kick Trimble runs into a EV trying again has it knocked away but then Evans loses it out of bounds just great positioning on help right now every North Carolina ball handler is seeing more bodies than they are wood theres just nowhere to go Isaiah Evans was right there as a helps side Defender then knocks the ball away from Trimble just couldnt come up with it but just great defensive play five playing as one for Duke and thats the seventh turnover right there as kiple comes up with a steal the heels have turned it over seven times Duke just once Evans this is what he is in the game to do a bad Miss there but hes a 45 threepoint shooter yeah he he doesnt want to be taking challenge threes though that was a a challenge shot not a good one Jackson misses the three ball still loose and it belongs to Duke but Carolina just not able to come up with any loose ball any offensive rebound it has been all Duke on the glass screen by flag to nipple and that sails behind flag out of bounds a 21point lead here for the Blue Devils the Duke freshman have played with a great deal of poise Cooper flag got off to a great start Sonic Blockbuster as John calip Perry takes the Hogs to rup where of course he was the coach of of big blue for 15 Seasons won a national championship for final fours as coach a looks on here at Cameron things obviously didnt end quite as well for John caliper in election what do you think the scenes going to be like in a couple of hours I think its going to be wild and as you said emotional and not just emotional for John caliper but for some of the Arkansas players you know du Theo DJ Wagner vamir visich they all played for Kentucky and three of Arkansass recruits committed to Kentucky before changing their commitment when John caliper took the job a lot of discussion about what kind of a reception John caliper is going to get will it be positive or mixed or uh we well wait and see that is a Sonic Blockbuster and it is coming your way at 900 Eastern tonight on ESPN Corner three short by Trimble thats one of eight now for Carolina Carolina only made one pass on that possession theyve got to move the ball Duke 10 and0 in the ACC this is the first time since 0708 they have started lead play 10 and0 can nipple into the paint just kept on going with the little exchange with Proctor and kiple then kiple came off for the handoff and turned the corner to get downhill he is an underrated driver and just Carolina having so much trouble finding any openings any driving lanes and they turn it over again the Carolinas got to get tougher they got to get tougher to get open Ben Luben didnt hold his position I mean k canle just got right in front of him took that ball away that thats a toughness issue there you got to be tougher when youre posting up to hold that position not let your Defender just come around in front and knock that ball away Carolina did test itself extensiv in the nonconference portion of the season they beat Dayton they have played Auburn they played Michigan State they played Alabama they played Florida they played a bunch of really good teams the problem is they lost almost all of those those games again theyre one quad one win is a neutral cord win over UCLA they have had a lot of close games nine games that have been one possession games theyre 5 and four in those overall 13 and9 on the season and down 23 already in this one and Duke has just taking RJ Davis out of this game look at Pau but he couldnt finish follow wont go GRE cracks at it now RJ Davis and that wont go down and then a block by Applause flag so Carolinas already had five attempts here on this trip and a whistle on the drive dont know if this is a shot clock issue perhaps as Bert Smith and Tommy Morris here talking it over they they may take a look at an elbow that they thought was thrown on the Kad Drive I know that Duke was asking for that but earlier in the possession on a drive by Elliot Kau when he goes now Duke wants that looked at I dont know the the officials are walking over there now and I think thats why theyre doing it previous play is under review for a hostile act a hostile act good Eyes by by you did Elliot CAU commit a hostile act there on tyres Music Proctor so no call on the floor they cannot go to the Monitor and say its a common foul its going to be nothing or perhaps a flagrant one just trying to get Tyrese Proctor off of him uses that off arm to Ward him off but when it gets up around the head and neck area you never know what the officials are going to call You could argue that that kadoo was fouled but thats what theyre looking at his right Music arm and that noise you just heard is the crowd getting a look at it on the Jumbotron here at Cameron AS Roger AES continues to look at various angles Applause Music and now the three officials talking it over extremely experienced crew here M Roger SS Bert Smith and Tommy Morrison Applause it was 76 a few minutes into the game since then a 297 run for Duke shooting well forcing turnovers getting out in transition dominating on the glass really winning every aspect of the game well its duks defense thats been the most impressive thing of the game they have made it very difficult for North Carolina and the half court to get any open at all and North Carolinas found it difficult to get passes off but they havent been moving the ball thats one thing that North Carolina has to has to fix theyve got to start moving the ball because youre not going to cause the defense any problems just by dribbling in one spot and it looks like we may have a Music resolution maybe its a kind of a split decision here theyre looking well they might be looking at time now if theyre going to call if theyre going to call a flagrant theyre going to have to theyre going to have to adjust the Music time after a viw the ring on the FL we have a flun one foul in North Carolina number three therell be two shots and the ball so flaken one two shots in the ball for the Blue Devils Hubert Davis wondering what else can go wrong so far tonight Applause and as you said even if theres no intent you get an A forearm or an elbow up above the shoulders generally it is called a play one yeah theyre much more sensitive to when theres contact in that area I just Im surprised that the play went further from that that nobody saw it so Proctor at the line for two and cans and Bo to make it a 25point game and now its Duke Applause ball its a 90 run for Duke and Jay thats lasted almost 5 minutes Carolina has not scored a point in 5 Applause minutes well one of the reasons Dan you can count the passes they made in the half cour on one hand flag defended by Jaylen Withers who commits the foul the former Louisville Cardinal a fifthyear grad student whos kind of fallen out of the rotation in recent games just getting a few minutes here or there he is one guy Hubert Davis say physically he can match up sizewise with flag and I think at this point Hubert Davis is going to try anybody he can think up on Cooper blackag yeah hes searching a little bit for an answer but the last five games Jaylen Withers has only scored 11 points and seven rebounds in 35 minutes total they start Ben Allen Luben an undersized five really and they bring Jaylen Washington in Off the Bench a little bit of Withers uh they also have Kate Tyson a transfer from Belmont who was getting fairly regular minutes early but hes kind of falling out of the rotation as well Drake Powell whos really a wing has to play the four sometimes theyre theyre its just not a typical Carolina team team up front and boy did Armando Bott I mean how great was he for 5 years and how much easier did he make everything just with his presence at both ends of the Court we had Armando Bott last year Harrison Ingram you had forac Ryan out on the perimeter he had some threats but right now its so difficult for North Carolina theyre not generating any offense off the offensive glass Davis high off the glass and good the first points of the night for RJ Davis but look at the degree of difficulty for every shot for North Carolina relative to the quality of shot that Duke is getting on the other end thats just not sustainable for 40 minutes flag the screen James the drive knocked away Withers has it here come the heels in transition but guess who Malik Brown with another deflection and that shows how disruptive he can be North Carolina gets a break they have a chance to pass ahead and play ahead of the Duke defense for maybe the first time all night and Malik Brown who was ACC all defensive team at Syracuse disrupts it BR on Jackson now kdo tough one up no good and somehow kdo comes up with it while he was lying on the court and the initial signal is it is a held ball and the possession arrow will keep it with Carolina that has to be the below of the rim Rebound in the history of basketball he was prone when he got that rebound again another very difficult shot that is a below the rim Laughter rebound the do is going to Music sit and a bigger lineup for Carolina with the withers and Luben both in there but theyre still not bigger than Duke as Mala watch at 72 just check back in yeah John shy said you go big I see youre big Ill raise you I raise you come on malow on the ball 75 wingspan 98 standing reach up the inbounds Trimble couldnt finish it with point canle was able to put put pressure on it but thats not a shot youre going to see Seth Miss very often Carolina shooting 25 Duke 10 to can nipple to flag three no good and the rebound down to Applause Luben Hubert Davis talking about how teams are putting bigger Defenders on RJ Davis this year scoring down a bit shooting threo shooting is down this year for Davis he gets by malawat Kicks it to Withers who its a corner three jayen Withers had a terrific freshman year at Louisville averaged 10 points and about eight rebounds but hes been unable to match that since then yeah three years with the Cardinals two now with Carolina hes on flag Low cross screen by proor for flag pretty well defended by North Carolina James can nipple deep in the corner James in the corner now good ball Movement by the Blue Devils but the shot wont go and here come the heels tremble all the way and a foul on the floor going against Duke 241 to go the Blue Devils up 22 here in the first half against the tar Hills ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought back here to Cameron where the Blue Devils are in control the Jeep halftime report is not that far away Baylor what a comeback to be Kansas and the Trojan sneaking past the Spartans with a preview heres Jess guys its all about the Duke dominance right now Seth what are you seeing offensively thats giving them the edge the pace force and connectivity of this Duke offense is impressive and Cooper flag first 15 points he either scores or assists he took over the game in the first five minutes of the game but most if not all of their offense came from their defense Jay what are you seeing you know this is the most most disciplined Duke team Ive seen in a while with their size and their length you cant get into those gaps theyre very special to watch and theres nothing North Carolina can do thanks guys just thank you ree Davis and company coming your way on the Jeep halftime report 241 from now Seth Trimble at the line for Carolina the heels are actually on a 60 run right now but still Trail by 21 they are shooting only 29 flag got off to an unbel believable start the first four five minutes of the game Duke has led by as many as 27 at this moment flag 11 points five assists three rebounds two blocks and two steals I may differ just a bit with my learned colleague I think there is something North Carolina can do you they need to toughen up and make some passes on the offensive end and put a little bit more game pressure on dke good pass from kiple to Mason Gillis who got off to a very cold start this year shooting the three but has really heated up the last few weeks well hes really adjusted to the way Duke plays I mean he was seven of his last 13 from three coming into this game and hes a 40 career shooter from three of course a big part of that Purdue team that went to the national championship game a year ago inside two minutes to go in the half on some of these drives North Carolinas winding up flat on their back and thats not putting them in a great position for their transition defense Trimble knocks it away from can nipple I think they got canle fouling Trimble as he was headed the other way cuz he was headed for a a breakout yeah Roger a with a foul call on canle and then kind of a warning to the UNC bench as they all exploded Off the Bench and he asked them to sit back down then the heels have lost three of their last four lost at pit lost at wake lost at home to Stanford the only win in that stretch overtime at home against BC Davis hits the three much better Movement by North Carolina the dribble weave moves the defense and then RJ Davis able to pop out to the threepoint line if youre just going to dribble in one spot youre not going to find any openings against this Duke defense cuz their help side is so good can nipple to Mala wats boy just throw the ball up there and let him go get it after malawat sets a screen he is going right to the rim they can throw it up as high as they want to look at the traffic Davis finds Withers in the corner the three well short problem was they had two guys in the corner that Withers and tremble final minute of the first half seon James started better than 100 games at two lane and John sh admitted this morning he was excited to get him but hes even better than he thought he was they are getting so much from seion James little isolation on the right elbow lag misses the long two Gillis The Hustle but Davis has it ahead to Jackson and a foul is called dont forget a Sonic Blockbuster coming your way later on tonight at 9 Eastern John calip Perry is in the building at Ru Arena leading his Razer backs in there against UK of course Coach Cal 15 years four final fours One National Championship for big blue but now coaching for the other side its going to be a Applause scene Jackson at the line what a stretch he had hes cooled off a little bit recently but had a stretch as you all know Jay where he had 20 or more in six of seven games he is second in a lot of categories among ACC freshman because Cooper flag is number one but Jackson could to be an explosive player the offensive end hes had some big games he had 23 against Alabama 27 against Notre Dame and hes averaging close to 17 points per game in ACC play those his first two in this game looks like hes favoring his right leg he just looked over to the bench reached down tapped his right shin or cap and hes coming out of the Applause game we will keep an eye on that just 25 seconds left in the half and the Blue Devils can hold for the final shot and John Shire will use a timeout 4525 Blue Devils were back in 30 celebrate a year of groundbreaking artists making Unforgettable

our coverage begins with NBA Countdown at 8 Eastern Madison Square Garden when the Knicks are are good and theyre really good is electric I mean it is a fabulous atmosphere and nobody has played better than Jaylen Brunson hes been spectacular for the Knicks speaking of the NBA Jared McCain a blue double last year very talented rookie guard with the 76ers this year he is in attendance here tonight the leading candidate for rookie of the year when he was injured final seconds of the first half dke going five out really spreading the floor against North Carolina for this last possession flag defended by Davis got a big size Advantage tough turnaround goes right how about that play a spectacular pass fake to the corner that got the second Defender off him just shot right over RJ but you have to give Duke credit for an excellent defensive first half we are now ready for the second half of our Sonic Blockbuster matchup danman Jay bill is Jess Sims here at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Duram 22point lead for the Blue Devils black draws a double kicks to kipple and he gets inside and slams it no defense at the rim for the heels boy North Carolina puts two on the ball and yet again Cooper flag able to look over that double team and throw it Opposite but youre right nobody reacted to that drive by Khan canle Luben trying to post up kiple lost it and for Carolina their 10th turnover of the night and almost all of them J have been live ball turnovers and Duke has turned those into points at the other end well in the first half Duke had more steals than North Carolina had assists to nipple for three and Duke picking up right where they left off in the first half boy every time North Carolinas brought a double Duke has passed out of it and the second pass is where theyve had great success terrific pass on the screen roll down the middle Kau to Luben for the laye first bucket of the second half for the Tarheels North Carolina has not had many easy baskets that was one of the very few Duke a very balanced team top 10 of the nation in both offensive and defensive efficiency and both of those have been on display here tonight another good pass good close out by RJ Davis on KH canle now hes going to post him up got a big height advantage on him and draws a foul smart play by kiple when Davis took away that drive and he passed it back out he just took RJ Davis down on the post and decided to use his size anytime you got Elliot Kad or RJ Davis switching off I think you have to take him down in the post that goes for canle but alsoon James and it was Luben coming over to help who was called for the foul itll be his second as canle goes to the Music line and lubins going to sit just a minute 42 into the half Luben out Jaylen Washington checks in for Hubert Davis Duke Shot 14 free throws in that first half north Carolina only six and thats a departure for a North Carolina team usually Carolina gets to the free throw line and they have a free throw advantage that has not been the case in this game and not really been the case this Applause year Gau guarded by flag now a reset to Davis Jaylen Washington tried to post up malow just pushed him right off his spot just more physical RJ DAV is over malawat buries a three his second of the N gutsy over the 72 Long Reach of malawat with that stepback that is the 322nd made threepointer of RJ Daviss tar Hillel career he is the North Carolina leader obviously the fifth year because of Co but still a magnificent 5year career really for RJ Davis in Chapel Hill yeah RJ Davis gets the advantage on the switch and that little step back right over the outstretch arms of Kanan malawat not an easy shot but its been a season of difficult shots for RJ Davis so now flag at the line for dke and as you said you talked about it early in the game getting to the line at a very high rate in ACC play it seems he is more decisive a little more aggressive and forceful the last month or so than say he was at times earlier in the season I think thats exactly the word Ive when he caught that ball against a smaller Defender he just ripped through one dribble and hes to the rim and thats what caused that foul was the decisive nature of that move maybe earlier in the season he might have played with it tried to cross over two three dribbles and that could get him into a little bit of trouble Kau gets it back from Washington left alone 17 ft away and he knocks it down a little better action from North Carolina a little more movement in their attack B screen malawat kiple finds James in the corner and the three will go boy the spacing so good from duke youre worried about malow and his roll to the basket that opens the crosscourt pass for the easy three from seon James how about Duke seven for 13 from threepoint range as Trimble answers at the other end really good cut by Trimble turning curling and really turning the corner to get downhill and North Carolina having a little more success in the second half of attacking the rim Trimble guy you talked about how the hes the leading rebounder on this team how unusual that is for a 63 guard hes coming off successive double doubles against BC and pit 18 12 in one game 10 and 12 in the other Washington kept it alive trimbles got Applause it t to shoot Davis again with a malawat on it cant shake him good footwork by the big man kadu into traffic wild shot off the glass and flagged the rebound great challenge by cion James at The Rim just make kados score over K nipple and one RJ Davis had a hand on the ball but K canle showed some great strength to not only get that shot off but to complete it off the glass watch he has his hand on the ball but canle just goes right through his arm and completes that play kiple now with 18 nine of them in the first 338 here in the second half he is the highest scorer in the Applause game seon James doing a really nice job in negotiating those screens and getting over the top Jackson a step back three and the rebound to flag Ian Jackson has had a quiet night for the heels and no offensive forward coverage for North Carolina James is bumped by Jackson 26point lead Duke with a Timeout on the floor here early in the second half ESP third season of the kid Captain program by the Shire family where they honor a child receiving Care at the Duke Childrens Hospital earlier tonight Duke honored London Cannon an incredible sixyearold who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on his fourth birthday but after 2 and 12 years of chemo he found out he was cancerfree just 2 months ago and tonight he I cant even tell you how loud it was in Cameron this soldout crowd showed so much love to this little boy and it brought tears to so many peoples eyes as he rang in Jess thank you wonderful stuff such a heartwarming moment and Jess is exactly right its been loud at so many different moments in this building on this night nothing compared to that moment hi nipple now with Applause 20 he has had a spectacular game when he gets hot and he can get hot in a hurry hes got a lot of game hes not just a shooter hes much more than that RJ Davis will step in and knock down the Baseline jumper and hes heating up hes now got 10 well anytime you close out ideally you want to take away the shot and the drive but with RJ Davis you definitely want to take away that threepoint shot Proctor lays it in Duke is just cutting up North Carolina right now just a terrific cut by Tyrese Proctor going up to set a screen and then he just peeled out of it right to the rim this matches the blue Devils largest lead of the night at 28 Davis sow CED to the board John shyers said recently he was happy that the Blue Devils got pushed a couple of times recently their last two games against Wake Forest and NC State as as we have a held ball they are not getting pushed here tonight the league is not that strong this year they did get pushed their last couple of games but boy they have been dominant tonight and really LED uh for much of the time by Khan kiple well kiple just taking advantage watch it Tyrese Proctor goes to set a screen at an angle and then just slips right out of it for an easy bucket not enough pressure on the ball but anytime K canle has been guarded by RJ Davis if Elliot kados switches off onto him hes taking them right down in the post and just going to bully Applause them the nipple with 20 already tonight his season High 25 against Miami on the 14th of January and Seth Trimble just limped off the floor to the end of the bench it looks like something with his left Applause leg so it is Davis Washington Withers Jackson and Powell in the game right now for Carolina Carolina running a couple staggers on the right side of the floor but Duke doing a great job switching to defend it and Malik Brown getting right in the passing Lane didnt let Davis make the pass you wanted to make Jackson and will try another step back hell hit it and a foul on Gillis this an outstanding individual play by Ian Jackson with the step back and then the foul by Gillis but North Carolina just not able to make very many passes you have to make a great individual play in order to get a bucket nice little crossover and then the step back and just trying to put pressure on the shot Mason Gillis didnt give him the opportunity to land Jackson a guy who can get to the rim with the best of them but we shouldnt Overlook the fact hes a good threepoint shooter as well 38 on the season hes a terrific scorer North Carolina bringing some full court pressure trying to trap and scramble flag gets it over to kiple Gillis the extra pass to Proctor into the paint and down with a rebound Washington Cooper flag almost took away that pass from Jaylen Washington hes got a terrific Court sense both ends of the floor SE TR Trimble by the way has left the court now and gone back to the Carolina locker room Applause Jackson driving this time into the chest of Proctor and its an offensive foul you dont see nearly as many charges as there used to be be the way the rule has been redefined but a proctor obviously got there in plenty of time well he was already there he just never left and when his man left the lane Tyrese Proctor stayed there because he read the drive so he didnt have to come over from the weak side he was already there third on in Jackson turn around for flag hes got 16 he has the complete game as complete a freshman that has ever played at Duke Trimble by the way now making his way back to the end of the Carolina bench as RJ Davis throws a foul and one of the things about Cooper flag he scored that last bucket for Duke you know there have been some Uber talented freshmen at Duke in the last 40 years Uber talented he can match most of them if not all with his talent level but his competitive spirit is at a level that most players let alone freshman can reach I mean I think the full package hes as good a freshman has has ever played here yeah the the word you heard most often early in the season when you talk to John shy and the other coaches on The Duke staff was competitive he lead this has been a a a much discussed note about flag and its a doozy he currently leads to in points rebounds assists Steals and blocks he is not a locked to do it at the end of the season and either steals or blocks but just the fact that he is right there in all five categories as an 18yearold is amazingly impressive and sometimes you hear competitive and you think oh the guy hates to lose and he wants to win in pingpong and checkers it doesnt matter and that may be true in this situation Im not saying its not but Im talking about on the floor like he competes at a high level every play and his basketball intelligence his awareness is all part of that you just dont see guys like this very often it really stands out I think the population number is wrong its down to 3132 since he left and came to dur everything you heard about him everything you read about him he has lived up to and in some cases perhaps even exceeded so far this season and he and Janai broom would you say are the top two right now for National player of the year yeah Id say cam Jones and Marquette is in there too but I think those two are the top candidates and Tyrese frocker is having an outstanding game he has really bounced back from the last five games not shooting it particularly well and this game hes done everything well Auburn by the way got a road to win at Old Miss today another double double for Janai broom Auburn has 13 quad one wins yeah its absurd its a huge difference because of how strong the SEC is and how much the ACC really struggled a nonconference play Auburn now with 13 quad one wins Dukes got five and Duke as it stands right now would only have three more quad one opportunities Auburn I believe would have eight more just the the strength of schedule look out James from kiple the strength of schedule difference for the S the top teams in the SEC uh is notable because that league is historically good this year Applause Duke is just getting whatever they want on the offensive end you know theyre playing that five out theyre getting fade screens ball screens cuts and theyve got their largest lead of the Music night without their starting point guard Lamont Butler who is injured yep and that means that Kentucky is not going to be able to put the same kind of pressure on the ball at the point of attack that they normally can so I think Arkansas has really got to try to punch the paint and drive the ball you saw Seth Trimble back into the game another Carolina turnover flag takes it away from Withers you show him the ball and he takes it from him turnovers have been a problem from the getgo for the heels tonight theyve turned it over 13 times to just five for Duke now six for Duke and Luben ahead to Powell who will slam it first points of the night for Drake Powell yeah one of the few transition opportunities for North Carolina and North Carolina is not a turnover forcing team theyre trying to get some full court pressure get a trap but Duke if they break it they need to break it to score can nipple going up to the rim but met there by Luben who knocked it away lubins got a long Wings span about 71 Proctor and blocked by Luben Saved By Davis John shy felt Davis was out of bounds but they play Applause on Trimble more of a driver than a shooter this year not shooting the three this year as well as he did last year and Carolina turns it over again well after that steal by Cooper flag Duke had a breakout and a terrific vertical contest by V Allen Luben he followed It Up by blocking a shot by Tyrese Proctor boy two blocks on one trip Mala watch back here the game for brown for the Blue Devils North Carolina looks like theyre dropping back in a two3 Zone they played a little bit of that in the first half and Duke was able to get it into the middle of the zone and have some good success against it especially with offensive rebounding it is something they really havent done all season worked on that practice yesterday Hubert Davis said we just had it in our back pocket for a couple of weeks just in case Davis tough fade away and the rebound to canle Jaylen Withers is able to block that shot on the defensive end and after the Miss Carolinas going to be back to manto man flag wide open hits the three 19 now for Coop flag there no resistance on that three at all Duke with 18 assists on 25 made baskets Davis the drive whips it into the corner for Powell Luben will go to the line Music a Cooper flag on the offensive end just after that little brush screen up top just a miscommunication two on the ball and Jaylen Withers couldnt recover in time to put any pressure on that shot he just waled into Music it Duke now 9 for 15 from threepoint range tonight lubben at the line for Carolina tomorrow afternoon Hannah hulo and number three Notre Dame at Louisville coverage begins at noon Eastern Hidalgo continues to put up phenomenal numbers in her sophomore season for the Irish better than 25 points per game better than four steals per game and almost six boards per game as well then Allen Luben started his career at Notre Dame playing for Mike Bray then when Mike Bray left Notre Dame he transferred to Vanderbilt to play for Jerry Stackhouse and then when Stackhouse was let go then Ben Allen lubben transferred here to North Carolina Kate Tyson making his first appearance of the night for the tar Hills again a guy a transfer from Belmont Big Score there had some good moments earlier in the year for Carolina has kind of fallen out of the rotation didnt play it all Tuesday against pit Isaiah Evans doing what Isaiah Evans does and Cooper flag doing what he does you bring a double at him he has picked those doubles apart with diagonal crosscourt passes assist number seven for flat Davis no Luben over malawat benel Luben has been much more aggressive in this second half on both ends of the floor after the make Carolina back in the two3 zone putting Cooper flag a playmaker in the middle he can score in there but also pass and the Seven assists he has tonight that matches a season high for the Freshman Proctor no look to malawat and down with the rebound Davis 30o lead for Duke Withers with the left hand a tough move a little Euro Step and then the use of the left off the glass over malow that was a heck of a shot by Jaylen Withers and its a huge lead but Hubert Davis is trying something different than hes done in recent weeks hes got really three forwards out there right now in Withers Tyson and Luen weve seen a lot of one big four guard looks from Hubert Davis recently just trying something different cuz the other stuff wasnt working FL no and again Davis the loose ball out of bounds it belongs to the heels and Withers may be shaken up 732 to go here in the second half it has been all dup all night long and two of their freshman are having huge nights Cooper flag and P kipple have combined for 39 are in the building for a Sonic Blockbuster against egga o transfer from Oklahoma double figures in every single game this year for big blue Kentucky ranked 12th in the nation uh theres going to be a lot to will look in on in that Cas Arkansas and Kentucky should be a good one the SEC so compelling every single weekend we talked about Tennessee the big bounceback win over Florida Auburn got a road win at Old Miss and how about Missouri and what Dennis Gatess team has been they were winless in the SEC last year 0 and 18 they went to the hump today and won by 27 the tigers are having a great year and in that Kentucky Arkansas game tonight following this Duke North Carolina game a player to watch is going to be Amari Williams the transfer the Lefty from Drexel three out of his last five games hes had double doubles for Mark Pope hes a playmaking big guy you and I will venture back at country next week well be at Auburn as the Gators will be there Corner three for Drake Powell Carolina getting a little bit better action and being able to punch the paint draw help and then kick it out to Drake pal Drake Pals going to be a really good player hes so talented Carolina sticking with that two3 zone black sneaks behind it and got fouled they just ran a cutter along the Baseline Isaiah Evans and then Kanan malawat set a screen down low that freed up Cooper flag on that right block you know there are a lot of ways to attack a Zone you can penetrate the gaps of it make two play one and play out of it you can overload it and certainly you can screen it and that was a bit of the screen and over load together and you spoke earlier about how often a flag has been getting to the line that was his eighth free throw attempt of the night he is 5 for8 so far 81 from the line on the season and there have been a number of nights like this for flag where he has just filled up so many different parts of the stat sheet hes now got 21 points seven assists six rebounds three Steals and two blocks its going to be really difficult decision if National Player of the Year voting ended today I would think Janai broom of Auburn would win the vote but by the end of the year Cooper flag is really shooting up the charts its going to be a very difficult decision because I dont I dont see neither Duke nor Auburn going anywhere at the top of the poll well let me ask you this when you look at Team resumés teams get credit for playing a better schedule strength of schedule do you give broom and this is not flags fault its not John jys fault its not Dukes fault but do you give broom a little extra nudge if the numbers are very similar because Auburn has to play a tougher schedule than Duke maybe a little I I dont I dont really worry too much about about the numbers part of it because you right now Cooper flag scoring more points but broom his impact on games has been substantial as has thats why Im saying its going to be such a difficult decision but right now if it ended today for me it would be Janai broom but its a its a close fall and theres a long way to go Broms also come back from a couple of injuries this year in both cases it felt like he came back quicker maybe than was expected Gau gets it up on the glass but cant finish it flag down with it and of course Auburns only lost this year here in this building to do uh in the ACC SEC challenge back at the end of November yeah one of only two losses for the SC in that challenge it turned out not to be a challenge it was 142 owl ahead to Trimble for the lay in Dukes got an interesting game next Saturday you can see it at 6 Eastern on ESPN again there arent that many teams who you would figure would really be able to challenge the Blue Devils although Anything Can Happen a duks going to Clemson next Saturday and Brad brownells got another good team this year he does have a good team Chase Hunter having a terrific year hes averaging over 17 a game Ian shefflin one of the best rebounders in the country Jaden Zachary who transferred in for Boston College that a really good year Clemson is a good team theyre solid Powell with a bucket for the heels and it is down to 21 in a game in which at one point Duke led by 32 and John shy will use a timeout 446 to go here in Music Durham Blue Devils a perfect 10 and0 in ACC play and quite obviously on their way to 11 and0 heres a look at the remaining schedule for Duke the regular season schedule per kenpom they are favored to win every game the closest game if you will according to how strong each team is for kenpom is the game next week at Clemson uh of note there that is not a misprint that that is real they are stepping out of League Play theyll play Illinois uh later on in February at Madison Square Garden John Shire likes the idea of getting out of conference they always love playing a neutral sight game up in the New York City area and again the ACC not providing that many skip challenges for Duke but it will be a good one when they take on the Align yeah Illinois is very good I mean they have lost three of four lost in Michigan State and Maryland they just got beat in overtime at Nebraska but Casper yakon is an outstanding young player that Dukes going to have to deal with so thats I think thats smart scheduling to play that out of conference game late in the season Drake Powell with another bucket its a 19point game couple of interesting results of the ACC today Louisville which has been playing extremely well Pat Kels team has been one of the big stories really in the country but they went to Georgia Tech and lost today and Wake Forest picked up a much needed quality win a very close game as they beat pit at home Bo Hunter Salis in that game against pit made some really tough shots toward the end of that game to seal it for Wake Forest wakes got a solid record in the league and again for Carolina assuming they lose this game they were called to one and nine in Quad one and their two biggest games of the Season may be their next two games as they will pay at home to pit and then at Clemson next Saturday and Monday 331 to go here at Cameron Carolinas made it closer but its still Kobe bro one of the best Shooters in the country leading Kentucky against John caliper Arkansas Razer backs it is a Sonic Blockbuster and it is coming your way 30 minutes from now on ESPN so how about these freshmen Cooper flag and P can nipple the last time two freshmen each had 20 points and five assists in the same game against the North Carolina Tar Heels it was 2010 it was Nolan Smith and John uh John sh not freshman last time two Duke players both had 20 and five in a game against carolinaa Nolan Smith and John shy in Shys senior season and an eventual Championship season for the Blue Devils Back in 2010 pretty good company for the Freshman flag and canle well both flag and kiple play complete Applause games Carolina going with the full court pressure Duke beating it not to score but just to get it across not theyre not slowing it down but theyre just not going to be in a hurry its an 110 run for Carolina over the last 315 or so if youre joining us late this game has not been this close in a long time Duke is led by as many as 32 and it felt like that for much of the night Proctor with the shot clock expiring got the rim and flag got the Music rebound its almost like North Carolina thought they had a shot clock violation and stopped pursuing the ball Cooper flag was able to beat everybody to it and a foul committed by Tyson and thats going to send canibble to the line if youre Hubert Davis barring a miracle here this is going to be four losses in five games and the win was at home in overtime over Boston College what where what do you do where do you turn how do you try to turn this around well you keep teaching uh hes talking about details and discipline and about consistency and look I I think North Carolinas better than their record do I think this is a great basketball team I dont but theyre much better than their record and theyre going to have to be theyre theyre inconsistency hasnt even been consistent some games they turn it over other games they dont shoot it well other games they dont rebound uh its a and theyve been in so many of their games theyve had leads late had a lead late against pit they had a lead late in Allen Fieldhouse Kansas lead against Florida those are all good teams they just werent able to close Tysons three off the side of the backboard and again Carolinas next two games could make or break their season pit and Clemson they need some quality wins after that theyve got six in a row against teams in the bottom half of the league and then they finish up at home in the regular season against the Blue Devils in Chapel Hill March the eth and it sounds simple Dam but North Carolinas got to get tougher with the way they run offense they got to make harder cuts and they got to screen better and just be a little bit more physical in every aspect of things top of the hour Arkansas Kentucky John calip Perrys returned to upup its a Sonic Blockbuster when its coming up next as Elliot Pau gets knocked to the Music court been a a great first year for pop coaching it his Alma Mo and again the energy the emotion maybe emotion is a better word than energy uh its going to be something else said Ru Arena it probably is already and youre going to see it soon Applause enough Kau trying to drive by James off the back of the iron James Brown is into the game freshman out of Aurora Illinois came down with a rebound but we have a call going against Carolina they called it on Kad saying he pulled down cion James after that shot so he was trying to be physical getting into the defender and then when he put the shot up the official said he pulled seon James down thats where the foul came Applause from another sellout of course here here at Cameron 9314 and they have enjoyed every moment of it and heres a guy who has enjoyed more Duke Carolina moments than just about anybody you are looking at Freddy Kiger and he is whats known as uh the official statistician here and this is Freddys 100th Duke Carolina game going way back to when he was at Carolina Dean Smith was the coach and he did stats for the program and that hes worked for every television entity you can think of over the last really 40 years or so I would think uh he is an icon in the ACC as is John Madre sitting to my left the statistician with us up here in the booth but congratulations to Freddy Kiger I dont know how many people Jay can say theyve been at 100 Duke Carolina games and if you know anything about the ACCC you know Freddy ker well Freddy Kyer is just a beautiful human being and he is an ency opedia yes of ACC history as is our partner and friend John Madre y but whenever we put up the graphics saying hey the last 100 games you know Duke is 51 and 49 against North Carina Freddy Kyer seen them all Proctor behind the back beautiful feed and brown the reverse Coach K his wife Mickey getting up from their seats watching better than 39 minutes of this one as his Protege John shy is on his way to a very impressive win over the Char heels yeah for 42 years Coach K never left the building early he he had to stay right the nipple out brown out flag out in the final minute of the game again a 20point lead in a game that really hasnt felt that close for very much of it this is another impressive statement by Duke unquestionably one of the best teams in the country no question and theyre the best team in the ACC with a legitimate shot to go unbeaten in conference play still a long way to go but they have a legit shot to do it they will be 11 and0 in League Play after this one the last team to go undefeated in the ACC the Duke Blue Devils 1998 99 Elton Branch ra langden William Avery Cory MTI Chris Carell Shane Bader pretty good group just a few seconds separating the game clock and the shot clock Proctor banked it in somehow from a very difficult angle thats like the shot Steven Ashworth hit today to beat Villanova Ian Jackson will lay it in at the other end and that will do it Duke making another statement
