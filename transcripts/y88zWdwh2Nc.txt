key to their success this season and Tyree Appleby at the controls here the opening tap won by the Demon Deacons of Wake Forest in the 168th meeting all time between Wake Forest and North Carolina state is off and running here at the Joel both of these two teams really like spacing so they can create dribble penetration and also set up their threepoint shooting the feed down low for Cameron Hildreth results in an offensive foul thats a big call because Hildreth is really one of the most improved players in the ACC and really important this Wake Forest team you dont ever like to see a player of that caliber pick up a chief foul in the first minute of the game North Carolina State trying to continue their Good Vibes in Mojo trying to win their sixth game in the last seven tries and a threepointer from turquavion Smith they cannot let him get loose Smith can score from every spot on the floor Appleby Hildreth Monsanto Carr and Marsh the five for the Demon Deacons as Monsanto gets fouled and it looked like he was behind the line Greg Gantt may have gotten a piece of him Monsanto always is behind the line he is range is in the building hes a really deep shooter but one of the things that NC State does such a great job is defensively they can switch theyre going to double check to see if Monsanto was indeed behind the line it looks like it looked like it was a probably as close to the line as he ever as hes going to get today he is not afraid to fill it up from Deep hes a team leader in May threes and he plays so well within this lineup because you know wake has the the big guys that they really play off of with Carr and Marsh and those guys can rim run they can also set screens and then we got Appleby who likes to push the ball how would you like to be a point guard and have a shooter on one side of you in the driver on the other side of you in transition youre awful dangerous and thats what this Wake Forest team offers up people when they come down and transition Wake Forest trying to rebound after a loss to Pitt on Wednesday 8179 as we get one more look at wow you may not be able to slide a credit card in between his foot and that line thats tight it has really tight I one of the things the officials never ever came over and asked my opinion they always told me youre going with the two so it will be just a twoshot foul the officials today Ted Valentine Tim clockerty and AJ Desai thats a big time crew we have here today Santo good on the first free throw attempt 81 percent shooter from the line but in part because hes such an active shooter from Deep coach he doesnt get a lot of trips to the freethrow line no he doesnt and thats one of the things that threepoint shooter sometimes suffer from because they dont get a chance to get to the line Music Smith Joyner Marcel Gantt and burns the jumper from Joyner missed Jack Clark is still out with the core injury hes out indefinitely so they have to continue to shuffle that lineup and well get a foul on the floor as Monsanto trying to approach the paint Applause Joyner who missed that shot right there he hes on a hot streak right now he has really picked up his scoring the last six ball games foulon Smith his first into Monsanto who will launch Gantt tracks down the loose ball Smith range from anywhere seemingly knocks it down to cuevion Smith six points early a good sign for the wolf pack but his energy has really helped transform this North Carolina State team this year theyve made a more aggressive offensively and has helped them defensively to create turnovers and play at a faster pace the accs leading scorer has come out on fire earlier Hildreth missing the fade away and the loose ball cant had it and then dribbled it off his leg out of bounds and that Im sure will not please Kevin Keats coach Keys has done a tremendous job this year last year they fell off first time in his career hes had a team fall off like that hes done a tremendous job at NC State and the thing that he talks about this team is is resiliency the way that it handles toughness and difficult situations Monsanto drills a jumper to extend the point total for Wake Forest but theyre still down by three 63 early on by the way the Heats Improvement also in the ACC win total just four wins last year in the ACC six so far and weve still got a ways to go as the ball will go back over to the Demon Deacons off the Miss well I can tell you last year really bothered coach Keith hes never gone through a season like that he retooled his whole staff he brought in some pieces that he thought he needed to do and he dedicated the off season to get this NC States team back to prominence in the beat and in the bid for an NCAA tournament Hildreth will bring it down Appleby trying to find some space crossover three thats good plus the foul Tyree Appleby wow I told you better hold on to your seats these two guys have unlimited range in their athleticism allows them to take tough shots and make tough shots look at that going hard off the dribble pulling up behind the three and knocking it down a lot of people say he reminds him a little bit of Allen Iverson but I dont know if Alan could shoot with that kind of range but certainly Appleby is an exciting player fourpoint play gives the lead to Wake Forest Casey Marcel picks up the foul and this is a game coach Clark that you definitely have to be careful with if youre defending some of these threepoint shooters they missed by Burns Applause Monsanto will pull it but thats an air ball Steve Forbes the 2022 ACC coach of the year had a refreshing talk with him earlier today and he is Healy in tune with this club I tell you what hes an incredible coach I tell you he reminds me a little bit of Bobby criminals who I work for and that hes so honest with his players his players love to play for him he comes from a very humble coaching background has never forgotten his start from Junior College and to where he is now awake and he really enjoys being here a Miss from Smith stays with the wolf path Applause and its interesting talking to him about his team from a season ago the team thats on the floor right now this is a much younger team not as much as experience or hes as he said not as calloused as the team from last year but this team still has some room for growth for sure well I think one of the things theyve done here at wake is really develop players and they brought the very best out of them and thats coach Ford I think he spends a lot of time with his players individually which allows him to push them on the floor one player doesnt need a lot of development DJ Burns very effective offensively into the starting lineup post the injury to dushan mahorsich Applause Joyner will fire the long Miss Tracked Down by Gantt I think is really important that teams kind of get into a rhythm right now these guys are coming out throwing Haymakers at each other shooting threes and off the dribble I think they got to settle down and really execute and run some really good half court offense Monsanto all the way in with a layup attempt Burns grabs a loose ball wolf pack have the numbers basanto behind the play flip shot to the rim no good from Smith and theyre able to dodge a bullet Applause Bill drift and another turnover the second of the day so far for Wake Forest Marcel gets a step drives and scores with a right hand I know wake likes to push it and Coach Forbes tell him to slow it down but wake has a great half court offense they cant get away from that and get baited into a game with NC State just kind of running up and down because I dont think theyre really built for that as much as NC State is loose ball foul on the way to Gantt out of the timeout threepoint lead for Wolfpack great grab right there and a big time finish NC State loves the Run Music Subway keeps up in the game with the subway series an AllStar media delicious summer Jones and Perry Clark back with you in WinstonSalem North Carolina the defense of North Carolina State one of the top defensive units in the ACC and Perry what have you seen out of their defense so far and how has it impacted the Wake Forest offense well what they do they put a lot of pressure on the ball and because theres pressure on the ball guys tried to drive and they do a good job of helping in the gaps so they dont give you a clear shot to the basket and it creates a lot of turnovers because of the pressure on the ball and the rotation Ernest Ross and Ebenezer dewana into the game for North Carolina State now Waco said a lot of ball screens a lot of dribble handoffs to try to create confusion defensively three to shoot for Applebee down to two fires it up a little short the battle for the loose ball taken by Smith Applause Joyner gets a step cant knock down the jumper grabbed Inside by Ross and the battle won by Ernest Ross will lead to a couple of free throws you know Joyner scored 19 points in his last six games so he what comes in here on a little bit of a hot lunch and sometimes you can get excited because hes had two really good looks and it hasnt gone down for him but hell settle down hes done a really good job of leading this NC State team Andrew Carr picks up the foul as Ross misses long on the first freethrow attempt Joyner has been on quite the Run for North Carolina State over the last six games 19 points per and theyre already strong offensively with turquavion Smith but Smith and Joyner when they get going very tough to stop and they are and they play so well together but sometimes when youre on one of those type of runs you think everything you throw up is going to go in and you rush yourself a little bit Hildreth couldnt get that one to drop track down by Joyner in the wolf pack Joyner will try it again a little short the control held by Carr see I think its really important right now to wait to get aggressively offensively and getting some sort of action and movement that defense popping up again for North Carolina State a floater the other way is no good well have an offensive foul so the basket will not count Applause and itll be the second picked up by terquavion Smith and hell head out thats a huge foul right there there you see him on the floater and he goes in Appleby does a good job of taking the charge sometimes you try to teach your young guys to go straight up straight down and cause guys like the floaters Derek but Im telling you a lot of times it can get you in trouble especially in traffic it did there for Smith hes got two and he goes to the bench scoring drought continues for Wake Forest missed on Sixth straight held scoreless for nearly four minutes now again wake likes to use the ball screens roll the big guys and then try to dribble drive out of that Williamson whos just into the game shot clock late again Hildreth fires from Deep its an air ball and thats a shot clock violation so North Carolina States defense as we talked about very stingy to start three turnovers forced by the wolf pack well what theyre doing is theyre keeping the ball out of the paint and theyre keeping the ball out of the paint by switching on the ball screens or going underneath the ball screen and then helping from the weak side and if you can keep the ball from going in the paint you eliminate a lot of things offensively teams like to do fourpoint lead for North Carolina State Applause important right now for Joyner to step up he and Marcel to now take over some of the offensive for because of the fact Smith is out Korean passes into the game to replace Smith one to shoot for Joyner cant hit rebound by Ross Ross hops in and scores Ernest Ross with the righty layups hes got three and thats where hes really picked up his game he does a lot of the dirty stuff and I say dirty stuff you dont call his number on a lot of plays and hes still able to produce points for you three from the wing is Good from Andrew Carr so Carr knocking down the triple and that ends the scoring drought for the Demon Deacons car is really versatile he can pick and roll he can pick and pop but he can does a really good job of spreading the defense because of his threepoint shooting Marcel long three over Monsanto cant hit the rebound taken by Damian Williamson you know Wake Forest is doing a good job in their half court defense Monsanto along three counters hes the type of guy you have on his on your team that wherever he shoots from you just say okay get the next one because he is played with a lot of confidence and he really picks up this weight team averages most made threes per game in the ACC three per three on the other end no good High game is 13 great crowd on hand here in WinstonSalem Williamson underneath that contestant by dewana Marcel wide open from three tipped controlled by Damien Bradford Appleby elusive scoop lay up and down thats what you like about Applebee he can play with different gears they came down in transitioning they didnt have a shot right away he took his time he probed the defense and wound up getting an easy opportunity for weight after a four minute scoring draft for Wake Forest 80 Run for the Demon Deacons thats why coach Forbes said you know hes gonna he lets Appleby Go he lets him play at his Pace because he understands how not only the score but also get his teammates involved a buzzer beater to beat the shot clock by jarkel Joyner his first points of the day Applause back and forth we go these are two teams that can fill it up from Deep near turnover but track down by Monsanto hell fire away and hit again this is like a heavyweight fight because theyre getting their shots not out of the offense theyre getting their shots both teams offer individual moves and both of these two teams have really good offensive sets and patterns Joyner trying to find some space cant against Carr and a foul back and forth we go 1716 a lead for the demon deacon for Wake Forest since the passing of Billy Packer a great on the floor for Wake Forest but Perry also a broadcasting giant as well without question he was an ambassador for the ACC he was an ambassador for college basketball Saturday afternoons you wanted to hear him and Al McGuire talk about the game he did a great job when ACC was at his Pinnacle telling the story and making it personal a relationship between player to player and player to coach unbelievable Talent unbelievable for the ACC you cant write a story about the ACC without Billy Packer being a main part of that in the growth of this league a true Giant in college basketball was a fixture calling the final four for years thats going to be a huge huge loss for the college basketball Community without a doubt and certainly we want to reach out to his son Mark who does an unbelievable job a great colleague and its a tremendous loss 1716 lead for Wake Forest the Miss by Sir quavion Smith and thats the thing about Billy Packer so many people associate him with broadcasting he was obviously a big part of the basketball program here as a player for Wake Forest leading into the final four in 1962 I saw a tweet that said that bones McKinney finally got his point guard back in heaven and so uh you know Billy just did its such a growth for this game and the way that he did it he made people interested in it he cared about the players and could tell the story Applebee floats it towards the rim because he got it in the hands of marsh Williamson three no good tipped around by caulk along the loose ball foul coming up you know not to get off but wait for it to sell this institution how many schools and has not had produced Chris Paul and Tim Duncan I mean two alltime greats in the NBA and this community is really a very special one turquavion Smith just picked up his third foul he came right back into the game out of the timeout and he is on his way back out of the game thats really tough right there uh coach was taking a gamble you know a lot of times you say why do you play a guy that has two fouls a lot of times it has to do with how you practice um what you think his mentality is and certainly Smith getting his third really affects this NC State team heres our womens college basketball quadruple header for tomorrow Louisville is at noon Eastern then the 16th ranked blue Duke Blue Devils take on the 24 ranked Florida State Seminoles followed by number 15 North Carolina State and Clemson at four and number 12 Virginia Tech and Virginia cap today should be another great afternoon of Coupes on acc Network and the ESPN app threepoint or excuse me one point lead held here by Wake Forest as Appleby in the lane makes it a threepoint game youre going to see NC State right now uh there probably wont be in transition as much as they were when Smith was in the game so theyve got to go more to the half court sets which means getting the ball inside the burns trying to play inside out Burns floater hook and DJ burns with four hes a big strong body and its tough to get him off the lane hes always been a talented player and right now coach Keats has gotten the best out of him to Mark Matthew Marsh getting on the score sheet for the first time today emphatically well now these two teams are settling in right now theyre getting shots out of their sets right now Burns cant get it to go and the loose ball corralled by the Demon Deacons Applause in the lane Applebee knocked to the floor and fouled threepoint lead fourwake Forest lots of Hang Time Marsh in the Demon Deacons out in front Music a lot of individual shooting almost challenging the other player there you see Joyner knocking down a three there you see weight coming back with another three Appleby right there out of transition just penetrating and scoring you havent seen a lot of set offense or trying to get points out of their set stuff they both teams have been living off of their transition and into and letting the guys go individually I think this game is starting to settle down right now especially with Smith being out where they both teams are going to have to depend more on their half court sets if youre just joining us turquavion Smith the leading scorer in the ACC has picked up three fouls in this first half lets go back to the methodology there two fouls typically youll hold a guy out for a long period of time depending on the situation of course but what did you think theyre bringing him back in so soon well again you know I think you can go either way I think is how the mentality of the the player is and what youre used to doing and how you handle those type of situations in practice and certainly they felt hes played with that before and could handle it burns turns left and scores DJ Burns so effective at The Rim hes got six hes going to become a major factor especially in this half I think he and Marcel are the two guys that really are going to have to step up for NC State right now and scoring wise and I say that because of the fact that youre running good half court offense you can go through those two guys Corner three missed a rebound for North Carolina State Burns previously the Big South Player of the Year in Winthrop before the transfer to North Carolina State as darkell Joyner and and one on the way for Joyner to try to tie the game up you know one of the things coach Keith talked to me about last night and you today is the resiliency of this group when youre asking whats the biggest difference he just talked about their ability to pick themselves up and to come from difficult and handle difficult situations this is certainly one of those today Joyner no good on the free throw the foul was charged Bobby Clinton Applause still a onepoint game at 2524 match up between the first and fourth ranked offenses in the ACC with the wolf pack at the top of the Heap averaging 79 points per game Monsanto steps into a three draws air right there on the spot though but the contest after Clinton had a shot at it but the wolf pack defense coming up big once again one of the things with Burns coaches will tell you hes an excellent passer so when you cant really just go and doubling and as I say that he turns it over Monsanto converts to the steal by Clinton and Monsanto with a three hes got 11 Monsanto averages 12 points per game and he came into this game with 62 threepointers hes added to that total today but thats the thing about this wake team I mean they can come at you with a diff a lot of different weapons Marcel not to be denied at the rack hes got four again Marcel can do a lot of things in a half court if youre looking at NC State right now youre looking at the things that theyre going to have to be able to do without transition and just running good half foot offense the transfer from Virginia cuts it to a twopoint game the feed down low Monsanto and that is going to be a goaltan and Casey Marcel Music good feed there by Clement off of the Steal and Monsanto drilling the three the ability to take care of the basketball that has not been a problem for North Carolina State as of late they just had two turnovers in their win against Notre Dame well they because they have multiple ball handlers that can make really good decisions in our good passes Applause Burns cant convert by the way those two turnovers against Notre Dame tying a program record set back in 1991 hildred Fade Away Jay count you know you almost count hell go there as a post guy because he takes you down in the block and he really punishes little guards because he has the ability to use his body and shoot over top of it second leading scorer on the team this season averaging 13 per DJ Burns and one as he flexes I tell you what hes tough inside and hes given NC State a weapon that they need here in this first half Gatorade fit well take you to Atlanta for Duke and Georgia Tech followed by number 24 Clemson taking on Florida State and the quadruple header is capped off by Virginia Tech hosting Syracuse in Blackburn big day of Hoops on acc Network starting to get into separation season in terms of the ACC as teams continue to try to establish themselves as we make our way towards March DJ Burns looking for 9 he cant get it stuck on eight cuevion Smith if youre just joining us the accs leading scorer out of the game with three fouls well get a foul here away from the ball against the wolf pack itll be Casey Marcel who picks up his second one of the things Wake Forest likes to do is go into a horn set with their post guys and run Cutters and off of the horn stuff or back cut the wings Monsanto at the line gets the front end of a one and one away from a double bonus Monsanto had the ability when the ball hits the elbow of either back cutting or coming off of it for a dribble handoff for a jump shot and he was held on the cut that time hes already got 15 the lead is at six for Wake Forest they have been stingy here at home 101 on the season trying to pick up win 11 in that category Burns working down low lost the ball Monsanto will fire no good Carr had his hands on it for a moment but it got knocked away Joyner into the paint tough shot short Burns his follow is no good Ross mixing it up and he cant get it to go kept alive though foul line Jay thats no good from LJ Thomas and finally controlled by the demon Dickens and Bradford great effort that time by NC State on the glass trying to take advantage of their size Hildreth tried to pick his way through the lane how about Burns diving on the floor tied up by Bradford and the basketball will go over to the wolf pack tremendous Hustle by DJ Burns Doug this game means so much you see the way Burns played right there Burns coming out of high school with the top 50 player uh tremendous Talent he he was even better musically because he was in the band there in high school you know he was being recruited musically also but he is really a talent and hes playing really well right now they brought Bradford in right now to give him a little bit more of a physical matchup the touch from Burns thats no good Id have to think being a musician in some way shape or four thats to help the basketball game a little it does he comes from a very talented family splits The Defenders and hes able to draw a foul lets talk about what Wake Forest is doing right here because they are doing a really good job of controlling the game theyre getting the shots that they want this is not normally the way that they like to play Just freewheeling and transition and theyre having to set up and go inside a little bit more you see Hillcrest right there whos probably one of the most improved players in the ACC Hildreth good on the first that foul was picked up by LJ Thomas its his first clearly the surge in minutes and the surge in production talking to coach Forbes earlier so many people talk about the transfer portal and who you brought in but you look at a player like Cameron Hildreth thats a homegrown guy and hes improved tremendously and you know thats part of this program Applause hes got four Wake Forest largest lead of the game very active from the charity Stripes so far heres Burns again Burns turns left tried to bank it in too strong Carr flies in for the rebound theyre going to have to give him some Cutters yeah wake is just too good defensively just to let him back him down on every possession Joyner is called for a foul its number one on Joyner and the trouble continues here for North Carolina State who has already challenged from a depth perspective coming into this game and the struggles continue with the foul situation mounting up and NC State really doesnt like to play zone so changing the defenses that way is really right now not what they do and so you just have to kind of weather through this half this is an important minute 48 to go Monday night the Huddle crew will have the exclusive reveal of this seasons ACC football schedule theyll break down each team and look at Key weeks and specific matchups our coverage of this twohour special begins at seven Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Marcel he cant hit the struggles continue for North Carolina state from the field just over 30 percent shooting in the first half Applause shoot and a lot of that has come from the fact that theyve had to do it out of half court offense instead of transitioning offense Monsanto with the drop of Bradford he tried to dunk that one over Ross instead it goes the other way Applause Ross does so many things hes a great rim protector for this NC State team oh were going to get a technical foul here a little too much talking DJ burns down there he can hold a conversation sometimes its just too much talking itll be Burns along with Monsanto who pick up the technical fouls monsantos not bashful either in talking so both of those two guys just trying to make a point and instead of just kind of playing basketball its interesting with Burns you dont have a lot of offensive options out there because of the situation foul wise with Smith at least youre running out of consistent offensive options so he has to be very careful out there well get a timeout called on the floor it will be called by North Carolina State and Kevin Keats more in a moment the hot spots and pressure points on your mattress could be why you were tossing and turning last night leaving you tired with aches and pains but dont buy a new mattress upgrade it with the premium mattress topper by Dormeo it transforms your mattress into a luxurious sleeping surface its the only topper in the world with patented octaspring technology providing incredible Pressure Point Relief and advanced breathability so you dont wake up hot head to dormeocom now for a special TV offer thats only available at dormayocom thats dormayocom foreign lead for Wake Forest Derrick Jones and Perry Clark with you today on the ACC Network and heres a look at what developed here to lead to the double technical see both of them would just kind of talk and then they both you know have a point of view I think one likes red the other likes blue and so they just kind of talking it out right there but then monsantos comes out and he looked like he was throwing up in a bucket on the side so I dont know what kind of caused that but you know one of the things NC State I think has to do I think they have to get Joyner more involved and they got to get more sell more involved and not just completely count on burns to carry them burns with the kick Joyner top of the arc three rattles out Bradford with another rebound for the Demon Deacons sometimes when your jump shots arent going Derek you got to have some movement you got to get guys coming off of action whether or not its staggers pin Downs curls that sometimes Shooters need that action to get loose Applebee down to 10 to shoot going at morsel hildred with five turns into Lane gets blocked by Burns Applause five seconds left Joyner with room for three connects and that closes out the first half in a positive fashion for Kevin Keiths crew to cut it down to a sixpoint game and again that came out of trans Joyner well because that came out of transition and NC State is really good when theyre in transition Unfortunately they havent been able to have as much transition baskets as they would like in the first half it will be Wake Forest basketball to open up have two you know that foul by Smith has a lot of effects and uh so defensively NC States really gonna have to pick it up and as I say that Applebee just goes up Baseline for a basket but theyre going to have to really do a good job in their half court defense so for Avion Smith starts to have the three fouls hes in the mix on the floor Ernest Ross well start the half instead of Greg Gant Smith floater with the right hand is in he had a strong start with a couple of Threes his first field goal since then he has eight Hildreth trying to pick his way back towards the paint working against Smith and he gets the shot to drop well they wanted a flop there on the Wake Forest bench against Smith they didnt get anything no and I tell you thats a tough match up Smith against held with because hes a very physical player and hes always going to be driving you eldreth with six now as Burns back to it trying to get to the left once again the rebound the car ahead of the pack Hildreth lays it in Cameron Hildreth with eight and he is slowly awaking offensively for the Demon Deacons Smith cuts into the deficit that was the largest lead of the game for Wake Forest before that three by Smith s into double figures with 11 this is a tough matchup for Smith against Hillary as he backs him in beautiful feed to Matthew Marsh with the flush to extend the lead out to nine you know although NC state does not play zone when Hildreth gets the ball they really got to Zone up from the weak side to protect Smith still aggressive he took it to Matthew Marsh and thats good enough to draw the foul thatll be the first on March that was surprised he started we got worried that he wasnt going to start the second half and he did and again thats the confidence level that a coach has in his play in the relationship that they have with each other to be able to communicate Way Beyond Smith who had that rough ball against North Carolina last week played in the game on Tuesday night against Notre Dame meanwhile the reason hes at the free throw line is because of the foul committed by Matthew Marsh but Marsh inserted into the starting lineup and what a find he has been for Coach Forbes he does a really good job defensively as a rim protector he also does a really good job of setting screens and getting other guys really good looks you saw that graphic there the 48 field goals 40 of them dunks so when he gets it you know whats coming well he runs to the rim and they call him Rim runners Burns nice speed down low to cam Gantt stuck back over to Burns who drops it in Music DJ Burns now with 10 this NC State team just plays a lot more efficiently when Smith is in the game because everybody can kind of get back to playing the way that they like to play Hildreth on Marcel Marcel gets the block and the foul by Hildreth as Marcel was trying to make his way back down the floor thatll be the second one hildred and thats a much better matchup NC State with Marcel on him as opposed to Smith Marcels a really good Defender physical player also so he can give him some resistance at The Rim its a seventh block shot in the game for North Carolina State their third in the ACC averaging a little over four and a half blocks per game Burns spins throws it up on the left hand it trickles out down the floor Hildreth trying to keep it alive Monsanto will fire and him my coaches are on fire here today and he just does a really good job of spotting up hes playing with a lot of confidence the minute he touches that ball hes letting it go you can tell when a guy has a feel Monsanto with 18 Smith his floater is short out of bounds it will stay with North Carolina State confidence is not a statistic but if it was it would be on on the highest levels before damari Monsanto well without question hes a young man that was at East Tennessee with Coach he didnt even start and followed him over here to Wake Forest and when I talked about Coach Forbes I talk about his relationship with his players Santos is the perfect example of that Smith fouled on the jumper count it and one for turquavion Smith you know its hard to quantify how talented Smith is and how many wonderful things he does for NC State he can get his shot going oneonone he gets it out of the system uh hes just a very effective offensive player its a free throw hes been busy in this game offensively when hes been on the floor he only played over seven minutes in the first half hes got 14 for the game despite the limited playing time early on due to the foul trouble Appleby scoop lay up right hand no good marks right there with the tip thats our guy hes in what they call the dont Spock every time somebody drives he goes to the front of the rim so easily he can tip it in or they can pass in the ball and he can finish with the flush Marsh with six the lead at nine Burns goes left throws it up with the left spins off the rim a March rebound Appleby the kick car and a foul coming up against Gantt and that will lead us into a come out of the floor threepoint shooting active there you see monsantos right there finishing with the three is giving way to lead here in the second half Music foreign Music Clark with you this afternoon and Perry coach Forbes has had a lot of success with that transfer portal well he has and one of the reasons why he has is because he spends more time investigating the player as a person than as a basketball player he wants to make sure that they have a right fit and theres a difference between evaluating talent and winning with talent and if you want to win with Talent youve got to get the enormous people Applebee the Florida transfer has it here lost the ball as Gantt after the swipe by Burns able to keep it alive for the wolf pack they did a real good job of trying to ice the ball screen and force it into the Baseline burns down low blocked by car Joyner off the screen by Gantt some people thought it was a foul no whistle down to four for burns turnaround shot up and in you know that shot went in Burns is having trouble finishing because instead of just shooting the ball with the natural basketball followthrough hes trying to spin it and thats why a lot of his shots has been has been in and out or spun around the rim Applebee looking for a little help car and and thats going to go the other way thats where Carr really likes to operate hes very dangerous catching that basketball on the elbow right there because he can shoot it and drive it hes very versatile player and that time they got him for a pushoff the transfer from the University of Delaware picking up his second foul of the game its a seven point lead for Wake Forest Joyner whos been mostly held in check over to Smith its been a little bit of a different story for Smith hes gotten going offensively despite that Miss as that ball heads out of bounds but Perry he has not been able to pick up an assist hes one of the top players in the ACC sharing the basketball hes been held to check in that department well whats happening is The Bigs arent able to roll because of the size of Wake Forest and so he lines up being able to get in the paint and elevating over the guards Punk fake by Marcel his three is short Monsanto getting the Loose Change for Wake Forest Applause foreign looking for some assistance back door feed the car that was just really good basketball both ways NC State was playing great defense they didnt let Apple be penetrate they cut off the people who he passed to he didnt want to make a bad pass so he takes his time waits Waits Waits and finally caught him says okay Im gonna help you and give them a back cut and is able to get a threepoint play out of it thats really good basketball both ways great Patience by the ACC leader in assists tar able to finish off the threepoint play the lead back to 10 for Wake Forest Applause you know Appleby has just done a tremendous job leading this team and sometimes leadership is not always about scoring but getting other people involved and allowing your team to play at a pace burns with that shoulder shank launches a jumper and scores to add to his total in the last two shots hes taken hes shot the ball he hasnt tried to spin it he shot it with follow when thats been a difference for him burns with 14 the lead cut to eight Music Applebee rooms for three Gantt rebound Burns back to it again Music trying to go with Bradford stuck fires it up no good cant offensive rebound double clutching cant score still kept alive for Dan he cant get it to drop burn down one NC state has been relentless on the glass coach Keith to talk about their resilience thats a way to be resilient when your best player gets in foul trouble to find other ways to be successful and theyre doing it right now pounding the offensive glass PJ Burns and the Wolf Pack back in it I our mens basketball quadruple header the nothing but net crew will break down today in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of all the mens games and look ahead at the best games on the schedule in the coming week thats coverage you can only find in one place right here on acc Network and the ESPN app 5347 lead for Wake Forest but DJ burns with 16 points he has taken 20 shots in this game and thats really not his game hes not really kind of built for that I think for NC State to get out of here with a win Joyner and Marcel are going to have to knock down a couple baskets for them going down the stretch Joyner picks up a foul Joyner at 28 points in the win against Notre Dame going back to Tuesday but he has been limited so far he has eight points off a three of 11 shooting well were both Jordan and Marcel are both good Shooters theyre good offensive players off the bounce and normally late in game situation when the defense gets tight that type of skill set gives you an advantage eldrift against Gantt scores it done a pretty good job on Hillcrest today as far as not really letting him wreak havoc against their defense he has started to wake up offensively hes got 10 foreign Smith theyre doing the heavy lifting offensively for North Carolina state two more for DJ Burns day thats really not what hes built for he keeps scoring but you know the one thing that has helped DJ a lot of teams that put him in ball screen situations which has created problems for NC State a little bit defensively wake is not doing that because thats not part of what they how they play Hildreth reverse layup is gone and Hildreth the England product getting loose to add to the lead for Wake Forest Burns backs it in now hes starting to shoot the ball with the good with the good followthrough instead of spinning it hes following through with it just like he would out of his jump shot Burns putting the team on his back he scored the last five field goals here for North Carolina State this Wake Forest team though is really balanced catching shoot three thats good Damian Williamson the driller from the corner but I love it Appleby watch the whole floor he wasnt trying to force anything he got the ball to the open guy and got a basket Burns turns left turns right and adds in two points for DJ Burns and hes shaking his head like Stan you better put somebody else on me Burns started the season coming in off the bench but injuries have forced Kevin Keats to reshuffle the deck making Burns a necessity in the starting lineup and the reason he was coming off the bench so that they could get more productivity out of him Music foul on the floor and this will be against North Carolina State and if its against Smith thats his fourth thats a tough foul right now hes telling coach dont take him out but hes got to take him out you like to trust your players you like to listen to him but sometimes the fact that you are experienced and know a little bit more than they do youve got to make whats best for the team well the other end of this is when do you bring him back probably around the five minute mark so if if you can handle about four minutes four or five minutes then you just gotta let him finish the drive and well get a foul here coming up off the attack by Bobby Clement you know the problem with Smith is he only knows one way to play and he plays all out hes a really good defensive player you know he he got he picked up his foul trying to help airball thats corralled by Marcel Applause lets see if Joyner can pick up the set in Smiths absence but Burns at it again in the lane and hes found hell go back to the freethrow line now the decision wake is making were not going to run at him and so theyre letting him go just oneonone uh with Marsh and living with whatever happens theyre afraid to double him because that will open up uh Joyner it will open up the threepoint shooting which is what coach Forbes does not want to do right now with the weight defense Burns no good on the first this has been a struggle for him hes now 03 from the line its almost been like a chess match for the two coaches missed the second seven point Advantage for Wake Forest Appleby whips a pass down low to March Marsh didnt attack Burns kicked it out five to shoot down to three Williamson cant convert Applause Joyner with space he hits Applause Music Applause thats what he likes to do and thats what hes capable of doing theyre going to need some of that to open up and break down this Wake Forest defense a little bit Joyner in double figures with 10 cause because there was a lack of secondary rotation there Burns had to step up to handle the penetration and nobody put a knee on Mars so he couldnt explode Burns adds in two more DJ burns with 24 points Applause season high for burns a fivepoint lead for North Carolina or excuse me for Wake Forest as North Carolina State continues to go into Chase mode and state hasnt really hit Wake Forest with a lot of that pressure they normally try to double the ball sometimes three is no good from Williamson loose Tracked Down by Gantt Joyner bangs it in darkell Joyner cuts it to a threepoint game thats the pace NC State likes to play at transition easy baskets at The Rim with his wolf pack career fairy well right now you see him right there hes squaring up hes able to finish hes flexing and the difference between the first half and the second half you see him right there he follows through on his shot hes not trying to spin it hes not just looking at Angles hes finding the defense hes aggressively going after the basketball and hes exploding and finishing at The Rim burns with a career high versus a D1 opponent 24 points eight rebounds 24 attempts thats one of the interesting numbers also another number to note here hes trending towards 30 minutes in terms of playing time that is not something he has done a lot during his playing days no thats why he needs that break right there and thats why I said that Jordan and Marcel have gonna have to wind up helping NC State if they want to close the deal here another lob grabbed by Clinton he gets swatted by dewana Tawana is a really good rim protector and I tell you Im really impressed with this NC State team the way theyve been able to hang tight and play and get back in this ball game Joyner Tatiana dark Hill Joyner has tied this game up at 62 hes got 15 but now look for weight to settle things down they do an excellent job running good half put offense theyre going to look to try to get help with driving the basketball Applause against Thomas turns left gets blocked again dewana got him thats the ninth block of the day for the wolf pack Joyner oh Joyner cant touch that ball he does and its a travel but thats okay that was a smart move youd rather have that turned over than a transition basket going the other way really smart play by Joyner 62 all Music the top eight in the ACC Clemson Atop The League with a 91 mark But third place on just a onegame spread between those teams let me tell you something this game is extremely important both of these teams know it both of these coaches know it theyre playing like it its been an exciting game and right now you need to you need to dial up monsantos he had a heck of a first half hes been a little quieter here in the second half Music seven straight for North Carolina State theyve made their last eight shots Applause Appleby who has six assists in this game Music Carr shot clock down to three hildra step back jumper and that will be a shot clock violation against the Demon Deacons NC State plays tremendous Gap defense there was no place for Appleby to penetrate and create a scoring opportunity for anybody else the joint is really quick on the ball theyve got a really good size on the perimeter and they just really stop stop driving Lanes and now Burns comes back in the game after getting a little bit of a rest the last time North Carolina State LED in this game was around the Midway point of the first half and it was 1615 wolf path Applause Burns going left throws it up and in DJ Burns gives the lead to North Carolina State hes got 26 coach Forbes may have to send somebody at him at least to Bluff him and make him think that theyre coming to pick up his dribble a little earlier hes getting too deep right now on Mars on his catches Applebee into the lane missed a car right there with a follow 10 points for Carr were tied again this time at 64 Burns double team open Thomas three got it hes such a really good passer thats one of the reasons I said they were gonna have to run somebody at him thats the danger of it because Burns is really a great passer but you cant let him just stay in Rhythm and continue to do what he was doing Hildreth tight defense again falls off the rim burns with a rebound thats his ninth and I tell you whats been so impressive everybody will tell you this NC State team is great in transition theyve had to slow this thing down and theyve had the loss tonight and theyve lost pretty well Marcel missing the three car with the rebound so that double is coming at DJ Burns Applause and well see how many open Shooters continue to drift another bucket for Monsanto the twopointer cuts a toll one point game hes got 20 they got to dial his number hes the hottest guy in the gym from the perimeter the NC State has not had an answer for him theyve got to continue to get him some looks Monsanto with 20 Marcel catch a shoot got him I told you Derek join in my those two guys that have got to be the guys to get them out of here whoa back down the floor car is knocked to the deck but we get a whistle it is tight down the stretch in Winston Salem North Carolina wolf pack up by four Music Oakland Zoo point guard meet castlevan the old foes and tobacco roads Blue Bloods and bad blood and the devils awaiting their dude all in on the standout Applause at the doubles needed huddles close calls and closer memories throwing down at Tiger Town all in on the game the whos and the whos next all in on the ACC all the ptps and tomorrows MVPs the conference that raises and the teams that shape us we are all in for all times come for it all foreign heres our womens college basketball quadruple header for tomorrow Louisville meets Syracuse at noon Eastern then its number 16 Duke taking on number 24 Florida State followed by number 15 ranked North Carolina and Clemson at four then number 12 Virginia Tech and Virginia cap today should be another great afternoon of Hoops on acc Network and the ESPN app speaking of Great Hoops this game here between North Carolina State and Wake Forest its a fourpoint lead for the wolf pack Derrick Jones of Perry Clark with you this afternoon from the Joel what a game its been in particular in the second half as Carr knocks down the free throw North Carolina state in this second half has been buoyed by DJ Burns in particular and when you take a look at the the scoring depth its just been those guys carrying the load in the second half yeah NC state has to do a better job on the glass though they gave up an offensive rebound on a foul shot theyve been heard on the glass a couple times they really need to clean that up or cell picks up his fourth so Marcel and Smith each with four theyre both out on the floor right now as Appleby tries to cut into the deficit you know you hate the work like heck get a lead and then give it up at the foul line especially when youve been playing such really good half court defense that will be 82 percent on the season from the line knocks down both he has 15 free throw shooting a story line to track as we head down towards the Finish Line 15 of 18 for Wake Forest North Carolina State just two for 10 theyve got Burns kicked out a lot further now theyre just going to let him go oneonone Burns throws it up and in DJ Burns 28 points hes feeling himself with a threepoint lead for the wolf pack hes going to that left hand and and that gives him an advantage but that time Lake decided that they werent going to come off of anybody Appleby got a step and that leads to a whistle you know and shes NC Supply sometimes when you know our teams in attack mode you cant you got to back off your ball pressure and I thought join at that time maybe could have backed off the ball pressure knowing Appleby was looking to attack bonus time for Wake Forest oneonone situation Applause you know Derek youre making twos and youre letting them go to the foul line and get easier it looks and youve got to make it off of your sets and things thats not the way you really want to play this thing and so NC state has to not foul and make Wake Forest earn what they get second one from Appleby one point game 7271 wolf pack two minutes left to go Burns we know how this movie has ended throughout the second half and now this time its a foul and a pair of free throws for Burns and this is where Burns has been a little soft on the foul line its really important now that he locks in and knocks down these foul shots because again wake is not going to come in Dublin because the NC State has shown that theyve got some Shooters out there and if you double them they dont want to give up a three late Burns a 65 shooter from the line now over five today a woeful two of 11 from the line of the wolf pack Burns gets one there Applause twopoint game look what Applebee coming off of some sort of ball screen action Applebee the drive Burns got a piece of it out of bounds back over to Wake Forest Applause Music watch this out of bounds they like to run this out of bounds timeout called on the floor back to it from WinstonSalem in just a moment wolf pack leading by two so I had to quit Carolina State Derek Jones and Perry Clark with you 137 left to go coach what do you think theyre drawn up in the huddle and the timeout was taken they like when Appleby takes the ball out they like the flash one of the big to the corner Appleby can come back and get the ball and look for a jump shot or a drive turn around shot by Monsanto to tie it up at 73 Jamari Monsanto with 22 has been called against Monsanto and that will result in a oneonone this is a so you see the big popping out they look for that but they got Monsanto coming off the other curl from the other big which is an option on that play and now Burns goes back to the foul line one and one for DJ Burns gets the first he has had himself a day today and I tell you what hes played extremely well on both ends of the floor gets ball a lead for the wolf pack of two a 31 Point performance a career day for DJ Burns Music Applause Appleby Baseline Drive and hes fouled they did a really good job what they do is they raise the bigs and instead of him going off of a elbow ball screen he goes to the Baseline and because theyve raised The Bigs theres nobody there to kind of help on the drive foul is charged to DJ Burns thats his fourth so three players now with four for North Carolina State coming up next well take you to Atlanta for Duke and Georgia Tech followed by number 24 Clemson taking on Florida State and the quadruple header is capped off by Virginia Tech hosting Syracuse in Blacksburg oh a miss off the second by Appleby look will run exactly the same Act Joyner under a minute left to go burn shot clock to 10 Burns against Monsanto the kick to deflection four to shoot Smith in the lane unbelievable Smith on the drive did you see the way he handled his body and elevated at the last minute body control Persona 5 two timeouts left each way and Steve Forbes will use one of them unbelievable action that time they wanted to play through Burns Burns recognized Smith got him the basketball even though it was only about four on the clock Smith is able to drive the basketball right here only a special player can do that the leading scorer in the ACC impressive yet again 16 points for taquavion Smith despite the foul trouble getting it done for North Carolina State and as we head down the stretch youre strategically what do you see here from coach Forbes how does he utilize the final 29 seconds here well you know I think obviously the ball is going to be in Applebees hands and hes going to have the ability to recognize what type of shot that they can wind up taking but um I expect them to go with some sort of high ball screen and uh and play off of that Wake Forest is the only team this season to put a dent in the Clemson in the ACC the loan loss for wake or for Clemson is courtesy of Wake Forest but when you look at things getting tight its been up or down and those games decided by three points or less yeah you know Ive been saying this all game monsantos is a guy thats had the hot hand and hes got to be involved in some sort of the action here with the matchups the way theyre going to be Smith will probably be on monsantos because you dont want him on Hell dress because Hildreth is probably going to drive the basketball and you dont want him picking up his fifth against the driver you rather him playing a jump shooter than a driver Applebee Applause over to Monsanto to tie it missed it Marshall the rebound kept Alive by Carr Applause Applebee cant hit from Deep a rebound grab by jarkel Joyner and a foul what do you think there I thought it was did a great job of executing I think they got the shot that they wanted I think they even got a second shot I was concerned about NC State defensive rebounding because of the team that they had on the floor without Burns but they were able to come up with it and now youve got you know one of your better foul Shooters going to the foul line third foul for Andrew Carr Joyner 83 percent from the line gets the free throw to drop and that makes it a fourpoint lead with 114 left to go you know you hate to say this was a shame either one of these two teams have to will lose but I tell you what for NC State to be able to handle the adversity that theyve had to handle here these are the things that make championship teams in NCAA team because you have to be able to go through the fire and you have to be able to build on that fire to allow yourself to get better and theyve certainly have been in the fire today because this Wake Forest team to come ready to play coach Forbes when we talked to him earlier said his team has to find a way to grind these kind of games out North Carolina state has been able to find that answer on the other end Monsanto will launch a deep three thats no good bouncing around controlled by Carr Hill fire from Deep thats good but the game is over North Carolina State hangs on to defeat Wake Forest by 27977 in large part thanks to a tremendous performance by that young fella DJ Burns 31 points in the win
