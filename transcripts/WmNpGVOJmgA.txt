struggling on the road to get a road win he needs to play well tonight one in four on the road so far in a case Georgia Tech which needs what they need these two young men to play exceptionally well Miles Kelly needs to get out of this shooting slump four of his last 23 and Davion Smith late clock late game situation they need the ball to his hands and he needs to make plays for Georgia Tech to win tonight we are ready to go from mccanish Pavilion team two of our quadruple header that was a good one in WinstonSalem to get it started it was a good game unfortunately the Deeks my Deeks took it out today but NC State tough team played exceptionally well Duke on the road in the black trying to solve this Georgia Tech Zone early on they play zone 12th most of any team in the country Jeremy roach connects from Deep back into the starting lineup meanwhile for Georgia Tech you talked about Davon Smith three double doubles in his last five games and then Miles Kelly is their leading scorer at 13 a game theyre gonna have to cut really well really confused Duke in their switching defense if they want to score just like that what a block by Kyle filipowski with the denial on Miles Kelly Josh pastner year seven he told us the story today about recruiting John Shire back in 2005 try to get him to go to Arizona but the weekend of that visit Arizona had lost in the elite eight they have blown their big lead over Illinois so Josh pastner said to us today was about one of the worst visits you could ever imagine it was really bad even Josh I was trying to be nice about him and explain how bad of a visit it actually was Rodney Howard with the first points for Georgia Tech John changes up his starting lineup you heard Kelsey talk about no Derek Whitehead hes out after the injury on Monday that well show you so roach in Lively in and this was the white head injury in Blacksburg on Monday scary sight if youre a Duke fan or just a fan of anyone you dont want anyone to get hurt when you see something like that grabbing that back leg like that great news its just a lower leg injury hell return at some point we dont know exactly when but just a great news that he will be returning to college basketball John Shire told us about an hour ago here pregame its a ligament strength its not Achilles and that was great to see because that was everyones fear its not cap either but like you said lower leg ligament strain thatll keep him out you know what it is its one of those terms that a coach cant pronounce so you just say lower leg second three for Jeremy roach who is healthy and producing early up well its a great shot for Duke the Jeremy roaches back and hes playing well but for Georgia Tech you got to have a little bit of concern because their game plan is to defend the size and length of Duke inside and they want to concede the threepoint shots but right now Jeremy roach is off to a hot start making two shots from down Beyond The Arc thats what Josh Pastor told us at shoot around today if they make 14 threes well pack up well try it again in the midweek yeah sometimes youre just accept it Rodney Howard bounces underneath for Jalen Moore who had it roll off the rim thats a rebound battle for by more but Duke secures It Up by Four early on well if youre running Princeton offense the way Georgia Tech does the big man has to have more assists you run the offense through your bigs in that mid post and they do a lot of handling of the basketball so their ability to hit cutters and fine guy open Shooters is big like that philipowski cutting at that end of the floor off the delivery from Lively and filipowski to the line just him cutting down the lane and just attacking Georgia Techs defense they have to decide how they want to go our ball Springs they hitched Rodney Howard late getting back in the paint to help out and when youre guarding the God is scoring like that he just found ways and that way if hes not you know getting it on the post not shooting threes you dont want to leave the best lead the best player on the floor Phillip housing cuts down the lane and now hes shooting two with four straight double doubles hes got 10 total look at the numbers these last four games for Kyle filipowski just as good as anybody in the country right now over that span I mean four games I mean thats thats Big Time number you dont see those numbers from freshmen but hes just been nothing short of outstanding and the way hes been doing it and its just its just amazing to me and well get into that later I mean a guy did not many saw this from if you went to Duke and saw them early in the year he didnt think hed be playing this well despite being the number seven recruit in the country thats what John Shire said to his pregame out Sturtevant Siege to that mid court for Georgia Tech with just two points three minutes in until the start of him jumper hes very good in the midrange he is hes much hes very comfortable in getting to pull up jump shots but theyre gonna need to take those shots I mean Dukes going to take away threes they wanted a better threepoint defending team with a threepoint line and also protecting the rim and theyre going to concede midrange shot 30 minutes steps in and knocked one down turned it over he got met defensively by Rodney Howard Applause thats the difference in the seniors bodies and the Freshman body right there freshman as much as hes worked to change his body type Rodney oh man yeah thats a grown man right there and this is what were talking about now the pressure is having Rodney Howard turned his back and top two not there for Davon Smith but an offensive rebound and then Langley went straight up defensively on Howard Livelys doing what he does I mean he blocks shots and he rebounds Tyrese Proctor off Target from Deep Lively on the stick back on cue hes doing what he you know thats why hes been asserted into the lineup challenge a little bit his strength is protecting the rim its not the typical offensive skill set of what you think of the number one player in the country but he defends and runs well as well as anyone in the country John sharer told us pregame hes coming talking about Lively jump shot protected there off the arm of Miles Kelly and Duke runs with Mark Mitchell The Freshman spinning horse one up Lively back out extra pass Roach wanted his third three run down by starting it galafis very active on both ends of the Florida got an offensive rebound last play he was contested that jump shot as well Debo Coleman connects sophomore known for his shooting but just 31 from three this season needs to get more out of Debo Coleman hes capable of it I think he needs to get himself more on the offensive glass get himself going in games hes definitely has the physicality to play in this game in the post against bigger bigger all right Derek Lively makes his first Collegiate three on just his fifth attempt and we talked about it you asked me why was he shooting threes in the pregame and thats why take that Mike Monaco yeah go figure he is coming indeed Applause and this is what Mike uh Lively does as well you see hes making Rodney Howard extended catch Sturtevant kicks it back out late shot clock for Davon Smith with philipowski on him Smith short cleared by Mitchell to lapowski knocks it down great start for Duke on the road Applause having a threepoint shooting contest here in Midtown and Dirk Livelys joined the threepoint shooting show here number one recruit Sean said 146 overall five and four in the ACC all four of those conference losses have come on the road but were talking about John Shire about a pregame you asked him he feels like theyve grown and gotten more comfortable playing away from home well you saw the first two games they gave up 80 plus points didnt score it wasnt as effective really werent close games and then the last two games you see them getting better and better and thats what you expect Duke has always been a slow starting team because usually the first road game doesnt come until they get into the ACC conference schedule theyre figuring things out this team is getting better which is great time as they had in the February for the final 11 games of the ACC he said to us he felt like dude outplayed Clemson for 35 minutes in that close game and then Virginia Tech what a way for the Hokies to get off the Schneider on Monday just a you know Virginia Tech who what do you say about that team you got two ACC wins against Duke and Carolina and lose to everyone in between but that teams finally healthy now theyre playing good basketball its always tough to beat them in Blacksburg and Predator Duke now theyre figuring things out this is a team thats been banged up missing quite a bit of guys they havent had their roster for 12 guys all year long 12 games rather all year long saw the take from Jalen Moore Georgia Tech with seven points here in these first six minutes but this is the part of the game I thought Joe detick has to be good at Baseline out of bounds after timeout has silent out of the bounds they have to win that game thats a game within itself scoring where its unscripted being able to sneak some baskets in had an opportunity today and just turned it over theyre coming off a 21point loss at Clemson at Little John on Tuesday and Josh pastner said after the game maybe four or five times he cant score he was just lamenting the fact that theyre getting good looks but theyve really struggled offensively so to your point thats where you got to steal some buckets yeah we talked about it which team was the best threepoint shooting team for this game enjoy the techniques to make about 10 I thought the win and fashion agreed if thats a good number one for two from three so far theres an offensive rebound for Rodney Howard and he will go to the line great job sealing that inside had a guard trying to box him out of them got inside a lively being able to seal him off hes done a really good job of getting on the glass being physical when hes been out there and weve seen that a few times he goes to the line for Josh passner he could just feel the frustration from Josh passner this morning and in those post game comments Tuesday he went so far as to say we just cant throw it in the ocean no standing on it here because when youre standing in you dont have the ability to make shots it just makes the game tougher and you get in this round of conference play against teams like Duke theyre going to switch everything so a lot of your half court sets just not going to work unless you got to attack switches and slips but they got a few looks early it just comes down at some point you got to make shots they just dont have as many guys as duke as when the play breaks down but hey go get me a bucket and thats just not enjoy the tech strength right now on the offensive end theyre within seventh Mitchell drives and his pass through the arms up Derek Lively and the third turnover by Duke so far good idea of a mention just driving I dont think a lot of peoples expecting him to throw the ball to him good idea just bad execution but you like the unselfish basketball there all in the hands of Tristan Maxwell the junior only playing in his 21st career game known for some scoring off the bench has dealt with a lot of different issues over his three years on the flats theyre having opportunities here with their motion off the ball theyre just not seeing the open Cutters right now Applause or off the mark from deep and back to Duke okay thats not the shot you want you know Moore is only three or 21 of the Year shooting 14 from three theyre having guys but theyre Dukes defense credit Dukes defense theyre pressuring that high post guy forcing him to turn his back he cant see the motion and Cutters behind him and thats hurting him hurting a score so Ryan young check in for Derek Lively who gave seven strong minutes out of the gates for John Shire Mitchell turn the corner a lot of contact and Mitchell through that context Im just such a huge fan of Mark Mitchell I think he plays his role as well as anyone I mean hes a three indeed guy turns the corner here takes the contact and finishes with the right hand and again numbers are good scoring really well I mean he got to shoot nearly 50 from the floor and 42 from three and that just tells you when young guys percentages are that high they know what they know who they are and I think he plays that role his role on this team exceptionally well and it prompted the second foul on Jalen Moore goes to the bench for Josh passner theyre going to go over and confirm who the fouls on it got announced here as Kyle sturdivin but it is on more and so it is his second yeah I think fashion was ahead of it and knew that was just a mixup stamps a threepoint play in the lead is 10 what a luxury to have the 20th ranked recruit in the country come out and the 10th ranked recruit come in all right embarrassment and rich is on the front quarter to Duke Duke basketball team right now great defense there blanks took it away from Sturdivant who then commits the foul is first after the swipe from the masked man Jayla Blakes with the Batman mask on Jalen Jalen Blakes has just been their best onball defender in Petes on both ends of the floor and hes been great all year on their own ball defense and just doing what he does when he comes in do you want to give us a Batman voice I dont have a good one okay me either sorry I wont do it all right but I love the mask though I do too I love the mask John Schneider told this pregame he thinks Blakes is still adjusting to it youll see more minutes out of him with white hat injured Bebo Coleman helped out defensively still 19 left to shoot for Duke Music youre so concerned if youre Joe detective youre just trying to keep everything in front and great look by philipowski Debo comes down on the weak side and blocks it telepasky just got net at The Rim Georgia Tech runs Maxwell lays it in Duke pushes right back with Blakes attacking blocked by Howard jackets run again Maxwell drops it off for Miles Kelly and Georgia Tech building some momentum here in the first half that goes on what we talked about about getting some opportunities you get some fast break points you got to steal some of those you know they need to get out and get as many quick baskets as possible eightpoint Duke lead eight minutes in on the flats in Atlanta challenge player here and I think hes critical for this game not just for this game but for his team because when the shot clock runs down hes the one guy that you can give the ball to and say hey go make me a play and Im wondering if hes a legit 61 too I think I got about a couple of inches here but I dont think I have a 45 inch vertical and what are you height wise I think Im six two okay you bring up this 45 yeah he told us that pregame he did he has been maxed out tested at 45 and a half inches on his vertical he said that was in preseason testing and then they also have tested again a couple of times during the season I dont know what its like to get up that high no other than flying Applause to Georgia Tech Trail by eight with the shot clock winding down on Tristan Maxwell who bounces inside for Howard back out Coleman off Target at the horn great job defending there dude communicating on his switch is not leaving Georgia Tech to get anything easy Applause Proctor at the controls with roach off the ball the lapowski driving on Coleman kicked Away by Howard with 13 to shoot on a reset to 20 thats just Philip Powers hes showing the skill set theyre a great defensive on the ball keeping them in front of you when he has a smaller Defender right now he wants to get to his spot just shoot right over guys so credit Joe to Tech and Debo good hands by Maxwell as philipowski flashed to the block Music gotta watch the Players and not the guy out of bounds until he passes the ball and Bounds there quickly moved for young passing out of the post good interior passing young finishes and a foul its difficult to come down you almost got to leave him oneonone hes just a tremendous pass to be seeing it right over top of the defense just got to leave him there against ranked late rotation down by Maxwell there and he commits the foul I mean just just tough to try to get there so Ryan young did the strike Northwestern transfer who Georgia Tech recruited very hard I thought they had him out of the portal Josh pastner told us that he did think he was going to get Ryan young got him into the Masters program here with young wanting to step business down the road and Ryan young said this week that he liked how he would have fit into the Georgia Tech offense with a post player operating from the elbow Philadelphia well you know how many times uh well how many schools have lost out the players that Dukes recruited so I can sign up for a few guys so I nobodys going to feel sorry for Josh on that one but no he was he was close I think he felt really comfortable that Ryan Young its going to come here but hey he made a great choice I mean you can make the argument and I think I would make the argument that hes been Dukes second best player this year hes been so consistent and he brings a dimension that they dont have when everything breaks down they can throw the ball inside to him in a post and hes a load down there in the post turning over that left shoulder and they can play through him yes when everything breaks down theyre not making jump shots because this is not a great threepoint shooting team so when theyre struggling a little bit they find him in the post and he helps them when their offense gets stagnant he goes to the bench Lively replaces him as philipowski splits at the stripe with Duke doubling up Georgia Tech Midway through this first half Jayden Chute is getting ready to come into the ball game as well for Duke hasnt played in three and a half weeks Smith probing Lively trying to stick with him Jayvon Franklin flash drives and finishes great finish there by Draymond getting to his left hand getting to his left hand off the drive Duke is just so difficult inside there because they got two seven Footers on the floor so if you get by phillipowski you got loudly there Challenger shot just a great drive and finish there against the Zone roach into the midrange no Livelys been good Howard met him up top Maxwell hoists and hits transition again for Georgia Tech those are the shots you need to get here you got to get stops in the tactics defense before they get set they blocking shots in transition grade three there by Maxwell the Lebowski high low in Lively goes right back to phillipowski who couldnt Corral it and a fourth Duke turnover of the turnover here want to try to tackle the transition here Applause talked about the offensive struggles for Georgia Tech so Josh pastners been saying weve got to have fast break points and weve got to have second chance points and gotta limit turnovers as well great great block Bob Rodney how were getting up locking Lively shot running the floor and Maxwell rewarding his team for getting in the ball in the threepoint line Georgia Tech sticking around theres no quitting these guys theyve been competitive all year and I dont see anything changing despite the 812 record one and nine in the ACC of course their only win against top 25 Miami Proctor no offensive rebound Mitchell blocked again by Howard and along the sideline Smith stepped out of bounds Rodney Rodney Howe has been outstanding early in the game hes blocking shots hes been physical inside this is the underside team hes the only guy that matches the size of physicality of this Duke team and if you pass them I dont know how you take him out of the game DJ made a huge impact Four Points five rebounds two blocks now for Howard and to your point hes played all 11 minutes he has but his physicality you can see I mean hes the one guy I think can guard the Duke front line man to man Applause philipowski on the interior backs it out for Mitchell with seven to shoot stop theyre going to concede threepoint shooting they know that and okay thats the fifth three so far in the first half this afternoon for Duke and theyre going to make those shots you just tip your hat to them and get ready for the next game but theyre going to pack it in control of the lane because they know they have to rebound one thing thats been consistent with this Duke team has been their ability to rebound the basketball theyre one of the nations best Franklin driving good defense from phillipowski and last Touch by Franklin its difficult play there Javon Franklin you dont want to leave your feet when you drive just drive play off two feet got in the air there and you definitely dont want to pass the 16 guys around their knees or their feet they dont get that low to get those balls out trust me I got yelled at a many a day trying to pass bounce passes to a big they want those up top toward the rim Tim Duncan wanted it a little higher yeah just a little bit just a little bit I needed a good pass by Proctor for shoot too strong rebound Maxwell thats what you got to do limit him to one shot and rebound no matter what that shot is they prefer to be a three like that you live with the cost dude got back in transition and then they foul Tristan Maxwell Credit Georgia Tech they got the game plan theyre going to stick to it you know you can see them theyre going to give up these threes and just want to say hey whatever shot is taken lets make sure we limit the morning not give them many offensive relay but this is part of the game they got to score offensively they have to score out of their Baseline out of bounds sort of special teams they have to its just a part of the game you got to win this part because youre going to struggle against the switching and all that half court half court defense lets press down on Howard who turns it over trying to connect with Coleman nine point Duke lead on the road here in Atlanta in the first half down two quick ones and surprisingly Dirk live hes got into the party but all the guys are chipping in uh Reese proctored a freshman from Australias coming in knocking down shots this is the game plan for Georgia Tech theyre going to concede these Threes And if Dukes going to knock him down coach fashion said hey were just going to look forward to the next game if they do but right now he was cooling off a little bit I mean theyre shooting better for three to two you gotta you got to live with that so youre going to continue to control the paint the one thing we know this Duke team does do great is rebound the ball threepoint shooting comes and goes theyve not as hot theyre cooling off a little bit lets see if they can pick that back up but for Georgia Tech they did what they need to do now they got to pick things up on the offensive end if they want to get back in this game Josh pastner said to us at shoot around all weve talked about is winning the game in the paint and as youve outlined and did so there thats the gamble theyre making thats the choice that Duke for the season is 32 from three they make fewer than seven per game so thats his decision you have to you cant give up both because if you get spread out theyre small Joe detects a small team and this Duke is one of the biggest teams in the country so when they spread you out we know theyre one of the best rebounding and offensive rebounding teams in the country taking that away theyre playing the percentages this Duke team only shoots 32 from the line from behind the arc so you want to concede that you got to continue something and theyre going to live with hey packing our Zone run our typical Zone principles shoot ran free on the Baseline this is his second Lively another offensive rebound Proctor for three and the key to that is you got it eliminate you got to eliminate Duke with one shot you cant let them know offensive rebound kick out wide open uncontested three and a threepoint shooting contest continues for the Duke four rebounds for lively theyre all offensive rebounds Applause phillipowski did a nice job staying with Coleman now and Avon Smith with Mitchell hounding him shot clock below 10 for Maxwell Falling Away tough shot no great defensive possession there by Mission just switching multiple times and keeping the ball out of out of the paint using his land to contest it Applause now hes posting up Smith battling the front phillipowski oh tear drop after slashing on the rip through just so skilled just catching it shoots it off the drive off the three and post up just a difficult matchup thats why hes playing as well as anyone in the country we step aside Duke up 13 on the road Music Kyle filipowski has been so fun to watch this season and yeah number seven recruit in the country and our ESPN 100 but you saw him in the preseason and it didnt look that way and as you know we talked quick shot earlier he looked anything like that anything but that early on I mean he had all these highly touted freshmen and he just didnt let the party and things were just so fast for him he didnt play very well I didnt come thinking very highly of him and boy has he hit the switch and in turn improved everyone wrong and Im there with many of Scouts and being happy NBA teams were there and he just didnt have a really good productive day in those two days and to see what hes become is just a credit to him and his staff the effort and work hes put in he looks confident hes showing his skill set and he looks like one of the best players in college basketball right now doing it all foul on the rebounding action goes against Duke I mean John shires said to his pregame we were wondering if we were going to be able to play him this season and he told us he had to kick philipowski out of a practice Yeah I was there that day and when I heard the ranking and heard he was rated that high he was kind of like that kid wont play for the machine he cant play and he has just been incredible to watching his development and his confidence and his bodys growing and the strength of just seeing how hes playing hes just theres a toughness about him that you didnt see in September that hes playing with now and its just credit to him first and then the staff and believe in him and and sticking with him and hes developed into their guy hes the guy there he is going to work on Franklin offensive foul first foul of Kyle filipowski thats part of being young as well his development he had the advantage he just gets the ball takes his time settles down a little bit there I dont think he picks up that foul Applause now that left elbow there caught Jayvon Franklin in the face and hes got to take a seat if Im Kyle filipowski Im saying well that is a very similar area to where I got punched in the throat on Monday yeah dont have me out here defending Dukes as a former demon Deacon youre saying but no I thought that was a difficult call I thought it should have been a flagrant one when I saw it I know it would have flipped the game told for Duke and giving him free throws in the ball late but in my eyes that was a flagrant one Mitchell down the lane missed it at The Rim Georgia Tech wants to run nice couple of shots have gone to Miles Kelly who scored his first two then missed the three now Coleman driving held his pivot put and backs it out for Smith I think Georgia Tech needs to do more conscious effort of attacking when he get the ball in transition theyre looking too much to run their half court offense and I just dont think they can those type of shots thats a difficult shot there but by Davon Smith he can do that but I think hes the only guy late in the clock they can create shots on his own his first points joining Kelly a couple of possessions prior like we said and Georgia Tech hanging around within nine with less than five to go in the first half the lapowski getting ready to come back in as Mitchell is fouled and Josh pastner is irate about to rip his coat up already snatch a jacket off with that Javon Franklin went up and I thought that was a great block there I think the freshman got caught in the air going to his left side instead of shooting it with his right hand he shot it with his left and I thought jaymar Franklin had a heck of a defensive play there Applause Josh pastner in the year 2023 said hes giving up slamming the scores table so it sounds like the the jacket is the next source of where he takes out his first person yeah hes going to throw the jacket here and come out of there pretty soon hes not going to slap the table but hes gonna throw his jacket and again I think shot blocking and getting out of transition has been so critical for this team theyre going to need to get all the second chance points in opportunities that they that they can because theyre going to struggle against Dukes length in the half court Applause five blocks for Georgia Tech already and theyve scored a half dozen fast break points as well Mitchell swirls that one out so he splits and the lead is 10 for Duke another one advantage they have jaymon Franklin is a lot smaller than Howard but I think hes a better passer when you get the ball in that that mid post area a couple of jump shots have gone for Smith and John Shire wants a timeout hes the guy if you want to get it going its got to get going with Davon Smith as hes joining the party scoring the last five for Georgia Tech got a game here in Midtown folks talked about it in the opening hes got to have a big game for Georgia Tech if they want to win here against Duke hes the one guy winning late clock shot clock situation happens you got to put the ball in his hand he can make plays off the dribble and make those Club shots hit the last five to go to Tech lets see if that gets him going he talked about with us today after shooting around how they have changed some things in the offense with what you had seen on film yeah hes the guy that can go create a bit for that hes the guy Lake shot clock everyone else needs the system and its hard against teams like Duke because they switch everything so when they switch theyre going to force you to make plays hes one guy that can make plays for himself and his teammates he got a rebound east of baskets here there it is Smith got there and then tried to save it threw it back out young underneath scores just tough luck there you love the effort anytime your six foot guard is out there leading your team in reboundings but just try to throw it away to toward his basket and Dukes lamp just catches it catches it and scores its a tough break for Joe to take there Applause so the good thing about Franklin and the poster I think hes a better passer than Howard from this position Applause its critical when you run a personal style office Sean Clark winding down on Smith missed the runner and the rebound to Jeremy Roach okay Granderson with the entry for Ryan Young Applause mantoman defense switching up the Zone a little bit good seal good pass phillipowski the plush the interior passing of the Duke big has just been great theyre catching the ball in the post and young is such a really good to score there and gets an angle on his Defender and just drops it off to an easy easy dunk there by Phillip housing hes got 10 to lead all scorers a lot of space for Jalen Moore its only hit three triples this season of the games playing there as well against Joe Detective Tech that forced him to knock down shots and right now Dukes making a majority text not young going to work again and Ryan young is cooking hes really good in the post I mean he is as gifted he is their best interior post player getting the ball and scoring and three straight great possessions from Ryan Young back to Eastern Clemson in Tallahassee against Florida State and then Syracuse against Virginia Tech off that win Monday have been snapped a seven game slide Clemson by the way will get back Chase hunter in this game well thats a good thing I mean it Chase Hunter is that guy we talked about late clock situation may go make a play but how about Florida State and Virginia Tech I mean two teams that are now getting healthy and you look at their rankings in the conference and youre thinking Florida States a lot better than that but theyre better than their records in conference play theyre not teams you want to play in February Applause in Tallahassee two against a ranked team coming in you know that the tuck will be rocking Coleman spins one out the rebound snatched by philipowski ol martinoff freshman from Ontario seven footer 10 in white has checked in for just the fifth time this season its only played 14 minutes all year for Josh passner unique size on the floor right now he fouls philipowski Duke is just so big and they got so much Landing again this Jordan Tech team is extremely small so you got to get some signs out there comes into the game and he had he hadnt played against philipowski much its like this big guy moving like a guard out there so the problem just catches it and realizes like hey this guy hadnt played a lot let me find him and get the ball and go make a play against him thats the one thing this program has done to you for many years they will attack someone that just gets in the game hey our womens basketball quadruple header is tomorrow Louisville Syracuse starts it up at noon Eastern then 16th ranked Duke against number 24 Florida State followed by 15th ranked UNC swearing off with Clemson and then Virginia Tech Virginia caps the day the lapowski makes both the lead is 15 as large as it has been for Duke he Duke is up and they want to pass the ball to the mid post and start the offense but Duke Biggs are up theyre denying that pass theyre not letting them catch it there at the elbow and theyre going to concede that jump shot there all day Rodney Howard stops the NATO runs Applause Rodney Howe has been great this game on both ends of the floor just back on the offensive glass hadnt got a lot of offensive looks there and hes up playing like a wing in the zone right now this zone is really extended roach drives and kicks now Proctor back for grandison yes great ball moving by Duke driving getting the paint Force rotation finally open shooter Applause Howard tried his luck again having an air ball this time yeah theyre just searching for answers the team Rodney Howards been playing great took that last shot knocked it down and theyre going to give it to him you know theyre going to give him that shot and just shut down a little short but hey this Duke teams lanthus really this team is coming together theyre playing better on the road we saw that when theyre recent scores they played Clemson tough they played Virginia Tech tough win healthy two of the better teams in this league and even Joe detective lost six straight his team is competing and they do defend they defend very well and theyre one of the nations best with defending a threepoint line but when Duke is scoring the way they are right now shooting 613 from behind the line theyre just having their way early Music foreign up on the final 20 seconds of this first half looking to give philipowski in the post thatll do yeah thats a high percentage shot there off a great cut and the delivery from Jacob grandison to swell the lead to 18 for Duke with a flurry to finish off this first half final four seconds Sturdivant got stripped Coleman got it off and cant knock it down and John Shire loves the finish for his Blue Devils to close the first half he has to because theyve done it on a defensive end they did it on that possession theyve done so so far this half and they shot the threepoint basketball better just great Hat by Duke 18 points is the lead for Duke our halftime score 4325 we get you to the point so when youre winning from behind threepoint line youre winning in the paint you know this is why youre up 18 and a half enjoy the tech you got to come out I think they have to do a little bit more and attack this team before the defense gets set they forced five turnovers but they have yet to score off to off any turnover and I think Duke is doing a great job like that as you see forcing him to catch the ball outside a threepoint line Debo Coleman with a strong take in Lively blocks him thats the impact of lively being in hes an excellent shot block as we talked about him I think he and Franklin you know how would both have played really well as a fiveman matchup in this game Five Points five rebounds and now three blocks for Derek Lively Hal phillipowskis got six now thats his development there in the post and then punishing a smaller Defender his wildest team is so scary and his ability to play four and then guard you on the perimeter on this end of the floor I I think thats why this team distilling is going to continue to stay high because of philipowskis Versatility hes out on Jalen Moore lost the handle recovers so lapowski blocks the straight defense I mean let me just talk about his versus facility on both ends of the floor and when they get to Rick Whitehead back its going to get even better Mitchell all Duke out of the gates Josh pastner a minute 14 and second half needs a timeout Duke is steamrolling the jackets in Atlanta Music 16 more so far and hes done it in so many different ways getting the unselfish pass they have by Ron young driving it there finishing shooting some shooting shots I dont remember I mean hes doing it all but again its his versatility that makes this team so difficult to guard right now and hes picked it up as we talked about it all year all broadcast just him getting better each and every game hes over his rookie long in the middle of the season and now hes picking it right back up playing as well as anybody in the country hes got a twin brother named Matt and Brian eskelson recruited Matt Kyles twin to Harvard where Matt is a freshman Brians in his first year on Josh passner staff here at Georgia Tech we were chatting with him pregame and he said well yeah of course Ive recruited Kyle as well during his sophomore season of high school to Harvard then it appeared well he might be ranked a little bit higher than where Harvard typically lands recruits so the Harvard coaching staff of course led by Tommy avaker they flagged that for the Duke staff that this might be a guy youd have some interest in yeah when the guy grows seven feet and the skill set continues to improve you kind of know when the rankings he shoots up the rankings that might be out of our reaching Tommy Amica just looking awful program hes very fond of it was interesting talking with Brian eskelton as well about what he saw in philipowski through his high school years and he said I thought he would be a first round pick but I didnt think this soon that he would develop the lower half strength to play bowling ball and some of what hes seeing on film coming into this game from philipowski so far Mike Ive had weve had multiple conversations today with people and you can attest that that was the conversation coming from the staff and now the other visiting staff is talking about no one saw this from from Kyle at the beginning of the season Applause Proctor gets into the midrange Smith the rebound this is part of the game I think Georgia Tech has to attack Duke before theyve establish their defense Howard missed the shot and then Mitchell is fouled by Davon Smith thats Smith second I just think Georgia Tech has to play a little bit more like that Applause Davon Smith just hes the leading rebound and so athletic just battling on the glass and see a little bit of a frustrating foul there yeah when you see transition you just got to take it before theyre struggling Duke switches everything so its difficult for them to score off their cutting and I think the other underrated thing is when you run the Princeton style offense its most effective when youre big is a really good passer thats not Rodney Howards strength oh what a love for lively from Tyrese Proctor man you can see that coming Applause Howard how to roll off the rim defended by Lively you dont want to get into a jumping contest with a footer you dont usually win those you dont win those seven foot one Derek Lively springing for that one we got seven and five why not wanted a second triple in one in the first half probably not hes making threes hes catching bodies dunking on people why not shoot his second one hes doing a great job of pushing how it out not letting him catch it as deep and Applause Howard looking for somewhere to go now finds Miles Kelly with just two points until that three yeah hes the guy hes got to get going as well we talked about in the open again Smith and Kelly has gotta lead this team offensively if they want to get back and get competitive in this game and really competitive for the rest of the ACC season a couple of ball screens from Lively he rolls Proctor floats for two Im such a huge fan of Proctors game I think as he physically matures and gets a little gets set up with his role here I think hell be great what do you like most I I just think his calmness hes been a guy hes been thrown into different situations with roach man in and out of the lineup hes played off the ball hes played Point thats not an easy thing to do with the team with all the accolades and everything that comes with the playing to Duke basketball Applause Mitchell driving on the Baseline and he will go to the freethrow line on the other side Ward we have seen the best from Derek gladly offensively if you want to know why hes the number one recruit in the country heres why catching bodies here Smith 45 to todays game had made 32 buckets yeah 31 of them had been at The Rim hes got three more makes today two of them at The Rim including that lot his 27th donut again hes such hes hes you see his lens but hes such an athletic big that again when he drives hes going to help the guards get to the rim because if you help off him they just got to throw it up to the rim hes going to go up and Elevate and dunk it like he just did there a few minutes ago and thats what he brings I mean as a number one recruit Youre Expecting all of this offense thatll come later in his career right now his super his superpower I like to call it is running the floor being an athletic defending and rebounding and hes doing it at a high level right now John Shire two days ago made an interesting comparison he said look go back to Mark Williams freshman year he wasnt playing a lot yeah I remember doing a January game where Mark Williams turned it over three times right away and they yanked him in a couple of minutes but John Shire said by the end of the year Mark Williams was dominating teams and that set the stage for what Williams did last year well one thing the true serum here in this league and everything that happens and you just you see it you can you know watch I mean when hes doing these things theyre good like right now hes controlling the paint Howards had a few flashes for Georgia Tech outside of that these guards are unable to attack him and switch him thats what his length and athleticism helps his team out at the defensive end like he is the one true shot blocker there he wants it again there it is oh and he throws down another On Cue this is the impact that this young man has Howard walked with it wow I mean you could just see him coming and hes throwing it up there you cant get up there backside guards theres nothing Maxwell can do there is that a guard you just got to watch you got to get in front of him well beforehand but when he elevates hes catching that at the square guy whos only scored in double figures once in his crashman season he had 11 points against Ohio State hes got nine in this one to go along with six rebounds and a trio of blocks now youre going to see the difference and they can get philipowski right there and hes going to get that shot its just difficult now what did he do and he got that shot because Lively last time got the dunk and then you leave the best player in the gym you know open at the elbow right there to get to 15 foot jump shot and its just its just a difficult matchup right now for Georgia Tech because they cant stop him and again now hes in the passing Lane hes doing what hes done all game eliminating that pass Proctor dish Mitchell backs it out roach steps in 23 his third one in the night just great basketball hero Duke no let up if you Jordan attack what do you do you got it you definitely got to take care of the basketball but again theyre doing a great job of trying it Dukes George Tech wants to get the ball to That Elbow right there and initiate their offense Music too strong on a triple try from Jayvon Franklin and rebound number seven for Derek Lively 133 a rather 163 the second half scoring Edge for Duke 26 got to be careful with that when Franklin and these guys start taking threes thats not what they usually do and its not their strength and I know youre down you know about a lot here but roach again just the way the game started the way it is right now roach with backtoback threes the way he started the scoring for Duke in the first half and you know with a young group this is their this is their style of playing enjoy the Techs gonna have to show up I mean there youre down big now I mean its just a 32point game right now and theres there will be no let up on this team trust me Ive been on the back side of some of these losses and its not fun at all Howard misses phillipowski clears roach has four threes of the eight for Duke in this one phillipowski can knock it down the bench was ready to erupt Lively stripped it free and earns another possession for Duke now Techs going to get out of the zone and go to their mantoman defense Applause roach feeling it why not wanted another Mitchell battles good block out from Coleman and itll stay at this end of the floor with Duke wow I mean what an onslaught from John shires group Georgia Tech late first half pound four and a half to go they had cut it to seven it was 30 to 23 and since then a Duke demolition well when your game plan was eliminate the reason was given Threes And it controls the pink they were controlling the pain anyway and knocking down threes and you know its difficult to just completely change your game plan in the middle of a game when youve come in locked in and thinking that youre gonna kind of fall on your source so to speak with that type of game plan roach Franklin the rebound it is 193 Duke in the second half Georgia Tech is one of ten this half until that three from Maxwell thats the way I I think they got to do more of that in general I dont know if they can come back and get into this one but scorn against in transition again I think its something they have to look forward to trying to score in the first eight seconds nothing else goes to close your way then you run your half court offense after that tipped Away by Franklin stays with Duke and Georgia Tech isnt a pressure team they usually try to control the pace and tempo of a game kind of holds you in the 60s and low 70s at that and Dukes already with 12 minutes to go already at 62 points and scoring woes of the yellow jackets just hit it its here right now thats what whats been able and his team all year long stability to score and who is going to score 30 from the floor in this one thats what we told you in the first half Josh pastner has been lamenting throughout ACC play he said really with the exception of that win over Miami we just have not shot it well Franklin battles for the steal the jackets do push again Coleman gets wrapped up by Blakes who commits the foul and sends us to a timeout Duke is doubling up Georgia Tech here in Atlanta like this next four games you get wake at home North Carolina at home a week from today then at Miami at Virginia so the question Randolph Childress is what do you take out of what you have seen so far today from duke that you think translates in that big of a stretch for us well I think their defense is getting better as we talked about and its a team theyre getting more comfortable we talked about the last two Road games they were more competitive early on Wake was the team that beat them at home they kind of started that Carolina you know and as they continue on and as the season gets on theyre getting better and better and theyre role playing and thats the thing you wanted to see them do we thought they were a little better than Georgia Tech coming in theyre proving us right with that and theyre just playing good basketball right now but their defense has to travel with them if theyre gonna win that wing and then obviously one of the biggest robbery in college basketball against Carolina and then you got Miami and Virginia thats a tough sledding how about their offense what do you make of them at that end of the floor because coming into today 43 field goal percentage currently their lowest field goal percentage in a season since 195960 that season what I Rely a lot on their freshmen as we know but some of that is theyve had so many injuries the guys have been in and out of the lineup you know Derek Whitehead we talked about his injury he was their second leading offensive scorer in ACC play now hes back out of the lineup you know we hoping to get him back quickly so lets just I think the question becomes as we said theyve only had their full compliment roster in 12 of their 20 games so far this season and so shires kind of shuffling to see whos available and thats dictating their style of play so when they get everybody healthy I think thatll dictate what we see from this team going forward Jalen Blakes play with that mask for his broken nose grandison at the rim with two more for Duke Brian did some great job of just knowing a shot clock student body tried to trick him a little bit there and give him a five four three two one countdown he wasnt biting no not at all good finish from Javon Franklin at The Rim you mentioned Tariq Whitehead if youre just joining us hes out today after the injury Monday against Virginia Tech which fortunately a whole lot better than it initially looked like absolutely MRIs came out negative John Shire said Tariq is relieved at the results he got Shire told us pregame that its a ligament strain its not Achilles its not cap its lower leg a strain to a ligament within that leg and certainly seems like it could be sooner rather than later yeah its one of those ligaments in the leg that I dont think coaches are can pronounce as some doctors term needs to let everyone know but we saw him earlier he was shooting around moving around really well and I expect him to come back sometime in the near future but he looked good today seeing him pregame and just really happy for him for a young man who had a foot injury early in the season he hadnt totally gotten himself in shape he was starting to play his best basketball so hopefully he can come back quickly and get back to that it was a broken foot to the other foot yeah in the preseason that slowed him to begin the year of course and yeah we walked in to the gym about two hours before the game today and he was shooting hes not jumping yet but he was out there in warmup uniform and getting some shots up yeah anytime youre that comfortable getting out early doing those things and he was here even before we got here and we always get in early so to see him out there getting his work in early let you know that hes feeling better and that I would expect him to get back on recording the nephew most of the time we get there early well sometimes its your fault today yeah he wasnt here as early as usual no we had some car issues a malfunction it wasnt your fault though I wont blame you for that thank you Randolph Childers Mike Monaco our entire crew behind the scenes Midway through the second half on the flats tyrees Proctor has been great hes got a season High eight assists good feed for young from grandison Applause its a difficult part about when you play this new team now now they got their bench players out there but thats the experience coming in now and you know young and Granderson and lakes just provide so much depth and experience with this group Maxwell driving on Blakes Franklin again hes got it 10 points now to lead Georgia Tech Franklin always plays bigger than you would think when you look at his size and hes just always he plays like hes six nine and six ten and hes real bouncy and with great length and hes finished the last couple of baskets here Applause grandison from the free throw line miscommunication was switched there by Joe the tech and those grandson open for the freethrow line jump under nine and a half to go here in this second half Maxwells got eight wanted another triple good battle on the boards from Franklin but it belongs to Duke theres enough time if you go to Tech you want to mount a comeback but theyre just not built the way they run their Princeton offense to you know to take those kind of shots and quick shots they need to try to score it on defense getting stops and getting out in transition but team operates better when they get to run their half court offense and run their Princeton Cuts but when they get defensive stops thats when they got to look and take those threes theyve got Smith Moore Franklin Coleman and Maxwell the five on the floor for Josh pastner Subs on the Duke side with Lively and shoot coming back in Anderson connects from Deep a ninth made three for the Blue Devils theyre just shooting lights off right now and again you know the game plan is out of the window you just this Pastor said himself you just gotta hes gonna dare him to shoot threes theyve made nine already and you know when theyre doing that and that was your game plan to stop that you just say hey lets get ready for the next one backing down shoot getting some run today for the first time in three and a half weeks and Maxwell scores over him yeah he had a hit point of there and hes a guy thats a natural scorer that you know if he could come around he can give them a different dimension and I dont know if they have Quick Step from roach and Davon Smith commits the foul we should mention with Georgia Tech as well theyre still without typical starter Lance Terry hes out for a third straight game with a hamstring issue and hes a guy who came in from Gardner Webb and you see was chewing up a lot of minutes and Josh passner said it was a few weeks ago their best perimeter Defender yeah and he also was shooting the ball while he was shooting 34 from three and theres just one thing this team needs is another guy that could knock down shots in you know hes dearly missed right now with that hamstring into me Granderson comes up short he was too open on that one I think thats what it was good problem to have but sometimes harms you Maxwell short as well Lively rips down a rebound and draws a foul and Derek Lively has matched the season high with nine boards he looks healthy and I think the biggest thing is hes a young man that had a calf injury earlier and it cost him his preseason he missed the game or too early in the year and missed a couple of games with an illness and sickness and now hes hes rounded into shape and hes coming around and being an athletic player that that Force interior on the interior for this Duke front court that we knew hed become hes showing you why he was the number one recruit in the country I think people were just looking at his numbers from an offensive standpoint and expecting something different but this is what he does right here extra possession kicks it out they move it for Mitchell on the drive with the right hand with the Im just such a huge fan of that young man no one plays their role better than Mark Mitchell does he does with all the Freshman success he doesnt get as much I think he defends multiple positions he knows what it is he doesnt takes bad shots and hes gonna be a force for the Blue Devils in the future Ill get a Defender is he can leaky black I think hes I think leaky is one of the more versatile ones because his length he can guard more point guards I think Mark Mitchell can but I just think his hes been playing on the offensive end somewhat out of position more so because of all the injuries and the shuffling of everyone in and out of the lineup shoot cant connect Applause inside of seven to go Kelly left alone swirls one out rebound Roach Kellys just continuing his slump he was four of 23 in the last three games coming in and you know you want for his confidence that hed take and make those kind of shots and ignore the score you just got to continue to play Mitchell into the lane gets the roll and thats because of having one of the ball spring with Derry Lively its one of those things that dont show up in the stat sheets the big doesnt want to help because if he does you throw the laugh to him so he stays with Lively Mark Mitchell just turns the cornering with his dominant hand and just gets to the rim with ease Mitchells got 115 and four they get a foul with 610 to go with Duke dominating Georgia Tech Lively had some slams Mitchell gets involved for the Blue Devil Music Clemson at 91 Virginia with a win today at 82 you see the rest of the top eight who do you like what stands out to you the biggest surprise in in turn in the conference this year is Clemson I I think theyre 911 and I believe theyre the best team in the ACC and will be at the end and I do I think theyll finish this thing out provide it they stay healthy I think TJ Hall and I think Hunter Tysons playing as well as anyone in deserving of right now the first half Player of the Year in the ACC and Chase hunter gets going and they got to get Brevin Galloway back I mean his injury from you know from scarier than Derek whiteheads injury I mean get him back and get him back in the lineup and playing and well see how long hes out but I think they have it all I think they would Chase Hunter being back the teams they defend theyve always had an identity on a defensive end and its gonna be a tough out yeah if you havent heard of Brevin Galloways injury we wont update it here no well leave that to your search engine of choice but he is already selling shirts with a play on words on his website Smith doesnt get a follow way to go after the fancy football yeah hes he sounded like he was still being medicated when he was explaining its just a scary thing to hear I I dont even know what to say about it I mean its just a difficult thing and you just hope hes okay yeah well leave it at that yeah all the best home and glad to know that he felt comfortable enough to do that Christian Reeves into the game 21 in Black for Duke he flashes open with the stop and Crystal Reed will be another guys embarrassment of seven footage of the Duke Blue Devil team has I mean he has the size and length and buried behind a bunch of guys but hell hell youll hear about him in the coming years and as he stuck behind some of the more talented freshmen in the country but another big guy that I think will be in Durham for years to come and has a replica skill set to to be a really good player Mitchell off Target Reeves draws a foul all right so some other scores in the ACC today Virginia 7657 a win over Boston College in Charlottesville and then NC State and WinstonSalem against wake who has now dropped three in a row NC State wins 7977 yes in a game that proceeded out thats a major win for Wolf Pack I mean that team is dangerous we know about that backcourt of jaquel Joyner and Craven Smith there and Casey Marcel theyre as good as any guard player in the country and who saw Burns today with his 319 I mean he was outstanding just giving him that presence inside and if he can give you anything close to that and look out that the Wolfpack teams theyre legit DJ Burns wow you heard that correctly from Randolph 319 he was 14 of 26 from the floor and led NC State to that win on the road he was their offense in the second half of that game and just a credit to him and that staff just a great Road win and Geeks as we talked about that next up for those guys is Duke and on the road they got to turn things around theyve dropped their last three conference games in a row I saw them Wednesday at Pitt pit hit 183 as a program record and Blake Henson matched an individual program record with eight of those 18 for the Panthers well theyre a team thats playing right now well on the offensive energy struggling defensively and its a tough place to struggle in this league if in this league theres so many good players if youre not defending at a high level youre just not going to win you know there isnt but so long you can just line up and outscore people at some point you gotta start matching up and taking things away Blakes had it kicked off by Davon Smith man Davon Smith is still playing hard here for Georgia Tech down the stretch battling with Duke in control ready to get a road win in Atlanta number 20 Miami at Pitt and Miamis up by five at the break in maybe the game of the weekend of the conference I think those are two really good teams there I mean the guard play in that game right there is whoever wins the backcourt matchup will win that game it looks like the Miami back Quarters off to a hot start on the road against Pitt the tough team to play against theyre playing really good basketball as well stick around coming up top of the hour we will get you to Tallahassee Florida state is hosting number 24 Clemson who gets back Chase hunter that is big for Brad Brownell and the Tigers it is definitely want to get him back dude right now has cleared their bench and allowing everyone to play here Applause turn it over as John Shire empties the bench he told me earlier about Brian eskelson Georgia Tech assistant coach came over from Harvard Harvard transferred hail Catchings 12 in Black hes into the game a guy that Brian eskelson knows well knows very well former player for him through the years Tommy Amaker staff T8 Howard is backing down on Reeves who commits the foul with the shot clock why hes cool chatting with Brian escorts at about tail Catchings earlier today so this guy is super smart coming out of high school 35 on the ACT and instead of going into a situation when he transferred where he could play more and hit the mid major level or low major level well he wants to be a sports agent so decided to go to Duke and uh the Brotherhood thats a pretty good place to start for Connections in Atlanta work great to have teammates theres going to be Pros that may be one that you can represent one day so hes a lot smarter than we are I can tell you that Sheldon Williams was here at the game today Rodney Hood also in the building we got word that Duke Legend Mike buckmeyer was here as well Music coming up on two to go here at mccamish Pavilion Reeves kicks out for Jaden shoot driving on Davon Smith tough following for shooting his teammates love it great job there under control playing off two feet reverse pivot and shot his fade away just those the type of plays you want to make this time of game because you want to show the coach that you can do that so that when theres your closer games that he can put you in a lineup and thats a Jalen Blakes blocking the threepoint shot from Maxwell Blakes fetishes plus a foul and everything coming up Duke here today Batman Blakes with the block handy and one on the other end just great defense coming down and finishing no mass is going to slow him down thats so difficult to play with I dont think people understand how uncomfortable that is to have something like that on and credit to that young man for toughing it out and I mean you can see that Blakes over the course of these last few games has been fidgeting with it a whole lot its the most annoying thing ever because its right there and you have to wear it but its just sitting right there and you can literally see it and you can feel it it just feels weird to have something on your face like that and oh I remember that and I I dont even you did it oh God yes yeah your college College oh Batman doing his part here down the stretch Blakes had to roll off Catchings tried to follow scoots out to Howard who starts it back for the jackets how long do you have to wear it uh a couple weeks a couple of weeks actually my team you know who broke my nose one of my teammates Duncan broke my rim uh Tim Duncan broke your nose yeah him and Joe Smith were fighting for a rebound and I guess I had no business in there and his elbow hit me and broke my nose intentionally I think it was he claims he wasnt he claims it wasnt but I I still hold it against him can I put you on the spot you and I have talked privately about Tim Duncan and youre still close friends with him whats your best Tim Duncan store oh you know what it probably would be his recruiting visit I mean him coming in there and just his story you know what great player he is but one of the funniest people that youll ever know he doesnt share that side with everyone but really his recruiting visit he comes in and its snowing and were at an IHOP eating breakfast and Odom its like hey I need you to come on this visit for this guy and its Tim and hes coming and I show up and it is freezing rain like an inch of snow outside and he has like a short sleeve shirt and flipflops on its sitting at the breakfast just shivering Im looking like coach this dude cant play like man they wasting my time like the only thing I got out of that was Im a swimming Im like hes a swimmer from St Croix so thats where my name came from I always call him Saint Croix because of that like the Saint Croix this dude is coming in February with flipflops on and its snowing outside like get this dude out of here you cant help me he cant help us win games like what are you doing boy did I get that one though yeah I got that one me I got it wrong shoot scores as we approach the final 30
