you mentioned the kids are ready because today was the last day of class absolutely they got me ready in here Obi Im bouncing with the fans set the goal the Hokies and the Flyers and we are underway as Virginia Tech wins the opening tip first they just knocked off number 18 North Carolina from the corner Couture right away launching a long distance shot hes hitting about 45 percent from threepoint land as we look at the Dayton starting five and that includes on seal who is 69 out of Finland you may remember he was the guy hit the game when he shot in Orlando to beat Kansas last year up top on seal will let that one fly but cant get it to go and you talk about a team that is struggling to shoot the basketball right now as we get a look at Virginia Techs starting lineup Sean Padula Hunter the Couture in the backcourt Darius Maddox of course with the pullup thats his game and we talked about the front court with bazilly and mutts for the Hogans gate coming in kind of disappointing because theyve really had a lot of trouble with injuries and illness rolling inside Blakeney for the first basket RJ Blake needs 66 sophomore hes out of Baltimore and Blakely had a big game against the Hokies a season ago when Virginia Tech visited Dayton a fivepoint loss which Mike young said is probably the worst Beatdown for a fivepoint game that hes ever had in his career it was an interesting comment theres Maddox again in and out hes had a couple of good looks right out of the shoot as we mentioned Dayton a preseason pick for the top 25 but theyve lost to UNLV Wisconsin NC State and BYU accommodation lots of injuries and some illnesses absolutely the injuries even bigger Malachi Smith the point guard right through for two only playing four games this year and where he really has felt is the difference has looked defensively a great assistant turnover guy but hes the guy that would be responsible for trying to keep Sean Padula out of the paint will lift that one off the back of the iron hes a 68 freshman from Mongolia first Mongolian citizen Everett Ernie division one scholarship and how did I know that saying shower jobs would not phase you at all it was just rolling off the tongue so perfect oh downstairs and no basket but a Nifty pass there for Grant bazilly the 69 grad brand new to the Hokies this year grad transfer out of Wright State a foul and well go against on seal news coach Mike young tonight his 100th game at the helm for Virginia Tech year number four and Anthony Grant said the first thing we talked about earlier today he told us Mike young is probably the most underrated coach in the country he has so much respect for Mike young and what hes been able to do and not just at Virginia Tech but he has a tremendous amount of respect and so much respect that his team is going zoned because he knows how great of an offensive coach Couture got a pretty good look rebound picked off by Holmes as you mentioned hes not standing rebounding its about seven a game hes the star on this Dayton team 16 points also leads him in Block shots hes the engine for them he absolutely is and Im glad that hes back home just one of those guys where you could have seen him but put his name in the NBA draft and most likely would have been picked last year Im sure Anthony Grants going to have them back as well as he cues up one for two right on time plays at about 240 pounds so thats an awful lot to try and stop Music medulla he was talking about his weight hes put on about 10 pounds from last years bigger and stronger more confident he really is and that confidence comes from that strength he has the ability to take the ball to the basket absorb the contact and still finish Applause seal with the kick out just getting started here it should be a rockness crowd especially the kids knowing the class is done for the moments anyway spinning inside was Kamara but he couldnt get it to roll in the followup by arms seal no and a block from high but a foul and as mutts went up to try and stop that shot and theres a look at Anthony Grant a sixth year at the helm for Dayton coaching his alma mater a couple of years removed from a 292 season a day one of the best people you will ever meet a great coach even better man and hes starting to rock his Corey Alexander beard hes got the great going over there now a little Touch of Gray you know a little more than a touch probably not as much as I have but still you both look very distinguished to me very proposaurus yeah just as you say with zero gray hair over they sit beside it so Im you know Im doing what I can sometimes you you have to go with what you have I agree six to two Dayton Oakies of course was such a great story last March you and I were there and Brooklyn when they just caught fire and played great basketball on four games in four days to win the ACC tournament guitarist slamming on the brakes tough move for two underrated aspect of Hunter Coutures game his ability to attack the basket get to the rim and finish we talk about strength he absolutely has it in the building to score over bigger players that one knocked out off of Virginia Tech on the deflections 1601 to go here in the first half dating a team that has turned it over more than their opponents probably a function of losing those guards Kobe Elvis and Malachi Smith both out of the lineup not available tonight yeah the Flyers actually have a negative four assisted turnover count on the season its been one of the Achilles heels for this team also the catch flips it up follows his own Miss and thats where hes so tough to defend not just the first jump but the second jump allowing him to get the second chance points top 40 National recruit last year out of Arizona 610 knocks on the Baseline itll shoot that one but it wont drop and hes cold out of the game but thats one of the things that Mike young wants to see he wants to see Darius Maddox shoot the basketball more be more aggressive up and in for two and hell go to the line as well 104 dating off to a quick start Music Ill be 42 by Wisconsin getting just 65 points per game and the threepoint shooting a big reason why but theyre shooting it well here early and we have to mention Malachi Smith Their starting point guard Kobe Elvis and Kobe Braya all have missed games this season those are the three returning guards from an nit team a season to go and Smith who had 175 assists last year and broke the Dayton record for 50 with 59 steals is important in the lineup is out now with the ankle injury so the Hokies trying to get it going theyre good shooting team 50 percent overall 36 percent from the threepoint line mutts up top here for bazilly got over 18 points a game for Wright State last year so he was a proven scorer and as hell spin into the lane hook it up and in pretty move there and right on time seeing that great when you talk about somebody they go get a bucket thats kind of the way it works when youre working with the notorious Doc its your first notorious of the season I knew it wouldnt take more than about six minutes by the time he got that in Holmes rolling blocked from behind and a clean one by bazilly now the sophomore drops it in anyway hes Relentless he absolutely is and thats the second time weve seen him gather his own Miss and pick up Second Chance points he is going to be a handful five offensive rebounds already for Dayton zero for the Hokies and thats making an early difference silly will flip that one up and in hes got a little game in that lane yeah weve got a battle between these two front courts brazili and Holmes going at it and then Kamara and mutts this is going to be a battle all night between these guys Kamara trying to find some room there and its another foul there by mutts thats going to be number two on Justin months and Duron Holmes and basili going out of basili with the block shot home sticking to it coming up with the second chance points but basilia on the other end of the floor going off the bounce off the one foot the Finish over the top great matchup between the two centers in this game Music shot clock down to 10 here Holmes back downstairs working working block from behind by Lynn Kidd his Junior the transfer from Clemson Padula yes all the way through as he banks in a bucket and the Hokies have sprung to life offensively ASAP adola put so much pressure on your defense with his ability to attack the rim Blake knee has it knocked away Camara going in strong with a left hand but that didnt touch anything and its deflected off Dayton and Virginia Tech with an opportunity to Tire Take the Lead Sean badul is so confident turns defense into offense the blocked shot he doesnt care how many white judges are back there hes going to attack them all one on Three still ends up being a bucket for number three one of nine siblings so you come up in a family like that where you never really see the inside of the bathroom I mean youre always waiting in line you you develop a toughness about you absolutely but my question is well as this really knocks down to three hes gotten it going here offensively who who was the 10th who played pickup was it mom or dad who got in to make the game right its a great question thats going to be an offensive foul a charge here against Dayton now Im still going strong down the lane but a foul and weve seen bazilly go off the bounce you cant give him this much room knocking down the three on one end of the floor and then you see stepping up Padula taking the contact picking up the charge a 92 run here for the Hokies that a great win over North Carolina knocked Carolina out of the top 25 on Sunday 8072 Tech holding North Carolina to 18 percent shooting from the threepoint line yeah and thats thats really the calling card for Mike young we know how great of offensive coach he is but defensively thats where really you have to appreciate what hes been able to do with this Virginia Tech program the Doula flipping the Kid buried the midrange jumper hokey started out two for eight theyre now five for five suddenly theyre sizzling and a nice move sharp jobs coming off has been productive as a freshman eight assists in both of his last two games starting to pick up the Rhythm and Pace he needs to play with to be successful at this level the Doula with the kick Hokies will air mail that one out of the corner way off Target by The Freshman Collins by one coming up in 12 minutes first half pretty good pace kick here wide open Kamara but cant hit it tipped out High into the lane Applause no secret that both these teams want to be able to score in the painted area Virginia Tech a little more dangerous from Beyond the threepoint Arc thats been a struggle for the Flyers throughout this season down the lane very tough angle by Buchanan Applause and a onepoint lead here for the Hokies on top 15 before hes heard all about Duron Holmes and wants to make sure he shows off his game as well going off the bout for the first two buckets and then spotting up from Beyond the three knocking it down Brad pizzilli has got it going here this evening and at Wright State average 13 points a game and almost seven rebounds as well you talked about the opener 30 points 10 rebounds thats a great way to introduce yourself to the fan base absolutely you become a fan favorite very quickly when you drop a 3010 game on your first one Music so you would have thought that Justin mutts stepping out with a couple of fouls picked up two fast ones would you know stop the hokeys cold but in fact theyre on a 72 run since then they really have and again the Hokies team doesnt they run through must but they dont need much to be offensively productive at all times they got a number of other guys that can make plays specifically Sean Padula and Hunter Couture can pick up this the slack on the offensive end much backhand Padula bounced into the lane for Collins he left it short and tipped out off the hand of Lynn Kidd of the Hokies coming up on Sunday a full afternoon a womens basketball starting at noon Eastern our featured matchup Diamond Johnson number eight NC State hosting 82 South Florida coverage being in two Eastern right after pit Ball State right here on acc Network Music 13 so Dayton picking up their third team foul 10 46 to go here in the first half how about the crew we have with the league of cell Ron Gruber Roger Ayers in the house tonight its like a final four crew man who are you telling Padulas jumper wont drop questions so Dayton trying to get back on top sorry Johnson will give it up there into the paint side stepping laying that one off the window will not go okay she could not make that one fall and switched in on the money by Brazil hes just having a great first half uhoh he is heating up knocked out his last two threes four for four from the field for brazili and hes one of those guys when he gets it going hes not going to stop himself Obi Applause long distance three will not fall tipped Away by Washington kept it alive and a second effort here for the Flyers Brea outside and Dayton is Missler last five make it six and the Hokies crashing the glass the Doula looking for an opening lays it up and in help that hell go to the line I just love the confidence that Sean Padula is playing with he comes down he recognizes Sean Johnson having a hard time staying in front of him and Sean Padula putting it in drive going to the left hand to avoid the shot locker and then a little Flex to his own bench I mean we understand why hes flexing young man came in hes gained 10 pounds 10 pounds of muscle since last season you know he looked like a freshman last year yeah it looked like now he looks like a upperclassman even though hes on their sophomore it looks like an upperclassman Applause four percent of the line threepoint play to open up a 2114 advantage last field goal was about five minutes ago they need homes right now and Ron Holmes pounding that basketball to his right hooks it theres a lid on it right now for the Flyers they do get the second effort this is one of the areas that Mike young was concerned about was Daytons rebounding especially on the offensive end of the floor well kg nice swooping shot in the lane more Second Chance points and when you continue to get multiple opportunities its going to work out for you Dayton able to take the lid off the basket on that possession yes boy is he feeling it a triple uhoh it must be you Obi he knows youre in the building and hes got it going here in this first half no hesitation at all on his shots thats going to be an offensive the sheriff Johnson looks hes upset by that but its actually the point guards fault not allowing his teammate to get set and speaking of getting set it doesnt take much for bazilly to get set you cant close out on him slow especially when hes shooting it this well he came in hitting 43 percent of his threes its a tough assignment for a guy six nine who can get out and do that and now you see theres a difference in the way hes being guarded and Brazilian going to the putting it on the floor extends that left arm picking up the offensive foul so charge my grandpasilly Applause Virginia Tech e2416 here against it rather beaten up Dayton team has been a big reason why with his heady play at the point hell take a breather Applause foreign under eight to go and a pretty quick moving first half they want Holmes to get a touch he knows exactly where to go and you see thats the goto guy for the Flyers when things arent going well get the basketball into Deron Holmes hands normally good things will happen for you he has eight here in the first half well they cant stop him right now every time he touches it hes making a shot hes six for six Applause 2618 the Hokies Applause beyond the three Applause cant get a shot off defense has been tight here for the Hokies the last seven or eight minutes in particular Freya long distance straight on got an excellent look cant hit the shot Im looking for the hot hand here Obby you cant help off a guy to shooting it that well around and out but the student section right with him on every shot I think absolutely and that was a defensive breakdown alms knocked away and stolen by Couture hell drive it got airborne kick out here Maddox cant drain it hes been off Target got a good look just unable to knock it down but Mike young would take those shots associate head coach Mike Jones told me today Mike young never flinches when Hunter Couture Darius matters get a look never even thinks about it he wants those guys to shoot with confidence the Dayton needs to build some confidence to be on a threepoint line theyre old for five Blakeney the shot clock at five and one and done there for the Flyers and Virginia Tech looking like a team that is settling in a little bit again coming in eight and one and Conference play 10 after the big win over North Carolina has Georgia Tech at the Smith Center on Saturday and theres brasily again left open for another threepointer and that builds the largest lead tonight for the Hokies but when a guy gets this High you have to abandon your normal rules of helping youve got to make sure you stay in touch with a guy like Brant brazili when he is feeling this good on the offensive end of the floor 18 points for the 69 grad Applause now roll Holmes lost control of the rebound the hot hand he wants it hes finding his spot right now youre not close enough Collins no thats the difference with the freshman he didnt know get the ball to bezilla hes the guy thats on fire right now get him the basketball at all costs find number 21 and let him do his thing he bezillas shooting the ball way downtown another clang away and again just the one shot here for the Flyers and they cannot hit threes they have not been a good threepoint shooting Team all season long and they certainly have not been tonight weve got a timeout Grant brazili has it going 18 of the Hokies 29 Points doing it inside doing it outside sitting on 18 points started out shooting the ball okay they have chilled considerably four for their last 18 the reverse is true for Virginia Tech because theyre finding number 21 theyre finding number 21 and number 21 is finding the bottom of the bucket and right now Im sure Mike young has something designed to give him a look here out of the timeout Applause kid will flip that one through the lane and Ox to his right pretty play there he needed a bucket he really did and I like the decision to attack the basket not just continue to settle for jump shots see the ball go through build some confidence and the next jumper will be much easier remember he was huge in the ACC tournament in Brooklyn last spring way downtown by um seal and from threepoint land it is a cold night for the Flyers at least so far they are over seven and Elaine guess who the zilli with two more and the difference between a freshman and a junior you know where the hot hand is and you know how to get him the basketball because he can give you a 15point lead last year as a freshman and now look at him this season with the added weight the strength thats a lot of hours in the weight room too it absolutely is he put the work in and it is showing for him this season averaging close to 17 points a game great assist to turnover ratio 36 assists on the season only 13 turnovers and leading from the point guard position playing great basketball this season Mike young relying on the young sophomore to get the job done as the coach on the floor hes playing about 35 minutes a game to lead the team meanwhile Dayton two out of their last 14 shooting the basketball Kamara gets a touch so silly trying to defend him and does a good job of it and the Hokies take it back and thats another area where Brazilia helps his team hes a very good shot blocker so not just a guy that doesnt on the offensive end of the floor defensively helps his team as well kicked away Padula and it was tipped by Dayton Oakies down to 132 run Padula trying to add to that he does nothing but net from threepoint land and he hasnt been shooting to three great as of late but hes a confident young man no question about it hes going to take advantage of his opportunities Applause we have a full day of Hoops coming up Saturday starting at one oclock on acc Network featuring this game at 5 30 Kyle philipowski number 15 Duke hosting Maryland Eastern Shore at Cameron Indoor on acc Network and ESPN app for Dayton this has become their largest deficit of the season at 18 defense continues to be really good his kid knocks that one away nappy Grant came into this game with tremendous respect for Mike young for the Hokies he told me early that hey these guys are good no question about it were going to have to be strong with the basketball cant turn it over and were going to have to defend and theyve done a great job defending this season but Im not sure anyone can guard the Hokies right now especially the way Grant bazilly has it going thought about it Couture did too mad Ox to the paints but swishes that one in and theyre pretty much getting anything they want right now they really are you see the way they share the basketball even though brazili has it going he gives up a look Hunter Couture gives up a look to get Darius Maddox a nice driving lane Lucille cant connect Blake D with the rebound deep in the corner Applause sharp Johnson with the bounce Kamara that clangs away just nothing going right at the moment for the Flyers yeah you can see the Flyers struggle to shoot the basketball from the perimeter Padula with a quick move to the Baseline under two minutes to go here in the first half and a Hokies having a great time at home heres basily again in and out we were shocked when he misses Im counting it as a mate thats me thats a make if it goes down it comes back out Im counting it as a man that was in the cylinder for half an hour youre right sharp Johnson is his own Miss there and misses again so its just been tough sledding in the paint or beyond the three for the Flyers yeah and you have to give the Hopkins credit for their defense but at the same time right now Daytons just missing easy shot so theres a combination of both but regardless its allowed the Hokies to build a 20point lead here in the first back out here and a great save finds kid his turn around good and at this point for the Hokies everyone has it going offensively lead kid knocking down his second jumper of the game Kamara yes and finally a threepointer that goes here for Dayton the final minute of the first half as the Hokies have raced to a 4021 advantage and Mike young as mentioned his 100th game here for the Hokies and thats got to be to my way of thinking one of the best halves his team has had and Coach young is sharp today too he bought out the good suit for game number 100 I like it 4021 Applause under 20 to go here before halftime uh Padula will take his time jumping inside went to that left hand opportunity for a long distance shot and that will clang away and thats how the first half mans and it was all Hokies after about the first four or five minutes yeah the Hokies doubling up the Flyers as my gosh rocking the Dell Curry throwback hokeys putting up numbers like they used to do when Gomez was here well no two ways about it a very impressive first half there for the Hulk Justin much picked up you know a couple fouls early and then Sean Padula Grant bazilly took over offensively 32 points combined for those two guys in the first half so Dayton Ole Miss up on the basketball here in the second half trying to get something rolling made only one threepointer in the first 20 minutes shot clock down inside Tim click the beyond the three jumper on the way from the corner and thats going to be swished in on seal right on target there and thats got to be a confidence builder for amsil and for Dayton only the second threepoint field goal they made only one for 10 in the first half so to see one go down early in the second half has to be encouraging but silly not this time so the flyer is looking for a quick run and before the shot no basket a foul inside the first minute of play here in the second half Padula we had a really nice first half with 12 points and ran the floor very well and Padula who gets caught up with Holmes coming down Padula trying to figure out how he gets the foul but its because of the left arm wrapping around Deron Holmes Applause heres Holmes 610 sophomore giving it up and shot clock becomes a factor to six Blakely trying to drive it inside knocked away clean theft there by Maddox and thats really whats got Maddox more opportunities on the floor is his defensive ability when he got here coming from Oak Hill Academy wasnt a great defender I wont take any responsibility for that but Bill knocked to the floor but no whistle there but earned the trust of Mike young a year ago on the defensive end and allowed him to get on the floor what a pretty shot that was by Kamara shifting his way through the lane for two and give him seven 4226 the Hokies and Dayton going back to the Zone defensively struggling to defend mantoman against the Hokies Anthony Grant trying to find anything he can Doula with the miss one rebound there for bezilla to start second half to lay that one in and thats the problem with the Zone finding box out responsibilities giving up offensive rebounds and basily with the second chance points to get his tab up to 22 hes having a great ball game and thats a round and out Holmes had it knocked away for a moment by padulos reaching in digging for the basketball and theyre going to win it back goes back over to the Hokies but thats what the strength the added muscle has done for Sean Padula he has no problem sticking his nose in with the big guys hes confident about being able to make plays through contact and he makes you a better Defender you can use your body better and absorb the bumps that youre going to take foreign game here for Mike Youngs Hokies as well got a lot of new faces on his team Couture from the corner and theres one of the veterans Pokey fans love so much absolutely top ten in Virginia Tech History for threepoint Arc number nine I would love to see him get to the top of the list throughout this season but hes got to take a lot more threes to make it happen almost gone in strong but denied Vasily again with some good deeds Applause he catches fires cant drain that well he wouldnt miss in the first half Ill stick with him I think hed be wise too yeah well stick with them well keep getting him his looks sharp jobs will give it up Kamara trying to make a move in that paint its tough to score against Justin mutts and that will misfire even close and another whistle now much did not score in the first half as you mentioned he was in foul trouble a big chunk averaging 14 points a game but they found other answers yeah but his impact has felt in so many other ways not just on the offensive end of the floor but defensively you see its so difficult to move him such a strong base for Justin much you try to back him down and he just refuses to move an arrest here for Padula Music is Blakeney sharp Johnson 68 freshman Applause Music Ron Holmes with a spin and a stop well he has that move down yeah and Holmes got tired of brazily blocking his shot so this time he goes with the twohand flush to make sure hes not going to get blocked fouled here right around midcourt with 16 minutes to go and Duron Holmes catching it the face up and then using the body of bazilly to spin off and to finish at the rim and thats a frustration finish for Holmes whos had his shot blocked a number of times in this game and has been defended very well by Grant bazilla follow us on Archie Blakeney of the Flyers mutts with a handoff shot clock down to four gonna get a shot in the air here Collins finds Maddox got it right in front of the horn and we saw Darius Mattis get into the painted area you see a couple go through and here you go open up the second half hes able to knock down the three theres seven out of 20 from threepoint land the Hokies are so respectable yeah right on their season average about 35 percent no basket there Holmes was fouled before the shot and the Hokies continue to look very sharp on top 50 to 28 at home 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research and saw you working with Vicki V earlier this year great to see Dicky B back hes doing tremendously well sounds great he looks great hes totally healthy which means hes going to be around a while he threatened the other day to reach a hundred and be calling college basketball Im winning lets do it said I want to be the first guy who gets to a hundred I know you you say you want to get to 105 yeah yeah thats your personal goal and I believe you will get there Im going 105 out you know a workout you work but I also eat horrible you burn it off like no one have ever seen though which is Criminal for the rest of us Holmes at the line foul on Lynn Kidd home 63 percent at the stripe and makes one of two so the Hokies looking very comfortable theyve gotten a giant performance from the grad transfer from Wright State Grant basily and obviously Virginia Tech fans have fallen in love with him right away Justin Motz is yet to score trying to get into the scoring column here gives up a beautiful pass and its going to be knocked away on a block by Kamara but even though that was a great defensive play by Kamara I love what mutts did on that one you mentioned Justin much hasnt scored in this game he doesnt care he makes the right play he makes the right pass hes really more of a point forward than anything else for this team Mike young talked about they have a cluster of plays where he actually runs the plays from the point guard position and against North Carolina they were 50 on those plays so got to call it pretty efficient youre gonna get Lynn Kidd for his second coming up weekdays right here on the ACC Network Mike Packer Trey Boston Taylor 10 about Talking Football also the latest from around the conference weekdays at four Eastern right here at ACC Network in the ESPN thank you Kamara gives it up on the bounce Holmes with another touch cant spin it up and get the basket knocked away big scrap for that Maddox just hauls it right to the chest possession arrow will take it to the other end and good defense and hustle paying off for Maddox and Obi as his former coach this makes me proud to see this young man who has grown up so much as a basketball player getting on the floor doing the tough stuff Darius Madison always score he could always shoot but he didnt do the tough stuff he was a young guy very young graduating high school at 17 years old it has come here and grown up matured in this program and you see how much Mike young reveres him how much he thinks of him and of course you know the game winners that hes hitting on Dont Hurt huge in that ACC tournament you and I were there he beat Clemson of course at the buzzer in overtime then he put up 20 against Carolina in the upset of North Carolina from the second Team all ACC tournament likes the big shot you like to have more than one guy on your team who will take that shot right who has that confidence agreed and Virginia Tech has a number of them we know Padula has it of course Hunter Couture Justin must but I love the fact that Mike young and you and I are calling that game and I believe that was Virginia Techs first game in the ACC tournament and youre not calling that game now Mike young makes a substitution late and has five guards on the floor right and we know at that point hes not playing for a tie hes playing for a win and gives the basketball to Darius Maddox a reserve who hes gained trust in to take the biggest shot for them and of course they dont win that game they dont win their first ever agency tournament thats a great Point too of them like hes a great coach but he also had a great tournament you know and that can happen coaches can get hot too agree even better than they normally are Mike Youngs been hot hes been hot for a long time so hot tonight in fact he took that that jacket off I know you love that terrific suit he was wearing here for game number 100 a whistle with 1316 to go and this will go against the Hokies and with a 5029 Advantage he actually looks like hes down about 15 points yeah and when you think about that coach young does a lot of work on the sideline thats why the jacket comes off hes over there working not concerned about a 21 point lead hes not coaching the lead hes coaching this game and trying to coach his team to continue to get better each and every time out Lokis picked sort of in the middle tier of the ACC rankings coming into the season but may well be way better than that come March and I would like for everyone to know that when those votes are being cast Im hanging out in the room with the coaches and the players doing the fun stuff so I had no vote in that no way would I pick Virginia Tech seven right in the preseason poll I think theyre underrated right now on on a national scale I think they ought to be in the top 25 I agree wholeheartedly I think they should have been in after the North Carolina win but they continue this direction they will be in soon Couture cant drill that and whistle in the lane fouled on the deck 1228 to play look at the preseason poll to the ACC Carolina of course off to the rocky 44 start if Georgia Tech coming up on Saturday and Duke Virginia Miami FSU ranked in the top five and dipping off to a disastrous start so well take a break 12 28 to go on the contest Hokies are rolling itll be a flagrant one hook and hold on hold will shoot the 69 Junior Roger Ayers and his crew taking a look Virginia Tech has not had to spend much time at the line to build up a 19point lead theyre one for one at the foul line but theyre making everything they really have and again Grant bazillion in the first half really got it going but its been more of a balanced effort here in the second half Hunter Couture getting involved of course Darius Maddox knocking down to three and Mike young has to be happy with both ends of the floor defensively and offensively for what hes seen for his team here I think so just delighted as the Hokies try and shoot out to nine and one on the year they have led for almost 37 of the minutes against North Carolina they did almost 37 minutes in that one and a big chunk of this one Padula flips it up and in with that left hand yeah he loves to switch hands in the painted area very crafty around the basket and nice touch to be able to finish that off the glass Kamara looking inside Washington outside the three Freya Lofts that one and done theyve had a lot of that tonight they really have and its been a struggle from Beyond The Arc for the Dayton Flyers who travel as well as anyone theyve got a lot of faithful fans on board and they are watching DeSean badulus so here in the second half his backtoback buckets for him attacking the rim they really do travel well they certainly did down to Orlando last year the ESPN events Invitational up against Kansas nice save there on that side by Kamara shot clock down to eight and plucked away another turnover Padula comes up with it over the shoulder to Maddox and trying to follow his own Miss hes going to commit a foul eleven twelvet and Sean Padula getting it done on both ends of the floor we see the steal we see him getting into the painted area going to the left hand off the glass and Ill count it even though its past banking hours and once again going to the left hand finish Sean Padula finding his way to the rim scoring in the paint knocking down threes at this point Obi he may be playing the point guard position better than anyone in the ACC right now you got kieh Clark who had to take on a lot more responsibility with Reese Beekman being injured where Jeremy roach is doing you know at Duke but right now when you think 17 points per game you know close to three to one assisted turnover ratio and making big shots after Big Shots Sean Padula has to be right at the top of the list Washington at the line here for the Flyers who have had difficulty scoring all season long weve been talking about injuries illness the things theyre battling Malachi Smith one of the guards is out tonight Kobe Elvis thats one of the great names in college basketball oh absolutely he is out tonight as well both of them on the bench unable to play so theyre really only able to go about you know seven maybe eight deep probably more like seven Applause so Washington to shoot student section has been terrific finishing up classes today so they were fully ready to go at tipoff always are this is becoming one of the toughest places in the ACC to play and a lot of it has to do with the student section and they dont just show up for the mens program for the seventh rank womens program as well they have been on guard wow Tomahawk dunk Hunter Couture with a statement my goodness if you were starting to doze off youre not anymore take it away by bezilla who had a spectacular first half with 20 points he has nine rebounds Hunter Couture with a rim rattler mutts up against Holmes lost the dribble I just won the damn ball so we could watch this again my guy hunter Couture getting down the lane and finishing it Obi I do believe we will see this later tonight on SportsCenter Top 10 nominee it would have to be an investigation if that wasnt true did the same thing against North Carolina same kind of play because thats blocked nice play by Holmes trying to get to the other end but spoiled by the Hokies the Flyers will keep it here but exactly 10 minutes to go in the game great Hustle getting back and the only difference in him doing it against North Carolina we werent here so its not the same it means a lot more when the notorious dob is in the building 5831 Applause Ill tell you one of the more entertaining things to watch in a Hokies game is Mike Young making a substitution he doesnt just sit there and point down the bench he jumps off the bench race is halfway down to the player hes on the court and points at the guy and says youre in the game you got to like that energy you gotta love that effort from your coach hes involved hes invested in doing that with a 27 point lead thank you gamara will swing this one for Brea and swishes it in nice touch there by Kobe Bryant theres another guy who missed a bunch of games because he got hurt and then he got sick yeah Brad didnt make the trip to the Bahamas when Dayton made the trip over early this year nearly picked off medulla gets it free pneumatics and hell stick the midrange shot do you think the midrange jumper is making a comeback the midrange never went anywhere Obi that was just all talk its a myth but I think you know so many more teams and coaches value the midrange much more so than before because of scouting so teams know okay you want to shoot the three weve got to run you off a threepoint line but theyre also waiting to take the charge under the basket so the midrange becomes so necessary and the greatest scores ever and of course the greatest scores in the game today use the midrange to their advantage when you look at the NBA Kevin Durant Devin Booker sure Steph Curry I mean you know the guys everyone keeps the midranges a part of their package for Sean Padula adds the long ball as well for him that might be a midrange jumper it might be Washington denied that Baseline Okies have also played excellent defense thats obvious by the fact that Dayton has 36 points Holmes back and down denied but a foul and thatll go against Lynn Kidd with 8 22 to go hell pick up his third Music well some amazing fans across the ACC of course and now we need your help this winter ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pic or take a video tag it with hashtag all the devotion and post it on your social you just might see it on the ACC Network so I can post a picture of you and ice here calling the game and we might see that on acc Network I think the one that I took of you devouring the pizza before the tipoff thats probably the winner tonight yeah that might be in the Smithsonian its uh its a work of art to see you eat my friend youre absolutely right it belongs in a museum still dont know how you do it Holmes with a foul shot coming with 8 22 to go and drops that one in he has 13 Mama fully on the floor again now for the Flyers of Anthony Grant medulla quickly into the offensive end Music hes been a bright star tonight and all season long for the Hokies how about that pass tried to get it free underneath but Boutique could not finish and no whistle on the play Applause but a tremendous pass there by the Hokies point guard and also recognizing who you can make that pass too although potee didnt finish it he did catch it and Mike young has talked about how great his hands are and its always a benefit when youve got a big man that you can throw tough hashes and know that hes going to take care of you as a point guard you dont get turnovers and that was always a topic of conversation for me if I throw you a basketball and you get it you cause me to get a turnover please believe Im shooting the next one I really wanted to shoot the next one anyway they just gave me a reason to shoot the nature Egypt be disappointed with only three turnovers yeah I mean they only average nine a game one of the better teams nationally in handling the basketball is really wriggling underneath rebound comes out high right back flung ahead man oh could not convert it Im a fully and finally got that one to go so on the second chance 7 51 to play here well you covered up my favorite Hokies Jersey of all time Applause I understand hes trying to distract the free throw so there we go show it off proudly one of my my big brother one of my favorites basketball players of all time the great Wardell Curry yeah and you would you know this and respect this he was a baseball pitcher through in the 90s was drafted coming out of high school remember reading about that and also drafted coming out of college talk about an athlete who could have you know picked up a golf club at six and won the Masters you know first time I ever played golf Dell Curry took me but Dell and Mugsy Bogues took me out to play golf first time ever Im still not good but man I was really bad that day nothing like the PuttPutt oh well Tina on the slam as he came sailing down like a couple of signature dunks here in the second half of the Hokies yeah and mutt once again dropping dimes not concerned about his own numbers and his scoring on the handoff and a foul kg draws the foul and hell be at the line file number two on Poteet for the initial minutes of the game if you were not with us the Hokies looked a little bit Rusty if you could describe it that way and you know came off that great win over North Carolina of course but then just caught fire Behind grant bazilly six nine grad out of Wisconsin grad transfer from Wright State look at those two medulla and basily they have been the show but 10 to 24 from the rest of the team isnt bad its not like those guys havent played well its just that Brazilian Padula have played great those guys have just been special here this evening 6541 the Hokies in full command Maddox and got a little sloppy there and threw it away hey coming up on Sunday a full afternoon of womens basketball starting at noon Eastern our featured matchup Diamond Johnson at number eight NC State taking on South Florida thats in Reynolds Coliseum coverage begins at two Eastern right after pitting Ball State take a look at the Blue Ribbon panel preseason top 10 Louisville Virginia Tech NC State Notre Dame North Carolina inside the conference Louisvilles had some problems they play Kentucky this weekend the ACC very well represented in the top 25 but Louisville not one of the teams in the mix Virginia Tech at number seven the highest ever in the Hokies program its nice move to get himself an open jumper but cant drain it quickly to the offensive end Blake b well short on the three Dayton Flyers looking like theyre about to pick up a fifth defeat and hitting the deck hard on the other end of the floor number 13 Maddox should I love Maddox getting downhill does a great job going past his guy and again theres contact there but it was verticality underneath and the sheriff Johnson comes up with the nice block around I like that no call I like that no call I mean again its not as though Virginia Tech loses the basketball they have to play another day months working working kicks it out they swing it around for a tour and theyll keep it on this end Applause you talk about the unselfishness of a Justin mutts whos averaging you know 14 15 points a game just had 27 against North Carolina but hes not forced a single shot only and thats his thats his character hes not the guy thats going out looking for his hes simply about winning basketball and if you look at the ACC hold on oh went down hard and quickly back up good sign there as he draws the foul without Mike the aggressive attack going to the rim and when you go off one foot and youre going into traffic and the officials going to go look at it theres nothing on this one I cant see it with the foul yeah I cant see anything malicious on that play its simply just when you go off of one foot in traffic if theres any contact is going to throw you off balance theres no way you can balance yourself Music and there is contact there is a foul I just dont see anything and I can appreciate the officials going over to check it out to make sure but I believe thats going to be a quick look for Roger here so the Hokies really in cruise control almost the entire night 6543 now the victory they improved to nine and one their loan defeat coming at College of Charleston and that was an important game because it ends up being a true Road game even though it was in a midseason tournament it was a true Road game because College of Charleston it is their gym so count as a true Road game which helps the Hokies resume even though it was at all Roger air is coming over to tell us that was a common foul Missouri to the line to shoot two look how Roger Ayers needs a reality show I think he would be perfect to follow on a reality show was it at the Garden last night doing the Jimmy V classic and if you just catch the Wardrobe his wardrobe needs a reality show oh he can press oh absolutely crotch can dress and some of the best shoes youre gonna see we have a full day of basketball Saturday starting at one on acc Network featuring Kyle filipowski number 15 Duke hosting the University of Maryland Eastern Shore thats a camera indoor on acc Network and the ESPN app take fashion tips from Roger Ayers the normally each day he comes in if Im fortunate to be calling a game that hes officiating we go through the Wardrobe I say tell me what you got he tells me with the walkin outfit was you know and again gentleman takes a lot of pride in his fashion and its were not talking about anything off the rack here were oh no no Im talking about tonight level stuff absolutely only to find this for my guy Roger Ayers and at the end of the day he is the definitely one of the best officials in the country you know thats what you would expect sure you know working with a great crew today be disappointed with anything else and to take nothing away from our guys Ryan groover League to sell the tour Maddox jumping inside the paint knocked away from him under five minutes to go and a little over two on the clock the shot clock here so the hokeys gonna have to hustle and they got the right look private oh he drove it no basket he was fouled before the shot a lot of guys just like to take that Jumper in which he should have thats what Grant which is talking to him about is like youll know there was only two seconds of the shot clock right resets to 20 but tell you what Justin butts has to be the smartest guy on the floor because hes got three degrees anyone with three degrees and still playing basketball has to win the intelligence contest this is called degreeing up Bachelors Masters second Masters second Bachelors right now in progress and right around the corner any day now its going to be a doctorate and thats what I asked him about he said hes going to probably have to wait until he finishes playing before he starts with the doctor but you know the benefit of when he gets that you can hit him with it oh doctor Dr mutts oh doctor thats when you know Dave OBrien is in the building when you hear the old doctor we know whats happening little baseball sprinkled in there I guess 6943 if you missed the big news Aaron judge has resigned with the New York Yankees nine years 360 million dollars great news from us Yankee fans yes yes and I know youre not a Yankee fan no I am decidedly not as a voice of the Red Sox but I think its great for the Red Sox because that just adds to that rivalry hes great for baseball I wanted him on the East Coast not on the West Coast I think its terrific I agree and I love the Rivalry between the two and Im still coming to see you one summer in Boston Ive been of course to Yankee Stadium the old and the new one right never watch the game at Fenway so theyre gonna put you in the booth and youre going to call the middle three Innings so just be ready to rock and roll I am ready to go youre trying to sway me youre trying to bring me over there over to that side yeah you let me call the Red Sox away from the Dark Side Red Sox game I know theres no no threat of that happening SketchUp to the best ballpark in the world sharp Jones getting inside 6945 and give him half a dozen and you see now mutts running the point the ability to hand the basketball as a point forward a playmaker a passer decision maker which makes him so dangerous lets draws the foul took a pretty good knock but he will be at the line when we come back just over three minutes and all Hokies tonight here in Blacksburg of my favorites to spend time with on acc media day and he comes into the room and is automatic energy and Hunter Couture he and Hunter came in this year ACC media day they were dancing they were having a great time and again this Virginia Tech team is a closeknit group and you have to be of course I mean your ACC tournament champions they got it going last year you and I were there but when they really turned their season around at Florida State Hunter Couture makes 93 Sean Padula makes six threes they go off they came into that game two and seven in the ACC play yeah they were last and went on a tear to go on and finish strong and win the ACC tournament and you cant do that without great chemistry and it really intensified there in Brooklyn and of course they went on in the NCAA tournament great accomplishment for Mike young first time that Virginia Tech has ever won the ACC tournament they did it as a seventh seed its a great story and were happy to be part of that meanwhile inside two and a half minutes to gozilly well flip that one up news kid cant drain it Flyers really took a shot pretty early in the game unable to recover very thin bench and Elaine Kamara and a whistle 210 to go in our conversation with Anthony Grant earlier today he talked about they have been whole for one week since this summer its been injuries theres been illnesses its been so many different things that have taken their players off the court and he knows they will be a good team at the point to where they are able to get hold but with Malachi Smith sitting on the bench in a boot Toby Elvis on the sidelines as well were not sure when that will be Doula fouling out but picks up 19 points and ran the show Master Fleet tonight well you know a smart point guard will get the ball into the hot hand over and over again and they certainly did that to number 21 bizilla who hasnt scored much in the second half but really hasnt needed to yeah he did all his damage in the first half he didnt need to get another bucket in the second half but you know hes over there thinking man I had 20 first half points I was supposed to have 40 tonight sure thats the way it works with 23 Camden handing off here back to Hunter Couture you talk about that ACC tournament he had 31 against Duke in a title game Couture did so he had some giant performances in Brooklyn another one is Collins boy they have had three magnificent dunks here in the second half they absolutely have and Collins had a big one against UNC as well flying through the lane of foul here on Virginia Tech and the Freshman showing off his bounce the nice pass by Lynn Kidd who gets double teamed as Collins goes way up and finishes Above the Rim with authority and hes 64 but you see the Hops he just yanked down eight rebounds against North Carolina yeah big game for him eight points eight rebounds coming off the bench and really hes the only perimeter sub right now for the Hokies Rodney rice getting closer to rejoining the team on the court their prize freshman recruit I think thats a really good point that the Hokies are going to get better yeah yeah theyre playing really well right now theyre about to be nine and one theyre gonna get better markedly maybe yes final seconds and able to share the sugar to Lynn Kidd and the stuff and sharing the basketball still even when the guys that dont get as many minutes come in the game theyre not looking to get their own theyre looking to play the right way and that is a direct reflection of Mike Young Mike Jones Christian Webster this great staff for the hostess Applause so its going to be a resounding victory over a very strong and proud program for the Hokies tonight knocking off Dayton Dayton about to fall to five and five and the Hokies racing out to nine and one and maybe itll only take one more win to catch the attention of the pollsters but they belong in the top 25 I agree wholeheartedly hopefully we see them there next week well at the rate and the way things are going I would say youre correct Oklahoma State on Sunday then rambling and then to the conference again at Boston College right before Christmas and wake and Clemson after Christmas Washington at the line challenging game on Saturday Mike Boynton Oklahoma State coming into the building but I can tell you right now the castle guard will be ready it will be rocking in here you talk about great student sections its a very tough place to come in and try and beat the Hokies certainly one of the best home Arenas youre gonna find in the ACC or around the country I think I agree Music so its one of the prettiest campuses youre going to find anywhere oh getting an opportunity to get some of the WalkOns into the game and Mike Youngs been able to play a lot of guys tonight delighted with their efforts 7749 Washington pounding his way into the lane and a scrap for that and thats going to do it thats our final score tonight the Hokies after an early couple of minutes where it could have gone either way just Barry Dayton I cant believe that those people who vote pick this team seventh in the ACC I didnt vote just so everyone knows
