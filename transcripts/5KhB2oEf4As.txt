so at the end of last year because he did not even attempt to shop the other night against Bellamy yeah its pretty surprisingly he hasnt gotten off to the start that we all thought that we were expected to see this year but you know a great opportunity today its a new game a new day and so uh were gonna see what he has and hopefully he brings it today Korean bronze set to go Matt Potter will be throwing the ball up our officials today Ron griever Kip Kissinger and Matt Cotter and we are ready to go Al Ellis with the ball for the cards guarded by Calvin heres James you think theyll go inside early try to get Curry engaged a little I think so it looks like theyre going outside to him right now lets see trying to work him on the post he gets the double swings it over to Huntley Hatfield down the lane and he throws it away State basketball Wright State its deceiving that 102 97 lost because they had a 16 point lead with about 13 minutes to go the other night against Davidson at home they led by as many as 21 Davidson came back before silver time one Calvin their number one offensive option but Amari Davis can score two hes got a great midrange game and Larry you know he played at Green Bay in the Horizon League was the newcomer of the year then he played Missouri last year and now hes back at Wright State and he had a doubledouble in his first game for them yeah he put up some big time scoring numbers his first two years at Green Bay he was a allconference player so hes definitely proven that he could score bunches in this how about an aggressive take for Jalen Withers Withers has maybe been the most consistent card but thats something theyre gonna have to stop is Calvin getting to the basket he gets an easy two there and theyre up 42 thats who you dont want to get going early Withers though does look much improved earlier this year I mean in in the three games and other two exhibitions dont count but as you see him attempt another three its off the rim rebound by Davis on the break and hes gonna be a wall Scott Nagy the head coach of the Wright State Raiders hes in his seventh season at Wright State was it South Dakota state for years helped that program transition from division two to division one and hes been to a total of five NCAA tournaments including the one last year with this Rhett State Squad Larry that won an NCAA Tournament game last year in the first four uh the first win in program history is LLS I think he might have uh the last five years they either won the regular season Championship or won the tournament Championship so really has established a winning culture of your Wright State an impressive uh yeah resume he has with over 500 wins in his career Kenny Paynes still looking for win number one in just his second game at uofl Alice drives kicks it over to James in the corner he goes inside and hits the jumper hes been impressive too in the early going as I said 16 points in his first game yeah he really has he I was wondering how he was going to do hes coming off of a serious injury coming from last year so hes really got off to a good start lets see if he can keep it going today Davis think he goes way up for the offensive rebound and well get a reset here 15 on the shot clock for Wright State as they try to go inside the brawn guarded by Curry jump ball possession to right space Applause heres Kenny Payne his first season at uofl and uh a thousand Point scorer at the University of Louisville but an assistant coach at Oregon and Kentucky in the NBA with the Knicks and uh Larry you know one of the things hes trying to do is bring former players like you really back into the program he really has hes really brought a camaraderie back to the alumni and really kind of bonded us back together a lot of guys had to come back to the program but to see one of our own in that position right there is really kind of bonded of the University of the players and alumni that used to play here and it looks like we actually have some some fans still filtering and again its a snowy Saturday here in Louisville but the crowd not bad for the early going here all tied up at four after the Jalen Withers turnover Norris with it out front trying to go back into Brawn it looks like Louisvilles going to go with curry just kind of matched up on him and so far so good although Currys gonna get the foul there early on it looks like theyre trying to attack Curry to the pressure on him maybe to pick up some fives that they did because they did Music maybe they get him in foul trouble although again the other night he didnt even attempt to shot against bellarm I think Louisville would like to see him just a little bit more engaged as broad goes to around hell have two free throws that was the first personal on Curry in the first one of the team Ron misses the first free throw yeah I think what we talked about this since emergency I think that more so speaks to Sydney Curry just to kind of get that motor going and get him going in towards to how he ended last year get him playing in that same Rhythm really going to need him to really achieve the goals that were going to want to do this year its right today team one of the best shooting teams in the country last year but Braun not their best free throw shooter he was just one for three and theyre opener and he misses both of them there so the cards with a chance to take the lead Jalen Withers aggressively to the basket with the left Handler thats when hes at is the best getting downhill attacking the basket hes had such a size Advantage he has Amari Davis trying to guard him four quick points for Calvin coming off his 37point effort Percy Miller set the check into the next dead ball for the cards Music be interesting to see what what coach Payne does with that rotation because he hasnt got a lot of out of Hershey Miller Fabio basili we havent seen him much at all since the first exhibition game but theyre kind of theyre gonna need another guard to be able to come in and spell LLS a little bit definitely because at the end of the email yeah I was playing a lot of minutes for the whole year thats really going to take a toll on him so okay but uh no call down there because going to Huntley Hatfield Wright State double in the post early and making the cards make a pass out of it Curry his first shot attempt of the season a little short on the lefthanded jump hook Music Applause Brandon Knoll number 14 in the in the game for Wright State is I think he misses the triple Ellis tries to go back thank you and Noel takes it away from him and they got a little four on one break and Noel doesnt pass it he goes all the way to basket and misses but Alex hubrick with the follow for the Raiders and they are back in front at 86 I think they all got a little deep right there on his penetration gotta maybe kick it out a little bit early before he get himself in trouble in the pain and nobody got back on defense Roosevelt wheeler and Hersey Miller both set the check in at the next dead ball here look at a team each timeout at the next dead ball cards down 86 early Music theres a balance between looking for his offense getting other people involved but they also they need him to be a scorer they definitely do because because he has to get everybody going he has to set the table for everybody but at the same time we need him to be aggressive looking for his shot as well two straight times down the court two straight jumpers by Ella Ellison were all tied at 10 well see if Ray State goes back to that pick and roll Applause ing Calvin and look at that Brawn two straight wide open layoffs and that might get Sid Courier a seat on the bench here uh Roosevelt wheeler is already at the scores table but Music Applause Curry and cant get the third straight shot to go down Noel with the rebound right state with a 1210 lead here Trey Calvin four points to the early going Braun with their last four on two wide open layups Calvin off the Knoll in his Music three is off Lowell has to be able to create some easy baskets were not really getting any Asian guys were playing a lot of half court offense which is sort of a struggle for us right now so we have to find a way to get some offensive rebounds get to the free throw line just find easy ways to see the ball go through and who can build up that confidence whoever passes up the three over to James he goes all the way on feet he misses forcing the action a little bit its almost like they pass it around the perimeter waiting for something to happen but James forced the action there and the cards get a basket on the followup and let me ask you and thats what they have to continue to do more continue to offensive rebound Logan has really good athletes and so they have to do their athleticism to be able to create easy opportunities just a bad pass there but theyre struggling a little bit with the pit and roll with drawn Music James in the corner he can hit that three and hit a huge one down the stretch to get Louisville within one the other night against Bellarmine and Ellis sees an advantage gets to the basket no foul called hes still down on the Baseline so a man Advantage right now for Wright State and Calvin is hes got shot no one saw it with us twohand shoved him and were gonna get James stepping out of bounds all right up and down actually theyre really going we are all tied at 12 the cards and the Raiders Music its Tim Tebow in a verbo Music when you get the whole place to yourself so its always just you and your

minute ago the only three of the games so far for the cars Huntley Hatfield Garden Sicily inside same like the second unit has come in and given the team a little bit more life they play with a little more Spark Noel spins around trainer and puts it up and in cards down for Ellis Withers and Curry all set to check in at the next dead ball but youre right they have uh seem to have a little more energy from this this second group foreign ER played less than a minute picked up two quick fouls heres Miller hes got the threepointer he drives in he gets into the paint which is something we havent seen a lot of and that gets him a three for games great execution it was a great extra pass and a great shot I think you really like the energy that Millers bringing because our Norris back outside

basketball Applause making things happen at the offensive end yeah these guys are executing really good got the ball moving the ball hop is not a lot of extra dribbling first leads Applause Davis

foreign Applause Music Applause Applause good use of the pivot put there in the lane and thats weve seen the cards get into the paint the last few possessions which we we didnt really see much the other night or in the first few minutes thats a good sign you know that the coaches have talked about it they shot a lot of Threes last game and wanted to cut down on that number so now you see these

2723 thanks to the large Partners play a freshman Mike James and Larry a pretty good start to hit you about career he has hes really made some Rhythm shots here you see it penetrating right here keeping his pigment foot down scoring but hes really seen the ball go through hes still found his offensive game the fifth most points by a uofl freshman in his first game with his 16 the other night against Bellamy he has eight already this afternoon only Jerry Smith Marcus Maven samardo Samuels and Darius Perry scored more Amari Davis down he misses but Braun with the offensive rebound three cards standing right there he goes and gets the ball and Alanis gets a foul and Bron will try to complete the threepoint play keep Applause now getting him to the foul line hasnt been a bad thing hes over three there this afternoon cards up 2725 whats been Louisville uh in the last couple of minutes there weve seen their offenses is running a lot more crisply than it was earlier and theyre starting to pass the ball back yeah the second unit really came in and gave these guys a spark the first eight minutes in the half they didnt have any assists in the last four minutes theyve got five assists and so you really see the ball movement you can see the left dribbling and in turn these guys have started to make some shots of DC Mike James knocked down a few with the ball ball movement now lets get to the basket after Hershey Miller Missed the drive but then he came up with a steal off the rebound keep the ball at that end of the court and Ellis puts the cards back up by four equaling their largest lead of the afternoon Applause bricks Applause gets right say back within two Davis Calvin hubris Braun and Finke on the course for Wright State Calvin Trey Calvin scored those four points early but has not scored in quite a while Alice misses the three Curry almost had the offensive rebound but Davis comes up with it for the Raiders and theyve got a chance to tie or take the lead he goes right by Curry and then trainer with the block and keeps it in bounds too Applause that was nice look for Withers but he cant get that to go here comes hublics lasting possession goal was really starting to settle they did a good job but they were on the Run theyre putting their head down get into the basket scoring in the paint pronouncing like the starters have got back in and weve kind of got back to settling Kubricks with the triple and put right stay back in front at 3029 start shooting 54 from the field right State shooting 50 percent sixth lead change this afternoon and Percy Miller has been the spark but twice hes got to the basket just not able to finish there have clean look at the basket its got a few minutes the new Calvin is going to look for some offense soon again he misses it the basket heres Ellis Withers drives and dishes it to Curry cant handle it is going to be ready to go that was good for Innovation I think he tries the quick basket ends up getting an offensive Rebound in a basket Wright State is back up by three Curry still has not made a shot yet this season as Kenny Paynes going to take a quick timeout Brandon Huntley Hatfield 37 checks out again as well Applause I remember when I first started flying and we would experience turbulence I would watch the flight attendants if theyre not nervous then Im not going to be nervous financially Im the flight attendant in that situation the relief that comes over people once they know theyve got a guide to help them through I definitely feel privileged to be in that position yeah Scott Yankees right State Raiders outscoring the cards bench 147 here in the early going and Music threepoint lead here 3229 446 to play Kent Taylor Larry OBannon Courtside here and uh Larry we see Sydney Curry has gone back to the bench Al Ellis Mike James JJ trainer Jalen Withers and Brandon Huntley Hatfield and Curry again its the second straight game the cars just not getting much out of it again yeah it just seemed like you know the focus is not there where it needs to be on both ends of the floor offensively defensively teammates have made some good passes for him he wasnt able to catch the ball on defensive end of attacking himself I almost have to take him out of the game a seventh turnover you see Curry on the bench a little bit he just doesnt seem as engaged he was the best player on this team at the end of the year last year 28 points a career high in a game at Wake Forest and hes only taken one shot in the first two games this season so far and that was a jump hook that he left short earlier in this game but yeah you see average 176 points nine rebounds in the last five games and hes taking one shot yeah so weve just got to find a way to engage but hes got a song look within himself too something that hes have to do to really get himself going to get himself engaged in these games and boy do they need him guards down three last five possessions for uofl over three from the field with two turnovers Applause the spark has really come believe it or not from Hurston Miller here this afternoon but hes on the bench right now and trainer cant get the jumper together Wright State is doing an excellent job of running their offense and really executing Louisvilles doing a lot of oneonone its not like were liking a lot of movement a lot of dribbling a lot of standing yeah a lot of people might not be familiar with Scott Nagy but hes got a pretty impressive wrestle he mentioned over 500 wins five trips to the NCAA tournament with two different programs Music Applause there you go Huntley Hatfield going to the basket and again theyve missed a couple bunch of layups this afternoon yeah we just got to finish those its one thing for Miller to be a little intimidated the little guy going to The Pantry probably Hatfield got him and finish that at The Rim cards get a steal Applause Music Applause Music kicks it out to Norris with a triple guard still down three he was just under three to play here Music looking inside for Huntley Hatfield and were gonna get a block down there on wellage a lot of Tire bodies out here Music on right State thats a close call Wright State leads it 3229 but the cards will have the ball well return 245 left Music my dad was a hard worker he used to do side jobs installing Windows charging something like 100 bucks a window when other guys were charging four or five hundred bucks you just didnt want to do that hes proud of the price he was charging my dad instilled in me I always put the people before

season and when you talk about the ACC uh Kent Taylor and Larry OBannon here uh Larry you start with North Carolina the number one team in the country yeah coming off a heartbreaking National Championship loss last year those guys are motivated and looking to really get back to what they were last year and try to earn that national title you know rare in college basketball had that many guys come back in this day and age Im sure name him hed probably like the offensive name images Music Atlas misses the jumper wellage with the rebound a lot of shots that were taking are difficult on challenge shots it seems like status getting the easy shots like you know the scary thing is Calvin only has four points and they all came really early as Ellis and over 50 to get the cards back within one cards with James Ellis Huntley Hatfield Kamari lands and Jalen Withers again Sydney Curry were not really sure just whats going on with him hes only attempted the one shot all seasons Applause and Ellis Music Applause Europe is getting a huge boost off the bench from Hershey Miller in this game Lance gets in the paint 10 on the shot clock right now as James drives Baseline as well knocked out of his hands by Calvin cards will have it on the Baseline with nine seconds on the shot clock as Davis checks back to the right state not a lot of post play for Louisville you know I think thats where we missed I mean yeah he doesnt want to be but he should be with his size and should have an advantage today but yeah thats kind of where you thought what youd get from Curry and then maybe from wheeler as well but he came in and picked up 2000 45 seconds so I think honey Hatfield does a good drive when the guards penetrate and Bishop off to him I think he does a good job of moving on the Baseline and finishing its not necessarily great for himself but were not just a creative for him and hes able to finish I think thats when hes at his best got the nice Gunk on the dish from Hershey Miller earlier James has really been the guy whos been the most productive guy I suppose so far this afternoon he got that one and one thats the cards only free throw count and the entire first half of this game just two fouls on the right State and that speaks to kind of U of L not really forcing the action either others Applause are back in front with a minute to go no down the lane except too many steps and youll get the ball with 104 left up one Applause number 12 Wright State has not scored in the last 3 44 but U of L hasnt exactly been able to take advantage of that they are back in front of 3332 with one minute left to play here in the first half Applause Music Applause come on Lance Applause not only Hatfield try again the basket hes gonna draw foul hes gonna get to the line that trout will be on Brawn just the third team thats his first team third at the line for the cards number five Hundley Hatfield hell shoot two cars with just one free throw attempt and a half so far and that was Mike James on that threepoint play he made it Huntley Hatfield now to the line for two shots Applause Music Applause what was his first freethrow attempt of the season the Tennessee transfer who had reclassified and played at Tennessee Larry and and the thought was you know he would have been one of the top high school players in the country uh coming in this year and a big get for Kenny Payne yeah I think hes trying to feel his way out hes trying to understand what coach Payne expects of him I think hes trying to find his Niche on this team and and what he can really really bring some maybe an impact on his team 11 seconds difference between a shot pack and the game clock so Wright States gonna have to shoot right now 15 50 down the lane gets it to Braun Withers walls up but Braun right up there well see the cards hold it for one shot here 15 seconds left to play U of L by one 3534 10 seconds LLS with it out front guarded by Calvin seven seconds Ellis is gonna go to the basketball Music Applause seven lead changes in that first half but Louisville heads to the locker room with a 3734 lead and Larry yes to find a way to get himself going and Wright State has to get Trey Calvin going he had a slow first half Id be interested to see if he comes out more aggressive in the second half and get himself going Trey Calvin number one coming off his 37point effort in their season opening loss to Davidson with Just Four Points two of seven from the field in that first half cards with the same five who started every game every half so far this season and they go right into Sydney Curry just his second shot of the season and thats good to see because he was aggressive hes going to go to the line for two thats what college fans want to see they want to see the big fella inside the paint and dominated paint and really establish himself down low and the cards made it important uh factor to come out in the first play to get him the ball down low and these rewarded to the foul line for two that was the second foul on Braun first team foul on right State they only had it three personal fouls in the first half their entire team as Sydney Curry gets his first point of the season in the second half of the second game and that increases the cards lead to 3834 Davis Calvin Norris Finke and Braun on the court Davis gets the back door but he cant finish and the cars with a chance to increase their lead since they go back into Curry Applause Music Applause really aggressive did a great job we can obviously rebound lower the shoulder there to create some contact and hes going to the foul line to get two check out the smallest guys Music Davis whos a pretty good rebounder failed to box him out Alice fouled hell go to the line for two free throws that foul was on Amari Davis he may be one of the smallest on the court but hes one of the most athletic he has a pretty good spring in his legs said some good dunks at Louisville live but Im not sure weve seen him dunk in a game Music Im not sure we can still for one man because you know he can get up and do it cards up six now their biggest lead of the afternoon see if they get another stop down at this end Calvin as you said looking for that offense and a quick Miss and Huntley Hatfield the rebound clearly theyre looking to get going yeah theyre going to need him if they want to win this game now lets drive Baseline had it deflected by Calvin out of bounds itll be cards ball on the Baseline 21 seconds of the shot clock they lead it 40 to 34 making sure everybodys clear on what the Baseline house play is here Music they look like theyre cutting with a little more purpose here in this hat dont they they are they playing with a little a little bit more energy these guys are moving Music into the basket Applause Murray comes up with a steal on the Baseline cards up eight and looking to increase the lead Withers after the drive doesnt settle for the three Huntley Hatfield looked like he had about a five footer in there but he passes it up 12 on the shot clock Withers the Deep triples gonna come up way short because he was about four feet behind the line he just did an excellent job for possession before him get into the basket so hes gonna do that at any time that he wants to so thats already shot four free throws in the second half after only shooting five in the entire first half and this could be a problem because Trey Calvin gets down the lane and gets the easy basket and U of L does not want him to get going because he could catch fire quickly hes got six points so far this afternoon and has them back within six yeah hes come out to really assert himself the second half and try to put his stamp on this game hes gonna have to if Wright State has a chance to win this game was that a shot not even close to them think he cant handle the passport Corner three for Norris Mrs Curry comes up with the rebound Im sorry Huberts with the missed three in the corner heres Alice Applause it looks to me like just about every uofl player out there could post up his guy and have an advantage down there they could uh clock winding down and hungry Hatfield gets to the basket good job of putting his head down to get to the basket Moons had a lot of success a lot of great plays when they putting their hand down to get to the bank thank you they missed three Huntley Hatfield the rebound I think coach Paynes really made that a point to really get the pain and stop yelling so much from outside Applause Music guards can increase the lead to double digits with a basket here its been a good second nice pass from Ellison a good catching traffic Larry in the defense great ball from a great execution great finish Applause thank you after the next three he drives get it inside the brawn Curry all over him and then they reject it with the left hand block Big Time block now he looks engaged engaged engaged just coming out the first play in the second half getting hit the ball and get to the foul line back getting him on the scoreboard Just Hits him engage a big spark in the first half Jackson Carson into four run Bailey

on Wright State and Larry OBannon uh the cards well take a look at in a minute but theyre LL is getting to the basket and dishing and getting everybody else involved with Brandon old squirts heres Ellis cards now inside the withers and he scores in the paint again and they are consistently doing that in the second half I think far more than weve seen them for the entire season I think theyve sort of found their formula for success get to the paint great things hopping when get two feet in the paint oh my god seriously with the horse shot he was sad I just threw that one up he gets it Hersey Miller back into the game for the cards uh gave them a huge lift just energy wise and I think hes the first guy who did go into the paint he missed a couple layups and here he turns the ball over as the lead is eight heres Calvin dont want him to get high he gets it to Sicily and simply makes his second Basket in a row and all of a sudden weve got a sixpoint game here cards with James Trader Miller Curry and Withers Calvin hubris Norris Knoll and Cicely on the court for the Raiders with the lineup That Lowell has in now is definitely a great time to get the ball in the car and let him go to work great for others its always a great time to do that and how about that 1501 Applause a season for Sydney Curry but it is encouraging to see how aggressive hes been and really both ends of the court in the second half rebounded Leslie it all started with that first player of the second half just getting him engaged lets see how that plays out for the rest of the half see if hes the mains engaged they need to go back to him right here yes or let Withers take Calvin because hes got about a foot on its going to be James who goes inside stepped on the Baseline I think another

Hatfield and lands for Roosevelt wheeler Who challenged that shot he played about 45 seconds of that first half and Drew two quick fouls so I havent really seen much of him this afternoon L Ellis with 14 points Huntley Hatfield has 10 trying to make it 13 as he tries the three Im not sure thats where the cards want to live they need to get especially the way theyve been scoring uh getting the lane and scored right getting into the paint condition creating for others and they are back within five with 13 and a half minutes to go the cards have led by as much as 10 but Wright State has cut that in half Applause Music Applause and James with the turnover truck was thinking of passing it to her its not letting Hatfield you see Kenny Payne and that Wright State three by kubricks James trying to figure out where that picking is going to come from it just gave him enough space to get that triple off and just like that we got a fivepoint game and theyre doing this also Larry really without Calvin yeah all right stay hands it right back turnover number seven for the Raiders the cards with 11 turnovers so far this afternoon as we see Scott naging in the seventh season as the head coach of the Wright State Raiders in Dayton Ohio the city of Louisville can get some movement get some player movement some offensive movement and execute on offense try to stay away from the 101 well Louisville goes one on one they seem to find themselves in trouble Jalen Withers in the game for Mike James Huntley Hatfield kicks it over the withers in the corner hell try the triple and he got it now that three you dont mind getting in the paint and he kicks it out the withers for the wide open look and he has been the best threepoint shooter on this team so far this season as hubricks comes up short might have been tipped and the cards with a chance to increase the lead that is at eighth their biggest lead of the afternoon so far has been 10 and Alice gets Lanza open three but he cant hit Applause and now Noel gets all the way down and lands with the block I thought I thought that might have been clean but were gonna get a foul its not the NBA so we wont have a challenge with everybody looking up at the big board I dont know at first plus I thought that might have been sleep I thought so as well take a look at it see that just block it right off the rim yeah I dont know referee might have been anticipating a call on that one Brandon Knoll to the line for Wright State they last year one of the best free throw shooting teams in the nation but so far today just five of eight lets take a look at this from behind here and youll see just right and oh my goodness just got all ball right off the front of the rim it looks like a clean block lands and now ell gets the rebound off his own Miss free throw Applause spin down the lane and the following jumper for Andrew wellich Applause and its back to five Wright State doing a good job of just hanging around until Trey Calvin get himself going an unconventional three points there for the Raiders Ellis the best pet shop Robert he sees just a bad pass I mean he had wheeler posting up Calvin but um you got to get it to him somewhere where he can catch him no wide open on the Baseline and Wheeler lets him go to the other side of the basket and Lay It Up in him and we got a threepoint game with 11 37 left Kenny Payne has seen enough as Wright State is right back into this thing at 5350 Music my dad was a hard worker he used to do side jobs installing Windows charging something like a hundred bucks a window

youre having fun Music from Santa service the Wright State Raiders are not going anywhere within three points of Louisville with 11 and a half minutes left to play here kept Taylor and Larry OBannon and Larry the the Raiders are taking advantage of maybe some laziness U of lmv Pennsylvania theyre doing a great job of taking advantage of Louisvilles Miss house not communicating on defense and picking a little defense you see there sprinting back on defense on Louisville turn the ball over theyre doing a good job of hanging around especially with the best players seemingly not being in his best Rhythm tonight so if he finds his best Rhythm if he finds his rhythm toward the end of the game Applause with some nice assists in that little Montage but uh just six points in the game for their star who came in were really early in the season but the third leading scorer in NCAA division one 37 points in their opening loss to Davidson cards go right into Curry he kicks it over to Kamari lands whos gonna grab Baseline and then discard Davis with his left hand and hes gonna get called to that offensive foul kind of a veteran drawing that for the Freshman yeah Wright States doing a good job of getting it done by committee today theyre pretty well balanced when you look at the scoring column nobodys really standing now you have Alec Hubert who has 10 points but other than that getting it done by committee today Carter the steal on the Baseline I think it was Withers you got the deflection youll know with Ellison Huntley Hatfield Curry lands and Withers on the court Davis Calvin Braun Music with the steal and well see heres Calvin see if they can get him going and theyre going to get a three from the corner by while its misses and the cards off and running oh Music up to lands and kind of a quick shot there Im not sure thats exactly what Kenny Payne wanted yeah thats probably about a one on Three brick there in a threepoint game at this time you want to make sure you execute with the best shot that you can and well its kind of On Cue we were talking about him and there you see Trey Calvin you see what he can do and you know uh hes capable of igniting here in the last 10 minutes and in a onepoint game that could be an issue even though he hasnt been scoring hes done a good job of setting his team up and being a good point where I can getting his teammates easy shots thats one thing he does do so he probably still has a pretty good Rhythm but seeing that ball go through the hoop now you probably will start looking for a shot a little more thank you with the turnover Withers and I can come up on that last one Withers into double figures Now with uh 13 points LLS leads the way for Louisville with 14 and Brandon Huntley Hatfield with 10 Withers already with 13 points and nine rebounds so a rebound away from a doubledouble for Jalen hes really really come to life this second half the first half he looked a little sluggish but this second half he seemed to really found his rhythm and really kind of sparked the guys again Huntley Hatfield doesnt settle for the three drives in but then leaves that one short Finke all the way to the back with his lefthanded attempt hits nothing and heres Alice on the break with just Calvin back and Alice able to get all the way to the basket in for the layup he now has 16 points and the Louisville leaders back to five Applause Music and the fast break point something we have not seen a lot of of his team but he didnt get those easy baskets when he struggled so much in the half court Davis Im not sure that was a towel but he draws the foul on Curry James Applause Music Applause you kind of jumped into Im not sure what James could have done different there Im not sure either you want to be all the way go to the cabin to take a look at that with the elbow but the neck area the crowd uh yeah the replays the video boards pretty high def here I mean its monstrous so they can see pretty clearly that those are questionable calls not just that one but the block on Kamari lands it was called a foul as well back in the game and Mario Davis initiated all the contact there lets see it one more time Larry is Davis driving with James and the Freshman does a pretty good job moving his feet but uh he ends up getting a foul call and Davis misses the second three throw Applause Music three fouls on the cards just two on ranked state in this half so far nine minutes to go Louisville with a fourpoint lead and the ball Applause in the withers he was coming Music hes gonna have to fire this one up and the Deep three goes off the back of the rim as we just get under nine minutes here this game is going to come down to who can execute best in the half court have you seen Calvin gets Vicky in open three and he hits his first triple the afternoon and those two guys can score and have not done it at a very high clip so far this afternoon but Pinky gets Wright State back with him one whoa Withers with the dart and he is absolutely drilled by Norris underneath Alices as Withers was looking for Ellis cutting the baskets its a good time to start playing through carries get carried a ball hes got doubled hes making good passes out of the double seemed a little more engaged in the second half hes got himself on the scoring board I think its a good time to really kind of initiate your offense through the big fella nice Cut there by Ellis and Withers its a nice pass to find him Withers all the way to the basket and his running hook though Music good job we keep talking about it get into the paint get into the pain thank you 15 points now for Jalen Withers cards back up three as we near the eight minute mark Calvin kubricks Norris Knoll and Finke on the court for Wright State and Norris throws that away thought Calvin was going to cut out he went the other way and another turnover for the Raiders replacing number 24 Withers JK trainers in for Withers and I gotta believe this might be okay I only had to itll take it he was going to get a quick blow into the underage better yet just leave him out there because hes been here the last couple minutes of this one Applause 15 on the shot clock for the cards they lead by three under eight to play Ellis all the way to the basket and that was blocked from behind that by Calvin yeah to get up to block that was impressive Norris back to Calvin and wow the circus shot trying to draw the foul didnt get his cards another possession up three Applause Music Applause Ellis gets a high screen from Curry over to James in the corner he drives Baseline and thats got to be a block right on the Baseline on Norris I believe so cars with a threepoint lead Jalen Withers 15 points and 10 rebounds for the junior cards lead it by three Music everyone is ready for Monday Night Football I know what time it is because you have to be ready for an NFC East Clash two seconds at a moment Washington is set to take command remember what were doing

5956 on right State catch Taylor Courtside with Larry OBannon and Larry oh Jalen Withers has been the difference here in the second half hes really gotten himself going you see here on the screen hes going 11 points in the second half hes got three rebounds and really uh just been a spark for Louisville in this second half to get these guys going to get them to leave right now his fourth career double double also with the 10 rebounds is five for six from the field second half it weve seen him hit that threepointer charge just three for 14 from three in the game hit that three in the corner a minute ago but hes been doing it by getting the basket scoring in the lane Regina kind of a variety of shots including that little jump up hes just being aggressive putting his head down into the pain um just getting in there just shooting five percent of shots and what hes done and so he stopped settling uh for outside shots and really get to using his size to his advantage to get to the basket here we go LLS to the ball throwing it in on the Baseline Mike James LL is JJ trainer Withers and Curry on the court for the cards and Alice gets in the lane and scores he has 18 points to lead the way for uofl in the lead is back to five Calvin Huberts Braun Nolan Finke on the court for the Raiders heres Brawn insides he was able to score early and he gets around Curry hes crafty in the paint gets him into double figures with 10 points and gets Wright State back within three you gotta be worried if you come out too that Trey Calvin might all of a sudden when he hit that shot a second ago that could get him going he could score a bunch of points fast coming out this 37point effort the other night yeah he can erupted anytime you know we have a legal score like that you just want to try to make it tough on him as possible but try to keep him in his in the back where the turnover pinky that quick trigger on the three and James has Ellis Breaking Free only think he back he goes Adam takes the hit and gets the lefthanded layup up and in great finish great finish shows you a little bit of that athleticism that hes so difficult yeah impressive how hes able to take the bump and then still get the lefthanded shot up in it too much Applause theres the first foul on Finke as Ellis completes the threepoint play increases the Louisville lead to six the fifth foul on right stay here in the half part still with just three personal fouls in this half Louisville leading at 6358 and trainer uh trying to fight around Noel there and hes going to get the foul but thatll be only the fourth personal foul in the cards here in the half Here Comes Brandon Huntley Hatfield Strikes Back in Sydney Courier right straight making a conscious effort to get the ball inside posting up AJ Brauns done a good job Withers with a steal on the out of bounds place that James he loves it up and oh goodness thats going to be as technical as he could not get the dunk to go and then he hung on the rims yeah that close to the cards increasing the lead to eight Withers with a phenomenal steal and then the lobster James but he couldnt quite finish and now Calvin looking for his offense a little bit and not a great shot Withers able to save it after the Collision without Lee Hatfield and the cards dont need to be in Rush here but Ellis some fancy dribbling goes behind the back and then doesnt even hit the rim with the shot he knows how to finish it the dunk and all of a sudden Louisville had the ball up six they rushed it a little bit Ellis got a little bit out of control and now were back to the fourpoint game and thats usually how it goes four point swing to take a bad shot not able to set up your defense Wright State gets an easy shot in transition out of the way Music 10 seconds on the shot clock as Ellis gets it over to trainer Withers has been the best player on the court in this half looking for a screen from trainer now he gets it to trainer in the corner his three off the rim Vicky the rebound for Wright State not a great possession there by the cards Applause Music Applause guarded by Withers over to Calvin its the switch from Huntley Hatfield pulls the trigger on the three and there it is a threepointer for Trey Calvin his first of the afternoon and just like that right state is back within one 6463 four and a half minutes left to play and Kenny Payne wants to talk about good adjustment by coach Nagy hes moved Trey Calvin off of the ball a little bit to free him up hes put the ball in Alex Huberts hand and now Trey Calvin can just focus on scoring cars with a 6463 lead 428 left to play Applause Music Applause Applause Music guinea pigs Music will join Music Music Applause Music Applause Ed foreign Applause Music Music Applause Applause all right Applause Music foreign Music lets reset things 4 28 left to play 21 seconds of the shot clock Louisville ball cards lead right State 6463 both these teams looking for their first win of the Season we saw Kenny Payne the most animated weve seen him since he got this job I think in that huddle uh Kent Taylor and Larry OBannon here and look at him just I mean yeah I think hes really getting on Brent ahead and Huntley well and Mike James for missing that live yeah and he actually threw his clipboard down Trey Calvin the most dangerous player on the court you you come out and close out without a hand up I think thats what he was getting on him about and looking for Huntley Hatfield in the post right out of the timeout 10 on the shot clock hes got Braun on him he should be able to score over him he cant get it to go hes almost got the offensive rebound right States got the ball down one and a chance to take the lead heres Trey Calvin hit his first three of the game hes now up to 11 points and we said he and he goes right by trainer but then throws it right to Withers who has it knocked away from behind as he tried to kick it up to Ellis back to Calvin and that is at this point almost becoming automatic and we talked about it and now its happening as he hits the shot and all of a sudden Wright State is in front with under four to go Louisville with just one time out remaining but they will get a TV timeout at the next dead ball this is the part of the game where youre where your big time players got to step up and make plays you know weve seen Trey Kyle with the last few possessions hes knocked down to three nine knocks down a pullup jumper starting to get himself going because we know hes got to close out the game whos going to make that shot for Louisville how about Al Ellis for a monster three to put them back in Applause 24 points this afternoon Calvin gets Ellis up in the air hunting Hatfield knocks it away Braun hat position on him steal for the cards three minutes to play they lead it by two Ellis looking for another triple and he gets it back to back threes for L Ellis in Louisville Applause Big Time plays just as we were wondering who was going to take those shots and make those shots for this Louisville Team Al Ellis with backtoback triples and all of a sudden theyve gone from down one to a five picky the Miss and James is going to get fouled because he was grabbed there on the Baseline as he tried to get some rebound by Alex hubricks Larry you know what its like to hit some threes and get some momentum going down nothing like it the big time Adrenaline Rush youre in the moment you feeling it you let it fly and thats what LL is doing the last couple possessions knocked out some big time threes to get a little advantage and then last Applause this afternoon cars by five two and a half minutes to play 20 seconds on the shot clock Mike James with it out front Ellis Huntley Hatfield Withers trainer Ellis goes Baseline Im not exactly sure what happened there just a little out of control Applause Music like a play with the right State tied him up as he got in the lane and just kind of lost a lot of bounds all right 215 left every time its looked like Louisville was going to pull away Wright State has had an answer well see if they dont maybe try to get Calvin a shot here because uh he right now is at 13 points hes made his last two so at the end of the game you would think that theyre going to look for him right now to really get him a lot of attempts and have him close out the game and try to get these games Im going to review here to see what happens Ellis down the lane Noel with it Ellis Im not sure what theyre I mean he clearly kind of threw it out of bounds so all right here we go Wright State Calvin duberts Brawn Knoll and fakie cards with James Ellis Huntley Hatfield trainer and Withers Music nearing two minutes to play Louisville with a fivepoint lead s guarded by James gets the pick from Knoll now with a side of advantage on James see if he doesnt take him down to the Post Calvin looking to score clearly drives in on Ellis and he hits the step back jumper Ellis kind of wanted the pushoff there time out Scott hes going to take a timeout with 154 left Louisville leads right state by three cards ball two minutes to see who can win thank you my dad was a hard worker he used to do side jobs installing Windows charging something like 100 bucks a window when other guys were charging four or five hundred bucks he just didnt want to do that I was proud of the price he was charging my dad instilled in me I always put the people before the money proud of offering a good product at a fair price I think hed be extremely proud of me Music welcome back to the KFC Yum Center Scott Maggies Wright State Raiders back within three 7067 Louisville ball 154 left Kent Taylor and Larry OBannon and Larry before the game he talked about the two stars of these teams the key players and they have delivered LLS agree right 27 points for Louisville and Trey Calvin started off slowly but he started to get things going he just did a basket now 15 points for him to get them back within three yeah Ellis has had a monster game hes really carried this Louisville team tonight and Trey Calvin is really starting to get himself going in the closing minutes of the game trying to get a W for Wright State fights with LLS Mike James Brandon Huntley Hatfield JJ trainer and Jalen Withers where theres 15 points and 11 rebounds so far this afternoon Huntley Hatfield also in double figures with 10 points six 15 seconds on the shot clock here lets see what kind of shot Kenny Payne wants to get out of that timeout he gets Ellis driving in the basket spins and an easy two for L to get him to 29 this afternoon theyve executed that play greatly uh they ran it early in the half LL is distant for agreement hunting for a layup earlier than the half so theyre two for two on their player now see if they can get a stop at this and Huntley Hatfield obviously with the size Advantage making it difficult for Calvin heres Withers biggie steps inside his shot comes off the rim and the tip by nose again nobody boxes him out and theyre back with some three one minute to go and were gonna have one final minute drama here the last player to score 30 points Jordan Warren the Milwaukee Buck at Boston College in January of 2020 LL Ellis a point away from that and Im gonna guess hes gonna get another shot here because he seems like the right option seven seconds on the shot clock six on the shot clock Withers is gonna have to shoot this a kind of a desperation three not a great offensive possession there by the cards not at all seven second difference between the shot clock and game clock Withers trash for the Steele could have been called for the foul there on kubricks cards have some fouls to give they only have 14 fouls so do you want to maybe foul here I mean it would let him hold for the last shot but might take them out of their Rhythm instead in all those Baseline for the dunk to get them within one with 128 seconds left and you know they kind of waited for their offense a little bit to get it going they were able to get these in baskets and now though it should be Louisville with 128 seconds left thinking to a cutting no and James kind of lost it yeah they did they used a lot of time there I thought they should have went earlier especially being down three but they executed they got a point now they do have 16 pounds they will be in the bonus theyre not gonna have to give any fouls here but it will be one and one and dont forget LLS has 29 Points right now he had a big one and one with less than a minute to go the other night against Bellarmine and Mystics had a chance to give Louisville the lead there they were down 67 66 so well see uh you have to imagine hes the guy Louisville wants to get the ball here and I think theyd want to take their chances with him at the line again definitely because hes its been his night hes there with the team so its only right for he to finish the game and put the game away and again the chance to redeem himself for what he did in development game even though he missed that so lets give him a chance to get up there and not go on the free throw for winning this game and close it out Music Ellis a perfect three for three but before then you want to make sure you know Im sure that Wright States want to apply some pressure here so you want to make sure youre strong with the ball make sure you run your hands into the passes thank you and if youre right stake youre trying to get a quick shot quick still and if you cant get that then you want to foul right away interesting is for the last couple minutes Cindy Curry who actually in the second half of this of this game has played his best basketball of the young season but again itll be Ellis trainer James Withers the trigger and Anna Huntley Hatfield in as well Calvin hubricks Norris Knoll and 50 on the court for the Raiders 132 seconds they put a little time back on the clock 7271 cards with the ball theyll just have to get it in and then they figure the foul will come immediately Ellis is trapped down there and he spins and were going to get a jump ball and that will be Wright State possession its almost like Ellis was anticipating the foul right state was going to go for the track and they did not get a foul called and theyre going to get the ball with 84 seconds left on the clock yeah just not a good execution there your press break ends maybe got a little too deep into the trap zone and Mike snake was able to create a turnover here we go Trey Calvin six seconds five seconds hes gonna take the shot three seconds two hes gonna pull up over Holly Hatfield not a great shot but it is good Trey Calvin gives the right State Raiders their first win of the season and the cards are all in two thank you I mean just were going to review that he clearly got it off in time there could potentially be some more time left but Im not sure he took it late and he shot it over Huntley Hatfield a great shot great shot uh you talked about Big Time Players
