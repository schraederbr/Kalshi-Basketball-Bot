Music set to begin for these Panthers and no year more successful than last for cable and Company reaching the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2016 and the 2324 campaign begins three newcomers in the starting five for the Panthers but nothing new about Blake Henson with unlimited range its a great sign for the Panthers when he get it going early its going to be a long night for you so feder Rico and hinston the two returners in the Panthers starting five and well take you through North Carolina AT a lot of new faces cam shell Landon Glasper Jeremy Robinson is the most experienced player on the roster for the aies he misses from the top of the arc Hinson again that time he fakes drives Baseline and gets the bucket through contact Strong finish Nice Shot fake after you knocked down the first one use the shot fake quick five for Blake Hinson again a preseason second team on all ACC player for the Panthers Carrington with the eyes to get it up to Fuller is Carrington defending the ball here hes a freshman guard out of Baltimore Maryland wearing number seven for Pittsburgh Robinson in the lane spins front iron rebound ends in the hands of Hinson and heres the 65 kingon steering the offense for the Panthers feder Rico muscles it his way down low and has it tipped Away by the agies pullup triple from Glasper is too long Glasper will hear the chance of the Oakland Zoo thats here loud and Crow tonight and a foul called on the leged penetration will go against North Carolina nice little shot fake by Blake get a near F hes a big boy you might have to use that foul right there with him going to the basket you going have to take one its not going to stop him hes a big body Blake Henson of course tested the NBA draft Waters opted to come back lost a lot of weight in much better shape heading into this season and can already start to see the effects of it here early in the year Federico around the rim that guy 6 11 hes long its going to be tough for the agies to stop him down low so far its all about the returners federo and Hinson now transition Hinson takes flight and lays it off the glass nine nothing start for the Panthers Brick by Brick they continue to build it here in Oakland feder Rico feder Rico two times the athleticism well the pit Panthers wasting no time putting points on the board and continuing to build momentum after in historic season last year under Jeff cable 24 wins on the year two in the NCAA tournament is the most for the Panthers since 2008 and 2009 of course when they went all the way to the Elite 8 with an incred ible team that year 15 seasons ago and the Peterson Event Center is alive and well once again thanks to the performance of the Panthers from a season ago Julius yes sir he felt the down you know a lot of heat was on him coming into last season you know the fans not happy with what coach cable was doing but he got us back to the promised Lane he got the Panthers back to the promised land as feder Rico make the layup back where we supposed to be J J you know thats what the P fans is saying back where we supposed to be you know what thats like for sure this guy has length hes under control hes smart just a freshman as feder Rico put it back in clean up the mess for the from the young guy what do you like about kington the Freshman I mean hes from Baltimore you know usually kids that come from those cities that you know yeah absolutely he you know hes going to have some Grit to him its just is a matter of him putting it all together Carrington by the way goes by bub so if you hear us refer to him by that the rest of the night his dads bub and hes Lil Bub team calls him bub so thats what hes going to be from our side as well 115 is now the panther lead after the Aggies got their first couple buckets on the board the last one a three from Nikos hudis for NCA and the Freshman from Greece now a Baseline pass swatted by Zach Austin hes a beast on the defensive side and he gets the block there now le it on the drive switches hands midair and has it blocked by the aies yeah thats good help defense right here but how about being this athletic two hands on that right there come on thats a forward hes not a footer doing that Jeff Capo calls him a really talented huge upside guy thats a freaked athlete as caring fires a triple thats Off the Mark leg tried to chase it down but Austin another transfer Julius coming in from High Point and had an impressive career there 141 points per game last season at High Point and a key piece among transfers for this pit team very athletic you know the exhibition game I seen him shot fake put it on the floor it look so fluid so you know Im looking forward to see what he can do on offense end for this Panther team he just had a big defensive play Coach Jeff capable said he should could end up being like Dion Sanders where defensively you just know not to throw the ball to that side of the field thats what he compared Zack Austin too and so now a foul called against Blake Hinson and the Panthers fans in attendance not happy about the call but nonetheless itll be landing Glasper headed to the line for NCA and to go back to Austin you know the Panthers are going to need a guy between him and Jeffers coming off the bench thats going to have to stop some real talented scorers in the ACC so you might as well get used to it now Zach Austin 67 in his red shirt junior year originally from Winston Salem North Carolina that was something they liked about him they know a lot of guys of course in the North Carolina area Jason played at North Carolina that Jeffs brother and Jeff of course a standout at Duke so theyve got plenty of roots in the Carolina area and were able to make some connections in securing Zack Austin to the Panthers quickly this time alop feder Rico the finish breaking to press doesnt get more better than that ball not touching the floor thats how you draw it up break the press to score the basketball the fastest way to get him out of it 13 Panther points so far all coming from Hinson and feder Rico two of the key returners on this Panther club that made it to the NCAA second round last season Glasper with seven to shoot defended by leot too much contact and the foul is called on the floor basket did go in but will not count 13 six Panthers leaded early and already a couple of jams from feder Rico feder Rico Ross Jeff raffy Dorian long joining coach Ross along with Ricky Moore whos somebody that you have watched a lot of Julius tell me why yes sir you know he went the Yukon its kind of odd that we had those rivalries with Yukon that I actually looked up to players from those Yukon teams the kit Lin Ricky Moore Jake vosco Rip Hamilton and then I go to pit and the these guys are my rivals like its the weirdest thing but yeah I watched a lot of rookie play uh Biggies basketball was huge back in those days and it was a pleasure to play in that conference its hard to admire you or its hard to think about you admiring Yukon in any for sure it is the it is a weird thing but Im glad we were able to build the program to even become a rivalry of Yukon you know we got to think Ray Allen before that crew so yeah we you know we did some good things yeah he won the title at Yukon in 99 and then assisted Kevin Oly when they won it back in 2014 of course the Huskies the reigning Champs once again coming off last Applause April Austin three from the corner rims out Hinson goes up and grabs the board on the weak side goes up strong draws the foul hell head to the line still the only points on the panther side tonight all coming from Federico feder Rico and Blake kinson and that was just a man move right there grabbing the rebound hes poised take his time power dribble just go up strong nice and composed no need to panic he got it all under Music control Jeff Chapel The Man Behind the first 20 plus win season for this pit panther team since 2015 and 16 of course when Jamie Dixon was still the head coach here at pit earned him ACC Coach of the Year honors and mention that impressive tournament run they beat Mississippi State in the first four and went on to beat Iowa State in that first round game against the six seeded Cyclones and I think what stands out about that game against Iowa State Julius they held the Cyclones to 41 points in an NCAA Tournament game it was an unbelievable showing on the defensive side yeah they got it going towards the end of the year and Coach cable finally got a chance to see what these fans feel like when it when its going good for the program but they got it going at the end they they had a good identity with Nelly Cummings and Nike Sandy and big shot Henson they found their Rhythm they knew you know they were great at shooting a three you know thats what you need to do you have to find your identity and and and do what you do well so the confusion here the brief stoppage to determine just who exactly the foul was on against NCA and and they rule that it was against Jeremy Robinson so number one for the aies officially gets the foul tallied Blake Hinson connects on the second free throw to make it 146 and how about the return of William jeffris good to see him back out there for the Panthers missed last year with a foot injury and has not played in game action since March of 2022 jeffr certainly a delight to see him back down on the floor for the Panthers and they expect him to be a big part of what they do this year especially on the defense to end with his length his ability to rebound the basketball and his athletic ability crafty shot there from the 65 Carrington to elevate over the defender and get his first official field goal as a Pittsburgh Panther and foul called on the other end will go against Zack Austin third team foul on the Panthers and the First on Austin guo Diaz Graham another friendly face for the Oakland Zoo and the panther fans in attendance really got hot towards the end of the year last season especially in the NCAA tournament for this pit team definitely gave him some solid minutes especially with feder Rico feder Rico getting banged up he did a good job filling in for him it must be nice to sub in 17f footer for another I dont know what that feels like but you know it must be nice for Coach cable Jaylen low the left Steve for three back iron and rebound hauled in by hi coutis good challenge by Diaz Graham on the defensive side and injured player down for the Panthers and being helped up along the Baseline look at the rejection from guo Diaz Graham reminds me of one thing the ncent coach told us coming into today Julius he said after practice on Friday we had to give the players some growth pills so that they could compete with this pit panther height tonight yes he does yes yes yes and with the three guys di Diaz Graham Twins and feder Rico feder Rico I dont know if a lot of teams can match up with having three guy uh three guys 6 and 11 and above its going to be a tough match up for a lot of teams and a scale set that they have theyre not just you know 7 ft stiffs theyre agile theyre able to run the floor right so you know in transition theyre going to be a problem also and talking about the height have to consider too they almost had another big in Papa amadu kti who signed as a freshman with the Panthers from Sagal and was expected to be a piece this year but is unfortunately out for the season due to a knee injury but you start to think about what this team could look like next year heightwise and its a bit scary yeah coach cap is doing a good job putting the pieces together thats for sure oh jayen low called for the travel there got caught in a tough position and theres KY freshman suffered an injury in September and underwent surgery it was successful unfortunately is out for the year but was rated the number 108 overall recruit in the 2023 class according to ESPN has a 74 wingspan and certainly someone for Panther fans to be excited about in future years and mix up on the floor Diaz Graham gets another block both of them are in right now guo out to the corner got a finger on that one too but it ends up back with glur crosscourt pass and now a drive from Kyle Duke 13 to shoot for the agies 13 minutes left in this first half good hands by guo Jaylen low transition pass tipped away and last off the Panthers NC and will take over Applause Music Applause Music I want to see Duke get a little more aggressive for the agies during wups he was knocking three after three after three down his teams down 10 he got to go ahead and let that thing fly well you want him to be aggressive but not in that way he picks up the foul after the handoff there made contact with Jaylen low and Kyle Duke picks up his first personal of the night substitution made by the Panthers ishma leet returns and checks in for Carlton Carrington big story to follow this year for the Panthers The Freshman guards how they will cope with having such an important role on the team after the back court was so vital to Panther success a season too Music Applause GMA looking for leot t to shoot leot drives athletic move to the rim and lays it Applause in well thats what we knew that he were going to have to replace from last year to Gar play coach cable said loow is more of the pure point guardy out of the Freshman so we get a chance to see how hes going to handle his Applause offense heres low again step back jumper top of the key off the mark and two players Collide underneath the basket and well use it to take a timeout 186 the pit panther lead 1153 to go first half from the Pak 70 Run for the Panthers going into the timeout but want to make sure we give you an update that Panther down on the B Baseline was Zack Austin and we think it came from this play right here gets his right arm pinched in between the arm of Kyle Duke now Austin went back to the panther locker room but fortunately was tended to and is back out on the panther bench so hopefully we do get to see Zack Austin again tonight but fact that hes back out on the batch of good s defensively definitely a guy theyre going to need in rotation 60 plus blocks and 60 plus threes come on thats a dual threat right there hes getting it done on the offense and defensive end theres a guy near the bottom of this list that I think has done pretty well in the NBA yeah pretty well huh I would say thats an understatement right there KD anytime you want to list with Kevin Durant come on thats legendary thats great company and Keegan Murray as well near the top of that list did it at Iowa couple years ago and hes of course now in the NBA with Sacramento and back back in Action here at the Pak just about 11 and 1 half to go first half first game of the 2023 24 season for the Panthers three ball two short there from Landing Glasper both Diaz Graham twins in the game and Jaylen low getting his run from the point guard position they lay off him but an offensive foul called off the ball against guo Diaz Graham who picks up his first five team fouls now on the Panthers four I should say and all from different players Ill tell you one thing last year around this time you saw the Diaz brothers on the floor a whole lot not so much looked like they put on a little weight little muscle its good to see sure did I think there was a point you compared him to the gasal brothers too that was what do you think about that D from Spain I mean thats not farfetched from Spain he had a great end of the year last year no question about that and certainly amongst the players to look at out for in this season in terms of breakout potential Gamo and Jorge that last three good from Jeremy Robinson the grand student from Raleigh North Carolina to make it 189 heres low takes another three back iron guo battling for the board and another foul called against Pittsburgh and once again on guo so he picks up two quick ones and good to see Zach Austin checking back into the contest so whatever injury he did undergo appears that it was quite minor and hes back into the action as the Diaz Graham twins check out along with Jaylen low low trying to get the lead off that basket low 0 for three from the field to start his pick career AT struggling themselves one of their last 10 and theres a triple offt Target from kelman Nicholls and now Carrington back out running the point he takes the pull up and thats off Target aggressive rebound from leg got it blocked on his putback attempt and Paul goes out of bounds along the Baseline will stay on this end faded a little bit on the jump shot but I like it he shoots it with a lot of confidence he know he can knock that shut down he already has four assists yeah like what Jeff cable said about his experience being a young guard in college he compared Carrington and low to him and Chris Collins back at Duke going into his freshman year there was a lot of praise for the front Court of duke it was called a championship front court but the back court there were questions and so he had guys like Grant Hill to look up to and he said thats whats going to be important for bub Carrington and jayen low look up to those veteran leaders for wisdom advice and guidance as they navigate trying to steer a team as freshman how about that for a little bit of help whenever you get in trouble as a freshman you could just swing at the gr Hill hell get a dump for Applause you now aggressive defense on the side from the Panthers ball went out of bounds Panthers thought it was last off the agies but it will stay with NC Applause Music and heres Glasper takes a pull up back iron and foul on the rebound attempt will go against Jeremy Robinson Robinson picks up his second so he and cam shell now both with two fouls for the agies couple in foul trouble for NCA and T and when we talked to Monte Ross we said you know coach this is a New Look team tell us some players to look out for and he said Im as anxious as you guys are to find out who theyre going to be yeah with so many new players and this being his first year he has to treasure the practice time that they have to get to learn Applause them but its no better its no better thing than a real thing the real game when the lights come on players can do whatever they want in practice some of them the lights come on they get missing on you so now he get to see for real for real you know who whos going to be the guy for me who can I depend on you know on the road against the ACC team yeah how about he said sometimes he still needs to use a roster card to learn the names and numbers of everyone on his team just because there are so many new faces and he was very open and honest about the challenges that hes got ahead of him for this year but very hardworking team he praise them for that theyre committed to building together and bringing ncent back to a stage where they can compete for conference championships and NCA tournament bids something that were going to see a lot of every time you have a coaching change youre going to start seeing players hit the portal right away wont be the last time youll see this kind of turn around heres one of the transfers Leed came to pit from rhod island has it tipped out there and Panthers will keep it I give with Five Points early for Pittsburgh on two of four shooting one of one from Beyond The Applause Ark Carrington Baseline jumper got it second field goal of the career for Bob Applause Carrington rocking the number seven a new change to college basketball that I absolutely love its great right right yes sir wes seven for Carmelo Anthony played AA ball with Team Melo did bu Carrington now hell bring the ball up the floor engineering the panther offense Austin Corner three on the wing I should say and now rebound on the weak side from Henson and Henson called for another foul thats his second and so Hinson going to step off PGE Diaz Graham will replace him what do you think about the call you know its a lot of pulling and tugging and extra curricular activity going on yeah before the ball get there that the referees have to watch Robinson and and hon been going at it so it happens Panthers still with a fairly comfortable 14point lead despite some of the foul calls 16 fouls called so far against the blue and gold Panthers now ball bouncing around five to shoot for the agies Glasper had it blocked by feder Rico and Carrington comes up with it behind the back what a move from The Freshman alleyoop attempt to Austin and feder Rico Taps it back in Carrington showing a little bit of the handles in transition kind of like what you see if youre Jeff capable from The Freshman point guard Carrington as duke get ones to get one to go Leed on the roll three from the top of the Ark in and out rebound to the agies Kyle Duke pushing Tempo pulls up off the mark rebound Applause Ley feder Rico drives strong take to the bucket draws the contact and when we come back from the break feder Rico Federico will be on the free throw line eight points for him tonight already heres a couple of them but Bob kingon with the Shifty move at midcourt and feder Rico feder Rico finishes eight points all back in the Peterson Event Center and want to take a moment to remember the life of longtime camera operator Carl trust passed last week at the age of 75 after over 20 years as a camera operator for pit athletics events hes also a former US Marine a Vietnam War veteran and were saving a spot for him tonight along the Baseline where he became so comfortable running that camera over the years here for pit basketball did Pit football Pirates Steelers a little bit of everything for Carl truss and was great friends with so many of our folks on the crew tonight and Julius well he did it for over two decades which means he was doing it when you were here too yeah yeah we didnt have a lot of conversations but you know we just seeing him here in the building we used to you know show each other love smile and um prayers to his family and talked with one of our camera operators tonight JW steel before the show and just reiterated that he always had enough time to help people out no matter how much experience they had in the business he would stay long after names willing to teach younger folks and our thoughts and prayers are with the trust family during this time 645 to go first half in the Peterson Event Center Panthers with a 14point lead Jason Earl Julius page with you on the opening night of the 2324 college basketball season Panthers with four different scorers on the game led by Federico and Hinson with a need a piece agies get an offensive rebound on this possession but a misfire from threepoint again they are two for 12 on the night from Beyond The Ark I know the agies are under sized but theyre going to have to try to get something going to the basket as Diaz Graham knocks down the corner three jge Diaz Graham the 611 sophomore from Spain hits the trifecta increasing the lead to 17 traffic on the penetration from glasur and last touched by the aies along the Baseline Pittsburgh ball yeah if you are 61 7 feet tall and you can set the screen and stretch the floor like this trust me you will get paid to play this game in the future you better believe it well thats what they want to see right guys like that who have the height ability on the defensive side but can also step out and hit a jump shot can pass the basketball put the ball on the floor hes only in his second year hes only going to get bigger stronger more confident comfortable a lot of upside two double figure scoring games last year for Jorge Diaz Graham and kentin hits from the wing for three hit really starting to find a rhythm now offensively on a 132 run over the last four and a Applause half freshman Carrington a lot to be excited about there hes got seven points rejection by Jeff blocked that one with two hands right there thats the second twohanded block weve seen tonight right welcome back William Jeffers good help rotation get up there with the two looks like hes help I would say so Jeff capable was so excited about jeffris coming into last year said he was playing really well prior to the foot injury and it was a big loss for that Panther team to not have him a season to go theyre glad hes back Diaz Graham the rebound Jorge is the twin thats on the floor now now low Al feder Rico feder Rico a flush got both of the young point guard point guards out there at the same Applause time and briefly silenced there by Kyle Duke as the crowd calms down for a moment but you said it Jaylen low and buob Carrington both on the floor so opening night perhaps a chance for Jeff capable to experiment with that low running the point jeffris weak side Corner three Off the Mark gets his own rebound and goes back up and draws the foul on the Applause way pushing it applying pressure to the D and theres nothing you could do with that feder Rico feder Rico getting up there just put it where your guy can get it and dunks was one of four categories that he led the team in last year along with field goal percentage offensive rebounds and and blocks and what an impact he has had Julius remember going into last year Panthers had John hugley he was expected to be the big that the Panthers could rely on was banged up going into the year that allowed feder Rico to get playing time but I dont know if anyone expected him to Surge the way he has over the last 12 months not at all you know I thought it was a fluke at first he kept putting up those double double those 10 and 10 games and I didnt think it would carry over but he definitely you know carried it throughout the season but I think it gave Blake Henson you know with John hugley uh being down it allowed him to offensively you know get himself going and you know here we are now and feder Rico started his career at Northern Oklahoma before coming over to pit and such an important piece in their incredible year they had a season ago and foul called that time on bub Carrington first for him hes got five assists in addition to those seven points on the night talked so much this year about the panther back court of course some questions about it but one of the big ones can they replace or at least live up to some of the expectations some of the standards set by last seasons group jamarius Burton Nelly Cummings Greg Elliot Nike Sandy so many talented weapons around the perimeter for the Panthers and its a whole new group coming in this year some freshman some transfers bub Carrington of course leading the charge tonight but so many names and again can they kind of fill that void thats left some from last seasons roster its obviously going to be some bumps in the RO but you know these days with AA being what it is and traveling all around the world these guys come in a little more prepared than I think you know players in the past came to college with the kind of experience that theyre getting entry pass down low feder Rico backing down his Defender with four to shoot spins and takes the shot thats off back iron and rebound attempt last touched by William Jeff 20point Advantage for the pit Panthers coming off their first NCAA trip since 2016 three and a half to go first half in the peak too soon JP but this freshman is on Pace for a triple double in his first career game yeah I speak soon Shawn Miller Brandon Knight Carol krower Lans Fields yall might have some company yall might have some company hes only 16 and a 12 minutes in foret hey I know its early I know its super early to say that but I dont know a lot of hype and its proven itself tonight no question about that I dont want to forget Trey Woodall I mean that list is long but if I miss anybody forgive me a lot of yall hey we cant cover them all right now thatll take too much Laughter Applause time 20point lead for the Panthers bub Carrington getting a welldeserved rest for the time being Jorge takes the three and drills it Jorge Diaz Graham his second triple of the night puts the Panthers up Applause 23 its tough with the length look at his ability to guard on the on a wing thats a footer right there guarding a wing player not many 61 guys that can do that not at all thats the thing that reminded me of a good gasau I seen gasau do it as a young man can he hit another wow yes he can Jorge Diaz Graham is hot from Applause downtown nine points for the Spanish Applause sophomore 12 to shoot now for the agies jge got a foot on it course a big soccer fan but not allowed on the hardw nice awareness kick out to the corner find your Applause guy Applause he can shoot it well the big story last year was the potential that we talked about right with guo and Jorge but what can they do in terms of St taking that step in the year two and this is an outstanding first impression from Jorge DF Applause green just look he they just look more confident out there stronger they they I feel like every other play they were biting the dust last yeah they clearly got a lot stronger a lot more confident in their game leg it crosscourt up ahead to Austin Austin u p way to keep your head up by leit Advance the basketball with the pass unselfish basketball advancing on the pass good catch by Austin feed the big fella he got it going heat Applause check 11 points to lead all Panthers hes perfect from the field and he completes the threepoint Play What a series from Jorge Diaz Graham yeah he had to tell him Im more than just a threepoint shooter now I could finish up this Rim too now I think he could probably clip off the last 5 minutes of this game and send it to every NBA Scout in existence theres a lot to like right there for sure and just like that the Panthers find themselves up by 29 here in the first half Hinson pivoting finding feder Rico off the fingertips Panthers reset with 13 to shoot Le it little jab step and then the drive and the Finish cant sleep Le it coming from the A10 its a very tough conference just because its a mid major I believe people sleep it but its not Applause easy Austin Skies up for the rebound Panthers waste no time on The Fast Break Leed again draws the foul its an 11 nothing run over the last two and A2 minutes for the Applause Panthers and it didnt take them long to gain control of this game and put all of their weapons on display as leot makes the first free throw I think its starting on that defense to end havent talked much about it but you know to see Diaz Graham guarding on the wing and to have the length rotation its Applause difficult going to have to beat him off the dribble make them rotate if Im Duke Im going Im just going to start going with my game I got to force the issue here this is when you got to start hitting the coach with the my bad coach my bad start trying to force make something happen see if I can get my teammates Applause Music Applause going 13second difference between shot and game clock for the Music aies this is Evan Joiner over to HEI kudis probably their final possession here of the first half now just one to shoot theyll throw up a prayer thats off front iron hining comes up with the board 7 seconds left for the Panthers alleyoop Zack Austin takes Applause flight my goodness pit Panthers story thats something special no question well the agies had a tough time from the floor in the first half just 14 Panthers with a huge Edge in virtually every stack category you can think of and it has propelled them to a huge Advantage at the break and if youre Jeff cable or Oakland Zoo not much to complain about here through 20 minutes against Monte Rosss North Carolina AT agies sure its a little intimidating going in there with those with the length of the Panthers but theyre going to have to figure it out 17 threes in the first half its just two of 17 not going to cut it yeah by the way count that as another rebound for bub Carrington whos up to eight boards seven points and five assists on the night his debut in a panther Applause uniform here is Carrington running the point eight on the shot clock finds feder Rico on the roll but pass taken away by the agies heres Joiner in transition and instead well drop it back glaspers threepoint attempt is short and Carrington Scoops up another one how special would that be hes up to nine rebounds the 65 freshman carington and another pit turnover now glassberg athletic move to throw it up off the glass but couldnt get the finish and well Carlton Carrington ends up with it again and if he does get the official count for the rebound there and he certainly does that is 10 boards for for bub Carrington The Freshman already with three rebounds in the first 90 seconds of the second half if youre the coaching staff do you tell them do do you tell them to try to get the triple double I think you let him play seems to be working right just going dont even say nothing just keep doing what youre doing right just hope that Jeff capable leaves him in long enough right oh hes a freshman you got to stay out there little get his reps in hes got more to prove if he wants to end up like Brandon Knight or Trayvon Woodall any of those guys you were talking about earlier hes off to a good start better start than any of those guys did I I can guarantee you that well what about you hows he compared to your start you remember your first a lot better I do not remember but I definitely didnt have seven 10 and five thats for sure you werent on Pace for a triple double at halftime not at all not at all oh hes got a chance for a double double On Any Given possession asz hes got those seven points heres Zack Austin tried the Up and Under but had it blocked now leet Scoops it up and tried to double clutch in the air and find feder Rico but ends up turning it over to the agies and Jeff cable still coaching hard if you thought up by 37 he might lay off the gas a little bit he thought incorrectly because coach cable has high standards for his team and doesnt want to see as frequent mistakes as weve seen here in the early going of the second half we saw Leed jump in the air and get and it worked in the first half not so much in the second half hey get out get hon was hot early been a little bit quiet since now the drive is blocked there by he C and the Aggies come up with it just two points in the first three minutes here for the Panthers in the second half Glasper three rims out Glasper is now 0 for 10 from threepoint range on the night nothing falling for the sophomore from fville Arkansas now Ley step through and Glides through for the Finish nice strong move good body control this male leot now in double figures with 11 on the night and five boards two dimes for the transfer from Rhode Music Island now Duke a step back top of the key got Applause it he can really shoot that thing got to become a little more aggressive make it it a little easier on your teammates Carrington for a double double he drills it The Freshman is showing up tonight in his pit panther debut 10 points 10 rebounds five assists for bub Carrington pan well Julius bub carington has been maybe the story of the night and we talked so much about the bigs tonight Im certainly there arent many that pegged Carrington as the leading rebounder for the Panthers hes got the 10 boards but also drilled the tri fecta in the corner to clinch a double double in his first career Collegiate game its impressive hes showing you know a lot of his talents whether its ball handling decision making his ability to get in there at 65 the rebound the basketball shoot the basketball I mean hes hes setting a bar real high so JP when people watched you I think a lot of kids started wearing the headband right I think if you watch enough bub Carrington and youre going to see a lot of kids starting to wear long sleeves under their uniforms cuz they want to be like this guy right for sure for sure and now with the nil you know was a good marketing for him Zack Austin another slam for the transfer from High Point to put the Panthers up Music Applause Music 41 ath ability on this team what stands out to you the most cuz you know 5921 theres a lot to like but to you whats the most important thing that youve seen for bit I mean you know losing the guys that they lost from last year and having leg it come in and Carrington and low and then add Austin a guy whos showing the ability to defend and finish at the basket the Diaz brothers getting better mean so far I mean this is going to be a scary team for you know this is a really good looking team so far yeah they were picked to finish ninth in the ACC and of course this is just one game against North Carolina AT but certainly gives you the sense that they could exceed expectations in that regard I if this team can consistently play like this theres no way they finish nin well whats interesting too is you come into this year asking yourself how much is Blake hensing going to have to do as he drills a three but for this team to be successful is he going to have to carry them game in game out offensively and by the looks of what weve seen tonight that doesnt seem to be the case I think leged is going to take a lot of pressure off of him with his ability to penetrate hes been doing that and if they continue to shoot its going to be this is going to be a long night for a lot of teams well the long night for ncent will continue after the timeout 622 right he was he was on the team with the guy but thats his homeboy if he couldnt shoot you think he would have been like nah man he was a scrub well he knew we were going to go on TV and talk about it right for sure Stephen A wouldnt definitely let him live that one down but I believe him I believe him you dont just go to a division one program and and you cant do anything he had to be able to do something well we may never know the real answer JP but for sure Monte Rosss word is all we can take for right now Panthers up 6223 as G mod Diaz Graham fires a triple thats off front iron and rebound falls in the hands of Cam Applause Music shell and the aies now four of 23 from Beyond the arc on the N another look at Jaylen low here the Freshman point guard for the Panthers and now another insance of low and Carrington on the floor together here loow is making me feel old is Godfather is a person that I know John Lucas the third Im getting up there when the players Godfathers and fathers are are are friends of mine well you noticed some Grays earlier right yeah just our cameras got a little too close huh yeah just a few Id rather get the Grays and start losing it so Im thankful but yet your jersey is still here zooo and its your jersey it is mine we its Applause official bub Carrington looking to be the next great pit panther guard trying to put his name in the same group as you Julius weve been told he is one of three pit Panthers all time to have a double double in his first career game joining the company of Shawn Miller and dwan Blair now I got to admit I was skeptical earlier when you started throwing bub Carringtons name in with Shawn Miller and some of those guys but there you have it hes in the same category in that they both got a double double in their first career games and thats legendary company Shawn Miller one of the best to do it at his position and dwan Blair wanted the best to do it at his Applause Music position Carrington also the leading scorer now for the Panthers with 13 points leading in rebounds and assists as well proving to be a doit all guard in his first game of his freshman season and a third foul called on Dio Diaz Graham and Carrington will step out after an excellent start to his second Applause Music half think Carrington might be done for the day I dont know hes got to get those last few assists right he need three more yeah I dont know how much any of them are thinking about it though no I dont think so at all I would you know the player want to get out there and go Carrington leading the Panthers in points rebounds and assists Panthers up big 1145 to go at the Music Pak each other especially with so many new faces on the team and you talk about you know the Diaz Grahams Improvement heading into this year theyve put on some weight and they chucked it up to their moms cooking back in Spain said she was feeding them too much good food they couldnt resist and so they come back with a little bit more muscle this year in their second season lets fly her in maybe they can put on about 5 10 more pounds of might do them a little more good Panthers expanding in international recruit of course mentioned Cony earlier tonight hes from Sagal feder Rico feder Rico has clearly proven to be a vital piece down low for this team here is guo speaking of him and his twin brother fighting for the board but cant come up with Applause it and Jorge hauls it in that time Jeff kle said they played against two good teams in Spain which was different from their trip to Italy four years ago said that the teams they played there maybe not quite up to par but over in Spain said the teams were really good that they squared off against and allowed them to learn a lot about their group but no doubt the Highlight was being in the Twins home country and really getting to experience what Jorge and guo grew up with just the opportunity to travel the world see something different Embrace other cultures and what I like too about what Jeff capable had to say about that trip he talked about one day when they were in Spain sitting around with staff some of their families as well and just thought to themselves we did this well they were a missed InNOut threepoint shot of being ACC champions in that road game down in Coral Gables at Miami towards the end of the year and he said coaching is such a grind especially these days with the transfer portal and nil you always have to be thinking about whats next and he said it really wasnt until a day when they were in a different country where they got to sit back and really think we did it we we brought the peak in the University of Pittsburgh basketball program back to what it used to be yeah he finally got the decompress after every game is on to the next one then after the season is on the Applause recruiting well Panthers certainly did the necessary work in the off season retooling the roster lost some pieces mentioned those ones but restructured brought in jayen low bup Caron having an incredible night in his first game a number of transfers that have come in and impressed early on in their careers and really significant what Jeff cable has done over the course of the last 12 months and Julius weird to think you and I were here for the season opener last year not quite as many people in the house here not at all started off slow took them some time to get it going you know but it you know its like this in Pittsburgh you know you win they going to come out and show their support if youre not win and theyre going to let you know you better believe it this city is is passionate about their Sports and you know they expect nothing less well I enjoyed how candid he was with us too he said I dont do coach speak he was honest with us and said it was really really hard and admitted Jeff capable did that part of it might have been arrogance on his behalf that when he got the job at VCU in Oklahoma he succeeded quickly going to the NCAA tournament in his second year respectively at each of those schools thought it would come fast at pit it didnt it took some time truly built it Brick by Brick into what it is now and said hes actually glad it happened that way because it showed him whos really with him last year when they started to turn it around he started to see people come back and he really found out who was really with him and those are the people that he holds on to absolutely you know during the struggle the time that he was down people was probably giving up on him he found out the people that was supporting him and then you know everybodys your friend when youre doing well okay everybody everybody want to be de who going to be with me when Im grinding and Im on the hot seat and things aint going so well you know you know you found you a good quality friend when they stick around during those times the win percentage contrast is striking from the previous six years to your par Julius maybe when he didnt have as many people sticking by him and last year they all start to come back but he pointed out Chris Collins again as one of his best friends said they were going into the same situation Collins the head coach at Northwestern headed into last year where both of us felt they were kind of in a make or break year they had each others backs theyve been friends since they played at Duke together in the early 90s and was really grateful for Chris Collins and the relationship the two of them Applause have I tell you what I always felt like he had the pieces he just had some bad breaks yep players getting hurt obviously the transfer portal and things like that you know but hes finally putting it together well and he made it a point to to start seeking out players in the transfer portal who appreciated the opportunity to be at pits that in the past maybe some guys came to pit and thought they were doing pit a favor by being there but guys like Nelly Cummings specifically last year who grew up watching this program and really appreciated the opportunity to put on a panther uniform and he said thats thats the type of guy that we want and those are the type of transfers hes looked for now heading into this season but all due respect if you if you taking over a program that winless and Conference play I Id feel like Im doing you a favor also yeah so it took time for him to build something I think you know everything matters I think the campus at the University of Pittsburg I think this facility in a Peterson Event Center the atmosphere you know all of these things matter when comes to trying to convince a kid to uh attend a university and you see ishmail Ley at the top of the graphic on your screen and he was one where they had a relationship with because trainer Daniel Anthony and strength coach Vincent Williams had worked with ishmail at Rhode Island and so they had a previous relationship with him they knew a lot about what he could bring to this Panther program and now they get to see him rocking the blue and gold and have to give a lot of credit to coach capable in the way he has rebuilt this roster especially in todays era of College athletics its definitely a players Market these days they have a lot of Applause Music Leverage 7431 is the pit panther lead under eight minutes to play from the peak never do it to put it simply one three national championships as the head coach of Indiana hes the sixth winningest head coach of all time and if you think about Indiana starting to evolve into a blue blood program in college basketball it all happened under bob Knight yes sir one of the Legends like you said and he will definitely be missed I think one of the most impressive things about his career is you he had Isaiah Thomas but you know aside from a few other names in his near 30 years at Indiana he didnt always work with the best talent not always the highly rated recruits or guys that would go on to the NBA but really made the most of his rosters and found ways to win basketball games yeah if you couldnt be coached T you definitely couldnt play Under Bob Applause night just about s minutes to go here at the Peterson Event Center pit Panthers have been in control essentially from start to finish here at the Pak and the lead is now up to 45 points theyve got five different players in double figure scoring on the contest and of course bub Carrington hes on triple double watch hes got 15 points 11 rebounds and eight dimes in his debut game for the pit Panthers go ahead coach let just run that pick and roll two more times pick and popping pick there it is right here here is this nine right here RS out they know they know hes going to be pass let him get it the lost six and a half here going to be dishing it out you know a player get this close you got to go ahead and let him try to get it Panthers are just given opportunities to land in Glasper whos 0 for 15 from the field on the night heres caring in top of the key takes the pullup triple hint in the board and the easy put back its a tough shot the long arms of feder Rico on you thats a tough shot stop on the dime step Applause back Applause crosscourt pass here to Zach Austin spins along the Baseline and gets a bucket Panthers have five at the scorer table going to do a full line change at the next Applause stoppage heres another board from The Freshman Carrington 12 for him on the night Hinson from way downtown in and out and that one was halfway down Julius Im not sure how that ball did not go in and look Carrington wanted the dime he sure Applause did and the Oakland Zoo is saying leave him in he shares a laugh with Jeff capable hes got 1512 and nine on the night and that would have done it put him back in coach put him back in Laughter coach well whether we see him again or not what a night B Carrington hes in great company already but you know come on coach just the one the one you got to let me get the one yes you got to let me get the one great job coach C great job you got to do it right let me be the only one to stand alone trying to become the first ever pit panther to achieve a triple double in his debut game so bub Carrington reenters to the pleasure of the Oakland Zoo and theyre making it very clear what they want Julius if you cant make it out they are chanting verbatim triple Applause double Im Im asking for my guys to come back in I need Blake back in here and feder Rico make it a little easier for me coach this happened a lot shot makers huh yeah yeah let me penetrate just throw it up there to feder Rico let him go get it then you can sub us right out Applause after you got to think the confidence and the Poise you have to have as a freshman to come in here opening night 18 years old one of the youngest players in in college basketball is cool as the other side of the pillow Carrington making a lot of noise tonight and and there it is Bob charington makes history tonight in Pittsburgh the first Panther ever to record a triple double in his debut game what a night I think a lot of people are going to be talking about bub Carrington Julius yes sir rightfully so did it without forcing the thing under control just F making a right basketball play and hes still a baby hey G Mo shot had people on the edge of their seats too didnt make it look easy right thing took a bounce off the rim the glass the theatrics he said Applause it still got a lot to play for no its only game one so long season new players they still got to find a rhythm figure out what formulas work what rotation pieces work together dont look at the scoreboard if you Applause diis Carrington from downtown 18 for the Applause freshman Applause Music Jaylen low getting in on the action second field goal of the night for him leads us to our final timeout of the night bub Carrington Dicky V would call him a diaper Dandy triple double for the Freshman from Baltimore theres the assist that gave it to him rebounding the basketball dishing the basketball scoring the basketball come on we talking about the likes of Shawn Miller Brandon Knight hes doing it all hes putting on the show showing why you better get your popcorn ready ladies and gentlemen you better get it ready he is quite the show bub Carrington an entertaining player 1812 and 10 tonight once again the the first freshman in pit basketball history to have a triple double in the first game of his career remarkable showing from Carlton Lil Bub Carrington from Baltimore tonight for the pit Panthers a fourstar prospect ranked in the top 100 by Rivals and averaged over 26 points in his senior year at St Francis Academy and Carringtons father actually coached former Panther standout Jamal artist from age 10 all through high school so once again there were some ties between this pit program and Bub Carrington and It All Leads to a performance like tonight well beyond his years 18 points 12 rebounds 10 assists on seven of 12 shooting from the field and its the type of display that can get the fans in this building really excited for whats to come the rest of the season a ton to be excited about Blake Henson getting it done feder Rico getting it done leg it showing what he can Applause do all five of those Panthers and double figures and Michael hwit Jr gets in on the action as well havent called his name too too much tonight but he hits the jumper the grant student from fville North Applause Carolina so worth noting the Panthers back in action on Friday here in the Pete against Binghamton and well Julius if youre Jeff capable youre winning 9648 what can you take from from tonight that you talk about before Bingington on Friday not much in a negative sense I mean your team pretty much came out and got it done thats a good thing you know just remind them that you know were going to see better opponents than the agies you know we play in the ACC youre going to see Duke youre going to see North Carolina Miami so so I dont think its going to be this easy every single night and theres KJ Marshall with the triple the walk on for the the Panthers has a little bit of fun as well and Pittsburgh up to 99 points on the night have a feeling they might want a 100 Oakland Zoo certainly wants a 100 KJ Marshall leading the panther panther offense saying H why not finds jeffris on the back door circus shot rims out but hell head to the line everyone invested in this 100 Mark here Julius yes sir its a great way to start the season everything clicking offensively defensively getting the job done seeing William Jeffers come back from injury un mentioned they are going to face some tougher opponents without question and those opponents not too far away we got Florida on November 22nd and as part of the preseason nit in Brooklyn theyll also take on either Baylor or Oregon State so some tough ones looming at the end of the month as jeffris sinks the second free throw and the Panthers hit the century mark theres theres never been more pressure for a free throw up 50 never youre right about that cant imagine the disappointment on this faces if that one didnt go in and Jeff Caple saying all right thats enough 100 52 the final bub Carrington makes history with a triple double quite the showing from the pit Panthers in game one Julius yes sir its good to see them clicking on all
