these two teams come right down to the wire over and over again as you mentioned the last four games have been decided by eight points 5250 6665 6958 last February Duke won by four right here so we are set to go Virginia to home whites and to do Blue Devils win the opening tip youre right theyve won that game last year because they got great play on a roach when roach plays well they play well get it downstairs for lively on a block and a foul founder Place immediately commits the personal trying to close in on lively The 71 Freshman you know Lively really has stepped it up he had such a great game against Carolina he has 14 rebounds again eight block shots I mean he just absolutely has been Sensational for them lately finally finally live it up to the billing he got as the number one high school player in the country averaging four blocks a game over his last six and looks good at the line there to put Duke in front two to nothing Applause theres a full cast now so we talked to John Shire about an hour and a half ago he said he feels like its the first time in well all season long theyre completely healthy mark up top for band Applause Virginia at 184 103 in the conference Franklin on the Baseline on the reverse and well lay it in Houston today I spent time with his mother and spent time with him at the hotel lobby what a beautiful mom he has and shes so proud of her son who did you not spend time with is probably closer to the question youre everywhere at once all the time probably picked me one time as a Dixie youre all Lobby youre on the old Lobby youre the coach of the alllobby team and philipowski will swing that for the corner Mitchell that didnt touch a thing and right back to the Cavaliers Cavaliers had probably their best defensive Game of the Year where they shut down North Carolina State you did the game Clark and two what a quick step for Kihei Clark and weve been watching it for many years good first step man Ill tell you it really exploded the Dukes starting five here this afternoon Proctor roach Mitchell philipowski and Lively and a key man coming off the bench and Chris will have more on that in just a moment the bounce here for roach comes in averaging 13 a game shot clock is down to four for the Blue Devils got to get it in the air Proctor launches it and cant hit it but Lively will give him a second chance roach wont wait he buries the three thats big right there good second Opportunity credit that basket really to Lively for that offensive rebound Lively as you mentioned with all those blocks the defense the rebounding he has really started to play his best basketball absolutely well finish that one downstairs High spec tour club by Van de plus execution so key with Virginia theyre so efficient he put a plate about against NC State whos a really good team maybe here averaging 79 points a game Duke throws that one away and left scoring 50 to take key in his game as well with Duke against Miami would have blown out the other day they turned them all over 21 pounds they better reduce those turnovers Big Time against Virginia the Miami team very underrated nationally I dont think thats the case within the ACC there at home they put on show against Duke but for the Blue Devils what a vicious part of the schedule this is North Carolina Miami and then Virginia had a whistle on the Baseline come on win two out of three of those are pretty good yeah approach with the personal foul and yeah cold night in a hot town they were five out of 19 from three you mentioned the turnovers and when Duke doesnt rebound its tough for John shires team to win exactly thats one of their strengthsky going did not get going against Miami Applause and for Franklin whos been cold here the last couple of games and a rare turnover here for Virginia they only kick it over nine times a game in the top five nationally well the last two games for the two for 14 two for 14 Franklin and hes been scuffling to score hes better than that hes much better than that transfers him out of Indiana he roomed for two years with Trace Jackson Davis youve got a lot of information out of his mom you really did well he told me that too today oh look at that steel big man stops it Beekman with the slam tell you what what a great steal that was now tremendous defensive play but frankly his mom jumped overjoy man jumping with joy philipowski around the back comes in averaging 169 Mitchell banging back to Roach in a triple off the heel Clark will push it back out execution Ill make the extra pass always looking for the open guy big quality shots its no secret to their success we defend you take quality shots and were going to win our share games Applause Franklin looking very determined in this one and a foul against the Blue Devils as Shedrick hits the floor oh boy defensively dick this is where the Cavaliers Thrive they really do such a great job defense theyll get you to sleep hes playing and finally Pops that ball loose the left hand and off he goes baby up up and away come on I had entered the game board the lower leg injury before the game about having a healthy life with his scholarship players are all healthy Duke is 90 Shire also told us that white had done a lot of individual work to work on getting that confidence back hes the guy thats dealt with some injuries throughout the season earlier in the year had a fractured foot this one was a lower leg injury when you watch him on the bench hes actually still wearing a brace while sitting on the bench out here now for the Blue Devils first time since January 23 he gets some minutes after he had to exit against Virginia Tech tell you what the biggest number 90 with him in the lineup thats going to bring a smile to your face as a coach thats why John told me on the phone he said finally we are healthy we got everybody that really rotate some people now youre looking at the two best defensive teams inside the conference swung up top for philipowski Duke holding opponents to 64 Virginia to 60 and a hot start here for roach in a twopointer thats thats really good news for September hes playing well Dave their game is elevated big time for them to come out here and knock those two down he played really poorly hell be the first to tell you that against Miami Applause time Gardner has really been the hottest guy offensively for Virginia here in recent games Music Applause Shedrick has to go off him and out of play Dan thank you very much Virginia has the early lead 97 they made their first four shots this is a big one to John Paul Jones Arena here in Charlottesville a packed house number eight Virginia against Duke who comes in unranked for the first time since 1996 to lapowski whos been a star in his first year with the Blue Devils on the spin and no basket as he took the foul hit by Gardner now Virginia buckling down defensively take a look at Virginia right there whole back door cut good efficiency and then defensively watch this from Victor park right there for left hand Franklin away there he goes baby Ill tell you what they defend if you dont believe me call up mistake he came in with the highest scoring team in the conference left with 50 points and got beat 6350 50 points a team that averaged 80 a game the top scoring team in the ACC going into that contest and Virginia absolutely just shut them down and the lane Whitehead and a whistle as the Freshman from New Jersey is fouled by Shedrick 97 Cavaliers tell you one thing Duke has not lost two in a row good here Im blown out by Miami I mean Miami was up to Sensational in that game Whitehead can be instant offense Joshua wanted to get him into the game quickly anticipates kind of about 15 minutes dick here today in his return to the rotation you know hes so athletic he really is hes got such great skills and talent shot clock down to one backing in phillipowski thats a shot clock violation back over to Virginia thats the third turnover already for Duke here tell you what really hurt Duke Big Time against Miami turnovers and you got a credit Miami I think personally all year the teams Ive seen the conference I think though theyre not in first place I think the best team in the conference maturity wise another place by him even though today people got a glimpse of North Carolina to real North Carolina that people were rejecting early this year to be a traveling violation on Isaac McNeely so look at those standings you alluded to the fact that Carolina rolled today against Clemson knocking them off the top run pit one against FSU so Virginia this is on the line today a share of first place tell you one thing I think North Carolinas going to go on a run I really do I think youre too talented that would be first to tell you theyve underachieved compared to where people were projecting I mean everyone was talking Carolina to Georgia the Lebowski getting a lot of contact here blocked out of the sky and theyre going to keep it on this end foreign company getting all over the seven footer tried to rotate inside here comes the defense rotating over great job Shedrick is one of the top shot blockers in the ACC frankly in the country had 611 hes from Raleigh you know Dave he didnt play against that game he was on the bench lets tell him roach has come to play here two threes driving layup hes a big time point guard he showed that last year the end of the season he was like their key Catalyst helping all those first round in his band Paulo and Company and yes certainly uh Williams he has seven Virginia hosting Duke hes an unranked team for the first time since Bill Clinton was in the White House too much coming up on 13 minutes and a half Beekman no rebound tap down out it goes and itll stay here on this end talk to Franklin today in the lobby the hotel when his mom was there in the Indias her name and I can tell you this he was so really so complimentary about his former roommates Trace Jackson Davis he said man hes having a great year and also he said number one hes a great guy rumored him for two years you get incredible information in hotel lobbies like nobodys business tell you what they Al McGuire hes the only Dixie youre all Lobby youre all Lobby rebound popped up and controlled by Duke I like the fact he calls you Dixie he always supposed to be Dixon its for the OS Club s the Baseline what a great move hes talking about strong in traffic Applause time Mr roach having a phenomenal first half really terrific his moms gonna be on cloud nine she goes to all the new games puts the Blue Devils in Front 119 Virginia has gone cold after a four for four starts without a field goal in the last almost four and a half heres Clark with it trying to get by Young and therell be a whistle and a foul before the shot with 12 26 left in the half Music its like a volleyball Applause six nothing run and Virginia to check it in return Mark Mitchell back on now for John Shire hes very athletic too when you dont get Mitchell streaky shooter but brings down after this yeah he had a rough one against Miami two for eight just five points in 24 minutes to take their whole team really struggled down there in Miami youve got a credit Miami I know well hear about the fact that it was emotionally tough just coming off the Carolina win but you know Miami played that Saturday as well beautifully moved out of Nevada plus and hell finish it everything theyve gotten has been in the paint so far tell you one thing doing a great job running a beggar lack of communication by Duke on a defensive end well tied at 11 dont be surprised if were saying with the last seven seconds to go its all tied up as well weve got a timeout and here at the table right before we tipped off a couple of Giants beating hey how about that hey Ralph says hes as good as it gets when he played man three times player of the year Music Applause Music we did it Wilbur why not lets do another one as well nothing but nylon then he shows his driving ability takes the most one to the goals going to go with another Drive what it helps with each of the game first nine minutes hes been brilliant I think hes got 10 points already doesnt he he does during the commercial break this is how well hes going they gave him another point because they took a look and they saw three instead of a two then he hit several minutes ago so hes really rolling yeah Jeremys having a great game he did last year they beat the Duke won the game they beat Virginia on this floor and Beekman came up with a big three to beat to beat Duke man did it open up for him and two more Ontario roach show time baby hes having one heck of an afternoon I tell you earlier I had pretty much Franklin on my mind it was beating them that made that great defensive play going through the goal with that jam so Reese Ill give you credit now hope you hear me loud and clear Mr Beekman deserved the credit sorry missed the Franklin thank you partner going over to set a screen peekman will give it up Franklin in the corner shot clock a factor down to five Beekman will line it up but he cant hit it takes me real quite is certainly Carter and Gardners been Sensational the last four games out to 18 Again seven rebounds again hit 18 against NC State 20 against Virginia Tech before that Whitehead with a Miss but Lebowski I should say young keeping that alive and theyll knock it down long range Proctor whos only making about 28 percent turn one thing pumpkin thats the double Australia went through an academy there he reclassified to become a player to play right now but Ill tell you thats the I believe the second or third time theyve gotten an offensive rebound and converted to three off the offensive rebound even got bottled up theres Garners straight on he loves that shot from around the foul line okay midrange player hes not a threepoint shooter he knows hes strengthened he knows it well he does a phenomenal job transferred two years ago from East Carolina he scored over 2200 points in his career hes legit plus no doubt him down very strong but I like like about him he understands his role and understands his shot whats his score young trying to go hard here on vanderplas as it knocked away a dive on the Baseline a terrific play there by Gardner thats why he wouldnt a lot of games man thats a little reflection of coaching kids really buying in to representing that church its going to be an offensive however on Jaden Gardner what a job he has done everywhere hes ever coached you guys amazing Ill tell you this today when I was talking to Franklin it was unbelievable he says to me hes transferred but all of a sudden hes arent you know they got fired he wanted a lead and was doing a time during the time when the situation was they were really looking for a coach at Indiana Tony Bennett came on him because he was in a portal and he said to me simply unbelievable has been the greatest experience playing Applause Tony Bennett 14th deer in Virginia John Shire his first year as the head coach Proctor got a great look absolutely drained it okay one thing squared his body really well normally he got hands in the guys face he was wide open here got that great look as you call Mr OBrien now what a new contract at ESPN a new contract certainly with the Red Sox I want some money man I want some money this guy decides two fouryear Customs did you leave any more money I hope so you are incorrigible well Im gonna call the president Mr Patel is there any cash for me file number two on lively 2013 the Duke Blue Devils and Applause the senior from Argentina well get some minutes here for Tony Bennett try to get some sights on that floor tough time defending that three new offensive rebound has really hurt when you talk about the situation with Virginia getting on the threepoint shooters Franklin from threepoint land meanwhile Duke has caught fire in a 152 run over the last seven minutes on your phone yesterday so you know we didnt play well she stayed we didnt play well obviously against Miami hes about 11 and a half weve played some good basketball we have so many young kids playing really well right now they made six out of seven the Lebowski out of the double and theyre going to turn it over Beekman On The Run Beekman to the paint leaning in and blocked by Mitchell Todd Mitchell did a great job defensively he held his ground he didnt go with the fake from turnover again two turnovers in a row right there thats been a little problem for doing it six times in this game here in the first half Applause Mark with it the grad who has played more minutes than anybody in ACC history about that its pretty cool on the Baseline back out to Clark shot clock inside 10 point guard will lay it off that iron it wont go for him Applause they go for the big again and from right to beat them three turnovers in a row now three possessions foreign Applause Applause Music Music Music moment Music Music welcome back to John Paul Jones Arena Duke up by five this was the message Tony Bennett sent his team after the Lost Virginia Tech well talk is Chief Do It show us to our players to our staff show up work in practice step between the lines and dont lose yourself with anything other than what your job is like chocolate totally better before the game is listen it might have come out a little harsher than what I wanted it but the point was wheres that point of the Season well you need to find a way to be able to level up your team it cant just be what were talking about in practice I need to see it and he certainly did this fast outing at home again since hes taking it its kind of funny when Chris repeated the quote in the locker room a couple hours ago Tony said really I guess yeah that was a little tougher than I thought but they were both talking about that intestinal fortitude both John Shire and Tony Bennett what a fascinating matchup this is among the head coaches you know Tony used to be the young sharp head coach a very sharp coach not as young as he used to be but John Shire 35 years old in the year number one at the helm Purdue so one thing bottom line is I look at Tony Bennett he still looks very young to me man be real young hes really tremendous respect among his peers respect among his players he has really earned That by The Unbelievable productivity in fact you know when you talk about that I do motivational tips every morning bro I did one recently Proctor just beating the shack life there big number to rebound I did what recently said hey dont tell people about what youre going to do produce and show them simply is the committee play your results do the talk yeah I think both of those coaches were saying in effect the same thing as we watched them work over there on the sideline and the intensity just pouring out of them better place with a little Fall Away wont drop then the plus came out of situation MidAmerican Conference he uh really thought Tony knew his dad really well had no trouble recruiting them Applause fascinating to watch how close their styles are coaching Styles shot clock at five young going in strong shot clock is down to four now to show you push Cody Beth go like that to him foreign Applause Music low scoring as anticipated with two very very good defensive teams ranking one and two in the conference Music Applause Music see the shoulder goes right in defense beats him to the spot philipowskis had a terrific gear the last game he

impact players and you know they may not be the best for the NBA draft thats another storm Im talking about guys helping a team win at Purdue she talk about Haney helping Saint Marys having a great year even though theyre going to upset with you soon after all its a foul a little bit young at the line in a threepoint lead here Purdue philippowski seven time ACC rookie of the week pretty good indication how that award is going to go hes really been terrific while youre inside outside but you go to a little struggle once in a while right now hes fighting somebody a little bit smart move I think its a smart move but a players struggling a little bit get her get him out for a minute or two and get him back on the floor Applause Music Applause Music conshire is going to be a terrific coach Im telling you right now just a just time patience patience is something that really is not part of anymore Society nobody wants patience if youre not instant super get a new guy get a new guy tougher fans to be patient coming off the goat right Franklin on the drive and a whistle heres the goal yeah oh hes a cool hes a coding right now and no doubt about Coach K I think hes the greatest of all time I really do the mens college basketball continuing on Monday Miami against North Carolina should be a Dandy in seven Texas and Texas Tech Texas going in number five on ESPN on big Monday should be a good goodbye Carolina today really put a hurt on Clemson big time once that game going away so much talent you know you look at the veterans there experienced players onto the last game of the year National Championship four starters theyve been a puzzle though to this point theres no question they were ranked number one at one point I heard Jay billis say today they were overranked by the media not North Carolinas fault its everybody else ranking them that high maybe theyre not that good tell you what they had certainly proved last shoot every good and I had everybody coming back so I can understand the video ranking in their house really five to seven roach long distance cant drain that hasnt missed many here the first half he has 12 points under five to play here had John Paul Jones Arena Speakman its really created that situation desperate three Ill try to sort of lob them on top but a hold before that out in the lane hey the one player and Cameron doesnt it back goes paid for them last year was Brady McMahon three roach with number two Applause looking for the mismatch trying to get the size of damage on the interior flopped and grab them hold them 68 grad out of

is what we call the stash section for Ben Vanderpump I did ask no ones related but they did say they get to meet him the other day they were thrilled with that by the way the stash has been growing since coven when he was stuck with his brother his brother grew one and then thought oh its a little competition growing mustaches against your brother mustache the little goatee a negro here on top of my head growing on my face a little jump shot right there my Mitchell left hand the Goodman range shot by the way I would pay to see that heres McNeely in and out his terrific shooting touch Duke continues to maintain the leads first basket so you have to get him screen roll oh geez doesnt stop in turnovers on the spin Mitchell denied back out to philipowski shot clock at eight looking for the lane left it behind scooped up by McNeely Franklin will wait on Beekman Dukes defense is keeping him in his game so were the leading actually Music the nine turnovers already thats quite a bit and youre up five thats amazing Applause and theyre possibly for some help Music cheekbone strong Drive denied stronger defense by Duke they broke taking over really well with Mitchell leaning inside and an offensive foul totally out of control right there totally out of control trying to make something happen that wasnt available calm down calm down but thats 10 Music the devils on the road at Virginia Music on any weekend work day or wedding day Music Laughter Music Music made field goals Proctor the freshman Miami held him to just three points and he turned it over five times but hes looked a lot better today hes learned how to play you know hes a young guy should be still in high school he was playing on a Collegiate level not just the collegial level at the elite level playing with his topnotch competition hes going to be a very good player too Applause Music stopped in a really well played game theres no doubt about it hes doing a good job defensive but turning the ball over as the guys talked about doing a break 10 turnovers in the first half one to get it off and got it up in time did Clark rebound tip and controlled by Shedrick Shedrick did a great job to keep that ball alive and give him a second opportunity dribble that gave it away on the pass it has been sloppy its been sloppy no doubt about it but you know its amazing situation if youre up five turning the ball open ten times he gets a team like Virginia and without phillipovski giving you anything offensive no points Dr learning the game yeah his product fixed the coach so the coach coach Ill get him going then hes amazed the whole defense sees whats happening on the floor he takes a look and then hes gonna write down hes pointing clear enough he wanted him to clear out he wanted to clear it yeah hes done basically reality dont worry about it we used to use the fiscal clearup Show fist clear up and well change it for the next game because people would get wise to him sure get down there with those coaches flesh full of sides trying to figure it out 98 of them mean absolutely nothing Shedrick with the foul to put Mitchell at the line and makes one of two douche defense the key Dave whiter right now leading Applause hes gonna set something up now Clark had been sitting for a while Kihei vanderplas turns to fire to rounds at him so hes been data Music they did not score in their loss to Virginia Tech on the road at Blacksburg they need some points from him the lapowski on the spin defense again too tight bound to plus this time knocks it away Applause its like a Nifty move to the cup but it wont roll in he did everything to score everything missed the big man every the beautiful move stood into the lane and made it so tough its gonna be a blocking foul before the shot so everything except the two points here great spin down in the lane good extension too hard too hard tell him what they made it so tough a philipowsky here in his first half should be his first points motor freethrow line the last eight games has been averaging about 19 points and 11 rebounds well he only had nine against Miami the last game as well without a point so far today and two rebounds in total for a very very good rebounding team leading to conference still cant get any scoring columns bottom tough tough afternoon so far folks his teams bailing them out theyre on top dont guarantee the only kills but getting out of here with a dub Franklin way downtown and it almost didnt get there Applause 2521 I dont think thats a shot 20 then it really wanted and Virginia is over four from threepoint land Applause and with a big time stuck fisherman high school he should be in high school are you serious are you serious Mr partner from Australia nice to have you wow give me an averaging nine under 40 seconds before the break McNeely left handed and one McNeill is going to be a star for Virginia is a fouryear player and hes going to be a star its not going to be good look at this Mr Proctor with the jam Miss McNeill he says you know what anything that diaper Dandy could do I could do him better I have to drive hes a little more flashy though when you look at practice right McNeely to the stripe and cant complete the threepoint play so four point game and Duke has won nine in the last 14 in this series but they have been close perhaps another one here this afternoon plus four games came down the difference of only total of eight points last last year it was a buzzard beater by Mr Beekman the beat of the Duke oh strong but thats going to be an offensive foul they get him for the charge Tariq Whitehead The Freshman just back in after missing the last four four and a half games lower leg problem here he is its months an opening defense rotates over hes up in a year and cant do nothing about it and theres the charge yes sir Music Emily simply say this before you go any further here Barry sucks he was so loved that he has been by so many people just a terrific guy Fierce and tense just had a great great way about himself and he just loved what he was doing always had a passion he had a massive heart attack and hes in the hospital and please say a prayer for Barry Barrys one of the real good Gods gives you a tough rough kind of personality a doggy hes got like a little teddy bear the love guy we love you Marion praying for you buddy black off the fake slack to the paint lays it off and beat him with a slam right at the horn what a way to end that first half and uptick certainly for Virginia its really that struggled offensively that gives you some momentum baby when Uncle Moe comes against the crowd all Jew stuff Music on the slam lets get it over to Chris with John Shire Koji told us before the game you wanted that tough he hasnt scored they have 11 turnovers yet theyre up by two and have only given up 25 points is amazing here in the first half dude by the way 151 when leading at the half this season Virginia with the ball to open up the second 20 talked about roach getting off 12 quick points yeah the first 815 did not score after that a quick strike here for the Cavaliers to tie it up at 27 Franklin now with seven nice club by Franklin to get the layup remember this Virginia had that momentum you dont have to cut in a deficit and going in on the last score its going to be an offensive on Roach lets go to Chris on Tony Bennett yeah Tony Bennett coming out at halftime said this is our kind of game were making him earn it we just have to steady the ship better how to be better on the offensive boards execute the middle ball screen and need to be able to hit our shots from the freethrow line Virginia number eight in the country so Chris is going to get my job man shes talking about execute the middle ball screens she have unbelievable Clark Ill tell you what but momentum has really come the way of like Virginia tell you what Dukes gonna have to really lace them up thats a good time off they needed it they needed it the way they have finished so this goes back to that final play dick of the first half and the slam dunk in Virginia has kept it rolling and now on top by two foreign Applause Music Applause its the whos in a big way at least as of this moment and thats why John called the time out when they do it around trying to wake his guys up here saying we got to really play there thats it Commander plus up top shot clock at 8 Gardner lost it it comes out High got to get the shot out quickly Franklin does cannabis fire in tight terrific efficiency New York so they dont score they move the ball exceptionally well got the play they wanted down the company bottled them all that would have been a jam no doubt about it I firmly believe I may be wrong Ive been wrong before I dont believe Duke will win this game unless philippovsky starts getting rolling talking about 16 points nine rebounds a game Proctor went around the back up top for lively four to shoot now for Duke Mitchell launches didnt touch anything its a shot clock violation that was a defensive clinic right again the defensive Clinton what date India was unbelievable the shot clock situation and his unreal that defense is suffocating yeah you dont see many teams have the pride and the only patience to play the kind of Defense they played 16 times this season Virginia has forced a shot clock violation Music now off the fake fakes again and the pass and draws the foul as he went strong to the paint you know create the opportunity for him when he caught the ball he went to Triple Threat position he owned somewhere he could drive he can pass or he could shoot number three on lively so that applies to shoot where he makes just 63 percent Music Duke back to the bench Lively will come out Mitchell as well Radisson is coming on and so is Young physical presence on the interior very aggressive player Virginia not very good at the line in this one they miss again theyre three for nine today thats 33 percent you cant win games shoot 33 percent free throw line pretty good math huh head to head again young will zip it to the corner and the long Ones Gonna rattle in by grandison well you know hes done that well did it well when he played in Illinois Holy Cross its the Marco Polo guy hes been around a few places product of the famous Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire as well line shut down there heres Franklin yes on that JD Justin Franklin the last two games he has not been an effective shooting the ball two for 14 hes too good a player to get a shooter came the way of Indiana marching got fired he got included by Tony in the absolutely fell in love with himself Santa Claus really attacking the backboard there look at the patience see a number of bathrooms paper patience hes been around a lot of years he can play one of the best little guys on the six feet in college basketball but we just talked about Virginia needing to step it up from threepoint land and Clark absolutely drained it they started out over five theyve made a couple now walk from Franklin two big threes roach gets denied on the Baseline and he is fouled on the play with 1559 to go here in Charlottesville thatll be on Vander Plaza number three on him Virginias open up a bit of a lead here 3530 on the Duke Blue Devils Music foreign Music Applause the Wells Fargo active Cash Card Black History always lets give a nod to the black women in these two schools breaking barriers Carla Williams the athletic director here at Virginia and Nina King the athletic director had to also at Duke would celebrate Rachel Barker shes a general manager for Duke basketball all Breaking barriers in their position at the first black women in those roles by the way there are only three black women as athletic directors at Power five schools the other one being at Vanderbilt thats the end of story Lee and take a bit of a context for you of just how incredible these women are seven years ago there wasnt a single black woman as an athletic director at any power five school so its amazing and I think its really great thats happened should be more should be more as a lot of talented people out there roach penetrates got it up there for two and hes finally broken through in the second half he had 12 points in the first eight minutes had not scored since then I dont know Carla havent met her but Ive met Tina a number of times shes terrific shes just a superstar Virginia had been on a 143 run going back to the end of the first half black for Gardner has been pretty quiet in this one a lot of contact there with young go whistle the young played a really tough and physical right there trying to lean in forcing it up there and he traveled with it slap you offensive possession right there and said hey Tony truly furious with their officials during the prank questions as hot as Ive ever seen him actually not exactly sure what that was about but hes usually pretty calm cool collected just like you about 15 minutes to go its a bounce here for young grandison open way downtown got a great look young draws the foul Tim Wilson and Young comes in seems a lot of good things happen its the aggressive is active gets the offensive rebound thats been a big plus for you heres this weeks NBA Saturday Primetime matchup at ABC and the ESPN app Lebron James the NBAs alltime lead score how about the sound of that beating the Lakers against Clay Thompson of the Warriors at the chase Center our coverage begins with NBA Countdown at eight oclock Eastern five Pacific just amazing achievement when you think about the years and the consistency year after year two decades first time I laid eyes on him doing his high school debut on national TV against a team oatmeal and Oak Hill was loaded with players he made them look like a bunch of guys just starting out playing dominated I was in awe I was in awe absolutely and now Im still in Milwaukee I think of 38 years of age doing what hes doing just absolutely great breaking Kareems record yes amazing and Kareem just one of the greatest of all time I dont think he gets enough recognition in terms of nationally when they talk about the greatest of all time you very rarely hear his name Jordan certainly uh by the way granis will try another one and all men on that one so that he can do he can do that hes done that throughout his career we had a tie game here remember we told you last year came down both games right to the wire Dukes six out of 13 for threepoint territory theyve not been a good shooting team then thus make it up for the fact that theyre getting his corn out of philipowski dont say what he does he creates space for his teammates because he gets so much attention whistle there to stop playing 1405 so the last 14 games decided by an average of four points per game no game decided by more than 10 the foul there on roach by the way and that is going to be number four uh Jeremy roach so he has to step off and so does philipowski so thats a big loss right there John scheiss losing their Candace he told me on the phone first thing he was speaking about told me hes really the guy that makes us golf theres no doubt about it so who does it fall on who does this scoring onus really fall to well right now you get the two scores sitting on the benchry looking certainly roaching and

it look at Tony on that side this is as hot as Ive ever seen Tony on the sideline mcnilly off the inbounds cant connect filipowski chases it down its a play they wanted him Neely some Victorious some tremendous longrange shooting so a onepoint lead for Virginia Duke with the basketball coach just settle down settle down lets get a high percentage shot game started approach was on fire with the game started Duke hasnt hit a field goal in about five minutes to Lebowski determined still working clean play thereby done and that is another shot clock violation thats the third of the ball game

last time they have been held under 60 in consecutive games if it were to happen you did it you blew my mind this is how good theyve been here right Virginia holding the last 38 opponents in the

recap brought to you by Buffalo Wild Wings to tied it by grandison another controversial ending to regulation thatll be actually argued look at this freethrow line cannot believe it Tony gonna give it a gym trying to be some free throw shooter oh man he was something else and you can still do alltime alltime threepoint shooter in the history that said uh Virginia just six for 16 at the foul line

fight for them hes a high school guy who reclassified came up big theres the Zone 23 hes normally dont play a lot of this well today Chicago has it stripped and Duke shuts him down on the Baseline threepoint game Music Proctor looking for a screen Music a nice Cut young inside he missed the layoff did everything run twoman play jumping blood oh that should have been a lamp right there under two his Zone patience patience usually he needs possession if you have patience points of productivity sounds like three keys Gardner A Little Fall Away usually his favorite shot six passes to get that shot but let me tell you youre right Ill be thats usually his shot his excellent midrange shooter oh look at the content of the top third draws another whistle with a minute 29 to go and OT thatll be foul number four on Gardner I like this kid right here look at us here look at that drive gonna use the left hand seals the defense off remember the name Mr Proctor hes going to be a special player in

this one away at the line and Kyles got to shake this game off Big Time get a few days get away from it back to me and Kyle Phillips another Premier impact type of damage that America meanwhile
