18 and a half points per game but shooting 48 from beyond a threepoint line also won the accs top assessment at 38 but its not just about williamson today you also has a contemporary on the other side prentice hub who was playing maybe his best basketball during his notre dame career and hub over his last four games where three of those have been wins for the fighting iris 178 points per game 55 from beyond the arc so both these guys setting up for a nice showdown today apprentice a guy who can really dish it as well as we get underway in south bend indiana very good of you to join us notre dame coming in six and nine three and six in the conference but theyve been hot lately wake forest at five and seven two and seven in the acc obama getting in close with a little hook shot and thats gonna drop down wake forest with the early strike getting inside the paint and thats a nice move by aguama but even better when you consider the competition going up against one of the accs best shot blockers in juan durham and obama coming away with the early bucket the fighting irish love to get it up in the air from the threepoint line where they make 38 percent of their threes gonna go downstairs instead and a quick foul hey liszeski at 610 to junior uh to jupiter florida he is the goto guy certainly along with prentice up cory no question about that 15 points eight rebounds a game and you talk about a big at six ten really plays more like a guard he really does and shoots the ball extremely well but over his last four games we see hes three for 12 from the free throw line knocks down his first one 75 percent throughout his first 11 games so lazzewski is a great shooter as we mentioned but struggled from the freethrow line recently good to see him putting points on the board for the fighting irish early at the strike its an interesting point to you though hes 66 percent now at the line he makes those two he looked very good and hes been a very good foul shooter throughout his career can a guy just sort of get the yips and start missing like that in the middle of a season it absolutely can happen especially if you miss one or two and you start thinking about it and aiming your stocks instead of shooting them oftentimes you come up short but leski im sure has put in a bunch of work recently on the free throws going three for 12 over those last few games and seems to be hes got that touch right back well a long one there by hub that wont fall but as corey mentioned the threepoint shot thats a big one in his arsenal the fighting irish routed pit on saturday 84 to 58 theyve won three of their last four games oguama getting that one into the paint again trying to back inside but left it short and when you look at what wake forest is doing multiple possessions already going on the interior to obama we talked about their threepoint shooting theyre trying to find a way to flatten out the defense if they can get obama going just a little bit to where maybe notre dame decides theyre going to double team open up some opportunities for those perimeter shooters demon deacons playing their first of three consecutive games on the road gonna swing it for masood but denied by durham and now durham with a nice catch and finish thats one of those thats a fastball that got up on him quick oh give durham a lot of credit because it was tight quarters where apprentice hub delivered that pass but the big fellow running the floor gave him a lot of credit for having great hands on that possession open shooter must said well drain that one hes 40 out there and certainly one of the better shooters on the court today yeah hes had performances eight threepointers for him against pittsburgh eight for ten so hes very dangerous from beyond that arc and oftentimes playing the five position for wake forest even though hes undersized there but right now having to go match up on the defensive end against prentiss hub goodwin down the lane tough drive but couldnt get that one to go williamson leading the transition now for the demon deacons their top scorer at 14 points per game steve forbes now in his first year as the head coach for the demon deacons replacing danny manning in april danny coaching the demon deacons for six years they went 13 and 18 last season so steve forbes trying to build them more into the east tennessee state mode because he had so much success there 130 victories over five years before coming to winstonsalem hub got a good look but could not cash in and ob you know when you mention steve forbes he says something very interesting to us earlier talking to him he said that identity happens long before culture and in explaining that he talked about right now hes not sure if his team knows exactly who they are theyve gotten closer to who they want to be over their last three games where theyve won two of their last three but yet they have to establish that identity as to who they want to be before they can say that they have the culture develop in winstonsalem durham little fall away nice touch there as he kissed that one gently off the rim and notre dame has a onepoint advantage and when you speak about identity the identity of notre dame basketball is offensive four out one in but one of the things that mike bray has had to do this season because of juwan durham is play really two traditional bigs which is not like mike bray but yet playing to the strength of his personnel having durham on the floor as he comes up with another board and already has two buckets early for notre dame you want to keep the big fella out there and give him as many opportunities as you can ski with a nice feed and durham continues his good early run on a nifty pass so you go you know two guys who can handle the ball well at their size in particular six eleven six ten leading to that hoop and a great interior passing once again as were going to get the second foul on oguama most likely he will not be on the floor when we come back in timeout right now the fighting irish at home with a threepoint lead acc network basketball is presented by geico you could save even more by bundling home and car insurance men everywhere are now cutting their hair at home are you introduced massoud at the rim and then catching the pass like the big fall is supposed to do on the break finishing it off and then going to the opportunities with passing on the interior with he and nate lechesky with the finish off the twohand slam and weve also seen durham get it done offensively but you look at what he does defensively right now 158 blocks fourth place all time behind some big names two of our guys jordan cornett lafonzo ellis as well as assistant coach ryan humphrey so great company for juan durham within the fighting irish program the dane goodwin with a quick strike and notre dame opening up a 105 lead yes in all of our games you know those those fiveonfives we play in the acc network you always get the bigs you know you get those big guys that swat the shots away you guys love to take our hardearned money and im sure theres an element of that that rings of fairness to you but not to me i just want to point that out well i mean again you know if we if we take if we take our network im gonna definitely go with cornett at the five im putting uh im putting fawns at the four you know luke hancock whos gonna be whos gonna play the three you know i need shooters to be able to space the floor out but ill go with you with the two ill go with you with the two now ive got the ball right yeah ill go with you at the two ill keep the ball ill go with you youve got the ball and i will never touch it thats how that works and youll win you win every game yeah thats what most of my teammates said thats kind of been just give me one look at the rock cory says no thats not the way it works those are not our rules notre dame with a threepoint lead here early at purcell pavilion and a shot deflected right to the demon deacons and to isaiah wilkins as 640 junior steve forbes will probably try to get 10 guys on the court here for this acc matchup yeah but i believe one of the areas of wake forest strength is their death and of course you know mike bray wants to play seven guys he likes to have a regular rotation of about seven guys give each and every one of those guys a significant amount of minutes but i believe that where coach forbes is right now with their program he feels like they have to have strength in numbers and try to find a way to wear you down and keeping his guys fresh at the same time but you look at mike gray in his 21st season the alltime winningest coach at notre dame and you know one of my favorite guys to talk to about basketball the thing i love most about mike bray mike bray never really takes life too seriously you know i mean he he takes nothing for granted he doesnt take things seriously and he enjoys what he does and youve got to appreciate that especially in college athletics where oftentimes many coaches take things just a bit too serious joe go with the lane yeah mike knows how to kick back on the beach down in florida and you know just have a good time relax with the sand under his toes and the sun setting and certainly when it comes to basketball hes as serious as a heart attack about winning games i think he made that very clear when he had some disagreements with officials down in tallahassee last year a shot clock a factor now here for wake and a foul with one on the shot clock a rare notre dame foul that one on prentice hub notre dame of course commits only 12 fouls a game its the fewest in the country again and a mistake by a veteran of course thats thats enough to make mike go have a seat especially when you consider that your point guard and your team captain makes that foul and knowing that this is a team that doesnt foul much but you bail out wake force as you mentioned only one second on the shot clock they werent even going to get a good look at the basket on that possession yeah thats a killer and you see princess hub still he knows hes upset about that and you know and again you know hes getting encouragement from the bench saying youre okay youre okay but apprentice hub is a very smart basketball player he knows he made a mistake there and he is not letting it go well the alleyoop does not work for wake forest so in transition here come the fighting irish cormac ryan now into the game wheres number five for notre dame another guy who can really shoot it hell draw the foul in front of that shot 11 50 to go here in the first half notre dame up by five on wake forest its bow tie if you ask us dinner should be warm golden real deal scratch made and stick to your ribs with plenty to go around id heard of shop at iron but id never seen it with my own eyes i was just shopping at food lion and saving money like big plays to how champions start their day this is the heart of it all this is nothing but net we welcome you back to acc network basketball presented by geico notre dame 127 in the early going here against wake forest look at their schedule now the fact that wake forest has only played a dozen games they barely played in the month of december since then however they played a ton of games in fact in the month of january nine times going two and seven so all sorts of problems with the schedule covet related of course but they havent played a lot of basketball compared to some schools and they missed a lot of practice time as well in the month of december so really when you think about them getting back in action on new years eve they were simply starting training camp over but squeezing a lot of games in as you mentioned 11th game now within the last 30 days and thats a lot of basketball to be played in a short stretch johnson lifts but cant connect a graduate out of durham north carolina notre dame trying to add to their fivepoint advantage here at home dave obrien and corey alexander from our homes i dont know about you corey i spent most of the day shoveling snow today here in new england 12 to 15 inches of fresh powder i have a feeling that was not the case with you my friend well hobie you know me well enough to know that i would have no idea what its like outside because i havent been out there in about three days absolutely true well coming up next our doubleheader rolls on with 11 and 5 north carolina taking on 10 and 5 clemson thats at 7 oclock this one beginning at a very unusual start time of 5 pm the notre dame students are now beginning to come back to campus they expect about 10 000 kids back on campus mike braves a little bit worried about it because his team has pretty much been in a bubble with the kids away theyve done a great job with covin and theyve done a wonderful job making sure the kids have stayed healthy pull up pop way downtown that wont drop by masood lets save back inside oh nice look there for the easy dunk of cuomo with two thats my guy ema coming up with the dunk of course coached him a year ago at oak hill academy but one of the mistakes made by notre dame you do not save the ball under the opponents basket when you throw it back in now theyre playing 405 ends up being an easy basket for wake forest so again weve seen two you know i wont call them bonehead mistakes but two mistakes that you dont normally see from a notre dame team who are very well coached especially on their defensive end of the floor lake forest has already had 10 guys get into this game williams a nice spin cant get that one to go and thats because durham was putting a lot of pressure on that rim again whit with a nifty save there and thatll turn into a run here for williamson and up for two i believe that was the first digits making a run here theyve cut to within one yeah that was the first turnover for notre dame and they havent scored in the last three plus minutes so mike gray right now going to the bench giving a number of guys opportunities but i think we may see nate liszeski dane goodwin get back on the floor here relatively soon if theyre not able to make anything happen with offensive end durham has been the goto man nice hook pass to get him a couple of more yeah he came in averaging nine points five rebounds he already has eight so far cory and i think credit for three blocks to this point and hes had some big performances this season you had a big game against virginia two double figure games against virginia so hes really come along as a scorer more so this season than he has throughout his entire tenure at notre dame and right now hes been the guy on the offensive end of the floor early in this one ryan with a clean look well stick that he had a great game on saturday in a victory against pitt 19 points and he nailed five out of six from threepoint lambs in the first threepoint mate for notre dame in each of these teams now with one threepointer we talked early both coming in making 13 threepoint field goals in their last outing and both turned into wins for these teams so they rely on the three but right now to this point neither have had much success from beyond the arc you see us on the drive heres whit to lift and got it right in front of the horn threepointer yeah hes playing with a lot of confidence that ob it was four for four his last timeout their win over miami for 11 points and he had struggled recently shooting the basketball but of course you know he talked about car to win came to wake forest in the second semester right around christmas time and so he didnt have the opportunity to have the preseason conditioning the training that most of his teammates did and you know thats one of the things where steve forbes said he missed out on most was the actual weight conditioning and trying to strengthen that body to be able to play in the acc kick back out to one and another one from threepoint land hes hitting 35 percent but the kind of guy the stanford transfer who can really get rolling and ryan has made eight of his last 14 threepoint field goals coming into this game now two for two for him from beyond the ark so hes shooting a hot basketball one of the reasons why hes getting more and more minutes for coach mike bray word saying that one is knocked out of there oh again getting involved but we talk about ryan and his ability to hit that threepoint shot yeah when threepointers are your problem fine cormac ryan as hes knocked down two of his three attempts here to give notre dame the lead when does a moment in time become a piece of history when it struck into a coin and the brand new 2021 american eagle silver dollar is a piece of history you dont want to miss this coins iconic design is changing dramatically later this year so this release is your last chance to own the original timeless design call governmentcom now and this shiny silver coin will arrive in perfect mint condition coin series in the world this is the final release of the original eagle design loved for over 35 years capturing reagans legacy american back in notre dame a defining irish lead 2014 and cormac ryan coming off the bench and firing away staying hot because cory his last game he was sizzling seven out of eight overall you see what he did from three against pitt yeah and ryan actually has been hot for the last four games obi now he missed the virginia tech game and mike bray talked to us about the fact how much they miss him in his ability to space the floor but to this point if you include the day 10 for 17 on his last threepoint shots made so you want to find more opportunities for a young man whos shooting a hot basketball like that out of milton academy in massachusetts hes originally a new yorker but the state of massachusetts has been very very good to the notre dame basketball program over the years thats going to roll off the iron see us a little bit cold right away the 68 junior cant find the range up on the spin well kick it back out ski back in the contest now for mike gray coming up in the sixminute mark of the first half up with the dish durhams been the man so far in this game pounding it into the lane got it up there hes going to go to the line and shoot two and not only has he been the man obie but durham has been very aggressive and i like the when hes approaching the game this way weve seen him play you know of course over his career at notre dame and oftentimes he would just throw that basketball back out feeling though he had no opportunity to score and now hes being aggressive putting his head down trying to find a way to get to the rim and if not hes getting to the freethrow line well heres our thursday womens basketball doubleheader wake forest facing syracuse that games at six eastern then number one louisville continuing their run to top the rankings for the first time in school history against bc both games right here on the acc network nine points so far for durham along with five rebounds im not mistaken i believe louisville went down to nc state last night obie i think the wolf pack were able to knock off the number one team in the country well nice inside they found nucias that time he comes in averaging 115 yeah you know ive had to keep up with my acc womens basketball when youve got the top two teams in the country but nc state actually went down to virginia tech last week and then theyve returned the favor to louisville so its going to be interesting to see whos at number one well you see how hubb continues to be very unselfish ryan with an easy basket prentice hub who has 21 assists over the last three games so hes been finding his teammates 23 but hes in the irish yeah hes got six assists already in this game alone and to only the well im sorry turnovers for prentiss hub so hes been doing a great job distributing the basketball and of course we all know sharing is caring for princess hub as hes attacking the paint and helping to his teammates get involved in scoring column ryan by the way with eight points and eight minutes off the bench for notre dame trying to force it inside massoud no the follow is up and good jalen johnson the 66 graduate out of durham for two jalen johnson coming off of a big game versus miami last time out he would actually went for 16 points sorry 15 points in that game so hes starting to find his way in what coach forbes needs for him to do in his rotation and you look at it coach forbes having played 10 guys already now has a mix of starters and reserves on the floor lucius yes got it to go caught that basket hell be at the line as well isaiah 6a junior and i love this move by mucias who you know oftentimes has settled for his jump shot on the perimeter but now you see when he gets smaller guys on them hes not going to settle and is going to find a way to use his size advantage over prentice hub and not only for the bucket but an opportunity for the hand one and he takes advantage of that and steve forbes had a long conversation with isaiah muchas when he got to wake forest and simply told him your numbers dont say that youre a threepoint shooter so we need you to be more than that and isaiah muchis bought in thats one thing he said he brought in both feet in has been a great leader as well as teammate in this wake forest program and won the gospels given the the success that theyve had thus far under code forbes getting a shot he can certainly make and steve forbes were talking to steve earlier today and he called nate really a guard who just happens to be 610 hes really one of the best shooters in america he makes 64 of his shots 52 from three and like everybody else in this game he makes his free throws typically we mentioned he had a little bit of a slump but i mean hes a guy who can shoot it from just about anywhere all right as well as you know ishmael massoud is a guy that can shoot it from anywhere raising up right over top of the defense and knocking down the three and we talked about hes got a eight pointer threepoint field goal made game this year against pittsburgh so you have to be aware of where he is around that threepoint line whenever he has the ball oh it up there from outside the building to nail that one and make it 2824 and mike bray is extremely excited to have words back in the lineup missed a couple of games with the ankle injury after he was actually granted eligibility with all transfers earlier in the season and he says he allows for prentiss hub to get off the basketball a bit and apprentices benefit from that as well but right now isaiah massoud will benefit from three free throws when we return three minutes ago first half notre dame by four we look at the bottom half of the acc standings now you see notre dame at three and six wake it two and seven you know theres a team on that list you figure can make a big time move it might be the fighting irish corey because they won three out of their last four they did it last year and when the season finally came to a stop because of cover 19 they had won 20 games they were playing like an ncaa tournament team as well when you look at their schedule theyve already played virginia twice theyve played north carolina twice theyve dealt with some heavy hitters they played duke so theyve dealt with some heavy hitters already the schedule was much more favorable for the fighting irish moving forward again massoud shooting three times with 301 to go here in the first half at purcell pavilion at south bend indiana and missing that last one good one outside the three lechesky over the shoulder the tip up and in good win with some nice touch and give dang goodwin credit for pursuing it isaiah muchas went over a little too far he wasnt actually helping but took himself out rebounding position and dane goodman recognizing that going in with the easy tip underneath tried to do a little too much there in tight quarters and they wind up turning it over so back over the irish it goes notre dame trying to pick up their seventh win of the season they do have a top 10 strength of schedule as corey detailed theyve played a lot of really good teams and paid the price for that early on but that schedule will loosen up a little bit as they throw this one away boy there have been almost no turnovers so far in this game yeah only the second turnover for notre dame but right there dane goodwin having nowhere to go as you seek five total turnovers between both these teams and again this is par for the course for notre dame but wake forest has struggled handling the basketball this season so coach forms has to be happy about that when you look at notre dame and the ranked opponents that theyve played this season alone you know very few teams play a ranked opponent nevertheless seven of them throughout the year and coach bray would love for there to be at least one win in that column but all seven of those ranked teams have been victorious over the fighting hours jacoby needs sticking a long one there to make this a onepoint game with less than 90 seconds to go in the first half durham looking inside and it never got there batted back to him he tosses it up and hes fouled again Music so juwan durham who was the center of the offense for a big chunk of this first half goes back to the line here Applause game high nine points for durham irish coming off a route of pittsburgh over the weekend in which they hit 13 of 24 threes but started out this one missing their first six from threepoint land a friday we have our first mens lacrosse game of the season and a wrestling doubleheader number one duke and number five denver at three and then at six the blue devil wrestlers take on virginia and at number three nc state squares off against number eight virginia tech here on the acc network weve got it all covered we see notre dame coming out with a one three one zone and when you put nate liszeski at the top of that zone its tremendous size but when youre trapping out of a 131 youve got to have great rotation to be able to get to the shooters and backtoback threes now for wake forest you talked about their ability to be able to shoot it from beyond the arc made 133s in their last win over miami and now a big one there to tie the game for the demon deacons goodwin good look yes hell bury that shot and put notre dame back in front 3532 and now its turning into the kind of game cory we anticipated this could really wind up a pretty good shootout yeah we were expecting for both these teams to come in and shoot it very well and both playing with a tremendous amount of confidence on the offensive end weve seen that over the last few possessions wake has made five consecutive shots and finally a miss so the irish to get one more shot in the year here before halftime leading 3532 in a reachin foul with 86 seconds to go trey wurtz draws the foul our officials here for this afternoon evening game jeffrey anderson patriscal and jeb hartness will take the break have you heard of nutscom its the best kept secret of savvy snackers

check out nutscom corey interesting to foul there by coach forbes very interesting simply because you know you have a foul to give so you want to stop the time but mike bray also has the user to lose a timeout he takes that time out to draw up something if you dont change your defenses you put notre dame in a position to get a good look which they do dane goodwin just unable to knock it down williamson on the run got it up there cant hit the long runner so we are at halftime here in south bend notre dame with a 3532 lead over wake forest durham with 11 points five rebounds big plays to how champions start their day this is the heart of it all this is nothing but net acc network basketball presented by geico from south bend indiana this is shaping up is a pretty good one notre dame 35 and wake forest 32 dave obrien and corey alexander coming to you from our homes on this frosty tuesday night certainly frosty for some of us and quite snowy in many parts of the country good luck on your digging your way out but you know notre dame getting behind the big guy durham and he had a really fine first half yeah obi we thought that we would see a bunch of threepoint shooting in this game and the guards taking over but its been the big man jajuan durham getting out and running in transition showing off a nice touch around the rim of course he does it defensively but what hes done offensively for the fighting irish in the first half has been spectacular hasnt gone away from what his bread and butter though blocking shots and finishing at the rim 11 points for durham early in this game and right now he has been the catalyst for notre dame on both ends of the floor our player spotlight brought to you by geico 11 points five rebounds and the three block shots came in with 27 blocked shots to lead the fighting irish and they have the advantage at the break a rebounding defense those have been a couple of weaknesses for notre dame this season a big reason is six and nine coming in same could be said for wake forest but notre dames defense with the big fella in the middle has been pretty stout and well see if the demon deacons will dare to go into that paint here in the second half yeah when youve got a shot blocker in there oftentimes that can deter you but right now wake forest picked it up from beyond the arc ended up five for 11 from threepoint range im sure thats something theyre going to try to find out more opportunities here in the second half notre dame in the home whites for the basketball to begin the second 20 minutes here at purcell pavilion was pretty quiet in that first half and thats what notre dame could do so well as hub will bury that one from deep on the wing and one of the things that mike bray talked to us about was flattening the defense and oftentimes theyll throw the ball inside to durham to flatten the defense and when you see notre dame has action once he catches the basketball its not as though everyone stands around to watch everyone is moving apprentice hub is able to knock down the three off of that movement out of the pass return trying to get inside well defended again on the interior by notre dame a scrap of that shot clock a factory got it off but it wont go by masood another loose ball scooped up by the irish and here comes the point guard hub hell drive it and deflect it out of bounds off wake forest in great offensive action is princess hub who actually was at the top of the key but got on the move after juan durham was able to catch the basketball off of a post speed from nate liszeski so you got to like the moving without the basketball for notre dame which allowed hubb to get a good look from beyond the arc juwan durham with the touch pounds that one into the paint and heres la chesky off target there durham fights and stuffs it back in and thats just pure effort right there and slams it down for the biggest lead of the game for the fighting irish and obi it was almost as though durham was on defense he actually boxed out obama to be able to get that offensive rebound and then of course found a way to put someone on a poster as soon as he got in his hands rebounded away by durham maybe a bit of a danger zone immediately here in the second half for wake forest goodwin drives it into the lane trying to reverse course draws the foul and hell go to the line and a seven nothing start for the irish to begin the second half and give dane goodwin credit for not moving that pivot foot he got into the painted area and you see he will keep that right foot down one pivot then reverse pivot find a way to the opposite side of the rim and finish through the contact an opportunity for the threepoint play which he completes to make it 4332 and wake forest goes to the bench and jaylen johnson who gets him about seven per game will enter the fray this game was tied at 32 and suddenly notre dames up by 11 and you gotta like you know notre dames ever coming out of the halftime whatever mike bray said to his group it worked at halftime and right now steve forbes trying to find some type of energy to start the second half going to jalen johnson getting him in the game early here in the second but juwan gorham continues to deny everything at the rim and that time the basketball actually goes off of williamson out of bounds giving it back to the irish and durham coming up with the blocked shot as williamson falls out of bounds the basketball hits him and giving it back and notre dame now with six blocked shots durham of course the primary suspect in the block party yeah hes got four of them and that one all the way down and way a little bit here 4632 and dave weve seen more of the same here in the second half its been the juwan durham show boxing out isaiah musius and then finishing strong dane goodwin getting into the painted area with the fancy footwork and the and one and then when you look at what theyve been able to do from beyond the arc notre dame started out over six from beyond the threepoint arc but theyve made six of their last 10 tries and part of the reason why now theyre on an 110 run just to start the second half trey woods with that big triple that forced the timeout by the demon deacons getting it inside for masood and again its durham right there to make sure it doesnt go hes having a great defensive game were raved about his offense but hes been even better maybe on the defensive side yeah five blocks for durham hes already in double figures with 13 points hes got eight rebounds and five blocks we might have to watch out for a triple double watch for juan durham in this one as he continues to dominate this game on both ends of the floor apprentice hub on the other end making sure wake really pays for that block 4832 he has seven assists and five points Applause shot clock inside 10 whit will give it up massoud on the drive to spin and that wont drop oguama went for the tip and a nice save by the irish everything is breaking their way and wake has started out the second half over six is durham again with another touch trying to use that 611 size couldnt get the shot away off the back of the iron this time by hub and wake forest will try and dig into this 48 to 32 deficit you know thats the first time weve really seen durham be indecisive on the offensive end but he gets a pass thrown immediately just directly to him on the defensive end wake with some tough interior defense williamson on the run out no give princess stayed right with him there yeah yeah he did he sprinted right back and did not allow williamson to have an easy layup threw his rhythm off just a bit and of course princess hub just for good measure comes back and knocks down the three oh boy thats got to hurt if youre the demon deacons now youre down 5132 on the road and youre having trouble making anything like theres a lid on that basket over the top for oguama in close and Applause Music absolutely won the areas of concern for mike gray and his team they want to get stop scores not just stops but theyve been able to do that behind the defense of jajuan durham and the shooting apprentice hub nearly 150 years of experience goes excellent from three notre dame start to half won a 160 run and they did most of that damage from beyond the threepoint off weve seen princess hub knocked down not one but two threes in the second half trey wurtz getting involved in the act coming in they made 13 threes in their last win over pittsburgh could they contin could they make that a you know consistent effort come in and shoot the basketball that well theyve done that here once again now seven threes on the evening and leading in 51 to and the basketball and the one thing youre noticing about these long shots by the fighting irish is you know getting in close for an easy two here but the threepoint bombs theyre theyre not even touching the rim theyre scorching the nets with these shots theyre true and on target well those are the way that those are the shots that you make for our team right being that youre our shooting guard isnt that the way you shoot it they dont touch the rim its just all net its the one i get its the its the one that the point guard allows me to shoot as the two guard well i will say as your point guard you can shoot every time i throw it to you because i only want to assist if i have to get the basketball out joe go getting involved and drops in two more and now notre dame is firing on all cylinders aguama underneath will lay in two as he rolls to the hoop right now steve forest is trying to find a way to stop the bleeding going inside to obama whos got a couple of buckets here in the second half hes really been the only one to be able to produce offensively for wake forest but theres been no stopping notre dame whos gotten everything they want on the offensive end of the floor apprentice hub just missed the easy one there but got the exact shot that he wanted obama again double up inside but it doesnt matter he fights right through it for two thats a nice answer from oguama weve seen him with three field goals now here in the second half and hes the only one that scored for the demon deacons his three field goals have been all their scoring in the second half as cormac ryan continues to stay hot from beyond the arc transfer from stanford coming off 19 points against pitt and has 13 in this game so a big lift for mike ray and remember now wake forest is also very capable of climbing back in a game from threepoint distance because thats their money shot as well heres a long one by hub but no williamson so far has not been a big factor in this thing for the demon deacons and they really needed him to be he came in their leading scorer 14 points and three assists a game aguama again this time a foul with 11 59 to go notre dame commanding lead 5838 in the second half ill never forget when it first happened Laughter id heard of shop at earn but id never seen it with cc standings at three and six six and nine overall but when you start to look ahead at the schedule you know clemson is in the field for the ncaa tournament at the moment but theres a possibility with the schedule cory notre dame could change that and jump over them and when you look at what they have coming up at georgia tech at duke those are if theyre able to win those games those are two very good opportunities for notre dame and you get those wins now you find yourself sitting at 500 in acc play with a favorable schedule going down the stretch you mentioned to coach bray juwan durham continues to dominate on the block you mentioned to coach bray earlier today ncaa tournament and where he talked about hey weve played a tough schedule they havent won those games but they have i believe the seventh toughest strength of schedule in the country this year the fact that they played that schedule and you know they havent had a covet pause they could get to 24 games i believe thats something that the tournament would have to look at if they get you know 10 11 12 acc wins possibility with that schedule because it softens up a little bit for the fighting irish goodwin nicking the rim on that turnaround but notre dame leading 6038 at the 11minute mark here in the second half Music williamson rolling inside but hes denied that goes back to a point that you made earlier today williamson got in the paint and he saw jajuan durham standing in front of him and decided you know what its not worth me shooting this and adding to his stat sheet and by the way the stat sheet is wrong juwan durham has five blocked shots we watched him get number five he does not have four and the stats have it wrong and that should not happen when hes at home theyve got to give him that fifth block shot or maybe theyre trying to preserve jordan cornetts record you think thats it i think maybe if you think a phone call was made late this afternoon i can see jordan cornett making the call saying hey guys anything thats questionable make sure you dont give it to him its got to be a clear block in fact even if it is a clear block because every one of them has been clear as day durham comes away with it again oh a nice give there but no basket they will wave that off 60 to 41 so well see if they revisit that we definitely have them at five but lets lets be honest jordan cornett is a charmer you know of of the first order so he may have worked his magic a little bit i i will i will give him that however jawan durham has five blocked shots and you know that because you are the notorious dob you know all things did you think that there was a way i was not gonna get that into this broadcast well i i had my hopes a new 10 minutes to play here in south bend shot clock a factor down to one and that shot off the iron he was able to get it off in time but it will not drop oh wake forest has been very cold the notre dame defense has had a little bit to do it look at the rebounding 23 for the fighting irish Music and the whistle stopping the clock at 902 in a foul wake forest just four out of 18 shooting the ball corey in the second half well its been a struggle for wake forest and it seems as though every time they got a good look especially around the rim jawan durham was there to block the shot so its been a struggle for wake forest in the second half after ending the first half shooting the basketball very well making six of their last eight shots in the first half but then coming out very cold here to start the second ryan lifts but that wont find mark he hasnt missed much in this one obama running right into a defender but a blocking foul on ryan with 8 48 to play here at purcell pavilion acc network college basketball on a tuesday night or do you call this an afternoon tip i mean five oclock the suns going down where i live but maybe not everywhere is it you know already pitch black as it is in new england at five oclock but i dont think we can call it night we probably just have to go tuesday evening you know yes because again its it is more like afternoon its its definitely light outside when we start but now you see that the sun is setting on the golden dome and thats a pretty nice set i mean you know i got to give them props for that one give our camera guys a lot of credit for coming up with that shot because uh how about how about that sight you know for the for the students who are returning to campus about 10 000 of them as mike bray said coming back to school coach bray said that theyve been pretty much in a mini bubble since november the 20th the semester ended before thanksgiving break so once everyones been home theyve been in their own mini bubble for about two months right now so coach bray is concerned about activity on campus once the students return and they will have inperson classes beautiful fine on the slam joe go make sure yeah this offense has clicked all night or afternoon dime that was a dime right there you look at notre dame the advantage of 28 18 points in the paint and they have shot the basketball very well here in the second half from beyond the arc but they still have continued to dominate the painted area with a midrange jumper will not fall and the irish trying to add on now as they have broken away kind of run away and hid here in the second half from the demon deacons up with a jumper got a free look but no obie this is what a healthy notre dame team is capable of and you see what theyve been able to do in this game this is what mike gray was expecting from this group they havent been healthy all year trey works wasnt eligible until after about the fourth or fifth game and then after playing one he sprains his ankle theyve had to deal with injuries to cormac ryan to jogo theyve had different guys in and out of the lineup but now that theyre healthy and mike bray has his rotation he feels as though this team is playing their best basketball of the season and its showing here this evening yeah they win tonight and thats four out of five and again a schedule thats going to be a little bit easier certainly than the first 10 or 12 games they played things looking up for the fighting irish here in the early days of february who knows how itll turn out massoud wont find a mark and a 23point lead in wake forest without a point in over four minutes yeah i think one of the more impressive things about this for notre dame so far is leshesky has not been much of a factor in this game and he has arguably been their best players but one of the better players in the acc this year they just keep pouring it on hes not been a big big factor in the game joko with another jumper to make it 6741 and yet theyre blowing out the demon deacons now with under six minutes to go and they have their biggest lead of the game yeah and as you mentioned you know theyve won three of their last four games and to be completely honestly hasnt been a huge factor in any of those but theyve been getting a more balanced attack and i believe thats what mike bray wants from this team i mean again nameless hes a great player but you dont want to have to depend on him to go get 25 and 28 for you to win games although he does get a nice easy dunk off of a beautiful find from apprentice hub and thatll take us to our break but right now notre dame firing on all cylinders Music do you have an idea for an invention but coming up on saturday of course mike ray there with coach k for a long stretch as a duke assistant they were pretty darn good acc champs in 9192 and 94 and mike ray learned so much under mike shashefsky and the glorious duke program that was my my first dealings with coach bray when he was an assistant coach at duke had a couple letters from him recruiting me when i was in high school but played against the 92 and 94 champions and mike gray great assistant went on of course to delaware and the strong career there which got him the opportunity to come and find his home in notre dame where hes been for the last 21 seasons but if theres anyone who has a game plan prepared to be able to beat the blue devils especially in durham its coach bray thats going to be an interesting time to see when they play duke after this weekends north carolina unc math end and duke matchup theres a goaltend here 447 to go and 6944 notre dame breaking away here in the second half take a look looking at if this is gold tending and you see the basketball is still above the cylinder as isaiah mucias goes and gets it and i mean again its at the front of the rim but its not i mean thats kind of interesting because you see it is still over top of the cylinder but its actually off of the rim by time it comes off he doesnt grab the basketball on the rim it has ricocheted off and they gave him three for that look my guy jeffrey had jeff got the cool run though i tell you what jeffrey andersons run back was cool theyre going to count that bucket but when you see it in slow motion it seems as though news took that after it ricocheted off the roof yes didnt look like it had any hope whatsoever of coming back the other way but counted for three 7244 williamson on the nifty drive again slams on the brakes and the kick out ucs will stick it from threepoint land a smart play by williamson on that as you mentioned earlier juwan durham has controlled the paint on both ends of the floor but defensively he has deterred wake forest from trying to challenge him at the rim but that time made the nice pass out to mucias to knock down the three juwon durham really got things rolling for the fighting irish in the opening minutes hes got a standout game and give him another basket and one as he will go right back to the foul line hes been able to do whatever he wanted on both ends of the court tonight thats it im sorry scraping snow and ice from your windshield in winter is such hard worked by geico you could save even more by bundling home and car insurance Music well notre dame rolling tonight here over wake forest 7447 and friday night coming up at 10 eastern we have our next bald men not on campus jay fonz and seth preview the acc slate of weekend games and the latest news from around the conference only on the acc network well our doubleheader continues carolina clemson still to come 7447 and the chesky has not been one of the men in double figures for notre dame so that tells you that a lot of things have been clicking for the fighting irish and not revolving around any one guy they really have leski the leading scorer for notre dame averaging 16 points per game but they havent needed his offensive production because of what juwan durham and his teammates have done for this group four fighting irish in double figures and leski not one of them theyve had a very balanced attack but when you look at what theyve been able to do with the basketball 17 assists to only five turnovers for notre dame in this game and you know wake forest hasnt turned the basketball over much they just havent been able to make shots especially in the second half carter whit hears that knocks down the long distance three but notre dame with a 25 point lead with some great shooting and grace sharing the basketball what theyve done here shooting 51 percent from the floor for this game durham 18 and 9 say this for le chesky though hes hit the glass he has 10 rebounds in this game so the really really good players they find other ways to help you dont they coming up next our doubleheader rolls on 11 and 5 north carolina taking on 10 and 5 clemson thatll be at seven oclock after our awardwinning postgame show anchored by corey alexander which is just around the corner thank you for signing me up for that were going to have some fun a little more i got a little more snow ive got to shovel here in new england so if you can take us to the top of the hour thatll be great cory i know youre gonna do it if thats the case then i would gladly be there to help you shovel snow now maybe we can chat with juwan durham and maybe several of his teammates this game has flown by i got to tell you it has i would love to talk to mike gray about should college coaches go back to wearing suits ah you know and thats something that you and i are both interested in and we should have asked that earlier today but maybe in our postgame coverage being that were going to have a little time to talk notre dame basketball maybe we should ask him about that you know its one of the one of the things you know about the colvin 19 period of college sports and a nice move inside by obama one thing thats affected is you know the relaxing of the socalled dress codes for for coaches not that theres a rule about that but a lot of guys for many many years of course not everybody but a lot of guys been wearing suits and well will steve forbes go back to wearing one or will will mike bray even buy a tie you know in his case i can tell you no thats not happening what about you know jay wright at villanova who is it always looks like not a million bucks like five million dollars and he has to have hundreds of thousands of dollars of suits and shoes and ties and and cufflinks you know in that closet what do you do with all that stuff jay wrights going to wear a suit again regardless as to whether they relax it or not jay wright will be back in a suit the thing for him and this year has been that he hasnt wanted to leave his his assistant coaches out but jay wright will be back in the suit mike bray will be all about no more suits lets coach the game the way we are mike grey wore shorts in january in chapel hill north carolina okay that man does not want any part of a suit and i agree with him wholeheartedly i dont think coaches should be asked nor required to wear suits while coaching basketball aguama with two i think youre right i think thats something that when its all over and it is good were all going to get vaccinated were going to get back to living our lives again and that means you know guys can dress the way they want to on the sidelines i guess you could now anyway but whats the point theres nobody in the stands to see you but i would i would think youre probably right about certain guys theyre going to forget about the old dress code and they like this relaxed look and feel and theyre going to continue it if we go back to many of the legendary coaches in college basketball you think bob knight never saw bob knight in the suit dont then when you think about louis fonda second lloyd carnesica wore the sweater bob huggins who right now believe his fourth or fifth all time and wins never seen bob huggins in the suit again he doesnt wear this i mean im sure he may have done it back in the day but now he does not wear the suit and notre dames alltime winning as coach hell put on the suit but hes not wearing the tie oftentimes hell go with the mock neck or whatever it may be but you know when you wear shorts in january in chapel hill id say that chapel hill is freezing but its not shorts weather you are a very casual laidback person and you do not want any parts of a suit in fact we are going to have coach bray in our post game spectacular so well cover a whole bunch of topics because mike is a fascinating guy and hes into a lot of different things i think its going to be really interesting to chat to even the off basketball stuff but hes got to be delighted with the way his team has played here tonight with a minute 11 to go its a nice way to welcome the students back to the campus at south bend with an impressive win here in this one and coming up acc womens hoops on thursday wake forest against su and then at 8 pm the number one team in the country louisville against boston college here on the acc network another scrap for the loose ball to the second half field goals notre dame 16 for 29 absolutely sizzling at wake forest well for a while there they couldnt buy one and shooting only 29 percent since the break kenobi one one of the areas that we see with notre dame they dont foul and so because they foul so a few times in the game only 10 fouls total in this game their games go so much faster where a normal college basketball game would take two hours we would most likely be done with this game you know in an hour and 40 hour 41 minutes so when you think about that and notre dame has led the country for the last six years and least fouls per game and so thats just a staple of program playing defense without fouling and they did a tremendous job of definition well for emphasis and a slam by zone coming off the bench matt zona the 69 freshman look at those bench points well everything at virtually every statistic in this game is soundly in notre dames corner but the bench points got started by cormac ryan coming in knocking down threes and remember notre dame didnt shoot the ball well to start this game they were over their first six threes until ryan knocked down that one and then after that they made six of their next 10 threepoint dribble hub with the layin right in front of the horn and that does it notre dame running away early in the second half and they win this one in blowout fashion 7958 durham with 18 points and nine rebounds ryan came in and dropped in 13 hub had a doubledouble 10 points in tennessee
