17 points a game Hes playing great over his last eight or nine He absolutely is 21 and a half points per game 51 rebounds But Obie most importantly 49 assist over those last eight games As you talk about Isaiah Wong becoming much more than just a scorer a facilitator as well Miami is a team that can shoot the ball 49 overall very good at the foul line and looking to beat that zone tonight of Jim Beahheim And we are underway as Miami wins the opening tip here in Coral Gables Oh by the way about 75° today You just rubbed it in That really hurts some people I realize that people jealous of you right now Oh yeah As well they should be Touch here for Jordan Miller 67 senior Hes going to go to work in the paint trying to get around Edwards did a nice job to get it up there Whenever you play against Syracuse its important to have that one guy that you know that you can put in the middle of that zone and win a oneonone matchup versus Jesse Edwards That time Jordan Miller puts his team on the board Syracuse lineup and Joe Gerard the leading scored about 17 points a game Mits will swing it here to Bell Chris Bell coming off an outstanding game 17 against Notre Dame Yeah And you see offensive rebound opportunity to put second chance points on the board unable to make it happen But thats something that you know Miami is used to giving up You look at a smaller lineup with Omir playing the center position at 67 giving away about four to five in to Jesse Edwards in the middle Norad Omir at 67 averaging 14 and 10 Hes been a big part of the engine for the Hurricanes Now Jim Larenego has 710 wins in his career Miller off target out of the corner and Jim a Naymith Hall of Fame nominee for the first time in his career Dump downstairs for Williams Hell lay it in and Syracuse moving the ball very well Nice interior passing of course Jesse Edwards with great hands off the pick and roll but keeping his head up finding Benny Williams who gets the easy one These two head coaches of course Jim Beaheim long since in the Hall of Fame are good pals and more than once Larengo on the Miami campus has been mistaken for Jim Beaheim And somebody might say Hey coach how come youre not in Circus right now How what what are you doing in Miami Well Jim Jim Larenega at one point had to actually borrow Jim Beheims pants to do a game in Syracuse That that actually happened Coach Lance or left his his wardrobe for the game So he actually went to Coach Beheim borrowed an outfit and of course Im pretty sure it was a navy blue blazer and some khaki I bet it was long and a foul on the play and his jumper but theyre great pals and Jim Beaheim 47 years credible run at Syracuse Of course Jim Larenega 39 years in his head coaching career So by comparison hes a baby Coach Beheim for those who have not really watched Jim Beheim and of course I cant imagine anyone thats a college basketball fan has not I mean you consider 47 years on the sideline the best lip read in the world You have to keep a camera on Jim Beheim at all times because when you get an opportunity to read his lips as hes talking to his players his staff it is some of the best commentary you will ever see in TV So Beahheim cam is coming here to the ACC Network Foul is on Gerard by the way Juan goes to the line and makes it 52 Miami and the Canes with pressure and thrown away So it works perfectly It works perfectly and thats one of the keys for Miami Get the basketball out of the hands of Judah Mintz make others make a play and just like that Benny Williams with the turnover will have a opportunity to go talk to Jim Beheim on the sideline immediately And coach Beayheims 47 years in still teaching Thats one thing I can really appreciate Coaching his guys up still teaching very involved in everything Syracuse related Malik Browns been playing really well The youngster gets in there quickly Poppler up top Cant drain that off the back iron The other thing about Jim Behind remains the same Its a quick hook Oh yeah Yeah Again when you when youre that guy and again that Benny Williams has been that guy as of late especially with Malik Brown playing as well as he has you can get that quick hook But one thing I will give Coach Beheim he gives you another opportunity Edwards boy tough shot there Very well defended Here comes Wong in transition And again over the last eight games hes averaging 22 Way downtown and swished in Nigel Pack on target I should say zone I tell you what if youre shooting it from that far away the zone is going to be extended Nigel Pack dialing one up That might have been from Coconut Grove Dump downstairs and off the fingertips of Edwards and out it goes and a Syracuse turnover Mint coming off a really good game Very steady game against Notre Dame He had 14 points had eight or nine assists Played very well Yeah he did the majority of his damage late in that game scores seven points in a crucial stretch to come back in that win against Notre Dame And hes really maturing as a basketball player as Jordan Miller wins the second matchup in the middle of that painted area He had a standout game when Miami beat NC State here back in December at 25 but he held a 13 over the weekend and their overtime defeat Bell gives up the dribble and thats going to be deflected off the foot of Edwards and out it goes And another to0 the third turnover already for Syracuse in this game So if youre Jim Largo youre happy to see that the turnovers are not going against you but this time in your favor and thats never going to be to the delight of Jim Behind Man thats a lot of victories on the sideline here tonight Coral Gables huh It absolutely is And of course 710 for Jim Larenga and I count 1111 for my guy Jim Beheim I know what the official tab says but youre not alone there by the way A lot of people feel that way Had a whistle and a foul underneath That was with eight on the shot clock About four minutes in here And Miami looking sharp early on top 10 to two The foul will go on Edwards and his second foul as a team And thatll put Omir at the line Former Sunb Belt player of the year at Arkansas State and he has posted backto back 13 point 13 rebound games And give Jim Larenega and his staff a lot of credit what theyve done through the transfer portal Not only bringing in guys but bringing in guys that fit into the way that they play and being able to get these guys integrated early enough to have success in the nonconference and be playing great basketball once they get to ACC play Its to get it across half court Harassed by Wong Hell commit the foul try to reach in So well take the timeout under 16 112 Miami off to a quick start And its a nine nothing run right now Subway keeps upping their game with

addicting Making some money I can spend keep my wardrobe fresh Welcome back Its a comfortable 72 degrees here in Coral Gables and Miami Even hotter on the inside as theyre up nine Between these two teams its been a battle even going back to their previous time in the Big East and even now in the ACC To revisit last years matchup Miami was down in both games by as many as 18 points but still got the win So the tell of the tape may be a little different or similar for both teams but their rosters are a bit different However Syracuse said in order for them to get some different results this time around it starts with their transition D They have to do a a better job of that and also forcing tougher threes They also noted Jesse two points versus them last year So no doubt his undersized Canes will have to make an adjustment to his length and presence on the inside Another foul here Theyll pick up Wong with his second personal just about a minute and a half You see Angel she doesnt mind mentioning its 72 Its Bobby Pretty sure she spent a little time at the pool today prepping for the game She doesnt mind to do that She spent some time with you Both you guys are rubbing it in to our audience that were hanging out here in the 72 degrees today I I brought my Miami Vice type of attire I have the pink pants Its just really nice outside Why would you want to freeze I left the trench coat at home So right It may be colder getting back I didnt just you know pack in regards to that but Im excited to have this very beautiful weather Now see OB you saw Angel left us out She brought her Miami Vice pants but she didnt tell us So whos crocketing Whose tubs I mean somebody got to let us know about this Thats that might be for most of our audience a reference from way too far back Huh Syracuse by the way with a messy start Six or seven possessions Already three turnovers Yeah The only basket for the Orange in this game thus far from Benny Williams who is no longer in the game But another offensive rebound Malik Brown picking up one giving Syracuse another opportunity Judah Mintz to the paint took a little contact and that one swatted away Tough sledding in that lane Popppler and company Syracuse coming in 12 and six five and two in the ACC But they have been a team on the ascent They absolutely have winning nine of their last 11 games And this team gets so much production from freshman that theyre different now because these freshman are starting to mature starting to grow up especially including the guy with the ball in his hands Shot clock down to three Mint launches that He had to get it up there Another scrap for the rebound and itll go the other way That is off Syracuse Or is it off Miami Its going to be off of Miami So itll be Syracuse ball My guy Keith Kimell hit you with the look away He was pointing with the right arm but he was moving with the left arm Thats what got me I was with you OB I was thought thinking it was going the other direction Yeah that could have been clearer Edwards in contact fighting for his own miss and Miami comes away with it We talked about Edwards with the height advantage but when you talk strengthwise I believe Omir definitely has the advantage over there Jesse Edwards having a difficult time moving him when he catches the basketball on the block Nigel Pac makes 36 of his threepointers Hes drained one from the logo at the start of this game Joseph in and thrown away Picked off by Bell Bell skyward mince there and before the shot a foul on the floor But this is Syracuse basketball turning defense into offense Syracuse since coming into the ACC of course has stayed at the top of the league in steals And Bell getting out in transition unable to finish But Syracuse will maintain possession on this But you know its been a tough setting for the Orange already in this game Struggling from the field to put points on the board Vince has it stripped and it comes right to the big guy Hea And hell dunk that But Judamance continues to stay aggressive trying to get downhill That time is aggressiveness Its allowed Hea to get that dunk Another one coming and this one wont go for Pack Jim Beheim going to his bench Heres one of those guys and Malik Brown getting all the way to the other end quickly for the strike But the nice find from Simir Torrrent checking in replacing Joe Gerard the third So you see a more defensive lineup at the top of the zone for the Orange right now and turning some of that defense into offense on the other end And Gerard coming off a very cold shooting day Boy tough shot underneath there by Omir Had to adjust a couple of times Couldnt get it to drop Heres Torrance Wants to drive it Gives it up for Brown Off the iron It was up there hanging and would not fall and tipped out by Syracuse Applause You see off the rebound Syracuse looking to run Simir Torrance coming up with the re with the rebound and finding Malik Brown Perfect spot for his teammate to be able to finish it off Fast break points for the Orange And just like that they made it a fivepoint game in OBU Were watching Jim Behind play differently than they played over the last few seasons More guys in the rotation for this years team From the corner Joseph lets fly And another whistle here with 1258 to go in the first half And Miami on top 11 to six The foul here against the Canes And thatll be on Omir set some big games this season Put up 19 and 12 against Providence College Its a real nice win for the Hurricanes against a good PC team Absolutely was a good nonconference for the Canes and a great start of course at ACC play getting off to a 40 start but losing two of their last three games trying to get that winning momentum back here on at home M jumping inside wont go for him Miami trying to strike quickly on the other end and the foul as Walker went up 69 junior out of Baltimore and fouled by Torrance And one of the things I love about what has happened in Miami Anthony Walker has had so many different roles during his tenure with the Canes Youre talking about a guy at one point was a starter was going out averaging double figure points Now hes a reserve In most scenarios this is someone who would have been in the transfer portal a year ago but he stuck with the program stuck with the plan now playing a role for Jim Larenega and I applaud a young man who sticks it out and basically now has opportunity to be was on a winning team last year had opportunity to go to the Elite 8 and now an opportunity this year as well on a very good Miami team And last year tied for the voting lead for second I should say the ACC sixth man of the year see the trapping and trying to get the basketball out of the hands of the point guard Bell will let fly And boy they love his shooting touch Yeah hes been a guy thats really kept them in games as of late shooting 50 from three in ACC play Came into the game 11 for 22 in his seven ACC games so far Hes one of those players Jim Beahheim is telling Shoot it shoot it shoot it Hes truly a great shooter Boy you watch him in practice in warmups like this Oh missfiring on that one But he is just outstanding Tell you what you got to have a green light to come down and take that shot Thats Joe Gerard type shot Once again Pack on target from threepoint land Maybe I should say Nigel Pack type shot Yes as Pack knocks down his second three here in this first half I had 21 against Notre Dame so he can light it up Gerard back in Justin Taylor getting ready to check in for coach Beheim Gerard nice move there to drop in two Thats a vet move right there Joe Gerard is not going to hide the size advantage over over many players that he plays against in this ACC but he has it over pack and takes advantage of it getting into the post area Coming off just seven points against Notre Dame but hes had some great shooting games against Miami Hell launch that one but that wont drop for Gerard But he has that type of freedom from Jim Beheim to be able to take that shot and he takes it confidently Pack gives it up for Popppler averaging about eight points a game Miami moving it trying to get it downstairs And well done there to get it in the hands of Omir for two And you can see Omir whos undersized in the painted area understands how to use angles and use his body to be able to finish over much taller defenders Gerard directing traffic He was looking for a screen Torrance on the baseline and he will take the hit and be at the line for two Will take the break but about 10 minutes to go in the half Well the climate is nice So guys are starting to find the range here Coral Gables Chris Bell finding the range from three And on the other end of the floor Nigel Pack knocking down the three ball from the top of the key Gatorade Fit Fitness starts from the inside out Music Get healthy real hydration and no added sugar artificial sweeteners or added colors Music Gatorade Fit Healthy

road is paying off with Drivewise Boring Get Drive from all state and save for avoiding mayhem in on the moment From popping papa trays in the driveway to getting buckets on the court All in on the ACC in the conference that raises and the teams that shape us We are all in for all time Come for it all Miami at home up 1811 on Syracuse Nigel Pack for the Canes Big reason why he has a hot hand Hes also two points away from a thousand He absolutely is is and Jim Larenega told us earlier today when his staff goes out recruiting especially with guards they tell their guards Hey when you come to Miami Coach L gives you a lot of freedom Coach L calls it a lot of responsibility And I can appreciate that Hes had a number of guys come in at that point guard position whove had immediate success Angel Rodriguez of course a year ago Charlie Moore and Nigel Pack coming in this year performing extremely well Samir Torrance rattles that one in Well this guys done a great job here Jim Larenga Just an amazing job in Miami Its a challenge for college basketball to get a foothold here with all the professional and cultural distractions This is an exotic playground here But you consider hes won 20 or more seven times in 11 years here All four of Miamis 25 win seasons have come under Larenga Five of his 11 NCAA bids right here five of Miamis three of the four Sweet 16s went to the Elite 8 last year Thats all since he got here to Coral Gables And now that hes got Coral Gables and 111 ACC wins he is the only coach in division one basketball history to have over 100 conference wins in three different conferences So you think about that youre talking about one of the best to ever do it Oh nice scramble effort there by Gerard huh Spinning on the seat of his pants But as a senior Joe Gerard understands how important every possession is for his team You see getting on the floor after the basketball And again what you have to do at that point is reward a guy like that Make sure you get him a shot Sure Syracuse was cold out of the gate They missed eight out of nine Theyre heating up now This Williams sticking that one But this is what I love Benny Williams who we talked about he got the quick hook early from Jim Beheim They had a conversation on the bench Benny Williams is back in the game Coach Beheim sticking with his guys coaching him up with confidence Vinnie Williams comes back in as productive as soon as he steps back on the floor Miller nice move there to get free for two Jordan Miller the senior from Middberg Virginia You know where that is up No I know Middberg very well and can tell you right now Jordan Miller has been very productive in the middle of that zone So Middberg is a great name for a hometown for him Edwards with the save flips it into the back court for Taylor Crowd wanted an over in the back there and that should be the case and it was Thatll be a turnover Well hey coming up Thursday night womens basketball takes on the ACC Network This week NC State hosting Miami at 6 Eastern Then the rivalry match up between Duke and North Carolina Should be another good night for womens college basketball in ACC Network and the ESPN app See that Duke Carolina matchup number 13 number 17 in the country And of course our friend Carol Lawson going on the road into Carmichael at Chapel Hill but Cars done a great job with the resurgence of that Duke basketball program Took over a tough time with the Blue Devils Got it going her way now Pack again Cant drain this one Big rebound from Miller Theyll get a second chance Wong out of the corner and a rebound grab by Edwards who averages 11 a game And Jim Lenega getting Isaiah Wong back on the floor with those two fouls So trusting his senior to make sure he doesnt pick up that third Nice feed for the slam inside for Edwards and two And how about the basic fundamentals of Jesse Edwards catching it keeping it high where only where the guards cant affect it Quick dump for the two points Nothing flashy but very effective Last six or seven minutes Syracuse has played a lot better than Miami Yeah part of the reason why they made this a twopoint game Now four with the Walker jump shot in the middle But Miami having success when they get the basketball into that middle of that zone A long one out at the 1252 mark with that second foul They were leading 11 to2 at the time Has tightened up considerably And another whistle with 727 to go in the half And the foul will go against Benny Williams Pick and roll to perfection Joe Gerard is going to get a lot of attention when he has the basketball in his hands as Benny Williams finds Jesse Edwards over the top The easy bucket for two Has this ever happened to you How was school Fine Whatever Oh no not again Eliminate that frustrating

hot as a firecracker 70 and finally theyre ranked I would say were all late on that one I would believe so You think about Brad Brownell has to be the front runner for ACC coach of the year Having a great season thus far Hunter Tyson averaging a double double for the Clemson Tigers Three teams in the AP top 25 Virginia Miami and Clemson And Tquavon Smith NC State leading the ACC in scoring And for those who have not seen Juvian he is mustsee TV Yeah Jim Larenga will tell you that after the encounter Miami had with NC State on Saturday He thinks their back court is spectacular Heres Pack again and maybe cooling off a little bit for the Hurricanes They lead it 2218 Now well see if Joe Gerard gets going He was just two for nine in the Notre Dame game but hes had a lot of great games Thats going to be goalending So count that basket Not sure how Miami continues to lose Jesse Edwards in the painted area Had a careerhigh 22 a season ago against the Canes And Jim Larenegger talked a lot about him in their shootound today So Im not sure how he keeps getting an opportunity to get these easy buckets in the middle Tough to lose a guy 611 Yeah Miller nifty feed and the slam out of the sky by Beverly Harland Beverly And this is a guy that you have to root for Dealt with injuries over the past couple of seasons Had a very good first year at Miami Now back in the rotation playing great basketball for Coach L And another one of those guys who stuck with the plan Didnt move on because things werent going his way Yeah Miamis last home game He had 15 against BC Edwards marching into that paint but no And Beverly with the board Miami defeated Syracuse twice last season each time rallying from 18 points down to win the game Yeah So this one is never over Its one thing for certain Mint Snuck it in there Draws the foul Boy he had a tiny sliver of a window to get that in there But they dont get much more aggressive and athletic at the point guard position than do they do with Judah Mintson You see getting out in transition hes going to win most of these battles the ability to hang in the air change sides of the basket and the concentration to still finish Very impressed with Judah and what hes been able to do thus far for the Orange in the Orange Threepoint play Let me ask you about Judah Mitz now Tremendously gifted Everybody knew that coming into Syracuse Is he a one and done I hope that he stays in Syracuse I think this Syracuse team could be great next year not just really good great next year if theyre able to keep all their guys especially if you get Joe Gerard and Jesse Edwards taking advantage of that co year and coming back as Justin Taylor lines up the three knocks it down and the first lead for the Orange But to answer your question it would not surprise me if he put his name in the NBA draft Syracuse just jumped in a lead Nobody in Syracuse New York wants to hear that conversation right now I get that Yes Yes Mhm But I think you are going to hear it from time to time moving forward Well and I say that because he is an NBA player No question about that Its simply about when does he become an NBA player I think it would serve him perfectly to do another year in college and become more familiar with the point guard role and also work on the shooting Only shooting about 18 from three in in ACC play right now So of course has a lot of areas to develop Meanwhile Syracuse has all the momentum right now in Miami And thats going to be banked in by Gerard Hell be at the line for a threepoint play Everything going the Orange way right now An eight nothing run And JG3 is playing bully ball right now Hes got the size match up on Nigel Pack and he is taking advantage of it Moves Benny Williams out of the post area and just goes to the block Goes to work Gets the hoop the harm and opportunity for the and one I think that is the essence of a veteran move right there It is that and again he he plays a vet game I love the way Joe Gerard has approached this season Jim Beha moving him off the basketball taking away the point guard responsibilities putting those in the hand of Judah Mintz allowing Joe Gerard to be the scorer that he is So its SU on top 2924 Beverly outside shot clock down to 11 And crosscourt theyll swing up top for Wong An open look Got an excellent excellent look but could not bury the shot Trying to stay hot Heres Taylor but no Hes hitting 39 The freshman from threepoint land on the run Nice strike there by Beverly Yeah quick getting out Benley Joseph on the break getting out in transition and an easy bucket for Miami The buckets have been hard to come by as of late Jim Larenega getting to see one go down for his team in transition Threepoint lead here for Syracuse Edwards wants to attack Heres Williams on the baseline Shot clock a factor now down to four Gerard going around the back Look at this Big time contact No whistle there It did get the iron A fight for it and a foul Gerard wondering why there was no whistle on the play Jim Larenga of course the Naymith Hall of Fame nominee His surprise announcement and this is a classic bit when we come back Im a screen addicted tween and if Im not posting on social media I dont feel seen Oh my god Mom you got to look No Keeping my eyes on the road is paying off with drive wise Boring Get drive wires from all state and save for

first time nominee We love you Okay Applause Hey is that a joke or is that true Hey I just cant tell you how proud I am of you Youve always been a Hall of Fame coach Hall of Fame father to me and I hope you and mom just really enjoy this special day Love you Hey Poppy Just want to say congrats on being nominated for the Nick Smith Basketball Hall of Fame Im so proud of you and how hard you work and consider myself so lucky to be your granddaughter I love and miss you so much and congratulations again Coach L I never would have guessed when we were in the PE building filming the scrambled defense for championship books and videos with the riff raff that coach Courtney brought in to help us that 25 years later you would be a nment hall of fame first time nominee So congrats are definitely in order for coach Larenega I thought it was very special Dave you mentioned just how he has impacted this program His 720 plus win seasons Thats the most by any Miami coach and over a third of the programs total So when youre looking at the numbers that stands out as a great and a huge deal to him however its how he impacts his athletes And I thought it was very interesting while we were at shootaround today He is still a true teacher of the game and still has a heavy emphasis on development of his players They were doing rebounding drills throwing the ball off of the glass He said sometimes he even puts a bubble on the rim just to make sure that they understand the importance of rebounding So just continues to teach and grow the game Yeah And thats just not done by very many coaches Not not during shootound No its absolutely not And again he wants to continue to teach the fundamentals of course as he learned from his great coach at Arc Bishop Mallaloy Jack Kuran who has passed but very proud of coach Larenega and coach Larenega very proud to be an Archbishop Malloy alum and is thats one of the things that hes carried with him throughout his entire career And again I can remember 12 years ago everyone saying Jim Larenga took this job in Miami to come down here and retire right And there has been nothing but the opposite of that Youre talking about that was a big miss Yeah it was a it was a very big miss And uh he has truly you know transformed this program into a powerhouse outside of a couple of injuryplagued years right This has been one of the premier programs in the ACC Fifth winningest program in the ACC during his tenure and of course winning an ACC championship and tournament as well Taylor with a foul to put Wugga Popppler at the line Legal name is Na Scene but he prefers the nickname his grandma gave him Syracuse on top 3128 More pressure here by the Canes and across to Gerard Applause So coming up on the twominute mark back door cut Thats going to be tipped by Miami So itll be orange basketball Got to give Syracuse a lot of credit Jim Beahim going to his bench early in this game after being down 112 the bench bringing his team back going to a much larger rotation than weve seen from him the past few seasons and it working well for the Orange Edwards going to work on Anthony Walker and draws the foul And Saturday college basketball we got a double header coming your way Matt Cleveland leading FSU against Pit in our first game at 330 Then its off to the Smith Center for North Carolina and NC State shapes up as a great afternoon of college basketball right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app Edwards makes 69 at the line The senior NC State at UNC on Saturday Both teams could score over 100 points Youre talking about fastpaced getting up and down basketball and always a rivalry when those two teams get together And I think we were both very impressed to see Armando Bacott come back on a bad ankle and I thought with a lot of courage play real well against Louisville the other day Had a double double in about 5 minutes Yeah And talking to Mondo he basically made it very clear how important of a game that was for his team coming off the loss at Virginia and three and three in the ACC as Harland Beverly is able to get inside the zone for another midrange bucket But you know he made it very clear they needed that game Thats why he played I mean he played through the pain but he knew how important it was for his team to get a win at Louisville Syracuse by three and a foul on Beverly whos made a nice impact in this game since coming off the bench for Larenga You really watching two master head coaches going to work here It is fun watching these guys compete against each other You know Ive sat down and talked with both of them about when they competed as players not in college but actually in kind of a wreck league once they were finished playing And they still have that same level of competitive fire on the sidelines 47 And how many years has coach Elvin been doing this 39 And 39 years later 12 here at Miami Yeah 39 years as as a head coach Of course that didnt take into account the assistant coaching years at University of Virginia before he became the head coach at Bowling Green Mince a little short on a couple Syracuse meanwhile three turnovers in the first four minutes just one since then So big time change and a major reason they lead by three So under 90 seconds to go before halftime here at Coral Gables Walker from the corner No Miami crashing the glass hard and torn away by Edwards Yeah the ACCs leading rebounder 11 a game being able to get the rebounds that everyone cant get to Bell cant connect One and done that time for the Orange As we come up on one minute to go and one on a tough drive there Applause Watson coming off the bench and hell head to the line And yeah Christian Watson getting out in transition Strong finish from the young man out of St Johns College Prep in Washington DC getting his first minutes in the game and making it count for Coach L giving him an opportunity here tonight Mintz with a foul with exactly a minute to go before the break and one shot for Watson with the students in the house They just got back to class 3332 Well its been an entertaining first half It has that Weve seen a couple of lead changes in this one and guys going back and forth Very competitive first half in this game leading up to what I think will be an exciting finish Gerard trying to get that one to go and he does Well its the second time hes made a play like that and his third post play his third finish but the second time hes gotten fouled on the opportunity for the and one And Joe Gerard this time hes going up against a guy that is that has the same size Benley Joseph the same size as Gerard but Gerard not concerned about that Still able to get Benley in the air and finish through the contact and makes the threepoint play to put SU on top 3632 Gerards made a big difference Applause Coming off a cold game but usually has very good games against Miami but hes done his damage closer to the basket in this game Often times if youre struggling with the jump shot thats the best route to go Smart plays by Joe Gerard 8sec split in the game and shot clock on the spin and Walker will draw the foul been a solid contributor off the bench here in Miami over the years And thatll go against Justin Taylor number two And Walker does not get to the line very often Only six foul shots this year He is four for six though Both these coaches using their benches in this game Impressive to see not only the coaches having the trust and the confidence in their players to be able to go out and produce but more importantly the guys on the sidelines that may not always get those opportunities staying ready for when their numbers call The junior from Baltimore makes the pair twopoint lead Shot clock is off Mint across midcourt They run it for Gerard Hell bounce here for Edwards down the lane Got it to go What a pretty play and it will not get a shot away Got to the backboard but would not have counted anyway Syracuse 10 and one this season went winning or tied at halftime and they had the lead against number 17 Miami at the break 3834 Syracuse after a rather sloppy start really tighten things up and looked good down the stretch of the half Second half coming up half heroics the majority of his career here at the U So no surprise if he still goes off and gets above 20 points to average what hes been doing over the past eight games Yeah last eight averaging 22 a game shooting 53 38 from three Theyre going to need him here as the second half gets underway here at Coral Gables Syracuse with the ball up by four Mince going over the top and a big time slam by Edwards and great execution out of the halftime locker room and Jim Larenga does not like that and its a simple play making sure that you help on the back screen Got to make sure you take care of your business Miami unable to do so downstairs and the big fella getting loose at 67 with that big body 4036 Syracuse Mince giving up the dribble Williams straight on He buried a triple Remember Benny Williams got yanked out of the game early after making the only field goal in the game for Syracuse Hes been a different guy since he he really has The quick conversation with coach Beheim Sit down think about it for a little while come back in aggressive Oh miss with a quick hand with the theftton He will not get the layin There is a foul after that though which will go against Miami Applause Mint also thought he was fouled on the play They get Wong for number three I do believe they did get Wong for number three on the trying to get the rebound Benny Williams hustling in as Judah Mchz felt like he got fouled but Isaiah Wong picking up that third foul right there Interesting to see how aggressive he can be Playing with three still with 19 minutes remaining here in this second half Right Could be the major story in this game Their top scorer and a man who makes them go in deep foul trouble Joe Gerard going back to the post He knows he has that advantage over Nigel Pack A nice find inside Edwards with the finish So Gerard doing a little bit of everything Syracuse starting to look a little comfortable here They really are They found something with Joe Gerard being aggressive in the post area Then again dont let Pack get a good look from around the logo And Nigel Pack goes over 1000 points for his career knocking down the three Well have to call that logo range I believe he was standing in the U on that one Gerard trying to answer Applause Well see if Wong can start to get rolling here Hes not been able to do it Popppler cut loose off the back iron Applause He does have good shooting range Syracuse up 4539 Heres Bell Bell on Popppler Shot clock inside 10 Gerard No whistle there and drops it in I love the no call on that one Doug Shas right on top of that Saw all the action Jim Larenega doesnt like it but I can appreciate the fact that there was no call on that one Also was not called a flop which could have happened True Omir going in strong and a blocking foul as Edwards hit the deck Joe Gerard using his body Thats not enough contact for that result There was contact so therefore not going to be a flop but I can respect the no call on that Great job by officiating crew here tonight on a number of these plays Doug Shows Doug Surmans and Keith Kimble the crew tonight Foul number two on Edwards by the way who has done a great job this season of staying out of foul trouble in comparison to years past fouled out of three games this year which of course have all been losses for the Orange but understanding how he has to play much smarter Theyre going to get offensive foul on Jordan Miller who took the brunt of that punishment Thats his first You see Miller walking away He got hit up high whether it was in the throat but Judah Mitch does a great job trying to fight over the screen And you see Miller sticking out that left arm that left leg causing the contact getting the offensive foul Applause Music Gerard inside that foul line for two more Hes played that game all night to perfection Hey he would be balling in the 35 and over league right now Obie That is 35 and overish And that has been the you know the recipe for success for Joe Gerard in this game Hes doing pretty well in the 18 to 22 Thats swished in by Wong Nice touch there Man do they need him Yeah it doesnt take much for him to get going but right now with Joe Gerard picking on Nigel Pack on this end of the floor I wouldnt be shocked if we see Jim Larenegger go to a zone at some point Nice feed there Edwards will take the hit Foul against Miami Back to that shot by Wong Yeah Miamiys leading scoreer Isaiah Wong His first field goal on the day knocking down the three ball And again hes a young man weve seen have 20 plus point halves throughout his career at Miami So would not be surprised if he goes over 20 in this game after only having the three free throws in the first half Miller putting Edwards to the line Jesse Edwards he gets fouled a lot Makes 69 of his free throws 1626 remaining here And Syracuse on top 50 to 42 Took them a little while to get going About five or six minutes but theyve been playing very well since then since that point of the first half And Edwards makes the pair What happened to the days of the big men from Syracuse not being able to make free throws cuz you would go back when we were watching Syra Well you were actually at Syracuse then but I was watching Syracuse on TV the big time battles against Georgetown and they the Achilles heel was always a free throw line Sure was Yeah Guards could always shoot him Yes Thankfully I say that as a Syracuse alum back then Thats going to be tipped up and in by Miller Got up high in the sky And when you are able to bring Jesse Edwards away from the basket you have those opportunities to offensive rebound Mr Edwards says hello with a onehanded slam Hes found the rhythm here to start this second half Started with the lob out of the t out of the halftime locker room Great design from Jim Beheim and got his confidence going on the offensive end Its a really nice twoman game going between Gerard and Edwards isnt there It absolutely is And Gerard in complete control of this game attacking Nigel Pack showing off his strength fires up the long one that wont drop Applause in transition Miller attacks Great defense by Edwards The follow on two occasions will not go Big fight for the rebound Miami comes away with it Heres Popppler He cant connect from the corner Syracuse going hard for the rebound And off the fingertips Joe Gerard in complete control here in the second half If hes not taking it to the block hes finding his teammates The find to Jesse Edwards with the finish who has found his way here in

Syracuse right now outscoring Miami 15 to 10 in this half Well the nation continues to celebrate the legacy of Dr Martin Luther King Jr who just did so much for the black community to ensure the basic human and civil rights for all But we have to acknowledge also what he did right here in the city of Miami This was the first city to have an MLK Day parade Theres a an amazing statue of Dr King at the MLK Memorial Park right outside of Miami And the historic Hampton House was a place where many great civil rights leaders were also able to stay during the segregated South era But I thought it was very interesting too talking with coach Larenega He started his shoot around sharing his favorite Dr King quote to whom much is given much is required And he told his team if you arent aware of the impact of Dr King you need to Google him because he did a lot for us today No question Inside its once again Edwards working on a big one 18 points eight rebounds and Angel you know weve talking with coach L earlier today and I have used that quote often I had no idea that it was from Dr Martin Luther King So I learned something today just from the standpoint of and we talked with coach Lar Negan He talked about his love of history as you have the same Dave OBrien I know youre a history buff You two share that and he talked about his love for history and of course growing up in the era as to which Malcolm Im sorry well he loves Malcolm X but also Martin Luther King was performing the majority of his speeches and his preaching and he talked about growing up during that time and how much of an impact it had on him as well Miller great feed there and a vicious slam by Omir Talk about making sure he certainly did The benchman spectacular plays really on both sides in this one as we come up on 14 minutes to go Mince just lost it Lost control of that Beverly will scoop up and a whistle and a foul as Wong got hit Back to the dish and a dunk a moment ago Jordan Miller attacking the paint and Omir attacking the rim on that finish As you mentioned left no doubt on that one Omrir with a strong finish Taylor with his third foul Wong at the line Hes usually very good 83 And Taylor will take a seat And Malik Brown back on now for Jim Beaheim Wongs been here a long time since 2019 top 10 all time in scoring at Miami I believe that Isaiah Wong also is a true senior however So he could be one of those guys who could come back next year Youre correct And use that co year Im sure Jim Larenegger wouldnt mind keeping him around for another year Yeah would bet Williams got it up there rebound tipped right to him He put it to the deck and another collision and Miami getting after Williams but another foul on the play Thats one thing that Larenga talked about with Angel at halftime He doesnt like his team committing as many fouls as they have And that one will go against Joseph his second But that foul was a result of Benny Williams playing hard even after missing the shot Going back after it getting the offensive rebound Edwards rolling seeking contact Jumper by Williams Got it to go Benny Williams on the money Quick conversation with Benny Williams pregame Simply talk to him about being consistent Thats one of the things that Jim Beahim and I talked about with Benny Williams over the past two seasons And not just being consistent in games being consistent in practice every day being that same guy that he know that he can trust and rely on Zipped inside for Omir Yes Chad Omir the sophomore from Nicaragua In fact the first person from Nicaragua to earn a division one basketball scholarship at any school Now that is history I like that nugget right there my friend Thats why youre the notorious K going downstairs Comes right back to him Hes had a big night so far Relentless here Left it short Williams comes away with it Gerards the open shooter Thats in and out In transition They move it to Beverly Oh he lost the handle on it He had a lay in on the play And now Syracuse commits the foul with 1219 to go Hey coming up every Thursday night womens basketball takes center stage on ACC Network This week NC State will take on Miami at 600 Eastern

the presence so far He absolutely has been that And Jim Larenega talked to us about Jesse Edwards He mentioned he thought he had a careerhigh on them a year ago which he did 22 points Hes tied that careerhigh this season But right now with 1210 remaining 18 points already for Jesse Edwards Doesnt look like hes slowing down He could see another careerhigh against the against the U here tonight One back in Miami led 112 early in the game but then Syracuse took the lead at the 529 mark They have led ever since Rebound comes free to men Great action right there for coach L out of the timeout with the option to throw the lob to Wong Not taking that Got a good look for Walker on the interior Vince will lean in way short Theyll battle for the rebound and another foul and Edwards going to

legendary coaches going deep into their benches in this game For Syracuse all nine players that have entered the game have scored And for Miami eight of the 10 players that have played have got their name in the book from the scoring standpoint So when you look at both these two coaches who arent traditionally known for playing you know large rotations both getting a lot of guys in action and those guys showing up being productive here this evening mentioned Jesse Edwards second half 10 points hes made four out of five the difference maker for the orange and Miami turns it over again and right now coach Larenga beside himself you know when you come out of a timeout and turn it over right there thats the coachs worst nightmare especially when you spend all the time drawing up something you want to get executed coaches go we practice that we practice it over and over heres Williams in and outs and a rebound by Omir here So Miami trying to make a run with 11 minutes to go here on their home floor Beverly catches fires That was rather ugly off the hand but another rebound by Omir and probably should have shot the ball and they turn it over Yeah two close of quarters right there to backto back turnovers for Miami But as you mentioned Omir that close to the basket you got to take your chances is a guy that averages 14 points per game and hes as strong as anyone on the floor Take your chances trying to get that on the rim if you can get a bucket or maybe even get fouled Music Miamis been consistent with the pressure on Judah Mitch trying to mix up the times when they trap him or when they allow him to bring the basketball across half court freely Gerard around and back off the fake Heres Williams No but the follow is good again But guess who Edwards continues to have a big night but thats it right there Obie Even though Benny Williams doesnt make that shot he puts Jesse Edwards in a position to get the second chance opportunity If Omir does that on the other end of the floor Walker gets that opportunity Two points for the Orange that Miami could have used on the other end Music Ever wonder why they call it the American dream and not the American goal or plan Maybe its because in dreams you can do anything In dreams you can hold your entire world in the palm of your hand and turn time inside out again and again And you can do it all with your eyes wide open Heres the AP top 10 fresh off the presses today with Houston number one at 171 And whos that at number 10 Oh by the way you see what I did there I actually you you practice that They teach you that in Virginia They do They do Get it in whenever you can But number 10 and 13 and three Kansas the number two team in the country Theyre going to wave that off Interference with it So no basket Yeah And that was going in So thats one Omir just patting his chest saying my fault And I love it when I was coaching and having guys say my fault And I would just look at them and say I know you did it And then theres no question about whose fault it was Yeah Its also on television Weve got replay Music Gerard tough shot Cant get that to go But those opportunities he should not get against Harlem Beverly who has the size advantage over Gerard Beverly doing a great job staying down defensively denying Gerard that opportunity Long feeding Omir slamming on the brakes back up top for the guard He will penetrate try to get inside and plenty of contact there as hell draw the foul That was with seven to shoot 5951 Syracuse So a mark of a great score the ability to get to the free throw line Thats one of the things we see from Isaiah Wong He spends a lot of time at the free throw line Thats a very good thing for Miami because he usually makes him Bell with his second personal foul We talk about the tear that Isaiah Wong has been on over the last eight games close to 22 points per game But the field goal percentage the rebounds but most importantly the assist per game Thats really where hes grown as a player Not just looking for his opportunities but being able to facilitate as well Applause Gerard nearly lost the handle on it Im not sure why Gerard was so set on getting it to Edwards Oh look at Edwards going inside Follows his own miss and thats going to be Syracuse ball He tried to call a timeout Jordan Miller airborne there Tried to call a timeout Now I can remember years ago I believe the rule was taken away to where you could not do that right You couldnt you werent awarded a timeout Keith Kimell right on top of that Theres a time you could though Yes it before then you could I think they took that away in college basketball Mintz against Joseph who gives chase now They want Edwards again off the fake Yes And if my memory serves me correctly that also ties a careerhigh once again for Jesse Edwards at 22 points Also a ninth double double for him this season with 22 points against Miami year ago also against Notre Dame earlier this year Bell with a foul on the baseline That is his third And a oneonone opportunity now for Miami with eight and a half minutes to go But Syracuse hanging tough here to a 6153 advantage And it would be obviously a tremendous win for Syracuse a long way to go in this one but you come to Miami and you knock off a top 20 and as we mentioned Syracuse is a program thats you know moving up right now Theyre not getting a lot of support as even a team on the bubble But you pick off Miami in Miami Well this would absolutely be a quad one win for the Orange if theyre able to get this game and I do believe that Syracuse is being penalized for struggling early in the season in their nonconference As you look at the ACC with seven teams in the NCAA tournament right now according to our guy Joey Brackets Syracuse not one of those seven teams However a win like this could go a long way to getting them in the conversation with Joey Brackets and of course later with the NCAA committee Again a ton of time but you win it youre Jim Beaheim youre suddenly six and two in the conference too Yeah And again I think that you know they need some of these wins in order to be able to get in those conversations Gerard illadvised pass there out of the double team down the lane Omir lays it in on a foul too No stopping North Chad Omir thundering down the lane And Omir showing off his ability to handle the basketball and make plays Jordan Miller coming up with the steal And after losing the basketball Omir with the Euroep the finish the foul opportunity for the and one and some momentum in the favor of the Canes An opportunity now to make this a onepossession game Fourth foul on Taylor Mint will step out now and Samir Torrance will come on for Jim Beaheim And one shot coming for the sophomore looking to cut it even deeper now And a threepoint play had some style on it too It absolutely did And now you see Miami picking up that pressure Interesting to see if they go after Torrance in the back court with that scramble defense Closest Miami has been in this half And contact there The foul will go against Miami And Papler trying to stay with Gerard 755 to go Its tightened up a lot 6158 Syracuse Music Im your

basket Has the ability to make plays off the bounce using both hands And of course its always great to see the big guys get out in transition euro stepping his way to the finish in a threepoint play So hes put together three consecutive double doubles Hes been terrific on the boards as well Gerard to the baseline Applause on the bench right now for Jim Beaheim Shot clock at six now Gerard trying to get past popppler Drains it Joe Gerard continues to make big shots for the Orange got off to a slow start in this game but picked up his scoring but his playmaking has been spectacular as well Syracuse by five Miller spinning in the lane Got it up there A lot of iron Wont drop once again underneath Strong rebound by Omir And another basket And whenever Jesse Edwards goes to block a shot or has to defend Edwards and thats going to lead to a foul as Wong tried to sky up there and defend and alley but he commits the personal Joe Gerard at the end of the shot clock getting to his spot calm and is able to knock down the midrange pullup And again hes the guy especially with Judah Mintz on the bench right now from the perimeter that has to be the playmaker providing points for the Orange whether he takes it upon his shoulders to score on his own or finds guys like Edwards at the rim 22 and 10 for him adding to those totals Meanwhile thats foul number four on Wong He has to sit again Take a look at that foul a moment ago as he went for it And you see Isaiah Wong coming across and again of course doesnt want to give up the dunk But on plays like that you have to understand your level of importance to the team If Judah Im sorry if Jesse Evers is able to finish that It would have been a tough finish But if he finishes that two doesnt kill you Him having to go sit down on the bench possibly can Especially with this much time to go 6460 Way downtown Packed with a miss Hes hit a couple of big ones tonight Popppler with the rebound Comes away with it Applause Heres Miller Popppler back to Miller in the corner Shot clock dribbling down to five Gets it free for Pack and a shot He buries a three And this is a onepoint game Second chance points now even at 12 for both teams But its five in a row for Miami on this end of the floor Gerard trying to answer Oh my Hes in the cylinder Kicked right out Theyll get a second chance Six minutes to go and a onepoint lead for Syracuse Heres Williams Yes sir He nails it A twopointer And we talk about second chance points both these teams in double figure offensive rebounds 15 offensive boards for the Orange The second time Miamis given up that many offensive rebounds in backtoback games Big time battle inside the ACC tonight Downstairs cant lay it in Omir with a miss The follow wont go and itll go the other way Syracuse basketball up by three off of an offensive rebound Nigel Pat getting in the right spot at the end of the shot clock able to knock down the three ball And on the other end of the floor off of another offensive rebound Benny Williams finding his sweet spot in the corner able to get the deuce Gerard 0 for seven from threepoint land tonight eight to get off a shot midrange Thats really been where hes made his living tonight And Joe Gerard every time he recognizes that he has a smaller Nigel Pack guarding him he simply just turns his back and gets to his spot scoring over top of Pat Give him 16 Heres Popular Yes hell swish it in from threepoint land Miami again closing the gap to two Isaiah Wong getting ready to check back in for Jim Larenga Gerard down low Heres Edwards and hell draw the foul before the shot 421 remaining Great ball movement against the zone Whenever you get the basketball inside the zone you have to have a playmaker that time Jordan Miller recognizing exactly where Wuga Papler was finding him in the corner for the three One possession game for Miami but it goes back to what coach Larga talked to Angel about at halftime They continue to foul and put the Orange on the free throw line Romeo with the foul and Edwards gets the roll 24 points now for Jesse Edwards A new careerh high Hes had some big games at 21 rebounds against Bryant 26 rebounds against Notre Dame 20 and 11 against Georgetown But he has absolutely been the man tonight for Syracuse And what a luxury to have a big guy that can go to the line and make free throws especially down the stretch staying away from foul trouble Yeah and that thats always key is Pack lines up another three Man hes just inside midcourt when hes taking his shots At some point maybe Joe Gerard should go take that away Joe Gerards a guy that would take those same shots Got to recognize Pack can knock that down 7069 Mint back in tried to lay it off for Edwards out in front Beverly will lay it up and in And Miami has surged into the lead 71 70 Applause Nigel Pack making plays here at home enjoying his time at the U so much he shoots it from the U knocking down what should be four and then looking ahead the pass to Harlem Beverly able to finish and the lead for the Kane Im a screen addicted tween and if Im not posting on social media I dont feel seen oh my god mom you got to look keeping my eyes on the

front by one And theyve been able to do it with some timely shooting from Nigel Pack And great production off the bench from Harlon Beverly whos got double figures in now two of his last three games So Syracuse with the ball coming out of the timeout Heres Edwards A 25point night for him A careerhigh Applause Gerard has yet to bury a three in this game He gives it up for Taylor Long one Yes a threepointer Big bucket there for Justin Taylor Curling off the screen recognizing the shot clock going down And how about the freshman production for Jim Beheim in the Orange Hasnt been Judah Men in this one but theyve gotten it from other guys Miller hesitates Cant hit Chases down and got it And a foul on the play Hell be at the line Well sticking with it really paid off there for Jordan Miller Its been a battle of second chance points especially here in this second half now tied 144 because of the Jordan Miller offensive rebound off his own shot and the finish through contact Lets go to Angel Hot shooting Cory that you mentioned before they came out of that huddle how the hot shooting got them back into this game But Koser Oenega said right now for us its the defensive end He looked at everyone and said You have to find Jesse Edwards in the paint Force them to take outside shots He said We have to communicate whether it be high low crosscreen Force them for the outside shot Yeah I agree Angel wholeheartedly Theyve done a great job on everyone except for Edwards in this game Gerard pull up pop off the hand of Williams as he went down Numbers here from Miami Beverly with a kick Jumper on the way and that clangs off kind of ugly by Miller and it comes free here to Mintz Hes going to go oneon two What a tough angle Big fight for the board Wong has it Theyre letting them play They I love it They Theyre letting these guys play again No falling down Theyre not rewarding flops Allowing both teams to play And this is what you want is a consistent whistle on both ends of the floor Miller gets the open look Got it Miami up 7673 A minute 45 to play And the pick stolen away by Beverly up against Mintz who commits the foul Harland Beverly with a quick hand Yeah Mint with the turnover on that possession not happy with himself gets back trying to defend the opportunity But Harlem Beverly lets talk about this young man and what he has brought to the Canes not just this game but this season getting back into the rotation Youre talking about a young man who played his best basketball two seasons ago before going through season injuring surgery of last year and now getting back into a rhythm A productive member off the bench for Jim Larenega And Beverly now with 13 points here He makes the pair Miami opens up a 7873 lead and 90 seconds to play 7 nothing run for the Canes Gerard his first three tonight And what a time to do it That makes it a twopoint game 7876 down the stretch we come Music I was pretty much going to be bald by the time I was 30 Took a mirror to

Saturday of college basketball double header coming up FSU taking on Pent in our first game at 330 Then we go off to the Dean Smith Center for North Carolina and NC State Should be a great afternoon of hoops right here on the ACC network and the ESPN app Joe Gerard has provided the big buckets for the Orange in this game but this is the first time hes done it from beyond a threepoint arc when his team needed the most JG3 stepping up a big bucket to make it a twopoint game with 123 remaining He has 19 eight out of 19 with five assists Hes passed the ball very effectively He and Edwards have been outstanding together but its Miami in front 7876 So theres our reset Syracuse now out of timeouts Miami has two remaining And the adjustment for Jim Larenega to get Haron Beverly in the game Not only for what hes done offensively but also defensively Hes been the guy guarding Joe Gerard taking Gerard away from being able to back down smaller players and go score in the on the bucket What we saw from him in the first half Harlon Beverly stepping up off the bench making big time plays for his team on both ends of the floor Syracuse has to really watch number 24 for the Hurricanes pack because he can nail it from right there and he has several times in this game Gerard out to guard him Coming up on one minute to go under 10 to shoot it Wong looking to make a move He slices through Hesitates fires it wont drop Rebound tipped tipped twice Gerard looking for the save Saved it right to Miami Never saved the basketball your team other teams basket Then an official timeout with 48 seconds to go That was a live ball turnover on Joe Gerard So the shot clock should reset to 30 seconds in comparison to 20 seconds which what it would be on the offensive rebound And we get the shot clock back to 27 now And again this puts gives Miami an opportunity to waste more time Youre Syracuse you dont want a foul but its of utmost importance right now to be able to come up with a stop Its a big call Those are big seconds It is And not only the stop but youve got to secure the defensive rebound if you do get the stop Beverly running some time in a twopoint game approaching 30 seconds to go now Seven to get off a shot Long on a penetration No And Edwards there for the rebound 22 seconds to go And right now if youre Syracuse you want to go get the basketball into Joe Gerards hands Allow him to be the playmaker Mintz inside No And its ripped away with 107 to go 107 seconds to play Mint took it on his initiative to go inside And a foul stopping the clock at 107 And Jim Beheim will have a conversation with this freshman point guard as he was trying to be aggressive and make a play But give Haron Beverly credit defensively He has just stood his ground Whether its Joe Gerard or Judah Mintz he has stood those guys up Hes been the stronger defender and come up with many big plays on the defensive end Making number one He hits 70 at the line Mint with four fouls and another one coming for the 67 sophomore and makes them both big shots And now a twopossession game That second one a huge free throw to get the lead to four With only 107 seconds remaining Syracuse is going to have to get a quick bucket and foul to try to gain more possessions in this game Its kind of been a recurring theme in this series Miami falls behind comes back and rallies And now talking with his gifted freshman Jim Beaheim chatting up Judah Mintz Well 47 years Jim Beheim has a tremendous amount of experience dealing with freshman point guards Hes got two of them beside him on the bench Adrien Archery and Jerry McNamera both started for Coach Beheim as freshman So hes seen these growing pains before The difference between those scenarios though McNamera and Archery were both point guards their entire life This is new for Judah Mintch playing this position this year So they have been even more so of a learning curve this far If Miami does win the game give him a lot of credit at the foul line They made 23 of 26 and 13 of 14 in the second half Heres Gerard trying to blow by Beverly Lays it up and in with 4 seconds to go Thats what you need And now if you dont get a quick turnover youve got a foul reaching to foul and they do foul Beverly right in front of the bench with a little over 3 seconds to go and 8078 Miami trying to win this game at the line Beverly is perfect at the line tonight 6 for6 overall Hes just averaged 67 but hes been better than that tonight Ill tell you what not that these two free throws hinge on it but if Harlon Beverly is able to make both of these and make it a fourpoint game which should ensure a win for the U he should be getting a game ball when they get to the locker room Im sure he will get a water shower Wait he played some big big minutes and cool as ever at the line So now a threepoint lead with 3 seconds to go 34 four and they have made their foul shots all night long and big time in the second half And Gerard will drive it and at the buzzer that one blocked Applause 8278 Applause and the officials going to walk off the court No foul on the play Thats the final 8278 We knew it was going to be exciting competitive
