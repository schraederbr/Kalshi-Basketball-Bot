you see brad brownell the winningest head coach in the history of clemson basketball his team has already banked four wins against high major teams morehead state controls the opening tip they go to work clemson in the home whites youre going to see a stifling mantoman defense by clemson one of the best defenses in the country they put extreme pressure on the basketball and help each other and an early whistle away from the ball against morehead state you look at the starting lineups for morehead state skyler potter coming off a big game in fridays loss to siue 12 points 14 rebounds got to lon cooper as well its homecoming for him hes a spartanburg south carolina native clemson likes to mix up the starting lineup theyve got chase hunter in there along with the freshman olivier maxsense prosper alimir dawes last tuesday against virginia tech had 18 points a season high for morehead state watch the movement off the ball they have to be able to move the help of clemson they are a heavy health team so you have to get a lot of cutting a lot of screening and just player movement ball movement to create open shots the three from the outside is good and morehead stayed on the board first it is potter paul keys to the game today well for morehead state they have to limit their turnovers theyre averaging 18 a game and clemson is forcing 18 a game so thats not a good combination number two they have to splash some threes they open this one with a three thats going to be important to loosen up the defense by the tigers for clemson guard dribble penetration against virginia tech and their only loss i thought virginia tech did a great job of getting into the paint and creating points for clemson get some points from specialty areas transition from your defense forcing turnovers second chance opportunities clemson cannot just rely on their half court sets how about janai broome the promising freshman for morehead state paul you saw him when he was in high school and he caught your eye i saw him in 2019 in east in july in los angeles at an aau event and i said boy this guys got a great pair of hands a terrific body and can score in the highlow game went up to the coach after the game he had no offers just division two offers then morehead state put on the full court press dominick lombardi on the moorhead state staff did a great job of evaluating broome and then preston talked about how the staff just goes all in on kids you know some kids some schools show interest and morehead state they make guys a priority early lead for the eagles thats potter again going strong to the rim and he draws the foul his head coach preston spratlin told us this is an acc level athlete well you see clemson gets so tight and they get under the ball so sometimes you have to just negate your offense you cant run offense sometimes against clemson but what you can do is get low get quick and drive it to the basket virginia tech did a terrific job of paint points and paint touches to pull off the win in their last game amir sims picks up the foul and now we get to see what clemsons great strength is this year its depth and a wholesale line change for brad didnt know they had hockey in south carolina a little line change there morehead state on the season has struggled from the freethrow line only 67 percent nick honor is into the game for clemson the fordham transfer along with johnny newman who had a promising sophomore here last year into the corner the three is good by jonathan bear who missed almost two entire seasons almost all of last year with the torn acl had to sit out because of transfer rules in 2019 came in from unc asheville a very good shot blocker one in the white bear the rebound hell push good ball movement here by clemson they run of a lot of movement set plays with motion concepts the freshman pj hall a lot to like there paul what do you like the most about pj hall hes got the whole package as a low post player and then you see the high post game the jump shot terrific iq a good passer hes going to be a star in the acc in time he was a former espn top 100 prospect big recruit for brad brownell and his staff in state post talent you dont find those all around the country honor the hustle up ahead to newman one on three blocked at the rim james baker and then honor hustling at the other end to knock it away from broome clemson flashing its trademark defense early theyve got a onepoint lead stay moments ago before we went to break janai broome the talented 610 freshman out of florida who has been moorhead states best player looked like he may have hurt that right leg going up here take another look 100 knocks it away that right leg a little bit of an awkward lift and broom was seen holding it after the play he grabbed it right away as soon as that ankle and knee buckled its great to see him walking it off he is the teams leading scorer and a rebounder a lefty and now this was a team that lost their best player and best post player tyshawn clawed a 68 sophomore to a torn acl before the season broom was not expected to have this kind of role hes been a pleasant surprise for this team promising post player size skill and look at his body its tight and toned right now a lot of freshmen dont come into the game really in top physical condition you see broome in great shape nice stroke lefty makes his free throws hes gonna get that knee checked out for a second hes got a really quiet demeanor not loud but he gets the job done on the court and he is terrific on the glass already a couple of 2010 games under his belt by pressure now by morehead state that pressure is just to eat into the shot clock it was a 221 back to a zone morehead state wants to take as much time as they can off the clock less than 10 to shoot long three by hemingway no and the rebound to kj hunt to the mcneese state transfer heres potter looking for help yeah great help by pj hall thats what clemsons all about they move on the dribble they move on the air time of the pass you move the basketball they move their bodies the help side defense by pj hall just shutting it down not allowing penetration so if you get beat on top youre going to see another defender for clemson on the back side and they helped the helper so well hemingway lost it near midcourt we have a tie up a jump ball possession arrow clemson theyre bringing their energy early to this game loose ball who wants it dabo sweeneys watching noon game on a monday no fans right byog bring your own guts bring your own energy long three by newman out of bounds to morehead state how about dabo making a few headlines this morning huh his coaches poll released he had ohio state at number 11 i think a lot of the coaches werent happy with the amount of games played by the buckeyes but lets not talk about whos in anymore lets talk about whos going to win thats the topic of conversation right now we know whos here if you ask me i think were set for alabama clemson five inevitable like thanos offensive foul clemson just moves their bodies so well and they dont look to block shots they look to take charges you see the drive comes over four clemson players are guarding the ball at that moment and one steps in to take the charge this is a heavy help team they put extreme pressure on the ball they can test shots and they are well connected they have their depth they play 11 guys and depth is important if depth can play on the defensive end clemson is well drilled morehead state wants them to beat them over the top they go high low bear to the freshman pj hall carolina player of the year coming out of high school that was a clinic on how to attack his own get it to the middle then look to the short corner or to the rim newman getting into the passing lane its clemson goes to the wing to the middle right to the short corner ball never touches the ground excellent attack by the tigers and once you get it to the middle you have the opportunity to kick it to the wings or go to the rim the middle destroys the zone you can hear the clemson bench stay down not much you cant hear these days new shot clock off the offensive rebound somethings not there hemingway for three back iron clemson does a great job of sitting in their stance sliding their feet and then they stay in their stance you never see clemson standing up on defense thats what makes them so hard to play against lj bryan shuffled his feet and thats a few times now weve seen pj hall really do a nice job defensively in the post and most young bigs get in foul trouble early they leave their feet they bring their hands down pj hall well drilled in the game from dormant high school where he won a state championship if he can stay out of foul trouble as he grows he is a terrific high post shooter and passer and hes got all the kevin mchale moves inside the shot fakes the jump hooks the up and unders im telling you hell be all acc by the time hes a junior threepointer from straight away alamir dawes brad brownell told us as this season progresses hed like to play both pj hall and amir sims together nicely down low its potter again the right state transfer i think hes going to have to play hall and sims together especially when they go against the bigger teams in the acc nc state with great size with thunderbird and bates we know about north carolina you need somebody in the middle to bang and to rebound with the better teams in the acc and sims cant do it alone threepointer by chase hunter no good good sign for morehead state broome back in there working in the post against prosper and the drawing the foul is devon cooper the red shirt junior clemson attacking the zone the senior jonathan bear to the freshman pj hall its a factor on the defensive end and thats why clemson is so difficult to play against they come at you with so many bodies and even though they substitute its a tight connected unit defensively there are times you can play too many guys and then on the offensive end you can suffer because offense is more about rhythm and timing and cohesiveness so you have to keep an eye on your substitution pattern to see where youre helping your team and where you may be hurting your team brownell told us the added depth really helps in practice its increased the competitiveness in those sessions and he said theres been years where we havent had a lot of depth and its impacted us in practice its impacted us when weve had guys go in and out of the lineup this way youre challenged every day and theyve been healthy this year theyve been covetfree i think depth this year in college basketball is gonna be more important than ever potters three rims out new years eve well have an afternoon womens basketball doubleheader right here on the acc network its notre dame miami at one and then second ranked louisville taking on duke at three nice way to spend your new years eve got a little clemson football later in the day too out of bounds off sims and thats the thing about depth we talked about it when you have too many guys coming in and out sometimes your offensive rhythm your offensive cohesiveness isnt quite the same and depth is good if depth can play it really i mean i think its just guys right i think its overrated but i think this year theres a point to having guys ready to play because other guys because of injuries or because of kovid wont be able to play but every coach has a different philosophy and thats what makes it really fun to watch clyde trap and the foul it appears before the shot this young man has battled some injuries now hes back strong 64 guard nice little shot fake comes right into the paint you dont want to settle yeah you dont want to settle for the three when you get the driving line trap brings a defensive presence on the ball hes a good cutter and brad likes to put him in the post at times because he can really score with his size he and johnny newman have been sort of interchangeable this year trap last year showed he was a fast healer towards acl in june able to return in december still wasnt quite himself although did have a nice moment with the gamewinner against syracuse last year in the final seconds i know that was hard for you to say no amir sims is that going to be an offensive foul no blocking foul on moorhead state sims almost picked up his second and thats where mayor sims has to be mindful and thoughtful you know hes really out of control hes lucky he got that call against him im for him im sorry but that could have went against him easily and then brad brunell has a decision do i sit him or do i keep him in the game ten minutes to go in a close game you need amir sims in the game as much as possible foul trouble has been an issue for sims this year trapped for three doesnt go rebound to morehead state here comes hunt talon cooper now the spartanburg south carolina native about an hour from clemson this game was originally scheduled for tomorrow but when south carolina clemson was postponed over the weekend both teams agreed to move the game up it got the players a little extra time off for the holidays to go see their families as we get another foul and weve talked to a number of coaches about that in this age of covet and especially with things really getting out of control these last couple of months do you send kids home to see their families and brad brownell said listen i think you have to because theyve been on campus a lot of them since july theyre homesick i think we sometimes forget about the mental toll this pandemic and this quarantine has taken not just on all of us but student athletes especially and proud brownell and a number of coaches felt hey its important for these kids to be with their families well get them tested when they come back well deal with whatever happens then but its going to be a good mental break for these kids just to decompress a little bit well the kids have been on campus some since june some since july and we talk about seeing their families that is very important but ill tell you what else is important getting a break from the coaching staff youve been with the coaches for the last six months the players wont say it but they just want to get a little break because you hear the same voice day after day youre with the same people even when you travel and when you travel youre more confined than you are at home the players need a break from the coaches and i im going to guess and say this the coaches need a little break from the players nifty move there by talon cooper clemson has missed its last six twopoint game very active zone and they spread out theyre letting the ball go to the acc logo and then they converge look at the hands theyre out theyre up its hard to play against the zone when his own plays active so whats the best way to attack this you want to gap it with some penetration you absolutely want to ball fake it and shot fake it and you have to screen a zone you cant just have ball movement and player movement you need to screen the zone so you can have an advantage of four on three or five on four you brought up dribble penetration who on clemsons roster gives them that dynamic to beat their man oneonone off the dribble i dont know about beating your man but the ability for one to play two im sorry two to play one so you want to gaff the zone i think dogs can do that very well i think traffic can drive it and pick up this dribble and move it thats what you want to do lets see they trapped pj hall that time shot clock at three newman lets it fly and we get a foul underneath it appears to be on hall yeah freshman got trapped tried to wedge him out did a nice job from that time he just a little too much physicality for the freshman whos still picking up the speed of the game the physicality of the game when you go from high school to college you get away with a lot of things in high school that you cant get away with in college and you get hit a lot more and calls dont happen in your favor you have to learn how to play through the physicality and hall is doing it marcus garrett number 10 into the game for morehead state entry pass down low broome with great position and blocked by bear bear came from the weak side nick honor Music and the fordham transfer will head to the line clemson only two freethrow attempts shooting 28 percent in his first half and nursing a slim twopoint lead opener and florida gulf coast knocking off miami that was a shorthanded miami team morehead state battle tested already paul theyve played kentucky theyve played richmond theyve played ohio state in fact this will be the eagles fourth game against a team that was ranked in the top 25 at the time when you go on the road now as the mid major you dont have to deal with the home crowd youll have to deal with the fan base yelling at you you can concentrate on your game how about the execution out of the timeout by morehead state that was beautiful into the post to broome its such a different game without the fans and it really helps the mid majors who are a little bit older the underdog they can shoot it well its really a level playing field chance to take the lead here hunt on the drive leaves it for brian and moorhead state are with a twopoint lead as we close in on six and a half to play in this first half timeout brad brownell a little 60 run by morehead state clemson has missed it with paul biancardi and his shroff lj bryan the last two baskets for morehead state and hes given the eagles the lead kj hunt off the dribble attacks the big draws all kinds of health defenders and lj bryan just waiting there to finish the play thats where clemson has to get a little bit better when they get up on the ball they have to continue to move their feet and not allow that dribble penetration amir sims out of the double team it comes to dawes hammond way a sharpshooter knocks down the three to end a scoring drought of almost four minutes for clemson this guy can really light it up from the outside 42 behind the arc 48 last year but limited due to a high ankle sprain anthony goins the clemson assistant coach in his second season well hear from him at halftime certainly racial and social justice has been at the forefront of the conversation here in 2020 and going to share some of his experiences while growing up in greensboro north carolina and how hes using his platform these days sims jostling for position down low theyre looking for him and a foul in the post its on cooper his first morehead state right in this game because theyve settled down in the turnover department they had five early turnovers in this game only two in the last four or five minutes getting better looks dribble penetration they need to make some stops this time its sims who turns it over amir sims only two points so far that was his third turnover theyre really attacking the mayor sims every time he touches the ball theres one on him and one coming to double and theyre trying to speed him up the possession before in the zone he got it in the middle they all converged and stripped him hes got to keep that ball over his head and under control potter tried to throw it inside its knocked away hemingway hit the deck and we get a foul christmas morning join packer and durham for their holiday hangout a look back at an unforgettable year and a look ahead at what we all hope is a much much better 2021 its 8 am to noon eastern and by the way tomorrow on packer and durham at 9 00 9 00 am they will announce the all acc football teams live so that is tomorrow on packer and durham we get to find out who is on the all acc team and that announcement will come live on packer and durham two guys going for the ball somebody has to get a follow on that play looked like the morehead state player just bumped him a little too hard sam howell on that list aneesh im sure he will be i dont think hell be first team quarterback i think uh number 16 and clemsons got dibs on that no question ian book is probably second team i would imagine sam howell third team all acc quarterback but the big reveal will be tomorrow 9 am on packer and durham sims shows you his versatility not just on the offensive end but defensively as well play the four he can play the five hell battle inside hell front the post even though he has foul trouble at times you know he doesnt stop playing defense and you cant for brad brownell its its the calling card of this program brownell told us maturity and his mind amir sims two greatest strengths that three doesnt go with the shot clock winding down offensive rebound and now a turnover hemingways got five sims again calling for it against broome theres the double hes such a good passer gets it out the trap hes got great passing vision the mayor sims alamir dawes to bear and that circles home and thats the breakdown the tigers need off the bounce to create help find bigs at the rim sometimes you just have to score from a broken play and thats thats part of the specialty points i mentioned in the open contested three not there clemson looking to add to a 70 run alomir dawes its 10 unanswered for the tigers and a timeout by preston spradling so morehead state paul took the lead clemson responds dawes with the penetration beer with the finish that was beautiful on this monday afternoon christmas week clemson up by eight thanks to a 100 run whats been behind this spurt its been bench points amir sims right now just with two points but hemingway with five dawes with six jonathan beer with five in their first five wins clemson had 25 points per game off the bench so when this unit comes in for clemson when they have other guys come in off the bench and they can score that really makes the tigers hard to guard because theyre going to be good defensively theyre going to be consistent defensively but when other guys besides sims can score the ball it really makes this team difficult to play against but one game clemson did not get much bench production just eight points against virginia tech the tigers lone loss 11 turnovers now for morehead state that has been a problem all season long have you mentioned it earlier paul thats what clemson does they turn you over and they dont press very often they press about 20 25 of the time but they pressure the ball so hard they deny it they fall into stales because theyre in great position and they just make you uncomfortable on the offensive end to the point where you turn the basketball over by simply passing and catching and janai broome just picked up his second foul thats big for moorhead see sims working the glass broom with a little little shove from behind with the body its the freshman against the senior hes got a lot to learn by playing against amir sims and thats where pj hall gets better in practice every day the freshman 69 225 he goes against the mere sims in practice thats how you become a better player in the future by playing guys better than you and playing against guys that are older than you the green horns need to take a little punishment from the veterans trap the steal and i cant state it enough this clemson defense is super aggressive and they do a good job of being aggressive and not committing foolish fouls except there except there on the way its just hard ball pressure by trap hes strong hes physical hes a senior and he knows what bothers offensive players that was the sixth team foul on clemson first on trap tigers on a 140 run so if youre more head state be tighter with the ball short passes make yourself available and keep the ball moving and an offensive foul against julius dixon his third i mentioned you got to try to drive clemson every now and then when they get up on you but once you do understand theres going to be health waiting you got to play off at two feet thats a jump stop and a kick out and play on versus a turnover seven turnovers in the last five minutes for the eagles amir sims the running hook no bear recovered and he draws the foul clemson attacking the offensive glass against the zone jonathan bear very active along the baseline any time a team plays his own they have blockout responsibilities and its a little bit more difficult than man of man because youre covering an area versus a person communication is huge and if you dont block out against the zone youre going to give up a lot of second chance points alomir dawes back into the game 15 unanswered for clemson after morehead state briefly took a 1614 lead davon cooper on the drive and morehead state now in the bonus you see how clemson takes away passing lanes theyre so tough on the ball you have to set really hard screens to create some space there are possessions you just have to gap that defense and get into the paint make sure you play off for two feet you can live at the foul line against clemson virginia tech did so they went to the line 31 times at home in may 25 how about mike youngs team they always overachieve every time you think theyre not going to be that good they end up winning a lot of games that is a wellcoached team the hokies did virginia tech give the acc the blueprint on how to attack clemsons defense well i dont know if its a blueprint but they were fabulous at driving the basketball they understood thats what was needed because you cant just pass catch screen and cut because clemson will take it away chester frazier had the scout for virginia tech and he really was well prepared for clemsons defense and got his team ready extended possession now tend to shoot prosper trap lost it recovers running floater not there rebounded by cooper to lancome look at the defense by clemson i tell you what they front the post a lot which will which really makes it hard to get out of the corner with the basketball theres no options that time brian got good position goes down watch the defense by clemson prosper comes over to help sims just a second late the freshman out of canada i think this guys going to be terrific in time super athletic long with very good ball skills oneonone for lj bryan they call him omax olivier maxsons prosper in 2019 he played at the basketball without borders in charlotte north carolina that is a instructional camp by the nba in fiba terrific pickup by the tigers alamir dawes the bank is open on a monday morning was that the bank or the atm im not sure it was playing that way i think alameda dawes is a guy who can really help clemson in the scoring department him and sims can be the onetwo punch they just need some a third option to really help them from the outside i think nick honor can be that guy a rebound comes to newman and that doesnt go this is clemsons seventh game its the fourth time theyve held an opponent to fewer than 20 points in the first half tigers ill be at 14 and then to shoot the ball from three just splash an occasional threepoint shot theyve struggled in that department but they did settle down in the midway through the first half to get back into the game as you mentioned to get a twopoint lead theyre going to stay in zone theyre going to make clemson continue to attack that zone they cannot cover clemson mantoman and they got to get some points theyve got to create some open looks but they have to be really good at passing and catching broom the freshman moorhead states leading scorer and rebounder and he cant connect only three points in the first half for broome and mayor sims made it really difficult for broome to even see the rim on that possession baron the high post sims now over broom yeah thats the veteran punishing the greenhorn well everybody was watching jonathan beer shoot it and amir sims picked it up that was like practice that was easy i mean he found the ball morehead state you cant watch the ball when somebody shoots it you got to find a body and block out thats a big hole in a lot of zone defense bayer just picked up the foul and theres davon cooper got talon cooper 55 davon cooper number one no relation but i like this the first field goal in more than seven minutes for morehead state and they know theres gaps they just have to beat the help side defense and if the defense comes then you jump stop and kick out id like to see morehead stay with more dribble penetration in the second half julius dixon just picked up his fourth foul so in comes james baker the senior the most experienced player on this eagles roster how do you want to attack this zone right there right there baby it was just a quick gap dribble by chase hunter its all you have to do chase hunter comes in as soon as you gap dribble defenders come at you the low guys come high the weak side guys come over and you just find the open man its bakers second foul but its difficult to do against an active zone paul chase hunter seems like one of those guys that has the ability to do what you talked about earlier in the first half take guys off the dribble and an element that clemson needs a little more of they do they they need that mixture they have guys that love to catch and shoot in fact 40 percent of their shots per synergy are catch and shoot shots they have to get to the free throw line a little bit more and they have to just drive people a little bit harder good position by broom he kicks it out potter hits the three skylar potters got nine to lead the eagles what a pass by the freshman just the basketball iq to understand he couldnt score and to find his open man in the corner outstanding theres hunter off the dribble drive and the follow is good by amir sims these are the specialty points that clemson needs to get even though theyve shot it well in the first half they were five for 13 from three theyre not a potent offensive team they need to manufacture points in other ways trap rebounds the missed three by talon cooper bear with his size advantage now the double out to dawes his fourth three hes got a dozen and clemson with its largest lead of the game time out state a little inside outside by the eagles but right now moorhead state getting turned inside out by clemson and this tigers d has done it from the outside four of six from threepoint range well bear recognizes the double chase hunter cuts through the zone alimir dawes just hanging out on the weak side wide open anytime theres a double team you want to get rid of the ball you have an advantage five against four clemson with some nice cutting to occupy the middle and dawes four for six this afternoon hes been failing it and hes been unafraid to take it what does morehead state have to do to solve this defense in a half court just what we saw again the penetration has to happen the reason being is you cant run your passing cutting and screening offense clemsons going to take it away so the closer they get up on the ball the lower you have to get you have to put it on the deck try to get the bump but more than anything you want to try to force help and then get rid of the ball quickly any kind of ball screens clemson is is hedging hard and blitzing at times theyre a tough team to run offense against davon cooper redshirt jr out of louisville at the free throw line limited last year to just five games took a medical redshirt but did start 33 games the previous season averaged almost nine a game shot it well from beyond the arc as well when i watched clemson on defense they remind me a little bit of that texas tech team that went to the final four i mean theyre fourth in the nation and scoring defense at 54 a game theyre number one in the acc they just dont give you anything easy anywhere and a foul against morehead state amir sims has been a lot more active on both ends of the floor here in the second half Music amir sims has done a really nice job of going to get the ball off the glass just four points at halftime clemsons putting him underneath against the zone and thats a great spot for the highlow its a wonderful spot to get offensive rebounds and dump offs off the feed from dawes sims has a dozen eight of them here in the second half coopers path cut off by sims it comes back out the three way off by baker and clemson just wears you down its not that full court trapping style that theyre always on you but once you get over half court you better be aware of where they are because they are on you and theyre ready to help against you hunt into the corner and the three falls and amir sims that time didnt get a hand up one time morehead state knocks it down a dozen for skylar potter a right state transfer hes the best athlete on this team he had a double double against his last game against siu edwards 12 points 14 rebounds dawes misfires now four of seven from deep open three by cooper that doesnt go hes their best shooter out of bounds who doesnt belong to it stays with the eagles this face up game a low post game when hes not involved in the offense he gets himself involved by attacking the offensive basket terrific at dump offs and finishes hes a really good passer doesnt have any assist in this game but he moves the ball and he helps the tigers run their offense they play through him at the elbows and the high post and at times in the low post he can move the ball he understands the game stolen away by john newman theyre still waiting for newman to get going this year as a junior off to a bit of a slow start he needs to be just a little bit better offensively hes a very good defender and rebounder theyre hoping his jump shot will come around nick honor no and the track went over the back his third foul skyler potter big time blockout new years eve a womens basketball doubleheader right here on the acc network we start in miami notre dame and the keynes and then its number two louisville against duke the blue devils coached now by our good friend carol lawson picking up all kinds of tidbits from cara on social media about leadership and motivation she is teaching those young girls more than basketball corrections second foul on trap third team foul on clemson kj hunt gets it to baker working on honor size advantage there into the corner skyler potter too strong shot clock does not reset hunt beats the shot clock and gets the roll excellent patience by morehead state not to panic when the shot clock was at five on the offensive rebound again dribble penetration by morehead state pays off open three by nick honor yes the fordham transfer on the 810 all rookie team a couple of years ago they were really hoping that he would have been eligible last season and with all the injuries clemson had it would have helped now he is a threepoint shooter right now only 35 percent but this is a guy who could be the x factor offensively for clemson he can really light it up his light is always green averaged 15 a game for the rams a couple of years ago haunts beats the shot clock and gets it to go just how they drew it up kj hunt honor open and hits im telling you this guy will shoot it all game long if you let him thats why hes here nick honor always ready to shoot it his feet are behind the line over 60 percent of his shots behind the arc he had a big game in the win against purdue four of seven from deep 17 points ran the scout team for clemson last year clemson took the time out up by 16 we have seen brad brownell unleash his depth not just today but all season theyll play 10 11 guys hunter tyson currently is injured out indefinitely after a facial injury three freshmen brought in to complement uh a pretty good stable of returning veterans and paul the three freshmen addressed the need size of the front court and you look at the way clemson is building this team theyve got depth now theyre starting to add size ill tell you what thats a blueprint that has worked really well for florida state in the acc depth and size when you play against florida state enough you realize that you need some size to play against them the recruiting class for brad brownell this year was terrific the freshman pj hall warren lynn kidd and omax size skill blank bodies that can put on weight can bang score and rebound in the acc but you need that outside shooting and i think nick honor can really open things up for amir sims and we see alamere dawes today shooting it deep from the outside theyre going to look at the video to see if cooper beat the shot clock to your point on recruiting paul the last couple of years were seeing a freshman making an impact a little sooner for clemson alamere dawes last year you really like as you mentioned pj hall and prosper hold that thought well come back with that has clemson shifted its philosophy in terms of how they build their team transfers versus freshman cooper did not beat the shot clock the ball still in his hands when that clock hit zero so shot clock violation and ishraf paul b and cardi and paul to get back to what we were talking about before the timeout clemson before the transfer portal really became what it is now did a really good job finding talent there marquis reid shelton mitchell elijah thomas kevin mack have they shifted their philosophy in the last couple of years where yes theyll still use the transfer portal more but spending more time in trying to get some of these higher end freshmen i think its a combination of both i think brad brunell understands another three by nick honor that you just cant do it with freshman it takes a little longer than people are willing to wait so to of bringing that transfer that grad transfer that can really help right away physically experience wise you need those in todays day and age and starting next year transfers are going to be able to play immediately theyll have a onetime transfer where they can play in i think were going to see a lot of people moving and shaking on the rosters movers and shakers there honor with a sweet feed to clyde trap largest the lead for clemson its 21 whats that going to be like next year is it going to be the wild west in college basketball with transfers i think its going to get a little bit out of control to start and then it will settle down over time but you know guys are going to be looking to lead they do have a date of i believe its may 1st where guys have to declare before then so at least theres a time period involved where guys cant leave a week before school and think theyre going to play right away good hands by nick honor see the ball screen defense i mean two are on the ball for a second and then they go back to their man but those traps are hard those hedges are there to take the ball out of the hands of the offensive player look at three on the ball right now and they dont follow they do a really good job of creating a shield between them and the defender the offensive player excuse me prosper cant finish clemson is turning people over 18 and a half per game thats top 35 in the country paul were also in a climate now where you got kids who cant take official visits so theyre committing to schools in some cases without ever having set foot on campus in your eyes does that make the transfer market even more robust with kids potentially getting to school and saying yeah you know what this isnt the place for me i should have visited i wish i could have visited well some guys have never visited the schools or have even met the coaches where theyve made decisions some have visited as underclassmen maybe been to a football game up into a practice its a little bit more comfortable to make a decision if youve been there somewhere in the past but a lot of virtual covet commitments i call them and youre going to get into the daytoday operations next year when things dont go well you may have some second thoughts about leaving a little bit quicker than if you had a facetoface relationship prior to the commitment ive heard the other side of it too where some coaches say official visits now are so planned out and youve got the graphics department with the social media and everybodys got the jersey shot and you know youve got the different people hosting you and you take them to place a to place b to place x to place y where in some ways recruiting in this climate you are building that personal relationship and yes its zoom calls and virtual tours but in some ways ive heard from coaches in football especially where theyre saying you feel a deeper connection to the kid and theyve heard the same feedback the kid feels a deeper connection to the coaching staff because everything now is being based almost exclusively on this personal relationship well coaches and players have had more of an opportunity to know each other because of zoom and thats been a big big difference versus the other way of recruiting when there was no computers uh zoom time there was some face time but nothing replaces good oldfashioned facetoface time you see the body language the mannerisms uh i i think were going to see some extra transfer as another shot by nick honor man i mean you can virtual recruit and it can sound good a niche but when things go bad you go back to the relationship and what are relationships based on trust and how do you form trust uh spending time together thats how you get your belief in and buyin so i i dont buy into virtual recruiting i understand it but theres nothing like getting facetoface with parents and players and coaches the first basket for morehead in more than four and a half minutes it ends in an 110 clemson run i think back paul to uh this time last year nobody knew what zoom was thought it was a song wasnt it zoom zoom zoom zoom it was a car commercial right you know that oldfashioned recruiting goes both ways you know the coaches go on campus and the players get on campus nick honor with the three and amir sims with the no resistance inside for the jump hook but my point was anish that you know coaches get to evaluate live thats been taken away too coaches are evaluating based on games on the computer i love it when the coaches get a chance to go into the homes of the players and go to the school of the players and vice versa the players and the parents get to go on campus nothing will work on cooper and prosper a little quick that time a lot of freshmen go way too fast theyre hyped up to play they theyre trying to bring the energy but the problem is their mind goes so fast they get a lot of quick turnovers and they get a lot of plays where theyre out of position because theyre thinking so fast the game has to slow down for the freshman and they have to understand how to absorb the physicality of the game a lot of bumping and grinding with no foul is called hey paul to your point about evaluating players on just film i mean you are our guy when it comes to ranking these high school players whats the biggest difference being there in person versus evaluating on film when you evaluate on film its almost impossible to understand the athletic ability speed quickness height wingspan i mean people can tell you how big somebody is but until you see them live its a big difference its kind of like watching florida state on film and then you go to the game live and youre like oh my goodness theyre so long theyre so athletic theyre so big hard to gauge athleticism off of film you can gauge iq and skill but you miss out again the interaction between the coaches and players because the film only shows you so much its a great supporting tool in east but again like recruiting nothing like being there live right there to clyde trap nick honor can stretch out a defense he creates driving lines for his teammates and i think he really opens the floor for amir sims skylar potter on the drive lost it telon coopers three is good morehead state just has to stay aggressive defensively you cant play the score at this game you cant look up and see the number you have to continue to play your concepts and play your scouting report grazing the front rim olivier accents prosper the freshman seven minutes to go clemson with a 19 point lead theyve led by as many as 21 and a foul along the sideline tonight after longwood and virginia tech the all acc team with a complete breakdown of tonights games with coach and player interviews its 10 eastern right here on acc network christmas week holiday season getting close to the end of this nightmares 2020 calendar year close to a new beginning i hope so amir sims with his second foul yeah you cant just barrel through a screen the sims knows that any time you get hit with a screen first thought is you got to avoid it theres janai broom taking it right at sims and the freshman earns a trip to the line i really like this young man broom when i saw him play aau basketball i said good strength good skill packaged up in a six nine frame and those lefties inside they can create some fouls hes got pretty good footwork at his size at his age and promising post player in the ohio valley conference when he reaches his potential hes going to be a load to handle in that league surround him with some shooters and hell be able to score one on one in the post he has that ability right now hes still learning the game with his back to the basket in his collegiate debut he scored 11 points five of six against kentucky i just like kentuckys down but still yeah thats their only win right now right against boyhead state this team is picked for ninth in the ovc morehead state honor hes got 14 a chance to make it 15 now nick honor is feeling it and so what did they do morehead state theyre closing out hard theyre coming out hard the transfer from fordham recognizes it puts it on the deck nice finish when you were the point guard of the scout team last year you were just youre just dying to get into games this year great denial by sims still still playing defense out at the threepoint line i think thats where his versatility really starts to shine through he can get out behind the arc may not be able to cover shooters but he can deny passes four fouls now on amir sims the last three have come in a very short period of time illegal screen im not sure that was so illegal i mean maybe because he turned his body but when you do a dribble handoff you dribble right at the defender you just pivot but replacements are on the bench for clemson pj hall the freshman will welcome this playing time by the way the new ap poll is out clemson has dropped out of the top 25 not a single acc team in the top 15 as the eagles connect from the outside that tells you paul that this regular season in the atlantic coast conference without crowds and home field advantage at places like the yum center and cameron dorn the dean dome and the carrier dome thats going to be nullified its going to be a wild ride once the regular season starts in the acc its a wide open race this year even before covet it would have been wide open the acc lost eight guys to the nba last year and when you think about the rosters not a lot of nba star power on this years roster a lot of good players a lot of good returning players you have uh justin champagne isaiah wong you got a mayor sims dj funderburg at nc state a lot of good teams you got sam hauser at virginia so theyre going to i think virginia north carolina duke florida state may be the top of that list for the top four in the acc five is wide open virginia in the latest poll the highest ranked acc team at number 16 north carolina follows at 17 duke at 20 florida state at 21 virginia tech at 24 clemson among those also receiving votes they received 28 votes in virginia got that big win against clemson theyre in clemsons out i think florida state is the best team right now in the acc north carolina with an unproven backcourt talented tremendous front court duke is so talented but so young again and virginia has to find their defensive identity and they need offensive help to go with sam hauser jay huff has to step up as a redshirt senior but they have a really nice freshman point guard in rhys beekman skylar potter picked up a technical so hemingway at the freethrow line now the 11 and hemingway hits the first nine points today for the sophomore six of them coming at the free throw line after hemingway went scoreless the last two times out clemson averaging 66 points a game if they can hit their average more often than not their defense can win them a lot of games theyre only giving up 54 points thats fourth in the country scoring defense and i dont think that number is going to change much in acc action may go up a little bit but if the tigers can hit that plus mark theyre going to win a lot of games morehead state has a little something in skylord potter 18 now for the wright state transfer and what did preston spradling his head coach tell us youre going to watch this kid he is an acc type talent he mentioned that he had some acc and sec interest in recruiting but nobody pulled the trigger moorheads five threes today eight attempts and sometimes when guys transfer they they tran they want to transfer up to show approve that they could play at a higher level but you want to play with your greatest opportunity is allowed three fouls on janai broom pj hall the freshman he actually played with morehead states to lon cooper in high school at dorman high in spartanburg south carolina where they won some state titles together because thats all dorman does paul theyve won four straight championships they also had a young man on that team by the name of miles tate who went to butler in the big east but ryan thomas the head coach there has done a fabulous job at dormer one of the best high school coaches in the country inside its broome salon cooper by the way on the floor for morehead state wearing 55 a little freshman on freshman that time broome did a nice job of sailing pj hall to get that high low im telling you broom can be a terrific highlow threat in the ovc honors got 14 hes looking for more he and dawes have been lights out from the outside a little hesitation by trap but he carried final media timeout clemson just asked to put the ribbon and wrapping paper on this one salon cooper on the left pj hall on the right teammates at dorman high school in spartanburg south carolina a little more than an hour away from clemson and state champions at dorman that team went 301 dorman won four straight five eight championships under thomas ryan the head coach pj had some nice moments early in this game on both the offensive and defensive end final three minutes of this one clemson looking to go to six and one as we get a whistle yeah we mentioned it earlier i think pj hall will play with the mayor sims in the front court right now he gives them some good backup minutes the young man from dorman high school what a team that was miles miles tate went to butler cooper in this game they should be winning championships with three division one players but i think pj hall is going to be a fantastic player here at clemson i really do his offense is much better than well see early in his career 20point game for potter who beats the defense down the floor amir sims meanwhile with his last rebound now has his sixth career doubledouble 12 points 10 rebounds today and clemson does a fantastic job of turning you over falling into stales they score a lot of points every game from their defense and theyre going to have to 19 points off 19 head to state turnovers today and most of those points are unguarded theyre in transition or there is an advantage down the floor those are points you need to make yourself feel good well you dont have to grind it out every possession offensive foul on kj hunt alemir dawes just that last little step at the last second and this is what they drill in practice every single day its the shell drill where you help each other and then you help to help her this game was supposed to be played tomorrow but after south carolina had to postpone its contest with clemson over the weekend both teams agreed to move this game up to today thats why you have the unique monday noon start we dont see that too often especially at this juncture of the season and it gives both teams a chance to send their players home morehead state doesnt return to action until after the new year when they play murray state in conference florida state has more than a week off their next game isnt until next tuesday against florida state so it gives some of these young men who have been on campus since july or august chance to decompress good for the mental health they can see their families for a few days before getting back to the basketball grind and i think we all feel some of that given how quarantined and alone we felt at times in this bizarre surreal 2020 year i hope the kids get enough time to be home theres been conversation that there should have been maybe a pause in college basketball the guys have maybe seven to ten days the whole country just shuts it down for seven or ten days and theres clemson with that that strong stifling defense but some days four or five days are better than no days at all the ability to go see family and friends and break away from the coaching staff i mean as well as these guys get along with each other uh kids sometimes need to hear a different voice be in a different location and just have that variety in their life thats been missing no fall break this year which is usually three or four days theres been no obviously summer trips and we know that clemson went to italy last year did very well and really started to push their team forward after that trip to italy they got a lot of good playing time they won a gold medal and none of those things happened this year so its just kind of show up on campus stay there travel stay in a hotel this break is much needed for everybody in college basketball we get a 30 second to time out by clemson amir sims moments ago fouled out a little bit of a 60 run here by the moorhead state eagles theyve made six of their last eight 140 to go in regulation we showed you clemsons upcoming schedule for morehead state nice long layoff before they get back to action in murray kentucky january 2nd then tennessee tech jacksonville state eastern illinois siu edwardsville that was morehead states last game of close loss against siue i think murray state and belmont will be two of the favorites with austin p and preston spradden right now coaching for that ovc hes talking in the timeout about what they could do to continue to just chip away at this lead would have been at 40 they know that its probably improbable to win the game but what can they do in their press what can they do in their next offensive possession hes coaching for down the line for league play and thats so important a lot of coaches sometimes you know they dont understand the last couple of minutes of the game win or lose with a big spread you can still get a lot of great teaching points in and for spradling even though theyve played nine games he is still trying to find the right mix with this roster take davon cooper essentially a new player coming back he was injured all of last year youve got janai broom a freshman whos starting for you potter is a transfer kj hunt is a transfer trying to figure out how the pieces fit they have 20 turnovers today but there are positives 47 from the field paul against one of the best defenses in the country and theyre a very good rebounding team there top three or four in the ovc theyre plus on the glass they do a really good job of blocking out trying to limit their opponent to one shot they got to be better in the blockout game when they play their zone defense this team will finish higher than their preseason ranking of nine with the transfers and broom inside theyve got enough to finish in the upper half where do you see clemson in the acc big picture to me it all depends on their offensive game today they shot the ball so well from the threepoint line its going to be about offense for clemson as i said earlier the average 66 theyre at 64 right now if they can hit their average theyre going to have a winning season in the acc they can finish in my mind their sailing could be up to four or five i mean i think they can finish that high because of their defense their offense if it lets them down you know they can obviously slide down eight or nine i just dont really like top of the league i just dont see the top of the league being as daunting as its been in years past i think theres going to be a chance for a clemson nnc state maybe even a syracuse somebody that were you know maybe not expecting to be in that top four top five im with you i just dont see the top of the league being that good this year well its good its just not great like its been in years past that nc state north carolina game coming up is going to be great the ability to turn people over by nc state and north carolina just continues to pound people in the paint at the rim they they win games on second chance points and pain points but nc state has the front court this year with minnie bates and dj thunderberg to hang with the tar heels up front but youre right i wouldnt be surprised to see any one of the four teams we mentioned duke carolina florida state of virginia or somebody like at nc state sneaking in to win the acc this year the lack of fans will impact games theres no doubt going to cameron youre down 8 to 10 points before you take the floor because of the crazies when youve got 30 000 people at syracuse or the yum center is rocking or the dean dome is rocking its to me when you lose some of that i think you take away from a lot of those teams and those are usually some of the better teams in the acc i think the lack of fans is going to have a significant impact on how some of these games play out in the conference road games now become so much less daunting theres no question about it we had that graphic earlier of the upsets you know the low to mid majors winning against the high mages on the road you you dont see that in a normal season home court advantage at a lot of places you say eight to ten and cameron im going to say its 10 to 15 points because when they get on a run and those fans get you with the follow line just think youre shooting free throws at cameron indoor stadium with no noise no jumping up up and down no keys jiggling no signs waving i mean its a big difference you can go in with some focus and concentration in any venue this year in any power conference and win a game and thats one of those arenas if youve never been to cameron indoor if you walk in when its empty your first feeling is huh thats it it looks like a high school gym but when you see it on tv and when youre there for a game when its packed and the students are loud and theyre standing up and it is a nonstop cacophony of chaos all of a sudden it feels claustrophobic and it feels like okay however many six seven thousand there may be it feels like seventy thousand and you cant breathe its that kind of feeling but when youre in there without fans its actually a very underwhelming atmosphere and on the flip side think about the carrier dome how intimidating with 30 plus people and you have to play against that backdrop and the acoustics of the dome home court advantage out the window this season its a level playing field clemson wins by an even 15 the tigers do it with threepoint shooting and defense clemson off to a six and
