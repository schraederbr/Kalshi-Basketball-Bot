basketball So you mentioned it just that battle inside in all facets of the game Critical tonight Tout kicks it back out This is Sundra The straight on three offline and Porter clears it Great defensive possession right there by Missouri They worked on that today with their post with their uh the draft in there Misfires from distance So its Notre Dame pushing and Sundra is open One bounce Had to kick it back out Harelson attacking again There is the fivestar freshman He has been impactful in his first nine games as a Fighting Irish He again is a player that can play downhill He can play inside Hes got great size great finisher around the basket Firstear player from outside of Indianapolis Theres a whole lot of anticipation the last calendar year for his arrival He has delivered early on Notre Dame has been challenged last week in Vegas Played three quality teams So the record stands at five and three Mitchell trying to stretch it with the shot clock draining and Porter swiped it away from Tout So a new 20 Mitchell lost it Deflected out of bounds It does stay here with the Tigers Gets away with a little bit of contact right there as well trying to get to the basket He again has attempted to try to play outside I think thats his seventh three of the year and uh has not had a chance to make any of those Again you see you see again Mitchell trying to attack the basket Great rotation over really close to being some contact there to where it possibly be an offensive foul So they they actually get together and reverse this one Theyre going to give possession to Notre Dame I like the call I mean I mean again the contact There was no call in the contact He loses the ball I think thats the right thats the right call Officiating crew of Bill Cington Tony Henderson Tim Clocky Its an NCAA tournament caliber crew Tout new 20 here Notre Dame gave it away Sebastian Mack on the attack Mack had it knocked loose Oh hes wiped out on the rim Brady Kaylor smothering him Great protection there He wants three here screaming Theres Marcus Burton Notre Dame will play fast Theyll play off turnovers Theyre playing low rebounds and they can score in transition Theyve got guys that can shoot the basketball Burton in particular is the guy that can really score the ball First triple of the evening for Notre Dame and it is their playmaker Marcus Burton So Notre Dame has the early threepoint edge Mitchell hammer pass to Mack Porter has his feet set Missed it long Remember last week Notre Dame plays Houston They play Kansas They beat Ruters They play some difficult teams They have been tested and they are off to a fast start after Shrewsberrys triple music Theres a great rim protection here Great block They get a chance to push music it in transition You got one of one of the most dynamic players in all of college basketball scoring the basketball music a little bit in terms of winning close ball games as well Thirdyear boss from Indianapolis originally and he feels like this is the roster for Notre Dame in his tenure that can turn the corner The goal is to get back into the top half of the league There was Mitchell by the way on the attack First basket of the evening anytime you have continuity back and hes got great continuity with his back court and some returners Hes got a chance to uh to have a really good year Both programs retained a lot and some key players from a year ago Theres one of them that is Sir Mohamd the sophomore has it here Boy hes wide open from the wing Cant connect Kev Jai got his hand on it and stays here Good hustle Second chance opportunity tonight is going to be huge for both ball clubs Keeping guys off the glass was something talked about in shoot around for both teams as a point of interest tonight Missouri has got Dennis Gatess team this year Hes got a lot of size and length Guys like Shawn Phillips Jr Luke Northweather whos back on the floor at the head of the snake There is their defensive cheering stalwart Anthony Robinson Steel and the throw down Robertson averaging about two three steals a ball game and you know hes one of those guys again hes the only returning SEC guy that was the all defensive team and you know he has the early lead in I think is being the preseason defensive player of the year in the SEC but hes so active defensively a junior from Tallahassee hes got great instincts Kevin Chai 15 ft out finds Shrewberry so Notre Dame late shot clock offense this is Mohamd in the paint scoring I mean coach you got to be really happy about that Really stressing them sides to the guys how important it was to get paint touches tonight and own the paint against Missouri Great job there attacking the half court Yeah four different Fighting Irish have scored here in the early moments Theres Mitchell Boy you see the dexterity and the versatility for the senior from St Louis Hes such a hard matchup I mean hes one of one of those undersized guys that has a chance to get to the basket You see him here you know this pick and roll defense the rotation over wasnt there quick enough And Mitchell finishing at the rim like he does at a very high percentage music at the line for one more music Mitchell all conference a year ago is averaging 17 a game Hes a Kansas City native careerhigh offensive numbers to start This is Missouris big road test to start They beat they beat Minnesota earlier this year Thats a 4 and4 golfers club Theyre on the road here for just the second time but against a power conference opponent Shrewberry front rim So here come the Tigers back the other way Transition defense Theyve got to get back and slow Missouri down Missouri averages 92 points a ball game really look to push the ball in transition hard and and in themselves like attacking the paint as well Mitchell lines it up missed it and then a foul Thats on Northweather So ball back to Notre Dame Dennis Gates 45yearold from Chicago fourth season at Missouri Now last year led this team to another 20 win season and another NCAA tournament appearance So thats two and three years for Gates and his staff And hes done a great job building this program

comes in the game and he brings instant shooting to the game And uh you know right there right off the bat he he spaces the floor He gets a really good look Coach R Coach Rusberry really emphasized to

tonight Now more than ever if you are able to please give now vorgdonate 100 of your donation goes to cancer research with Rodney Terry Kevin Fitzgerald with you Rodney I know I know you knew Jim

challenge continues Notre Dame with a fourpoint edge For the first time in this threeyear challenge theyve got a home game inside PCEL Pavilion So meanwhile Missouri is in town Theyre unbeaten Notre Dame would like a big statement victory on its home floor Honor Boatang is going to the music free throw line after an assertive attack in transition in transition transition defense Its going to be really important Notre Dame gets back and gets the defense set Bull tang is again a guy that attacks the rim Strong body and theyre happy to have him back He missed early part of the season with an injury and hes playing great right now coming back coming back on to the court for these guys Finally healthy Bo attack By the way you see the last couple of outcomes for Notre Dame in this challenge at South Carolina and at Georgia in years past Oh we had the first game go final earlier That was Texas AM A victory over Pittsburgh the ACC with a couple of wins since that point Syracuse knocking off Tennessee inside the dome Virginia Tech winning in overtime You throw in an Oklahoma win So were two up in the early going here on the mens side Heres Jacob Cruz Yeah he is a flamethrower off the bench Coach cant be happy with that that they walked through that play today Notre Dame they knew Cruz when Cruz is on the floor hes going to get an opportunity to come off that that staggered screen there for for a look and he hes not going to be happy with that They covered that today and shoot around Number 35 of the black one of the most effective threepoint shooters in the SEC to start the season You see Missouri right now open up in their zone Theyre going to show a different defense Changing defense is what coach G does By the way shot clock is malfunctioned here So its stopped at 25 and so Bill Cington is going to the scorers table just to get this sorted out You know Kevin the chess match has started a little bit The chess match has started a little bit right now with uh again you see Missouri coming out in the zone and you know you got uh again the execution of zone offense I know Notre Dame worked against the zone today with the overload Missouri prepared for the overload today So its going to be a great great match up here again But at the end of the day its all going to be predicated on what they do on the glass Early chess moves So while we got a moment lets take a look when this shot clock just stopped here Yeah it was at 25 seconds I think the official what maybe about six seven eight seconds had passed before the officials the shot clock got their attention Thats what Cington is over at the monitor right now They might take I dont know anywhere from 5 to 10 seconds you would think off the shot clock Sure But it also gives you another timeout over here for ball club right now I mean now now Notre Dame has a chance to talk about their execution versus the zone You know obviously Missouri cant have great spacing You know same thing can be said a little bit about Missouri as well So looks like they finally have this sorted out You mentioned it a coach a a head coachs best friend here the extra timeout I mean you look for right now for coach Bear to have something drawn up a little bit on how he wants to attack that zone Maybe Missouri comes out shows shows zone and go man Wow How about this So they took 20 seconds off the timer off of that shot clock So it was a bit more than I had thought So five seconds on the shot clock Thats it And and you see Missouri go man right now Theyre coming out instead of zone Heres Serta shovel it Ta They beat the horn Theyre back up by two Great job attacking the paint Sa getting in there and finding tout Touts really good with that with that push shot around the basket Notre Dame has had the early edges first portion of this game Its only the 10th meeting between Missouri and Notre Dame They last played 14 years ago Missouri has had the upper hand Theyve won seven of the prior nine including that battle in 2011 This is Mitchell Gets the whistle and hes going to the free throw line Okay late in the shot clock and it and put the shot clock down to five So watch the shot clock It starts maybe a second late but I think even if they go back and look at that one you subtract a second or two T still gets that off Meanwhile Mitchell at the free throw line where he has lived for a couple of years in his two years at Missouri And again paint touches for both teams That was a great paint touch to to close out that possession for uh for Notre Dame And then you come down the floor and you get the ball to a guy who lives in the paint in Mitchell and it was a really hot match up and hes back at the foul line again Hes from Kansas City first two years at Duke He was productive there Comes back to his home state last season Helps lead Missouri to a 20 win season and an NCAA tournament appearance Now he is their headliner averaging about 17 a game High level talent You see some fourcourt pressure here right now by Missouri trying to speed these guys up a little bit and kind of take them out of their rhythm a little bit That three offline Harelson battling for the board Mitchell rips it away This is Boang Boat in transition Kick it back out MITCHELL GOING UP STRONG AND HE FINISHES Mitchells doing what he does best Hes attacking the basket Hes finishing at at a high rate at the rim You try to see some pressure again up the floor falling back in that zone right now again Missouris going to do a good job of moving the basketball and really trying to again still play inside out Got to do it Serta this is over to Logan I sundra misfires Oh lots comes away with it I is going to the free throw line A fortuitous bounce for Notre Dame How about Mitchell on the other end Rodney Hes got nine in the early going Well again Mitchell again playing to his strength Hes getting to the basket Hes playing through contact finishing at the rim You talk about one of the best finishers in all college basketball than Mitchell And the lefty this time finishing with the right hand But meanwhile thats the first foul on Shawn Phillips Jr So Logan Ims Junior from outside of Indianapolis Hes been a program vet good teammate third year with Notre Dame Hes at the free throw line trying to tie this one up You know Kevin he adds to that continuity I mean you talk about seven returners I mean this is a year again in year three for coach Rubberry He has his team These are his players that hes had a chance to recruit and uh its a great opportunity tonight for these guys to try to again get over the hump tonight Thats the key this week this year for Shrewsbury and the Irish They want to turn the corner last year took a step forward after Shrewsberrys first season but they still finished below 500 trying to get back into the top half of the lead That pass is picked off by here He comes His pass is deflected and now its Boang So Missouri gets it right back and is up by two Not theyve done a great job in taking care of the basketball this year but theyre going to be challenged tonight of Missouri They got another one Just picks I pocket and throws it down This guy again one of the top defenders in all the college basketball Robinson you really got to protect the basketball around him Hes got very active hands on the defensive side That was too easy So hes got a couple of steals in the first half Missouri by four This its largest lead as it swings back in front for the first time Corner three way off Ricochets out to Shrewberry Shot clock does not reset So another chance for Ryder Frost This is I feed it inside I got bumped Thats just the third team foul in Missouri But theres IMS with a couple of offensive boards Look at this by the way from Robinson You got to protect the basketball around Robinson Robinsons one of those guys will take your basketball at any time if youre not protecting the ball man Hes a great finisher in transition But you got to you got to have great ball security around him Great defensive instincts So Robinson sits down to two steals Theres another giveaway Missouri on the run out Boang eyes up Look whos open Cruz splashes another three Time out Notre Dame Missouri on an 112 run And they have now their largest lead in the first Theyre up seven at South Bend I mean beating Tennessee I mean one of the top teams in the country Were off to a great start with this challenge This this is such a great week for both conferences for all the teams involved and all just all of those games outside of Oklahoma pulled away from Wake Forest late They were very tight You saw that nugget on all the lead changes in those games Plus Duke and Florida coming out of the wire as well Look at Sundra was open got free on the baseline Notre Dame back within five Notre Dame did a great job of not selling for shots right now versus his own They still attack the paint there They get a a really high percentage shot there to finish out that possession Notre Dame had that quick 112 burst in the first half of this period At one point they led by six Missouri just went on a run of their own at a sevenpoint edge Its back to five Thats a foul on Haroldson his first So neither team in the bonus Neither team had any foul trouble at this point 742 to go in the first where you had a lot of points off turnovers Value taking care of the basketball leading the offense for Missouri Gave them a great spurt there You know they know they spent a lot of time on this baseline out of bounds defense right here today as well knowing music that they could get a hard duck in right now when they throw this ball into Mitchell Mitchell leads everybody with nine points Hes been efficient and hes gotten to the free throw line several times This is Phillips whos coming to set the screen instead Boang He takes Sundra off the bounce Missed it Hes a guy again thats going to attack the paint at all times Bang Hes going to try to really get downhill Theres Shrewberry doing the same thing Instead pop it back out to Burton This is the allconerence playmaker for the Irish Gets downhill Robinson knocked it away Boy weve talked about his defense Nearly gave it away Who wants it Notre Dame with the takeaway Irish on the move Sundra sets the feet puts it up misses it again No paint touch that time though You know not really trying to attack against Missouri You dont want to settle for those Oh Mitchell throwing man move Count it And a foul Mitchells having himself a night tonight but hes living in that pain Hes doing hes doing what he does best attacking attacking the basket You talk about one of the hardest matchups in all of college basketball Mitchell man getting that heal Hes Hes terrific at finishing and again playing through contact He has lived at the free throw line The first eight games of the year for Missouri So even just those two possessions right there Notre Dame puts that three up On the other end Missouri attacks the paint goes back to your biggest key to this matchup Well again Kevin it was no paint touch though You know again coach really stressed to the guys today have great spacing He wanted to get some driving kick He wanted the paint touches He wants to shoot the three I mean Notre Dames at their best when theyre theyre making threes but but no paint touch threes Those are hard shots uh for Notre Dame against Missouri You got a great matchup right here by the way with Burton and Robinson We talk about one of the best offensive players in all of college basketball You talk about one of the one of the best defensive music players in all of college basketball So its going to be a great matchup within the game tonight Robinson with some tenacious defense in this first half Hes got a couple of steels that block a few moments ago and nearly knocked that off of Burtons leg Instead it stays here with Notre Dame Shot clock at 20 Burton a crossover Its downhill Haroldson rim run What a great finish What a great finish But what a what an even better drive by Burton to create that opportunity for Harrison there cheering Cruz hoist up the three Missed everything He is saying that it got deflected I mean Cruz is such a good shooter I mean he misses it that bad He thinks he thinks he got hit on the wrist at some point I mean hes hes that good a shooter Thats what I was thinking laughter too Hes already canned a couple but instead ball back to Notre Dame You see Missouri fall back in this zone again has given again not day some problem but great job attacking right there inside out Great job Kevin Chai the 610 senior from Ohio Now gets a chance to get back set their defense to sit down and guard a little bit right now at Notre Dame Threepoint game 540 to go in the first Barrett got bumped And that might be the second It is Thats the second on Jaylen Haroldson Friday we keep talking about all these premier matchups all week long Tomorrow here are the headliners Louisville and Arkansas at 715 a top 25 battle and then you got NC State and Auburn that follows at 915 Got a couple of great players in that first one You know Mike Brown Malik Thomas on either side Uh thats going to be incredible guard play right there with both of those with both of those teams having outstanding guard play to start the season So this time Notre Dame able to neutralize Mitchell He has had his way early on Shrewberry transition three missed it and does stay here with Notre Dame So it will be a new 20 for the Irish Last possession now Kevin they they did a great job with their with their double team on Mitchell that time rotation was better Uh and and again they they forced a tough a tough shot for Missouri Phillips back on the floor Missouri shooting 50 from the field and uh a high percentage from from inside the ark A twopoint field goal percentage one of the best in the nation And you can see why they have pounded it inside especially to Mitchell Notre Dame loses it This is Mitchell who deflected it away from Mohhamd Mitchell all the way Know Kevin again Notre Dame has to try to stay away from these live ball turnovers Missouri is scoring off of turnovers back on the other end Theyve got to value taking care of the ball a little bit better Theyve done a great job taking care of the ball all season long but they havent played this type of pressure up the floor and changing defenses And there it is Theyre minus four Seven turnovers for Notre Dame after the miss Missou relentless back into the front court They play in higher possession games just like a year ago They were one of the more prolific offenses in the nation Mitchell or rather Phillips this time Close range look Got to put it up with the left hand Hes a talented inside player in and Phillips Sean does a great job keeping that ball up and and uh again scores over the other shoulder there But hes a guy that can go over either shoulder and extremely athletic interior player for Missouri Missouris new starting fiveman back in the SEC Remember he started at LSU Jai hurls it back out Burton ducks underneath Mitchell Jai one bounce Jai gets fouled and Kebai goes to the free throw line when we return So its Missouri that maintains a lead and its a sevenpoint advantage Missouri trailed in the early goingings but then they went on an 112 run pulled in front and so they have had the bounce They have had momentum since And Randy theyve got a sevenpoint edge Whats been the difference in Missouri taking the edge late in the first point of turnovers We talk about the live ball turnovers Missouri has converted a lot of those turnovers in the baskets and gave them a great spurt ability there to to get some separation uh and put themselves in a good position in this ball game right now So Dennis Gatess team theyre plus four in the turnover department Theyve for seven Notre Dame turnovers but theyve gotten 11 points off of those turnovers To your point they have been opportunistic Anthony Robinson has he has been the leader on that defensive side for Missou And when youre able to play that way Kevin you you dont have to come down and go five on five in execution and half court offense Youre able to get points off your off your turnovers and and in transition those are big baskets Second road game of the year for Missouri Theyve won all eight games Their other road game was at Howard outside of DC to start the year So this their first road game against a power conference opponent Cruz dials up another three Offline had hit his first two Saved that one and half Look at Phillips gets his hands on it Quick pass inside Porter going to the line Wow The hustle leads to an opportunity at the stripe for the Tigers What a great effort music What a great effort by Cruz here I mean Cruz again 5050 balls on the road He gets a good look there but he also doesnt give up on the play He keeps continue to play They win the 5050 basketball Now they got an opportunity to go to the foul line Kid almost a tip up at the basket Just a seed to Porter And if the last name is ringing a bell uh the Porter lineage lives on in Colia Theres the hustle from Cruz You made mention of Porter Hes the baby of the boys right there applause in Javon Hes the last Porter to come through Big brother Michael Porter Jr is having a good year in Brooklyn Not too bad a player Hes had a pretty good career to this point right in the NBA NBA champ couple of years ago So Brady Kaylor just got whistled for a second straight foul And so music Notre Dame is in the penalty And so Missou is at the line to shoot a one and one as a team Theyre four of eight at the strike Jacob Cruz he is their best free throw shooter One of so one and one and he hits the first Hes one of hes one of the top shooters on the team and they get to the foul line One of the better free throw shooters for Missouri AC So tomorrow night on the ACC Network this challenge continues Here are the matchups LSU at Boston College Unbeaten LSU Tigers By the way Mississippi State is in Atlanta to take on Georgia Tech Those two at 715 and 915 on the ACC Network So Cruz is one out of two Weve seen early here Kevin uh again Burton really setting his teammates up but hes a guy that can score that basketball as well And and you see it right there You know hes a guy thats going to let the game come to him a little bit but he they need him to score as well He averaged 21 last week in those three games against Houston Kansas and Ruters He could always fill it up Thats another foul Thats a third on Kayla So this is the freshman from Fisers Indiana has gotten whistled for three straight and Missou back to the free throw line for another one and one Unfortunately again hes been in a you know in a situation where hes had to to defend a bigger guy and Phillips there and you know hes got caught caught a couple times with his hands in the cookie jar a little bit there and we got Phillips going to the line right now as a result of it cheering Missou has struggled at the line Theyre five of 11 They have had some games where theyve been shaky at the line in the early goingings of their season Their best win for Missouri to this point They beat Minnesota a 44 Gophers team at home back in November This would certainly be a pretty nice road win for Missou in the early going Burton a step back Cant hit it and Robinson collects the miss Barrett foot on the gas out to Cruz 43 Cruz is going to keep shooting that basketball Hes one of the best shooters on the team And you know that great find right there by Tio on the drive there And again Cruz shot ready to shoot the basketball He hit four in their win against Cleveland State few days ago He lets it rip cheering Burton on the baseline Cut off his fingertips Ball back to the Tigers again Pushing the ball here hard in transition You see Tio Barrett looking for him He finds the best shooter on the team Cruz a shot and hes hes shot ready there and he knocks it down Big shot by Cruz Seen a lot of that from Missouri Driving with a purpose and in this case finding the open shooter in the corner Finding one of the better shooters on the team and Cruz You see hes three out of five Maybe that one did get deflected the way hes shooting it I mean only way he misses that bad is someone had to hit him Hes not Hes not taking it any other any other way Thats a rare Missouri turnover tonight Only the fourth time theyve given it away So 2011 to play late in the first Notre Dame could use a little response You see the numbers there on Cruz how effective he has been bottom left from distance Notre Dame that last time down came through and ran their ball screen motion to change a little bit with Iverson cut here right into the pick and roll action right now Here is Burton Missouri work worked really hard today on the on in their shoot around today against this ball screen motion Well theres Burton on the blow by missed it Tout got his hand on it and Missouri has got numbers again Tout trying to hustle back Cruz heat check No Town secures the board Thats his seventh rebound Burton draws the foul on Robinson Thats his first just the 15 foul on Missou So Notre Dame will inbound You got Burton pushing that ball again And you know you have the continuation music You know coach wanted a continuation on that Right now this year in play when you music get that continuation the official said no he takes too many steps You only get the one step after the after the contact youre going to get that continuation but he took probably two steps there and wasnt going to music get that continuation The the key sign the gather youre starting to gather when a defender bumps you Sometimes that can lead to the and one trying to mirror the NBA a little bit more The college game Burton tries to split a pair Jump stop Burton brought it low Knocked away Barrett has it There go that There goes that man again right there When you talk about Robinson I mean he has his hands around the basketball at all times You got to have great ball security around Robinson Cruz didnt realize he was on the block turned and scored it 10point lead for Missou And Cruz has 12 now Cruz scoring in the paint I mean something he doesnt do a whole lot of Hes usually a guy that scores from the perimeter but Oh theres a technical foul Bill Cington has just teed up Micah Shrewsbury I think coach was a little upset from a couple possessions prior when Burton went in there and they didnt call the foul They had good vert verticality there and didnt make the call So I think this was a kind of again a little frustration from some earlier calls not being made and wanted to get his point across to the officials in terms of hey theres displeasure for those calls not being made Hey with 457 to go trying to light a little fire here So Cruz goes to the free throw line to shoot the technical free throws And again this is a big ball game for Notre Dame I mean again coach is in his third year right now Theyre building with continuity that this is a big ball game The challenges here at their home court right now Its an unbelievable opportunity for him So again he he can get his guys you know fired up He said today he said he thought his team was going to be very excited about competing tonight So uh they just got to stay they got to stay the course and work the game right now has done a great job scoring off the turnovers and uh you know Notre Dame just got to kind of regroup a little bit and take a deep breath They are Rodney in their uh biggest hole of the evening Theyre down 11 after Jacob Cruz has gone on a little bit of a run Hes got a game high 14 So hes right at his season average already in the first half Well theyve been here before now You know you they go back to their previous game against Houston They work their way back in the game with shots like that right there for Spru They will work the game Theyll work Theyre never out of the game because theyre a team that can really shoot the basketball at a high clip You have shooters on your team youre never out of the game A timely triple for Notre Dames marksman Thats Shrewberry second cheering triple Oh Burton A little taste of Robinsons own medicine there Takeaway and the layup What a five nothing burst You got 5 seconds here Clock is rolling Robinson eyes up One more dribble throws it up misfires And what a critical five nothing burst for Notre Dame You got Marcus Burton and Anthony Robinson Theyre jawing at one another here after 20 minutes Shrewsbury You got to love it You got to love it right now Shouting some words here You would think maybe towards the officials And so the emotions they have officially begun to run high in halftime Kevin this music is a big ball game for both teams Theres a lot in motion and again an opportunity for both teams again to to try to get a big win early in the season Notre Dame in particular here at home You got to try to protect your home court Boy Dennis Gates just had a brief word with our officiating crew I I wonder if who Shrewsbury was barking at Was it Robinson to get back to his side Was it the officials Well I think he really wanted to have a few more words with Bill Cington a little bit The referee that teed him up a little bit He wanted to have a conversation with him a little bit Didnt go so well And so after a little mini brewhaha if you want to call it that at the end of this laughter first half weve got our officials at the monitor You music would think to check to see if there wasnt anything that went over the top here So Robinson as the shot as the horn was going off here Look at he and Burton They exchange some words and Robinson as Jaw Adam Shrewberry starts trying to walk towards the two of them and maybe just get between them You talk about a great matchup You got a great offensive player against a really really talented defensive player So lets take a look at this angle again Shrewberry senses it I think hes telling Bill Cington And then Shrewsberrys got a few more words for Cington Again I love the matchup I mean you talk about mono on mono in terms of a good offensive player against a good defensive player I mean what a matchup Kevin Were in for a great second half Its getting tense right Its getting tense You got to in the books Lets step aside Going to be a fun matchup here down the stretch here in the second half Cruz leads everybody with 14 points We didnt mention Mitchells impact Thats Mark Mitchell had 13 and a couple of boards as well He was impactful early in that first half for the Tigers So its Notre Dame who has possession Theyre on that five nothing run They went on a 50 burst at the end of the first half And so its an extended 7 nothing run here as Harrison lays that one in Thats Jaylen Harlson Jaylen attacking the basket Hes really good at finishing around the basket as well Great possession to start the half for Notre Dame Notre Dame with a little bit of the upper hand of late Now after the boang miss the Irish are trying to trim the deficit even further Harelson assertive throws it up and he draws the foul putting the pressure on the Tigers Again they only got to the foul line four times in that in that first half Notre Dame already coming out here really trying to put pressure on the basket The way you get foul you got to put pressure on the basket You see Harrison here starting with two straight possessions putting pressure on the basket Second foul on Porter This is the impactful talented rookie from outside of Indianapolis Hes averaged 13 a game Hes been one of the higher scoring rookies in the ACC in the first month of the season and now hes got nine shy of a double figure game Macdonald America one of the top players in all the uh high school basketball last year Love watching him play in AU basketball A talented scorer and and hes again he scored in double figures at I think five or six ball games this year already for for Notre Dame And hes going to have a tremendous year this year for these guys Rodney its a nine nothing extended Notre Dame run They scored the last five points of the first half and the first four here in the second Theyve come out He got a score a stop and a score to start this half Porter pulls up misses everything Ball cheering back to the Irish Two consecutive stops to start the half right now for Notre Dame coming down and finishing possessions forcing Missouri into a really bad shot Again theyre putting pressure on the basket offensively So they started the way they wanted to start this half right now Missou shot very well in that first half They shot 50 from the field However as you pointed out they missed the first two here Oh what a spin move from Harelson That may count I dont know here Were going to look at that Are they going to say that that was a goalend So no Nope Theyre going to say two shots for Harelson and they get Robinson for his second personal I love what coach has done here to come out and start the half Hes really again being assertive with the young young freshman right here He came with the matchup and and again hes doing his part by getting to the foul line using his body great size Uh I love what what coach has come out and done here to start the half here Made the two previously at the line Misfires on the first I mean getting to the line was a big deal for these guys They had four free throws at the half So I mean you come out and you have you got two straight possessions where youre at the foul line And again its getting the young player going as well And he hes a key guy for these guys as well So Harelson leads all Irish scorers with 11 Hes got a couple of boards couple of assists Notre Dame within two all of a sudden Weve got a one possession game here now screaming Mitchell goes back to the rim Mitchell lays it up and in Thats an answer right there Now going to your goto guy in the paint doing what hes done all night finishing around the basket Missouris leading scorer now guards Harelson Harelson starting to bump into him Ball fake goes up Blocked That was Mitchell who wins that battle Heavy dose of of Harelson to start the half here but great defensive play by Mitchell Phillips misses the layup Robinson had found him So here comes Burton and the Irish Look for Burton to be a lot more aggressive here in this second half in terms of looking for his offense a little bit He did a great job setting guys up in the first half Finds Harelson Back out to Shrewberry Dials it up His fires Rebound down to Phillips Yeah Burton three of eight shooting Hes got the seven points averages 20 a game to to your point He could easily hit that in this second half and and again he had spurt ability in terms of scoring So you look for him to be much more aggressive here in the second half Phillips has missed a couple here 5 ft in and was it deflected by Notre Dame Yes So it will stay here with Missouri Kevin I really like the look down there with Notre Dame It was an inside out by your one of your best threepoint shooters in Strawberry It was a great look Just didnt make the basket But theyve come out much more aggressive defensively than Notre Dame when getting stopped So a little more of a bounce for this Irish team here first three minutes of the second half Notre Dame working really hard cruising the game right now knowing he may get some set some kind of back screen to come off a stagger here So going to have to stay attached to him on this inbounds Number 35 of the black there X factor off the bench Also worked on this This is the ISS iso play here for Mitchell where they kind of spread the floor and let him kind of go go oneonone did a great job of finding Tio right there and he splits that double team and youre right on Found Tio Barrett the sophomore with his first basket of the evening The Zoo back up by six as this challenge continues to heat up Burton pulls it from 15 There goes that man Burton He going to press him here in the second half Look for him to look for his scoring in this second half that pull up that he has Its Its always so pure Mitchell forced that one Irish back into the front court With the Duke victory against Florida the ACC has got the upper hand for now See how the rest of the day unfolds A lot of basketball to be played Kevin Were just getting started with this challenge Harelson throws it up Haroldson How did that one go down Were getting a heavy dose of Harrison to start the half And again a youngster that can really score the basketball in tight quarters in the paint Has a great body to be able to do that Rodney hes been efficient Five of seven from the field today Hes got 13 Mitchell just barrels right in Pitchel put his head down and he earns another trip to the free throw line But it is the rookie whos taking over right now for Notre Dame Hes stepping up in a big way music You see B right here again Har come out heavy doing him get to the basket He said earlier look Ive been doing this long enough Usually you got three different players on a roster Might have a guy walks in the locker room and he they might be a energy vampire Lets say laughter another guy walks in doesnt really change the energy and then you have an energy giver Thats what Harelson is He la his maturity how hes been able to coach him Hes got a great head on his shoulders to go along with all that talent and ability The thing that jumped out to me and talking to coachberry about it when he lit up about Harelson was about a smile on his face every day and the attitude that he came in with every single day You that attitude can dictate so many things Notre Dame after the free throws down four Remember late in the first half they had fallen behind by double digits but they are back in this one early in the second Good move here by coach Gates going to zone right now and just really took these guys out of their rhythm a little bit in terms of what they were able to do to start the hat But great change of defense by coach Gates there Great call Burton had to hoist that one Cruz wanted to find Barrett in the corner and instead a giveaway again Theyll have some pressure up the floor 221 back to this to this zone defense And again you know Notre Dame has to do a better job here attacking and getting a shot on their turns So they got an opportunity to trim the deficit again We thought this was going to be evenly matched tonight between these two Felt like it was heading in that direction Here we are Two possession game Burton lets it fly and connects Bur going to come out and be aggressive this second half Hes already set the table for his teammates You saw the the skirmish there at the end of the half I knew he and Robinson were going to take this match personal right now his second three Hes got 12 Robinson trying to back him down Robinson says Get out of the way Missed it Whos down with it Sundra might have last touched it And it will stay here with Missouri Robinson trying to have a grown mans move down there in the paint He and Burton going at it I love this matchup and the competitive fire between the two of these young players The two starting point guards Remember they exchanged words at the end of the first half Looked like Robinson probably initiated it They started jawing at one another for a couple of brief moments there as they both went to the locker room Sometimes Kevin you dont want to poke the bear You dont want to wake Burton up Now Burtons awake now Hes fully awake and hes ready to try to to make some some havoc in this game Mitchell goes up with the right and rolls off the rim And then a loose ball foul on Missouri So thats the third team foul on the Tigers high percentage shot You get the ball to to Mitchell in the paint Its your goto guy You want to stop a run give it to the guy who whos you know get that high percentage shot there Ball just didnt go down for Mitchell there That was the first foul on Cruz by the way Onepoint game in South Bend Shrewsbury didnt have enough space to squeeze it off Instead over to Serta Back on the floor now Shot clock at six Burtons got it Burton lets it rip Missed it Had connected previously from that side but instead Mitchell comes down with his fifth rebound Mitchell blocked Keai pinned it off the backboard And then Missouri commits another foul Great rim protection by Jai going up and contesting that shot at the basket You see here Mitchell trying to get downhill An excellent block by Jai going up and contesting that shot Mitchells played really well scoring the basketball in the paint But that was a great rim protection there by that by J Mitchell he leads everyone with 17 Remember he had that great start early in the first half Still six out of 12 from the field Notre Dame defensively its gotten better as this one has unfolded They turned it up a little bit here They put some stops together here in in the half court and uh theyve really challenged Missouri at the rim and been much more competitive on the defensive side This is the freshman Brady Kaylor back on the floor number six in the white Caleb picked up some early fouls and they had to sit down there a little bit Hes playing with the three fouls right now Serna pass to Burton Marcus Burton gets inside Kick it out Shrewberry cashes in Thats Notre Dame basketball attacking the paint playing inside out driving and kicking What a here out of the out of the timeout trying to get the ball again to their primary guy Mitchell Heres Mitchell guarded by Jai Couple of jab steps Kick it back out to Boeing Notre Dame digging in defensively again Cruz contested three Burton down with the board And another quality defensive sequence for the Irish Theyre putting consecutive stops together right now Not Notre Dame And again its giving them separation on the on the on the offensive end and in the outcome of the game at this point Heres their playmaker Burton finds Jai Good ball movement back up top Kaylor for three And again thats Burton again Burton I mean his assist tonight getting in the paint finding the open guy Its now six assists for the junior from the town over Official walk up We got three in the key cheering Offensive foul rather on Phillips You know what I Kevin earlier in the game thats where the young freshman kid Kaylor thats where he was picking up his foul Thats where he was picking up his foul You get you get the reverse call this time down on the other end music Boy ducking I mean you may have to look at that right there with Phillips right there again Taylor music trying to stand his ground Oh wow Yeah they may have to go and take a look at that right there I mean that thats thats not a basketball play right there again that could be upgraded if if if we have a look at it music and thats at the officials discretion if they want to go and I think really want that to happen I mean we both obviously we all see it and what happened but hes hes making that case for it right now but instead the officials are not going to go to the monitor music got away with that but he got away with one right there So I mean again I mean the possession goes to Notre Dame right now but could have easily gone the other way and been shoot free throws Its not a challengeable play Wow Burton what an attack mode right now Hes aggressive right now Notre Dame has its largest lead at a critical time in the second half You can see that you can see the excitement in Burtons eyes right now He is ready to play and he is taking it to him right now I love this match up Burton hes frustrated Rodney Notre Dame is on an 11 nothing run this second half Heres Notre Dame as a program Theyre trying to turn the corner back above 500 Theyre in the top half of the league They got a lead here Absolutely You got to think that theyre going to try to get that ball in Mitchell at some kind of in some kind of form of fashion He has the ball in his hands right now Atto see that bottom left Missouri scoreless its last 4 and a half minutes Another miss I dont know if thats really the shot you want from Mitchell at the time I think you want him to try to get something closer to the basket He hasnt made a three all year You want him attacking the basket Zo of three from distance today All of his points coming near the rim or at the free throw line Missouri is cold offensively in the second half Theyve got just six points Notre Dame still in the miss of the 11 nothing run Kaylor the freshman goes up with the left front rimmed it Great opportunity there in the paint to try to get something done just kind of pulled it pulled up on it a little short Sebastian Mack number 12 in the black on the floor only played five minutes in the first half So hes getting a little run here Missouri needs something taken away It was Kaylor and Serta who bothered him Notre Dame in a groove right now Burton got bumped and that is the second foul on Cruz The fouls are pouncing for Missouri Thats 16 fouls Not yet at the halfway mark Not Daves doing exactly what coach Fear talked about in the shoot around today and to his team in film today He talked to those guys about owning the paint Theyve done a great job here to start the second half attacking the paint Paint touches paint touches threes you know drives for Harrison Theyre doing a great job attacking the paint Both teams just underscored the importance of that battling the paint both offensively and defensively Notre Dame has had the upper hand especially in the second half They have outscored Missouri 206 Sundra a giveaway This is Robinson now Kick it over to Cruz Its a fast break Cruz lost it Mitchell put it up Count it And the foul It was the one thing Kevin again in the first half that caused a lot of problems for Notre Dame were the turnovers and the live ball turnovers You know they hadnt had one to start to happen and they have one And again anytime Missouri has an opportunity to play in transition off the turnover they will look to score Theyre here at the foul line right now Boy Missouri could use this threepoint play in the worst way Mitchell with 19 points for Mark Mitchell His fourth 20point game of the season Mitchells a really good free throw shooter Anytime he gets a chance to get to that foul line he usually cashes those in and converts those free throws Fourpoint game halfway mark second half Good battle between Missouri and Notre Dame Which way is this challenge going to swing on Tuesday night Shrewberry has hit three times from distance Could not connect that time No paint touch that time Kevin Again just a no paint touch three Cruz after the paint touch He got the best shooter ready to spot up there and he shot ready Notre Dames got to come down and just work their offense and do what a you know that got them the lead earlier here in the half to start the half here Six straight for Missouri Sundra is open Contested three way short looked like Mitchell just mishandled it No And ricocheted off of Harelson Ball back to the Tigers Id like to see Harelson get a chance to get in that paint a little bit again and have an opportunity to score at the basket a little bit You see here another look here I dont know if that ball got deflected a little bit there but I think the I think the right call was made Yeah were blocked out by the stansion but it goes off of Mitchells fingertips and then off of Harelson Missouri misses the three and thats a foul on Burton That is the third on Marcus Burton We saw Robinson go tumbling Both were going for the rebound Thats a big foul was the one guy you cant take off the floor for Not Notre Dame right now Hes going to have to play really smart with three and you know coach decides to keep him in the game I was not really liking the replay here Lets watch out Im not sure Yeah wed have to see it again I Im a little surprised we heard the whistle there maybe on just first glance Nevertheless its a onepoint game Mitchell turning body bumping with Tao Throws it up Oh Robinson took it away from Cerna or rather Kaylor and he scored it Missouri back in front Big basket right there Robinson playing strong getting the offensive rebound but not only getting the offensive rebound but also scoring it Notre Dames got to get it across the timeline Nearly ran into a little trouble So Missouri answers Notre Dames 11 zip run with an eight nothing run Theyre in front Well Kevin theyre getting a chance to set their defense every time they score Oh wow Offensive foul Got to be careful again Yeah you got to be careful on this one right now Thats a second on tout Burton had split the defenders Lets take a look You got the pick and roll action right here again Again Tio really trying to fight through that through that screen there a little bit Youre able to get that call If you kind of stick your your butt out a little bit like Ta did there youre going to probably get that offensive foul Yeah If he doesnt just kind of wing that right arm out theres probably no whistle Cruz another three You got to find Cruz Cruz is the one guy you cannot leave open Timeout at South Pin Jacob Cruz a 20point game Hes caught fire Hes hit five triples Two key two key guys from last year that were major contributors Youre always a lot better too Kevin in year two a lot of times than you even were in year one This retention and the continuity of having those guys back is its really paying dividends tonight Missouri with a little heat in the back court they nearly force either the turnover the 10second count but yes right now Cruz hes on a rampage Hes hit five triples and Notre Dame has been seldless the last four minutes Couple of wild runs for both teams free to shoot Giant close range is going back to the free throw line to hopefully put an end to the scoring drought Absolutely I mean Cruz has kind of picked up where he left off last year in terms of the end of the year scoring the basketball well for these guys Not today Great job music of putting the ball in the paint right now and and really trying to get to the foul line Stop this run right now Ji has gotten to the free throw line quite a bit 13 out of 16 coming into music this game the senior from Centerville Ohio A third year with the program fourth year playing for Micah Shrewsbury Started with him at Penn State So Rodney this uh this challenge which is pretty tight right now It continues tomorrow on the mens excuse me on the womens side Weve got three great matchups starts with Kentucky at Miami at 5 Eastern on ESPN 2 NC State Oklahoma to follow Tennessee and Stanford close out our action on ESPN 2 16 games on the mens side 16 on the womens side I like that state I like that state Oklahoma Thats the matchup Thats an offensive foul Another illegal streak Do we have a technical foul that was just issued against cheering proof Jacob Cruz that gives him three fouls right now Not a not a not a foul right now Cruz is emotional Couple you see some of the assistants are trying to settle him down So lets take a look what happened Okay so Bill Cington just came over offensive foul and then the technical technical foul It was indeed on Cruz So two big free throws for Notre Dame What happens after this sequence Take a look 35 top of the screen You have the illegal screen on Robinson right there And then you have a dead ball technical foul on Cruz not taking a liking to the call Got to kind of channel your emotions right now G you know gaining the balance right now You got to work continue to work this game So for taking the shot there after the whistle or was it something he said I couldnt tell It looked like it was something he said Must have been something he said Serta for three misfires again after the free throws Notre Dame back within one cheering Theyre going to come back to this match up You got a mismatch right now Great trap by Notre Dame They worked on this where you dont leave the little guy down there on a bad match up against Mitchell Mitchell oneonone He beat Chai to the basket Got fouled and Mark Mitchell is going to the free throw line music Mitchell does a great job of putting pressure on the basket in terms of having guys they got to do a much better job with the verticality than Notre Dame You cant come down music on him You got to They put him at the foul line Hes a good foul foul shooter as well I love down the stretch how this thing is going to kind of play out a little bit especially with the two high level guards Burton and Robinson cheering So Mitchell hes lived at the free throw line Hes now seven out of eight Hes had an unbelievable game tonight and but again just doing what he does in terms of being a mismatch problem all game long and getting to the foul line Oh Northweather comes away with the offensive board Missouri has the upper hand a slim advantage but an advantage nonetheless on the offensive glass Mitchell again oneonone Flick it back out to Barrett Now theyre improvising Three to shoot Barrett step back missed it but last touch by Harelson and so might be a shot clock violation Dont not sure if that ball hit the rim or not but I theyre saying its a shot clock violation right now Well and they must have said there that the ball or the the timer had expired before it ricocheted out of bounds and there was no contact The ball didnt ball never hit the rim So you have a shot clock violation Oh boy By a fraction If that that basketball grazes the rim its Missouri But instead Notre Dame down two less than seven to play in a competitive challenge game between the Tigers and the Irish Harelson a spin move Picked up the dribble Burton cuts Marcus Burton offline rolls off the rim but it stays here And here comes Tim Clocky immediately to have a word with Coington And yes they do get it right Possession Missouri Its a great job officiating right there where you have another guy comes over and tries to help the other official that had a better look at the situation as well Thats thats outstanding officiating there Yeah thats off the fingertips of Jai One score game Robinson left open Puts it up Missed it short Not a couple of bodies go tumbling Weve got a lot of contact on the floor this game Look at the end of the first half things started to heat up and this has been physical This has been intense second half and that is a foul on notre Dame Thats the fourth on Haroldson Its a 5050 ball situation here Again you know Harrisons trying to block out There four fouls on him Unfortunately for him you know hes going to have to probably come out in this ball game right now but just trying to block out on a threepoint attempt 13 points for Haroldson the freshman from Anderson Indiana Rips down that board so hes going to remain on the floor here He cant check out That was a high level rebound right there by Harrison above the rim Thats his fifth Barrett swipes it Haroldsons got to be careful and he just fouled out Thats a tough went with him with the elbow Tough break That is the fifth foul on Haroldson and this fivestar McDonalds AllAmerican Cant believe it but hes out Yeah Coach Coach had a player at the scores table to try to get him out of the game And before you get him out of the game he fouls out of the game Youre Haroldson though You kind of know you just you got to be careful again when youre in that situation Hes a young player Hes going to learn through this This is a learning experience for him right now Playing through four poul situations like that You just got to you know get your hands back go with verticality Make him make a tough play Live to live to fight another another play Yeah Ill tell you what Rodney looking at that Barrett is the one thats seeking out the contact And so yeah thats a its smart play by Barrett I mean Barrett knows hes got a hes got a an impact player that has four fouls and you know he should initiate trying to have some form of contact Smart play by Barrett Really good defensive play by Barrett He took it away from Harelson and he earns a couple of free throws Mark it down 6 minute mark Harelson fouls out and theyre able to set their defense their pressure defense up the floor Well look to see here if they theyll stay in their manto man as opposed to going back to their zone Chai rim run AND THE THROW DOWN Thats a great pass by Burton Its a great look BS have done an outstanding job finding his teammates tonight cheering Mitchell going to work on Shai Double comes knocked out Stays here Nine on the timer with 527 in the second half Great double by Logan Adams coming down and and doubling in the post on their best low post interior score Really great job of

So shot clock 20 Yeah shot clock resets to 20 Thats a major break Anytime you have a ball situation that shot clock had a chance to reset It was down to nine Oh illegal screen on Mitchell Several times we have seen that call tonight on either team Lets take a look here I mean Little touch and little touch and go Now in the NBA thats okay guys Well he extended his arms out a little bit You can do that in the NBA You really cant do that you know in college basketball Extended those arms out on that pick and roll situation Second foul on Mitchell Remember both teams now in the bonus Burton on the pullup Still free Robinson has it for Missouri Five to play Burtons really good in that midrange right there Wasnt able to convert that one but hes really really good in the midrange cheering

a clutch answer Get out of here Kevin Thats his first main three of the season Mitchell hes a prime time player I mean but you know to make a three at this juncture of the ball game when he hadnt made one all year Shrewberry cant answer Mitchell with the rebound Boy that is timely hooping Wow If youre Mark Mitchell hes got 24 to lead all scorers Thats just an older player being a player man Again having confidence to take that shot at this juncture of the ball game Missou by two 5 seconds Barrett improvising Picked up the dribble Barrett stepped through and he puts it in Big shot by Barrett Big shot by Barrett right there with the step through They took Mitchell away there and he had no choice but to go ahead and take that shot Its been he and Robinson and they have been on the floor for much of this second half in the back court Logan I lines one up TAKES IT LOGAN I that was all created by Burton getting to the paint driving and kicking finding his open shooter and Logan A wild back and forth second half between Missou and Notre Dame in South Bend Robinson is sizing up Serta Robinson couple of crossovers Robinson a spin out to Barrett Passes up the three Robinson head fake goes

we go partner Buckle up Final two and a half coming up Marcus Burton has 14 and eight dimes as well You see the seven lead changes most of those in this second half We have had some wild runs by both teams in this second Notre Dames got it 220 to play and theyre down one Can they close it out here at home against a good Missouri team It would be by far their best win of the year Great job by Coach Gates coming out with the zone defense to change change their uh change their defense right now Drewberrys got to chuck it Bounces over the rim Really good move by Coach Gates coming out again out of the timeout Comes out with the zone defense Notre Dame settles for a three without a paint touch You know theyve been really good getting the paint touch but that was a really good really good move by coach Gates there Changing his defense Well hes pulled thats been up their sleeve a number of times tonight Hes shifted to that zone Its been effective Missouri the upper hand A onepoint lead with possession Mitchell backed down to smaller Burton and he earns another trip to the free throw line Hes going to shoot his 10th and 11th free throws The double and the rotation with a little slow there tower if he just stands around and doesnt put him at the foul line Mitchell again music has a heart for understanding what it takes with his body to get into a defender and get to the foul line Hes earned his trip to the foul line Second season that Mark Mitchell has been back in his home state for his program Dennis Gates loss his craftiness and his versatility Hes got his team back in front by two Our mens slate tomorrow here are the featured matchups Louisville at Arkansas at 715 Eastern and then NC State and Auburn to follow at 915 Thats on ESPN So after the Mitchell free throws Missou by three Notre Dame looking for an answer Serta got it Its a corner three Big three by Ser Sa is the guy again that again stretches the defense Hes the shooter for those guys Really good find again as well Even at 67 122 to go You look for a heavy dose here right now Mitchell trying to get to his his point on four Wobb it up Phillips Boy that was a dangerous pass Theres a tie up Phillips is going for it Thats a little extra tout down on the floor Barrett very wisely just gets Phillips out of there He was tangled up with Tout Possession arrow favors Missouri Its going to stay here Absolutely Again could have could have been a little bit extra there after a little bit extra there after after the tie up there a little bit Phil is lucky here Didnt get didnt get any other kind of call made after this right now But jump ball situation baseline out of bounds Notre Dame spent a lot of time in shoot going over these baseline out of bounds plays You can look for some ISO with Mitchell You can look for Cruz coming off a stagger They know the two guys that theyre going to try to go to on these baseline out of bounds situation here Well Northweather just checked in for Phillips So Phillip sits down in this very emotional tense entertaining second half Look for Mitchell to get this basketball here and try to find an area on the floor where he can try to score this basketball Northweather sets the screen Bump it into Chai Goes up with the left Missed it Rebound Tal Thats the ninth rebound for the ACCs leading rebounder Notre Dame possession after the third of three Theyre looking to pull in front Less than a minute to go Burton lost his footing Theres a whistle Its a foul on Robinson his third And Marcus Burton is going to the free throw line to shoot two This matchup has been great all night You got a great defender a great offensive player You know Burton gets the better of this battle right now in terms of getting an opportunity to go to the foul line Let me correct myself Thats the fourth on Anthony Robinson So four fouls on Robinson Theres three on Cruz Remember Jaylen Harlson for Notre Dame already fouled out Robinson the only player with four fouls now Burton puts his team back in front by one Well you look for a situation here right now on the free throw Maybe I was before the free throw Coach Gates takes a uh takes a timeout to try to set applause up a play in terms of getting that ball to Mitchell or having having him play through a little bit of Robinson to try to get something done His veterans and you also have Cruz as an option too Burton has 16 Its been an emotional competitive tense game especially in this second half cheering Missouri down two 45 seconds left Robinson nearly threw it away We got Cruz got held on that back door cut to the basket Now Missouri is also in the double bonus and so Cruz is going to go to the line Great execution out of the timeout Cayman this is a set play here where again you get over play trying to get the back cut Hes got a foul on the back cut Now Cruz gets a chance to go to the line shoot two free throws This is Missouris most reliable free throw shooter Jacob Cruz who came alive early in this second half Hes got a 20point game Went on that threepoint shooting rampage earlier And one more to tie things at 69 Missouri gets a chance now to set their defense So Scrooge Mary has to either call timeout or hes going to come down and and and let his team try to play it out But they get a chance to set their defense right now and theyll have some form of pressure up the floor Now whether theyll go back to zone or go to back to man well see here Coach remember Missouri has one timeout Notre Dame has two Were all square 444 to go Missouri with a little backcourt heat They get it across Hes got to take try to take that ball out of Birds hand but Birds still going to get that ball Hes got it a double kept trying to get it out in his hands Hes been the playmaker Burton trying to step through and Micah Shrewberry calls the timeout He sensed that his junior playmaker was stepping into some trouble 29 point opportunity of time to be able to have an iso to do that Sir Mohamd has to get it in Gets it to Ta Burtons got it Notre Dame and Missouri tied up 69 apiece 20 seconds left seven on the shot clock Over to Sera to Serta lets it fly PUTS IT BIG SHOT Big shots late in the second Missouri out of the front court Cruz cant answer Barrett got his hands on it Saved it Its free NOT HAS cheering CRUZ HAS THE FOUL BURTONS going to the line to maybe ice it 68 to go All they

found Sera Deep shot Shot ready Big shot by Sa Thats huge right there Ss been big in the second half making big timely shots 11 of his 14 in the second half Burton hits the free throw Notre Dame by two possessions 68 to go Right now Notre Dames got to be smart now Dont foul Let those guys come down and you know try to get a shot up but you cant put them on the foul line here Notre Dame with the upper hand 68 to go You know they wanted to win one of these close ones Theyve had a couple slip through their fingertips And tonight in this challenge game this a statement game tonight This is a statement win right here for Coach Stes program right now and and letting his guys know hey they can get it done and win close ball games This is a statement win for them tonight So Phillips with that two hand stuff threepoint game Shrews Burton to inbound Gates brings Phillips back in Thats the sevenfooter Hes going to guard the ball Right now Burton can run the baseline right now He can go up and down the baseline here They just got to get the ball in bounds and close out this game Notre Dame trying to close it out Shrewberrys got it Time running Theres the foul Shrewberry going to the line A great a great uh press break right there by by coach Shrewberry You know they had they had the other other guy come in He had to have both feet down to begin to miss it Theyve got the threepoint edge one free throw it here for what is and what would be Notre Dames best win the first month of the season Again Kevin there it is This was coach Gates teams first really tough contest on the road They had Minnesota at home earlier but this is one of their first tough contests as well So with this victory the ACC is going to take a 63 lead in this challenge Notre Dame cheering gets an important statement victory in the early goings of their season against an unbeaten Missouri team at home A great second half Marcus Burton was excellent He was the distributor tonight along with the scorer along with being the scorer Big win for coach and his program Again I said music a statement win earlier Just a great effort here in a really really good ball game tonight against two good teams So its the five to3 lead for the ACC in this challenge Marcus Burton with the 18 points and the 10 assists Big plays down the stretch music None bigger than finding Cole Serta a couple of times for game clinching triples music He was he was fantastic tonight Again you poked the bear and the bear woke up music and he had fire in his eyes and he closed the game out Notre Dame a winner Hope you enjoyed it He certainly did for Rodney Terry and the entire crew
