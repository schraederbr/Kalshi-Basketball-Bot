on the offensive glass something both teams want to do get some Second Chance opportunities he got up high that time McLaughlin and theres an offensive foul called on Rhode Island the defense by the Eagles and the Freeman three though moments ago now and thats right there not bad defense again hes a guy thats below 30 percent on the year early from the threepoint line not a bad closeout by Aston Langford but a pretty good offense in spacing by Rhode Island picker staff for the Eagles Here Comes Ashton Lankford elbow jumper no Hometown roll Applause expect Rhode Island to run transition thats something Earl Grant talked about we cannot give up a transition buckets to Rhode Island lets try to get them in Long possessions a lot of that come from not turning the ball over did you not want to give up any live ball turnovers to this Rhode Island team but Allen playing the four guards Leggett hoisting and hitting it he can hit those acrobatic shots as we told you in the open came at Allens all turning team I tell you right now he is one of the most difficult shot makers we talked about it in the open thats going to be the key matchup for Boston College he averages close to 20 a game thats a tough pullup jumper fading away by Ish tomorrow Lake for just checking in finds his brother Makai in the post good Court Vision by Damar Lake yeah were seeing some high quality offense early on by both teams Eagles shooting 43 percent this fire Here Comes Jayden Zachary BC is pushing the pace Zachary in the front Court Langford coming off a belt with the flu played three games this year high entry pass for CJ Pena and its out of bounds so the langfords with Tamar Langford body is brother Makai Ashley thats a good combo for the Eagles love seeing it pretty good crowd this afternoon and you know right now thus far both teams performing pretty well on the offensive side I think its a bit of a frenetic base probably something that we both didnt expect and coaches are looking to push the tempo early BC basketball Chas Kelly double zero in gold in the game kayash to Lake for driving the lane wild shot and balow pulls down the rebound for the Rams Here Comes Legend to Freeman the fade away nicely done on the Baseline I talked about the backcourt matchup in this game the Rhode Island guards uh have a really good pullup game that time in transition stop on the dimes excellent under control stop and pop jumper Lake for transfer from Providence tomorrow Lake for trying to back in Applause fade away too strong Applause transitioned again for the Rams what a block for their weak Side by Asta Langford outstanding defense Music punched Away by Leggett well this is what he brings a Makai Ashton Langford again BC late on the transition D but Langford bails them out thats a great individual hustle play to break up would look like was going to be an easy uncontested layup that was Malik Martin who got blocked transfer from Charlotte senior 66 averaging seven points Mason Matson back in for the Eagles so Matts into Ashton Langford and Kelly the backboard Ashton Langford up and under rebound by McLaughlin hes harassed and fouled the BC recipe for Success what is it well dont give up easy buckets and that basically is dont turn the ball over you cannot let Rhode Island get out into transition off of live off turnovers and then get the first rebound Rhode Island a very good offensive rebounding team Earl Grant said we must do a good job on the defensive last and then take care of the basketball again a lot of that has to do with getting deep into shot clock look they realize theyre not a great threepoint shooting team right now dont settle for the first jumper work the shot clock try to get the ball into the paint also free throw shooting has been a problem 64 at the line for the Eagles McLaughlin one out of two its only the eighth time hes been in the line this year Lockton coming up terrific career high game against Wyoming in the nine blocks its a block party weve been blocked and well theyre going to need a lot of it today especially with this back court of Rhode Island theyve been impressive early on as you take a look again at another uh Drive uh by Freeman hes got great body control and his ability to finish through contact has been impressive early on what a shot first lead for the Rams Kelly the three freshman from Houston in and out Palau pulls down the rebound but in every pass two overzealous Freon Freeman George Washington transfer some special moves yeah that crossover right there again cross them freeze them and then go back to your right thats a tough shot I cant really call that bad demon thats a guy that really going to his right fading away but thats great body control and concentration Again by Freeman hes only shooting 30 up early thats into Kelly Applause Rams mantoman Kelly is fade away rebounded golf by Weston Music like it running thats a better job in transition D that time by Boston College you can see the strategy for Rhode Island theyre trying to get out on misses get early offense before BC can get set up Applause Abdul Sam in the game for the Rams wearing one in navy blue shot is good its a twoparter this time for legend you see on a scoreless drought of three plus minutes they missed their last five shots in the Rams have capitalized yeah and thats a breakdown by Zachary that time uh uncharacteristic Lego is the one guy you cannot uh leave alone nice little pass out of the post that time its been legit and Freeman the offense for Archie Millers Rams McLaughlin in the post out of bounds you see ball oh this back work thus far early on is as built I said it was going to be a fun matchup uh thats a big time pullup and right here thats a missed opportunity though for Boston College McLaughlin that time cut off his role to the basket Music Factory inbounding Applause Lookout kayashta Lake for Keeps alive from Matson a three and the drought continues what a pass by Leggett to Freeman for a touchdown you cannot run transition offense any better ball did not touch the ground at all one pass led to a one dribble layup excellent execution in transition by Rhode Island six to nothing Run for the Rams laying by McLaughlin no good your eyes playing with energy they have the excitement going on the far sideline well theyre getting Boston College in balance that time uh Makai Aston Langford goes for to gamble and thats just beautiful transition offense uh when you take think about a running transition offense very few dribbles uh one dribble on that possession right there it led to a layup uh Archie Miller has to be happy with how his team has performed early on on offense Rams shooting 67 percent to skip pass by Leggett to Weston Seton Hall transfer Miller is buying the transfer portal like many around college basketball Freeman Applause he sees drought at two and a half minutes without a Bucky Zachary to the rack and contact we will have a media timeout so BC is off kilter for the floor shooting three for 14 whats their answer coming back Music eat fresh refresh just wont stop now Subway doing a great job on this staff and we had a chance to talk with Coach Miller about him and said really just love was what he brings to the table and hes still in pretty good shape too it looks like he can go out there and still get a few buckets certainly does and I coach Miller said hes future head coach and its just a matter of time and he loves the connections he brings in the Northeast recruiting it was an excellent addition to the URI staff Jaden Zachary converts Eagles Trail by three why has their offense struggled well right now I think the biggest thing is theyve missed a couple of buttons right theyve had some opportunities a couple of layups they just missed uh should have been a couple of and one situations and then defensively transition defense is going to be key in this game against Rhode Island uh theyre getting out pushing the pace and then defending that guy right there rebound 5050 win by the Eagles bicker stop gives it back to him Skips a pass to Zachary lets move in the paint wow outstanding body control by Jayden zacher great offensive possession thats what Earl Grant said he wanted guys passing up twos open twos to get better opportunities at the basket thats what Zachary did on that last play he could have easily took the first look decided to use a little head fake work the ball into the paint right here again this is what Earl Grant talked about dont settle for that jumper get into the paint higher percentage shot and thats beautiful offense by Boston College thats a difficult reverse layup though by Zayn and Zachary made it look easy and the Mantra is give up a good shot for a better one we heard that from Earl Grant a couple days ago thats his brand of BC basketball and part of that is it works the shot clock again so often teams take the first look they get unless youre wide open underneath and you gotta layup work the ball around get Rhode Island deep into the shot clock try to fatigue them with your ball movement and then get a higher percentage shot Applause eagles with some nuke foul life Triggers on defense Ashton Lake for down the lane for the laying in the foul and then one Makai Aster Lake for the steal to the transition score well we said right at the top this was going to be a good back court matchup back and forth right here Makai Ashton Langford read The Gap and then this is just great body control eyes on the rim the entire time and it was so huge that he decided to come back to Boston College Earl Grant and staff Rave about his leadership and his ability to change the game with his defense hes leading BC with 132 points per game and he has to go a long ways for the 30 plus minutes as well because injuries have filed up Eagles lost Donald hand a highly touted freshman guard he is out Jazz Kellys an inexperienced backup so they rely upon Makai Ashley for a lot in the post Double T skip pass and thats too strong for the wing ball loose good job I asked to Langford to come up with it after the mark missed three you see riding a seven to nothing run over the last 90 seconds Jayden Zachary gets doubled but good pass to Bickerstaff who missed it thats got to be an M1 Bickerstaff knows that hes such an important piece of what Boston College does but right here uh the hustle play by Makaya Ashton Langford great Hands by Bickerstaff and then your leader on the floor leading to break this right here though has got to be this is what Im talking about thats got to be an am one a bicker staff he knows he wants that one back right there beautiful setup pass but that has to be two for Boston College that was Rory Stewart 15 to navy blue defending him in the post who just blew a chance of an easy layup on down the other end when he can secure the pass heres a turnover by BC look out Freeman in transition no good but contact they call the bucket at goaltending and this is what Earl Grant was concerned about live ball turnovers cant do it Rhode Island just too good in transition and their backcourt they are uh really difficult in the open port the 15th annual womens ACC Big Ten challenge begins Wednesday with Pittsburgh hosting Illinois at five but were featuring the second game top 10 matchup between number four Ohio State and Haley van lit number 10 Louisville right here on acc network of the ESPN app hcco its a 1013 alltime advantage in this series should be a great night of Hoops that time Boston College decided to just post up Jaden Zachary and again sometimes you just got to simplify your offense Jaden Zachary with a size Advantage oh let your bigger guard go to work in the post a heads up play and offense by Boston College Freeman turn around hungry from buckets rebound by damara Lake for Freeman five for eight from the field he has 11 points to lead all scorers and a steal look out here comes Joseph Palau with power defense triggering offense Ive been impressed with Palau now he has come up with a steal there hes made some nice passes out of double teams as well and been very active on both of the defensive and offensive blasts malawajuko transfer Applause Armani Mighty in the game for the Eagles Lamar Langford Baseline CJ Penas been a good addition from division two this right here again below uh Biggs now are asked to do so much in ball screen coverage comes out heads is hard and comes up with uh the turnover and slam lets rip the rim off right there my goodness but again hes been very active and I think uh the numbers you look at it right there Freeman and the get 15 points rest of the team only two thats okay though thats the formula for Rhode Island we knew their backcourt that was going to provide most of the offense I think the other guys though defensively have been solid Mighty guarding allow wild hook shot Here Comes Chaz Kelly for the Eagles fourstar recruit out of Houston Kelly Nifty dribbling the runner is good boy if he can give him that on a couple occasions that would be beneficial thats so important having a midrange game thats a nice floater that time by the freshman only averaging three points shooting 35 percent and we have a foul on the Eagles Chaz Kelly take gets a screen for Pena yeah hell capitalize on that BC leads by two BC is over five from three today Malcolm but theyre not overly reliant on the three this year yeah neither team really are relying on the three balls you take a look at the numbers uh both teams below uh six uh threepoint field goals made per game so you can tell the strategy for both teams they want to work the ball around either get out in transition or in their half court get the ball inside the paint has been a back and forth Affair both teams trying to push the tempo good to have you with us on the HTC Network Malcolm Huckabee Im John Mita perel dribbling kept Alive by Freeman Lake Martin follow and contact in the post our money Mighty golf the foul hes a relatively inexperienced basketball player former soccer player in high school well theyre high on him but right here no blockout by Boston College in Rhode Island With Another Second Chance opportunity foreign at the line for the Rams Music next weekend we have Duke and North Carolina on HCC Network and the ESPN app its Saturday the number eight Blue Devils host BC at Cameron Indoor coverage begins at 4 Eastern Sunday the number one Tar Heels take on Virginia Tech in the second game of our doubleheader that starts at one Easter should be a great afternoon of hoop Earl Grant some anxious moments but he has to be pleased with the first 12 and a half minutes and theyre battling injuries with posts and a lick Bay at hand Malik Bay they hope to get back soon might be back in the swing of things before the end of December and same thing with post I think post is really the big one look you lose your seven footer hes a guy that also can space the floor and obviously rebounding oh thats huge for Boston College but theyve been battling injuries Earl Grant making no excuses but certainly hes without a large portion of what they want to see as you take a look at Quentin post uh their seven foot center uh any Booth they said hes a daytoday week uh maybe a week or two away but certainly theyre looking forward to getting all three of those guys back into their lineup thats it with a turnover Rams back in the front Court Martin trying the runner blanket defense by Matson cut off the itch thats great defense and also a lot of times you see guys block it punch it out of downs and looks good on camera but you dont gain possession excellent job to keep possession equally good job by Led it but he traveled got ahead of himself BC defense A Renewed commitment for Earl Grant and his staff yeah and its certainly both teams thats what they want to do but this right here again you rarely see that a guy block a shot keep it in bounds and gain possession a heads up play and the late great Phil Russell would appreciate that one right there one of the best that blocking and then regaining possession I think matsons going to be an instrumental part of this team especially as we move on towards the ACC portion of their schedule they bring them in from Cincinnati to be a consistent threepoint shooter they didnt have that last year outside of Jayden Zachary elbow jumper by Ashton Lankford but if he can give them anything on the defensive end it will be a bonus yeah and thats really both teams struggle in that area Rhode Island and Boston College uh threepoint shooting you talked about it uh you know less than uh five threes made per game and uh they struggle dont shoot a high percentage again when you get in the conference play Youre gonna need guys to be able to knock down some perimeter shots good take by brayon Freeman he is aggressive Malcolm he gets going between the circles hes tough to slow down downhill Shifty uh theres been a long line of Rhode Island guards that are really good this guy is fun to watch and always in attack mode 13 points for Freeman Leggett stuck on four he has the ball Music twoman game deep three Leggett Jazz Kelly the board would you like shot yeah it is I mean good hes shooting close to 40 uh hes a guy that for Rhode Island but thats in Rhythm dribble Drive kick is a little deep but and hes your main scorer thats not a bad look if youre Archie Miller CJ Pena Nifty Up and Under And swatted Out of Bounds the Big Fellas showing a handle well this has been the problem area for Boston College keeping Freeman out of the paint no Communications and thats a great little block out that time and then here great defense thats great team defense by Rhode Island but again in that situation you would like to regain possession Malik Martin swatting it out of bounds nine seconds to shoot for the Eagles Ryan OConnell Jeff Anderson Tommy Morris see the officiating crew nicker staffs been quiet cut him off he fights for the 5050 Ashton Langford just beats the clock and the rebound for the Rams wow what a block by TJ Bickerstaff off the drive by before that there was contact and a foul on Ashton Langford and a TJ Bickerstaff come out of nowhere he did but Freeman again look at this he takes little time to get the ball up the court hes flying crossover a transition d uh cant say it enough in this game in particular with this backcourt uh Freeman hes looking to push the pace every time huge addition to the portal for Archie Miller Brian Freeman leaving George Washington to come to Kingston Rhode Island Applause and thats just the college basketball now you have to mine it so well and looks like he hit a gold on this one we saw a guy yesterday on the network Wake Forest is Steve Forbes they call him the transfer portal Guru Ty Appleby is going to be a very good player for Wake Forest and Im looking forward to see him match up against some of these good ACC backwards but certainly thats just the name of the game right now in college basketball have to keep up with the Joneses thats for sure Jayden Zachary down the lane harassed and punched away Sebastian Thomas hes out of Providence the teardrop is good that was pretty he ran out like an NBA guard beautiful floater that time under control drive by Pena knifing through the lane both teams try to get downhill this is just a great Indigent individual play right here come up with the steal nobody picked up the ball and a lot of guys might have tried to get deeper into the lane realize the big was back there nice little floater with touch Music Franz largely was five Zachary good catch by Damar Langford Lucero grant for instructions the defense thus far by the Rams its been pretty good and they forced Boston College into some difficult twos on the Rams you see a twominute 14 seconds scoring drought it was on Thomas damara Lake for eyeing a free throw Applause John the number that Im watching in this one and based on the game I would think hey Rhode Island might have an advantage but right now its Boston College six Rhode Island four points off the turnovers I think thats going to be key in this one we talked about both teams not particularly a high percentage from threepoint or volume so transition buckets off of turnovers I think is going to be key in this one shes awesome his three foul shots six for nine from the line for Allen three for four Leggett guarded by Zachary now Ashton Langford on Thomas Zips a pass in the lane for chiku good reach side defense Again by TJ Bickerstaff out of bounds will have their final media timeout of the first half but how about this block by bigger staff hes got active hands on the defensive end for 14 points uh one of two from the threepoint line uh right here hes just made some difficult shots floaters into Lane pulloff jumpers uh Boston College has had a difficult time keeping him out of the paint I think the other big number John only one turnover in this game thus far hes played solid for Rhode Island it is seasoned high point total is 21 their last game four days ago against Illinois State a 5744 Rams win he lost her opener against Quinnipiac that was an eyeopener for Archie Millers first game for the Rams but coming off a nice 21 tournament the Cayman Islands Turn Around by tomorrow Langford puts back picker stop no good Eagles have not made a bucket in the last 235 three side rebound Malik Martin Applause Weston with a quick trigger on the other end yeah but you know theres so much pressure being put on them because of Freeman pushing the pace again right here post up thats not a bad look just a missed shot and then Freeman is Off to the Races uh putting a lot of pressure on this Boston College defense Freeman Martin and Leggett in the backcourt with ball fake Freeman three Pena the rebound and a foul heres next weeks Conference Championship Saturday lineup coverage from Charlotte begins with ACC pm Friday at 4 Eastern and continues at nine with the Huddle Saturday a twohour pregame show the Huddle through kicks off at six Eastern and after the game head back to ACC Network for a complete Game breakdown with coach and player interviews you can always watch on ESPN app youre out and about because nobody covers the ACC like we do Applause Freeman Runner rebound tomorrow Lake for is that a good shot selection oh thats his good defense by Boston hes in the lane youre going to have to do it by committee uh there were bodies around him Applause in traffic the Glock did to Zachary but he pops it out scoreless Stroud is now 3 45 for BC Applause game of runs Malcolm its been tilting back and forth Applause off skipping a jump Leggett rebound blocked Pena to Zachary and hes fouled he was hounded by Freeman Tommy Mars he calls a foul physical game this afternoon uh right here both teams getting after it on the glass excellent recovery and then Zachary off again both teams theyre going to try to push the base be opportunistic when they get opportunities in transition but its going to come down to ball security no turnovers for either team and then transition d Zachary at the line last bucket scored for him was a layup at 9 33 of the first half and he rolls at home to tie the game eighth time the game has been tied Applause like fruit punching the ball its GQ transfer from Alabama Freeman waning stages of the shot clock looked out Leggett launches got it what a shot dish Leggett its been quiet but then he hunts his shot and thats what he does though again Ill say it hes one of the most difficult shot makers and takers thats not bad defense by Boston College shot clock winding down thats a guy thats average and close to 20 points a game making it difficult contestant too Zachary and Ashley Lake for the twoman game screened by McLaughlin could he work off of it in the lane nice move too hard with a shot though with the rebound for chiku thats a great block out that time the Lost Art of blocking out uh keeping Boston College off the offensive glass chiku big body for the Rams Freeman patient takes it Baseline on Zachary and a steal by Pena hell advise pass Zachary the lob and the layin for Devin McLaughlin Well Done by Zachary McLaughlin all set up Jaden Zachary individual

matched up against Freeman whos really been having it going in this first half uh uh the backcourt to Boston College in particular Zachary and also Makai Aston Langford how they match up against those two guys I think thats going to be the key to this game this afternoon technical foul has been given to a BC assistant coach were going to get an explanation from Jeff Anderson Applause the Leggett yeah shooting the technical foul free throws so indirect it was one of the assistants on the bench of Fort Boston College got a technical foul some not so uh Thanksgiving words were said he said that with a smile so so Im glad hes got a good sense of humor about it but I dont think thats going to happen again and thats really cost the game going back and forth and now you give up two freebies huge uh certainly that is not something that you want to do in this situation if youre a Boston College big momentum swing perhaps for the Rams game Within game moments what a star by that one hit the ball back after the two makes by Leggett shot clock off Zachary hounding him the screen and a steal by Ashton Langford finds Zachary with time and he lays it in outstanding defense by the Eagles Rhode Island blows The Possession after the technical foul and we are tied at 28 at halftime but you cannot ask for a better end uh after the technical foul Makai Ashton Langford to Jaden Zachary uh this backup backcourt matchup has been unbelievable Earl Grant joining us at the scorers table Earl good defense at the end of the half your takeaways from the first half you know um a lot of a lot of plays at The Rim we didnt execute on um I think we left about eight points out there that maybe we could have you know capitalized a little bit better got to be tougher in the paint I thought for the most part defensively we were fine they got some leak outs in transition uh where we just didnt we didnt we didnt get back in transition it got maybe two two baskets that way so we got to clean that up but overall I thought we had good effort all right Earl good luck in the second half thank you thank you Earl Grant and the Eagles some terrific moments Jane the Zachary part of it after Makai Ash the lake finds him for the easy layin were tied at 28 at halftime mean to you about exactly what they did to close the half out solid defensively get out in transition but I think thats their best offense uh right now theyre backcourt get some steals push to pace and then when you dont work the shot clock get deep into it and then get uh paint touches youre awry in the away navy blue PC in the whole gold good to have you with us at an offensive foul eight seconds into the second half much to the Chagrin of Abdus Sam and his call for the foul Sam with limited minutes to the first half the 68 freshman hes made Seven starts only the 12th foul in the entire game and thats hard to believe as physical as its been but I like how the refs theyve been consistent uh do not come into the paint a week and this one right here both teams getting after it defensively CJ Pena off the line with a threepoint attempt Penas has been a good addition to Earl Grant making his fists start averaging nine and a half points four and a half rebounds division two transfer shooting 54 percent tightly guarded by picker stop to fade away thats great defense uh by bicker staff that time staying down on the shot fakes and enforcing a contested two Kai Ashton Langford the Mason Matson pocket pass Bickerstaff those are buddies that were missed too often for PC the first time another one high percentage shots arent falling yeah the first one thats what Earl Grant talked about in a halftime interview they missed a lot of opportunities just like that uh those in this game where its tight uh you have to have those fall when you have chances that close to the basket Applause wow nice move of the post Applause Leggett cant keep it alive its saved by Madison here come the Eagles like a blur in the front Court Ashton Lake for three for jackery got it first threepointer of the game for BC cant do it any better transition offense that time Makai Ashton Langford pushing the pace draw The Defenders and then kick out uh to Jade and Zachary beautiful transition offense Zachary five for 14 on threes six plus games a misfire Applause DC matching largest lead of the game here comes bicker stop for the drive to put back by Pena now its the largest lead to the Eagles and Archie Miller wants a timeout good start for BC first two and a half minutes of the second half about display on the other end for Matson and then Makai Ash to Langford keeps his head up he finds Jayden Zachary at transition from distance Earl Grant a head coach for Boston College talked about establishing their identity and he said their identity is being tough defensively and get out and push the base off those misses uh you cant do it any better right here and then another great defensive possession by Boston College the backcourt of Jaden Zachary and Makai Ashton Langford we talked about that matchup theyve done a nice job to start off the second half I love Zachary fighting through a screen to still pick up his man and TJ Bickerstaff for BC not a great score as celt scores this far but hes doing the proverbial little things to help you win a game yeah one of the better rebounders uh rebounding forwards in the ACC uh solid Defender Music Rory Stewart in the post hes harassed ball loose Freeman launches a three and the loose ball rebound for Matson Zachary in the backcourt Ryan OConnell calls a foul on Jaden Zachary and that one right there a tough one uh but thats on the passer again Matson has to see that theres a Defender right there uh Zachary did not know there was Freeman right there Heads Up played by Freeman to come up uh with the turnover but thats not on Zachary thats on uh Matson again you cannot lead your guy into somebody if he cant see him first foul on Zachary could also by Ashton Lankford but still URI possession with eight to shoot Applause point was a free throw for urri with 28 seconds to go in the first half Leggett Marie is an air ball vickers staff has it why are the possessions coming up empty well the defense Boston College again another contested shot Jill live with that we talked about it only won three uh in the first half by either team youll live with that if youre Boston College a Rhode Island shooting contested threes tomorrow Langford coming off the flu Applause ran into a Defender at the elbow Applause thats going to be on shiku the Alabama transfer physical game again its been that type of afternoon a well played both teams uh although not a high scoring game uh physical and then the back courts really theyve done the majority of the scoring for both teams I asked in Langford Jaden Zachary and Freeman and Legette for Rhode Island Turn Around by bicker stop hes still scoreless good post defense by the Rams and approaching four minutes without a bucket in his second half rayon Freeman shiku stop snaps that string Alex chiku averaging Five Points in four and a half rebounds thats a great patient offensive possession that time by Rhode Island better not settling for a jumper almost a punch Away by Freeman delivered Eagles offense and a steal Here Comes Malik Clark art down the lane Runner got it theyre riding a mini 40 run some rejuvenation for URI triggered Again by the defense when we spoke with Earl Grant uh top of his list for keys to the game live ball turnovers cant do it uh that right there again Rhode Island very good in transition off of turnovers Applause BC now scoreless in the last 220 this is Matson and a foul that will take us to immediate time on Alex GQ hes a load at 6 11 and hes got some power Music theres been four lead changes BC has held the lead for nine minutes and 11 seconds Malcolm Huckabee its all about the guards yeah the backcourt matchup we talked about it at the top it was going to be a really good one and the key to this game and theyve delivered its been difficult uh for both they both made it really hard from the score but they made up the majority of the scoring uh in this one its going to come down to though I think uh points off the turnovers and transition points right now a Boston College 10 points off the turnovers six for Rhode Island Jason Matson the three rebound Baker staff to put Bart and an M1 my goodness TJ picker Staff first two points of the game memorable oh he is one of the better rebounders look how high he gets up for this offensive rebound and put back thats great work on the offensive Glass by TJ Bickerstaff and thats a huge bucket for Boston College bow is on Stewart his first kicker staff seven points per game also seven rebounds 13 steals for the Eagles thats first on the club Sebastian Thomas shined at times during the first half Freeman finds him and the air ball Applause Ashton Langford down the lane open three Mason Matson that one has to drop yeah you cant ask for a better look again Makai Aston Langford in transition thats a wide open three man the tank and the make hes aggressive hes got his first two of the half and PCs one for 123 this guard does these backcourts are just Ballin Freeman another tough contested two that time body control concentration eyes on the rim the whole time Zachary hell go to the line for two shots this has been strong point transition offense for Rhode Island right now they lead Boston College 17 points in Fast Break to eight for Boston College thats been a huge number for Rhode Island big reason why theyre only trailing three right now Archie Miller said I think the thing thats hurt them is the points off the turnovers in that first half Boston College had 10 points off of turnovers yeah he wanted to make sure that this game was played at the Rams Pace you know Grant said the same thing to us too they want to keep it deliberate at times although both teams have tried to push it too for the chess match in that regard its been a wellplayed defensive game both teams getting after theyve been active in the passing Lanes Applause H Legend all right away from the ball of foul they got TJ Bickerstaff thats his first and with this we talked about Quentin post the seven footer for Boston College theyre starting center out and forces bicker staff to move to that Five Spot the 50th annual womans ACC Big Ten challenge begins Wednesday with Pitt hosting Illinois at 5 Eastern featuring the second game a top 10 matchup between number four Ohio State and number 10 Louisville youre on acc Network and the ESPN app should be a great night of Hoops thank you turn over by chiku lets see fourth point lead Demar Langford walks across the timeline its a fact from Zachary and hes got two give and go BCs sixpoint lead and thats great recognition by Boston College realizing a Demar Langford has a mismatch let him go to work off the bounce largest lead of the game for the Eagles again but they foul in the post well with this lineup Boston College has a smaller lineup thats a threeman being guarded by a five and I like that matchup if youre Boston College on the other end though smart by Rhode Island realizing they have the size Advantage so theyre going to let their two bigs go to work in the post on this smaller BC lineup if I was on Devin McLaughlin whos been quiet after a career night against Wyoming urgent Islands McLaughlin had 12 points in three blocks josephat below is at the line a block to play only nine minutes in the first half Applause hes made it difficult on the Rams in the second half your eyes shooting only 30 percent tomorrow Langford trying to back in on Malik Martin take the block by Martin is that a good idea by Lankford it was but his better recovery defensively wow the put back off the line Applause out of bounds off of BC 20 on the shot clock Eagles not exactly rolling in the second half either 33 percent 33 for the game back door Malik Martin that played a Charlotte transfer threepoint BC lead thats a great set piece uh out of the out of bounds underneath uh poor communication though by Boston College no switch or help on that cross screen Martin has six points in 21 minutes Applause Chas Kelly his first run of the second half freshman trying to get too cute goes out of bounds and we will have a immediate timeout rosters for both squads as BC leads three by three points freshman dotting the roster for URI NBC yeah and I think theyre similar where theyre both trying to both coaches trying to really learn their team again Boston College we talked about of the injuries uh down uh two starters and uh with Coach Miller again theyre trying to figure out the identities team they know though uh both teams they have really good back courts Batson gets it swatted out of bounds but its a shot clock violation before that as the Eagles are strictly with another turnover battling injuries throughout for real Grant quit the Post and Prince salute day they hope to get him back by the end of December Donald and out an extended period yeah thats tough obviously down uh both those guys uh oligby and Quentin post starters uh guys that will probably be starting or playing considerable minutes in Grant hoping to get those guys back soon well theyre going to be key as they enter conference play Up and Under by Freeman Eagles are doing a good job engulfing the post their post defense has been terrific man Ive been impressed really both teams this afternoon physical game I think a wellofficiated game consistent yeah its going to come down really whos stronger with the ball and whos going to make contested shots because theres been nothing easy or uncontested in this game I asked to Langford wild shot not what theyre looking for and a foul we got Jaden Zachary back down the other way Leggett against a smothering BC defense and thats been the story this afternoon both teams uh nothing easy thats a great help uh and team defense uh something uh both coaches have stressed but Earl Grant can he said look thats going to be our identity we need to be a tough defensive Squad hunt for a really a good twos and he gives Zachary and Ashton Lake for the Breather on the bench how do they compensate well I think its the trust that he has now uh in particular Chaz Kelly um the trust that he has thats something hes talked about I felt like he played those guys way too many minutes early on uh hes like look I have to go to my bench and I have to trust uh in particular a freshman point guard and Taz Kelly get him some minutes because theyre going to need him as well when they get into ACC play log for tomorrow Lang for double teamed and they pick it off here come the Rams Leggett Freeman Jazz Kelly on him Leggett Baseline Applause again Eagles extremely active in the post but thats on Shaz Kelly first on Kelly pretty good job sliding his feet uh by Kelly here help over yeah thats a foul again referees in great position Applause your ride two minutes and 17 seconds without a hoop Joseph allow high percentage shot but hes fouled John thats twice now theyve run the same out of bounds play uh this time on the opposite side watch the cross green right here by the guard this is Cass Kelly hes got to talk to his big and slow down that cutter talk screen screen and then you have to slow down the big check him to give your guy a chance they dont communicate those are the little things okay you have a freshman Point Guardian hell learn hell definitely watch the film Earl growth talked about that but theyve been doing a lot of film sessions with this young point guard hell learn but when he gets into games like this you must communicate on the defensive side and the foul was on Devin McLaughlin well how difficult is the transition coming from high school defensively for a young Point Cook its that stuff right there you can get away with that in high school but now you got seven Footers uh setting screens you got to check them you got to talk to them theres a lot but certainly hes a talented player and theyre going to be needing a lot of minute from him off the bench he sees scoreless for the last 3 15 theyve dealt with droughts theyve withstood them tomorrow Langford blocked by Malik Martin and the 5050 win for the Rams so they come with this Leggett and he gives them the lead into that one this Leggett in transition feisty defense by URI well done turnovers uh points off of turnovers right here great individual defense uh block now turn it over your imbalance on defense thats a Gamble and theyre off to the races this guy has been impressive all afternoon this is the opportunity for a threepoint play a fight for the ball with bicker staff and below Applause now Earl Grant goes back to his starting back court its Langford Aston Langford and Jaden Zachary back into the game fifth lead change Huck he sees held the lead for 1450 URI for almost eight minutes Jayden Zachary after a couple minutes on the bench watch the lake for back in as well the low dribble not easy CJ Pena ill advise three two on one Martin against Langford and here comes BC Music missed opportunity for URI Music and a foul against Malik Martin says Brian OConnell well the one thing Boston College needs to do now any threes that they take or Jumpers or they need to have two guys back Rhode Islands doing a really good job in their transition offense theyre just pushing the ball up and theyre running somebody up on the sidelines and if Boston College is not back theyre getting some opportunities that time Boston College very fortunate they werent able to give up a two Music one on one for tomorrow Lake for after the foul on Martin his third more problems at the line for BC theyve missed five foul shots Applause Eagles at 64 clipped from the line entering the game driving a block good catchup defense by Makai Ashton Langford Blow by by brayon Freeman uh its been fun to watch this back courts uh go at it theyve been battling all afternoon thats a great recovery by Makai ask and Langford and he just drops below who almost collided with his bench a long gliding Joseph fat Palau Applause all teams tenacious on the defensive end reflect him in the shooting percentages URI 34 percent DC 30 Sebastian Thomas got it he hit that one from Providence second threepointer for the team Thomas is from Bishop Hendrickson High School URI has taken the lead with a 10 to nothing surge over the last four and a half minutes to Langford BC needs a hoop keeps it alive Here Comes Malik Bart but a giveaway they blow a fast break opportunity its been a frenetic pace Rhode Island with Sebastian Thomas his first three of the top Rams up by four Music are your headlights cloudy at oxidized Malcolm Huck could be a Mason Matson missing a three yeah but its the transition defense I think thats the big issue and fast break points for Rhode Island right now Rhode Island 17 fast break points Boston College only eight thats the difference in the game right now Rhode Islands doing a great job in their transition off of Misses Boston College as I said earlier you have to have two guys back and you cant go for the gamble skill Steel on the first pass because theyre letting Runners get behind them for some easy opportunities Jaden Zachary in the backcourt with Makai Ashton Lankford heels up Devin McLaughlin TJ Bickerstaff and damara Langford joining them do you like the defensive pressure by Rhode Island well theyve been a solid all afternoon both teams really I like this matchup right here though by Boston College its the look theyre looking for right well McLaughlin has a smaller player on them and thats great recognition by Boston College right here again let him go to work thats giving up a lot of size but back to Earl Grants a halftime interview said look weve missed a lot of easy buckets like that thats got to be two points or an and one situation if youre Boston College theyve had a lot of those and a lot of points left on the board Devin McLaughlin trying the foul for Breon Freeman Freemans third Applause and mcglockton converts twopoint game see the fouls eight for Rhode Island Seven for the Eagles Applause timeout situation three for BC two for Rhode Island Archie Millers Rams are two and four and I like to change up by Earl Grant go to a little 23 matchup Zone Rhode Island has struggled shooting the ball from the perimeter keep them out of the paint crafty moved by Freeman McLaughlin crashes 5050 ball who wants it its Weston fight with the kayash to Langford and a jump ball on the Arrow Rams basketball well Boston College got a good change right they got forced to contested jumper Maddox secured a ball right here uh great work by Rhode Island on the offensive glass its a fight but again the change of Defense by Boston College deliberate offense Rhode Island slowing it down against the 23 matchup Applause Freeman for Thomas you can hit that shot too hard this time TJ Bickerstaff good outlet for Jayden Zachary Music backing down on Thomas and another tie up DC possession Martin fighting for it nobody wants to let go the ball reps somebody has to let in its been that type of uh afternoon really I can appreciate how both these teams uh its been physical all uh afternoon Music right here Boston College electing to post up Zachary and its a fight like I said come out of half do not come into the paint if youre soft its been physical in there all afternoon says that 1993 basketball or 2022 oh I like it and the refs have been consistent all afternoons Jayden Zachary well Off the Mark gj Bickerstaff missed another golden chance those type of opportunities have been short supply BC has not hit a shot in their last nine attempts another missed opportunity right there again a bickerstaffed a great on the offensive glass unable though to secure the ball and now Boston College showing a little threequarter court pressure the Eagles are only down by two they havent been a field goal in more than seven minutes Testament to their defense Valance scoring drugs 225 Joseph papalau and off and an offensive foul says Jeffrey Anderson its on Palau and you know you filed when theres no argument from the bench or the player take it in normally yeah normally guys you know theyll try to contest it but yeah hes moving right there I mean you cant do it on the screen thats right in front of refs Zachary the high dribble tomorrow Lake for the take and the make off the bounce for Jamar Lankford its the 11th tie of the day Applause five for tomorrow late for seven for his brother Makai Boston College back in the matchup zone rayon Freeman you know it Music what a shot crayon Freeman its had a quiet second half but that was a burst well again coming into this game shooting 23 from the threepoint line uh but thats a huge three offensive foul against Jaden Zachary good call I like to see it again a lot of contact but good decision by Demar Langford not to settle for the jumper right there on the previous possession and then right here thats a deep three by Freeman thats what you want if youre playing Zone you want to force them into jumpers the percentages would say you want that if youre Boston College but Freeman has been huge all afternoon uh for Rhode Island Freeman has two of their threes theyve only hit three out of 14 it is another attempt brought rain to Chestnut Hill thats a good contest by Makai Aston Langford on that previous play again theyve done this multiple times trying to post up Zachary bad angle right there again hard to tell but this refereeing crew has been consistent uh certainly a big break for Rhode Island for blank fruit on the Baseline Applause been hustled by Demar to track it down after the lot by Zachary and thats a missed opportunity uh that passes on point lankfords wide open here screen no communication hes open but he throws it on the wrong side another athletic catch by tomorrow Langford Music where are the Eagles going on this possession right now Im going to your guard youre back work put him in the high ball screen situation and let him go make a play playing fruit Applause and their rebound by Malik Barton Applause Eagles shooting 23 percent in the second half five for 22 theyve only made one three in six attempts one of their last 11 for the field Joseph Applause for Freeman looked out Bickerstaff Taps it to Ashton Langford Applause and punched away in a foul so the eagles with frustration on the offensive end Somethings Gonna Give in the final 309 TJ Bickerstaff off of his foot and then brayon Freeman with a dagger Music challenging schedules ahead but BC and Rhode Island are locked at an oldfashioned pitchers duel so to speak well I think both coaches have found out a lot about their teams and for me the biggest thing is is that you got some guys that will compete I think the question marks for both teams really is threepoint shooting both have struggled shooting the ball from the perimeter and then turnovers I think both coaches talked about that Rhode Island right now 14 turnovers for the afternoon Boston College 11 uh backwards solid I think threepoint shooting for both teams is going to be a concern moving forward foul before the break was against Malik Barton is fourth so hes dealing with that issue is Ashton Langford hits the two big ones for the Eagles the first points in 215 Applause whats the defensive strategy in the final two plus minutes for the Eagles Force contested twos do not give up layups or offensive rebounds Brandon Weston Seton Hall transfer traveled what happened there Archie Miller knew it uh again you know its a good call when either uh of the coaches argue it uh he knew it right away uh this good defense uh Boston College the backcourage again they denied the guards make somebody else make a play they were able to force a turnover shes been outscored 1918 in the second half adson drops it off for TJ picker staff Baseline a double team by the rams look out Matson pretty good luck couldnt get it to go how many high percentage shots of the Eagles Miss theres been a lot and theyre getting credit a lot of it to Rhode Island their defense uh again I cant say it enough both have been a really good at contesting at The Rim a lot for Palau triple team and hes fouled good idea Joseph at Palau and how he got open watch how good this screen is set a good screen I always tell young players best way for you to get open go screen for your teammate below sets a good screen and then rolls hard to the basket great set of hands and forces Boston College to put him on the free throw line foul was on Matson his first Applause weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help the switcher ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective snap a picker take a video tag it with a hashtag all the devotion and post it to your social and just might see it on accn Applause problems at the line for the Rams now its on Boston College Im putting the kayas and Hank Lankford with the ball let him make a play just like that Devin mcglock did the runner hes got seven points another lead change thats your sixth Zachary on the ball foul says Tommy Morrissey Applause and this has been Boston Colleges best back offense right here uh double beautiful pass and floater by McLaughlin this right here though not a good foul uh by Jade and Zachary again love his aggressiveness just dont want to put a look at on the freethrow line thats your fourth foul uh they can ill afford not to have him on the court and also you dont want to put Rhode Island on the freethrow line and if youre looking for a threepoint threat late hes your guy Jayden Zachary shot 39 percent for three last year its leading the eagles with 15 points but another big Miss at the line Rhode Island coming up dry Leggett one out of two 12th tie of the game its been fun in Chestnut Hill Jayden Zachary walks it across the front Court in a timeout well take a 30second timeout do not go away were right back at it after this Music spots and pressure points on your mattress if youre Rhode Island Im almost trying to deny a ball out of his hands let somebody else make a play Boston College I think has been pretty good running some type of pinned down action for him get the ball in his hands and then put him in the ball screen I like putting uh uh Makai Aston Langford in a ball screen situation or Jaden Zachary let those two guys make a play Zachary with a basketball Applause Music to Devin McLaughlin and off Ashton Langford oh wide open mcgruckton the beneficiary good call Malcolm and thats it again uh thats the luxury and the importance of having a leader a guy thats been around making decisions into games like that beautiful pass by Makai Ashton Langford Devin McLaughlin hes an X Factor for the Eagles he has nine Leggett the take below trying to put back along with the Westin they missed some bunnies Double T for Legette no kept alive Leggett tracks it down foul on BC the put back opportunities for the Rams a frenetic situation I mean my goodness if you dont love these end of game situations like this the coaches dont like them like that theyre nervewracking but man they are getting after it we love second third fourth opportunity guys battling out good no calls by the refs and then the tip out well again uh getting the loose ball Applause timeout BC Applause so 363 on the clock and the Eagles lead by two what is Earl Grants philosophy now well first and foremost uh you must block out on the defensive board any miss you must have the ball you cannot give up another Second Chance opportunity and then make her Miss obviously it changes things if its a tie ball game youre going to have an opportunity to probably hold for the last shot if he misses again so often I see teams turn the ball over in this situation secure the ball do not try to make a long home run pass if you dont have it secure it but it starts with blocking out if youre Rhode Island right now obviously Legette after free throw line you need him to make both these free throws and then you need to stay home stay solid I would say dont let Makai Ashley get the ball make somebody else make a play for Boston College fantastic defense down the stretch for BC theyve held the URI to no field goals in the last four and a half minutes Big Shot for Leggett double figures in all seven games for him hes at 10 points he had 34 against Tulane five days ago a career high now one point lead BC what do you got Huck well right now if youre Rhode Island you still have a chance uh you dont have to foul okay theres a differential of six but they elected to foul uh you could have gone for a steal and then if you dont get it okay then you obviously the time is not in your favor uh in that situation I would have liked to see them get it out of Jaden Zacharys hand try to get it out of his hand get it into one of the bigs whos not as good of a free throw shooter uh Jayden Zachary and Makai Aston Langford the two better free throw shooters for Boston College 85 percent or a minor coming up next East Carolina at number five Virginia the Cavaliers have been rolling under Tony Bennett Jane Gardner star for the Cavs used to play at East Carolina Zachary one of two all right defensively where are you going well youre not following obviously its going to be in the hands of this guy right here Freeman and Legette Applause timeout Archie Mulla Miller full timeout 192 left shot clock off Thriller at Johnny forum and this stifling defense for the Eagles one of their last nine for the floor for the Rams no field goals in the last 442 why is that app great defense again a lot of people will look at and say ah neither of these teams shoot the ball really well yes thats true but Ive been impressed of the defensive intensity and the pressures there have been very few open looks in this game I think defensively for Boston College Im almost blitzing on a ball screen I want the ball out of the backboard of Rhode Island theyve accounted for over 80 percent of the offense in this game uh Im getting it out of Legette legettes hand and make someone else or Freeman get it out of their hands and make somebody else make a play for Rhode Island Id almost have them deny on the inbounds uh in that situation but if youre Boston College uh you cannot file and then you need all Five Guys on a defensive glass the options are limited thats the problem for Archie Miller at the moment offense has been in short supply it really has been but theyre back for it I tell you what uh he said hes still trying to learn his team uh what Ive learned from watching them is hes got two really good guards and its legit and brand feet Freeman yeah thats going to keep them in some games and I think thats why theyll be a tough out in the Atlantic 10 but first things first you have 19 seconds to try to pull off a tire pull off a lead with a three man guarded by tomorrow late for Freeman wow Nifty dribbling rebound McLaughlin and a foul in the backcourt he had a shot couldnt pull it off that would have been acrobatic it really was fake like he was going to do a dribble handoff but watch this over here and then he goes it was a beautifully set up play this there thats his good team defense and then McLaughlin uh hes been impressive uh on uh both ends of the glass for Boston College and thats a big time rebound seven rebounds for Devin McLaughlin you and I talked about hes going to be instrumental for BC this year theyre going to need him especially on the defensive end he rolls at home a threepoint Eagle lead Applause now depending on this uh lets see how Earl Grant decides to play it uh where it will he foul youre up three will he go and choose to side to foul in this situation money at the line from McLaughlin says no foul in the front Court three by Leggett no rolling out of bounds and that does it a gritty win for Boston College both teams playing hard BC outscoring URI by four the second half Malcolm Huckabee terrific defense great job my friend
