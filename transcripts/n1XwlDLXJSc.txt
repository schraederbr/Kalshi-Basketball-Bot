Duke wins 6564 Blue Devils 124 32 in the ACC off to Louisville here is Mike Wes thank you very much we welcome you to the KFC Yum Center how about that finish in Chestnut Hill Chris patola you know this league this year man is topsyturvy uh that obviously a good example of that man yeah a Duke survival by one at Connie forum and now Wake Forest and Louisville as our triple header of mens Hoops rolls out here on acc Network and Matt Marsh with a lob he gets a lot of those from Tyree Appleby to start the scoring and its too easy to start I mean lets just get that out of the way I mean Appleby who controls the game particularly off of that high ball screen freedom of movement and then like you said I mean weve seen a ton of dunks for marsh this year and then a Louisville turnover ripped away by damari Monsanto who is always ready to let it fly check out the Wake starters Appleby at the controls for the Demon Deacons and theres the three from the quarter from Andrew Carr the Delaware transfer you know weight spacing I think is is the key to Tire offense so when you have a ball handler as good as Appleby who could really carve up a defense this way chorus offense is tough to defend big concern for Kenny Payne and Appleby one half of the great point guard matchup in this one as Mike James misses from Deep coming off a big game Tuesday in the one point loss to Syracuse Appleby can stroke it as well wide left but an offensive rebound by the seven foot one Marsh the ten and five two and two in League action coming off a nine point loss on the road at Carolina on Wednesday thats cleared by Sydney current Applause L Ellis directs Louisville he has a ton on his plate for the cards like Gap will be a top four scorer James coming off the big game as well and a second consecutive start for the Freshman Kamari lands and another turnover from Brandon Huntley Hatfield Monsanto connects and what a start for Wake Forest candy timeout I mean the turnovers are junior high turnovers I you know I hate to be harsh but a problem all year for Louisville hes just handing the ball over on a platter success looks different for everyone which means the path to success also looks different for 75 years University of Maryland Global Campus has helped adults succeed youre not waiting to win youre ready to succeed again at umgcedu buying pan sucks it should not be this difficult these just came in theyre the only pant from fabletics fourway stretch done always stretch youre going to feel the difference thank you two guards who are task to do a whole lot for their teams Chris yeah LL is the name who should be familiar to folks who watch Louisville last year a guy who I thought started to come on at the end of last season had a very productive offseason hes had a lot on his plate this year turnovers been an issue and then this guy he is electric he controls the game with his handle that high ball screen Waits spacing has created a lot of room for him to operate its been one of the five best players in this league yeah the spacing is what jumps out to you you said that to Steve Forbes today on shoot around you know part of it is they can make shots although theyre not a knock down three shooting team struts the four to shoot it but theyre disciplined in it Mike and they put a lot of pressure on the defense because Appleby is so Dynamic off for the ball screen its a willing passer can knock down a three and hes very very good and quick to the basket meanwhile fourth possession for Louisville a couple of turnovers already you said not ones that were essentially forced either for Kenny Paynes group Music theres James off the bounce spinning on cam Hildreth and the tip wont go for curry second ever from James and he will go to the line with a chance at three the very talented redshirt freshman sat out all last year tore his Achilles before the season he has talent though and when youre trying to find the bright spots in this Louisville season Mike James is that guy a redshirt freshman who has uh he started to come off you know and the thing you love about him hes got a great attitude you know I think its been a push pull all year for a team that you know losing starting to become a habit Mike James plays hard hes got a good attitude about himself Kenny Payne told us in his office what about an hour ago that if he had five Mike James on the floor he would be a very happy man wake by six Appleby with assists on all three wake buckets so far these first three minutes LL this is draped out him curry with a hard hedge Monsanto from Deep came up short Curry one arms the rebound who else has to step up for Louisville Applause Music Applause Music that I think youve been waiting for since his freshman season as Jalen Withers Off the Bench Colby to the cup for two you know Withers a guy who he goes for 107 against Syracuse but in the two games prior against Kentucky and NC State he didnt have a field goal guy who struggled last year I mean its just you know theres been such an up and down inconsistency to Withers but but hes another one of those guys that youd love to maybe see him pop as you get into conference play here JJ Trainor gets tagged with the foul there coming off the Louisville bench as well its a hard answer its a hard question to answer though Mike yes with this Louisville roster two and 13 start 04 in the ACC coming off another Heartbreakers that one point loss here at home against Syracuse on Tuesday and that mad scramble of a finish trout wanted to carry Monsanto never shot like we told him hes got another threepoint mate he is a real wild card for them and I emphasize Wild hes an irrational confidence guy but I love that dude I mean theres an attraction to him because hes really talented lands on a Baseline Drive no at 38 from three for 30 in Black hes got good positional size at six six does get caught for the travel here and it sends us to a timeout with wake up by eight just over four minutes

Music interactive Fitness mirror Music foreign Music Our Food Lion Food For Thought damari Monsanto when hes going good its perfectly rational it is left I dont know if its perfectly rational its rational now look he plays with a ton of confidence and when youre a shooter like he is you kind of have to be 75 of his shots are from the threepoint line thats what he does youve got to make him put it on the floor and dribble because turnovers you know hes got to Value the ball more I think thats the one issue that if youre Steve Forbes youd have with him you take the Carolina game as an example I mean you look at the volume of Threes hes made or attempted rather if you look at the Carolina game their last game might for example like his turnovers seemed louder than others like we were saying to Steve Forbes today you know not all turnovers are created equally and it seems like his at times because you dont know sometimes what hes gonna do with the ball but hes really talented hes got good size Steve Forbes has told him you can lead the country in threepoint percentage if youre taking the right shots LL is slices to the cup for two for Louisville and youre going to get them especially with their spacing and that guy Tyree Appleby directing the offense Maria says so far for Appleby without a turnover Carr shot out by trainer Carr back out for Davey and Williamson and turn them over and back on the deeps and Louisvilles Defense Forces a stop and thats what Im saying you know theres a difference in turnovers I mean that ones its a bad turnover and we talked about Louisville turnover has been an issue for Wake as well that one at least a dead ball so you get to set your defense the problem in the second half of that North Carolina loss is they led to a lot of runouts their turnovers Steve Forbes talked about the pressure that Carolina put on as that second half went along and he felt like his team wilted against that defensive intensity from the heels with it down by six just over five minutes into this first half Ellis moves it for James another extra pass for Withers in Off the Bench Applause and Ellis does not its a shot clock violation and Ellis is frustrated with Jalen Withers well he was handed the Hot Potato you ever play hot potato growing up you dont want to be the last one with it Mike hail his oldest time basically Jalen Withers said no no I dont want this miss here you go L have it we will let you do the lip reading there on Kenny Paynes reaction youll see Louisville change defenses they will extend they will back things into a Zone and well wake beats the Zone they handle the pressure easily and then David Williams well you cant be in a pressure like that if youre going to give up a wide open three to a guy who has shot it well of late turnovers on both sides and wake has capitalized with a dozen points off turnovers Applause Ellis pulls up on Hildreth draws back iron a lot of contact on the rebounding action between Withers and Davion Bradford who gets tagged for the foul you know as L Ellis has continued to have the year that hes having his numbers in conference play have gone down hes only shooting 30 percent from the field in conference play 39 on the year so it shows you how well he was playing hes now at the top of the scout and the result is going to dip in shooting numbers and hes at about four and a half turnovers a game which is a really high number for a guy whos directing your offense theres the entry here for trainer who had it poked Away by Applebee Trader recovers and now backs it out to Ellis trainer line track three doesnt go and a blackout from Bradford Applause Apple D Williamson Hildreth Bobby Clinton 34 in Black the Freshman Off the Bench from Sweden and Bradford the five on the floor for Steve Forbes Applause Williamson pulls it out shot clock below 10 now hildred working on Mike James loves to get into the posts and the following too strong cleared by James Brothers comes up to get it rejects the screen from Roosevelt wheeler James stumbles and walks with it and its a Louisville turnover their fifth already you know its hard hard to drive at times against wake because they really plug you know it looks like a Zone when theyre sitting there in their man and its particularly exaggerated I think here in the early going of this game because youre not afraid of really anybody outside of Ellis making a perimeter shot for Louisville Appleby checks out the Mario Monsanto returns we talked about the Louisville turnover issues and wakes had some of them as well but bottom 10 in the country for Louisville in turnover rate according to Ken palm and turnovers per game as well good strip by Ellis on Clinton but Hildreth recovers Monsanto off the shot fee wanted another but an offensive rebound and a fresh 20 for the Deeks Applause Gotta Love cam Hildreth keeps two possessions alive there couldnt handle the pass from Monsanto and then a Wake Forest foul in the open floor Music something that Kenny Paynes been harping on All Season the turnovers is talked about giving up offensive rebounds as well two two pressure points for him I mean look this is not a pad on the back I mean they have gotten better they are playing better over their last six games their offensive numbers and and a number of different categories have gone up but they have obviously with their talent level being what it is they have a very small margin for error and one of those ways you can prevent or at least give yourself a shot is by taking care of the basketball and they just havent been able to do that theyve got Fabio basili into the game The Freshman from Orlando one of the few guards on this roster his 11th game of the season Checks In off the screen from Huntley Hatfields now James draws two basily on the drive and has it blocked by Clinton Williamson ahead of the pack and he lays it in Applause scoring drought swells for Louisville here in this first half taken away on the post entry but it will stay with Louisville on the other side would wake up by 11 and some long distance Marksmanship from damari Monsanto well Monaco youre just irrational to Marty monsantos irrationally confident guy could really fill it up from Deep man hes wet North Carolina drained by Todd Williams womens college basketball on acc Network Sunday were welcome to be back to ACC Network basketball presented by Food Lion alongside Chris patola Mike Monaco with you our entire crew behind the scenes part of a triple header here on accn some news and notes from around the conference big one coming up less than an hour from now over on ESPN2 the two unbeatens atop this conference to midweek losses for a trio of top 20 teams and then tonight well see what the health is of Virginia Tech news in a little bit of a slide right now Clemson to Pitter for real Im curious to see how that game plays out you know we were talking to Steve Forbes earlier thats one of their losses they lost on the road to Clemson he said I was trying to tell anybody who would listen that Clemson is absolutely for real youve seen Pitt firsthand as well too you know they they can beat you making shots theyve proven in their last two wins that they can beat you not making shots theyre incredibly old but I think one of the things were seeing another shot clock violation on Louisville Applause I think one of the things were seeing Mike with the transfer portals if you can get them in bulk like Jeff Capel did coming into this season those guys dont care about what Pitt has been yeah you know theyre theyre about this season the only transfer in that starting lineup who was on the roster last years jamarius Burton whos having himself a heck of a season but its almost like starting over and hes got really good attitudes on that team those guys play hard and theyre good that is a massive early season matchup for those two teams both 40 Louisville meanwhile with a half dozen turnovers here these first nine minutes wake showing that one three one zone that Steve Forbes teased to us this morning he might break out Applause shot clock below 10 for Tyree Appleby whos got Kamari lands on him back out for hildrath who Rises and connects thats another three the fifth one for Wake Force Applause I like Kim Hildreth he plays the game in fatigues just a tough kid hes their leading rebounder the legal screen set by Roosevelt wheeler you know I was uh I got down a rabbit hole on Worthing England last night whatd you find its the 29th Bay Mike Monaco Im glad you asked it started out as a small mackerel fishing Hamlet really I bet you didnt know that no uh its also it was big into Flint mining back during the Stone Age uh its been around the towns been around that long did you know that Brienne of Tarth I dont know if your Game of Thrones guy its the biggest character fly have havent seen it Brienne of Tarth Folks at home will know the actress not Brienne of Tarth the fictional character the actress is from Worthing England and so too is Cam hildred finding his way onto a spatola red Wikipedia page I said you know this might be 217 at 10 22 I may need some filler whats Worthing England like mackerel and flint and Game of Thrones characters Im not well versed in Applause Midway through this first half you saw the turnovers compared to the points for Louisville and now another turnover Withers gave it away Hildreth in transition scores and Worthings own is going to the line for a chance at three Hildreth in in Matthew Marsh another guy from the UK let Marsh make a play and Ill give you some info on Cornwall but these two guys made a a major jump you know I think its one of the reasons you lose and alondis Williams and you lose a jake leravia uh outside of getting the transfer of Appleby you needed some other guys to step up Hildreth and Marsh you know got good experience last year playing a ton more minutes I think both those guys are going to be really good in a wake uniform where do you always hear from Steve Forbes with Hildreth is tough I mean I had the Duke game right before Christmas hes got his right wrist still wrapped from that still taped up he went down and he was begging his way back into the game coming off the bench after the injury and Forbes had to like push him back to sit down and wait a few minutes off the withers miss it is wake up 247 Monsanto rebound to Withers Applause its about six minutes without points for the cards Ellis has the drought continue Withers try to tip and Marsh rips it down Appleby pulls up and knocks it down Applebee Strokes another and the Wake run continues hes terrific hes absolutely terrific a guy who shot 36 percent from the field last year in Florida hes been so efficient thats the thing that stood out Music you know run for Wake Forest Kyrie app will be five points five assists one of the best scorers in the conference earlier you said hes a top five player in the league where does he fit into the mix in the ACC you know to me right now I I think he and bacon are probably the Two Front Runners from player of the year Id probably vote for bacon if it were today um but hes been terrific man he Isaiah long I mean the guard play in this league has been really good Sean Padula at Virginia Tech has been uh obviously really good thats why I say with Appleby you know his shooting percentages have gone up hes been much more efficient this year hes averaging over seven assists a game in League Play its one of those fouled players in the league Withers from the corner too strong offensive rebound Curry and he sticks it back and the drought without points of more than six minutes ends for the cards first points for Sydney Curry who does have five rebounds in the Louisville front Court Monsanto sorts of confidence to the cup got a little snarl coming back up the court hes got a lot hes got a lot going on damari Monsanto oddly Hatfield from the corner came up short offensive rebound worked by Withers and he draws a foul on cam filter thats his first the back and forth between Monsanto and Steve Forbes set to shoot around two right if Montana wanted to wear sweats and he went to see when toddler on Steve Forbes Forbes said just get changed please enough is enough Steve Forbes would say anything to us about Monsanto knowing that Monsanto was within your shot standing right there thats the relationship they have after all these years now at two different stops he is an X Factor always for the Demon Deacons to lead by 20 over eight to go in this first half here in Louisville plans with a post entry a dig down from Hildreth and a foul again on Camp over it so he picks up his second here and his fan of six seconds Music you know when Steve Forbes told us he was going to double the post today and not necessarily because youre youre scared of what Huntley Hatfield can do on the Block a lot of times you run a double because the guys not good playing out of that you know hell you could induce a turnover hes not a high assist guy swirls one now good put back from Huntley Hatfield for two love to see him come on too hes been very good in their last three games fivestar recruit coming out of high school Applause Corner three not there for Williamson but an offensive rebound and then Huntley Hatfield went up to contest Marsh and he gets tagged for the foul Matt Marsh to the freethrow line when we come back its wake by 18 first half why is Aaron happy first half have been threes theyve made six of them and theyre a good threepoint shooting team its it hasnt carried them necessarily all year theyre only making a little over eight a game and Mike look how many of these are just wide open you know theres really no sense of urgency from this Louisville defense guys just catch shot and release and then how about this step up from Tyree Appleby you know Skip Cross or the late skip cross so the late great skip prossler used to have a phrase hed call them put some threes youre so wide open you could punt them in reflecting on Coach Prossers comments watching a lot of those man yeah so much room for Wake Forest to let it fly you talked about their spacing how much of that is Steve Forbes skiing how much of it is the Players he has playing in it offensively its a cut its both theres no question that Steve Forbes emphasizes it and you know I always say the Courts you know 50 plus feet wide the best teams make it use all of it and what they do a good job of is those two Wing players they gravitate down towards the corners its an old Mike DAntoni scheme where you make them guard the entire half court were just very disciplined with their spacing and by being down in the corners it spreads out the defense that much you gotta guard more of the floor flattens out the defense and then to your point you have to have shooting to keep the defense honest to stretch it Kenny Payne just got a warning I believe for the coachs box stretching the limits of it see the Louisville struggles offensively against eight turnovers here for the cards in this first half trainer backs it out for Ellis off of shopping driving past car up the window left hand Applause its a type of shots hes hes had to make its been a lot on his plate he wanted a foul as well coming back up the floor kick to the corner Williamson its exactly what youre talking about drifting down into that corner they get that shot so much and Applebees really good at making that skip and a trap on Ellis on the sideline Lance drives he kicks trainer can knock it down Curry Skies another offensive rebound from Sydney Curry a half dozen boards for the big fella thats been one bright spot in his first half seven offensive rebounds for Louisville whos kept some possessions alive Curry has been busy guy who scored in double figures in four straight games going into Christmas of course had the 19 rebounds in the win over FAMU Applebee comes up short see if Louisville can make a run here with over six to go until halftime L is driving and the blocking foul is called on Bobby Clinton Applause so thats two on the Freshman Clinton Ellis to the stripes 77 you stepped it up from last year he was below 70 hey coming up next we capped the day with number 11 Virginia hosting Syracuse part of this triple header of Hoops here on accn and the ESPN app what do you make of Virginia where theyre at right now I like Virginia I think theyve had to theres a little Fools going to Gold to start the year I think its a team that can shoot the ball well probably not as at the clip that they were early in the season you know that tournament out in Vegas where they beat Baylor and Illinois they were shooting it so well came back down to earth a little bit but I like them you know I think they defend I I think theyre you know theyre incredibly old and they are making shots more than they they were last season they get a Syracuse team that has won seven of its last eight most recently here on Tuesday Ellis split into stripe under six to go Appleby trapped and he turns it over James in the open court with a stop and Steve Forbes wants a timeout Applause its a nice read by Mike James the guy who is really starting to play well the redshirt freshman he read that play the whole way knew Appleby was going to try to come back with it a nice athletic finish in the open floor it was interesting talking with Kenny Payne he told us today in his office that there are times where hell make one of his patented it seems late night phone calls and he will call Mike James and ask him about how his coaching has been received in that he has the trust in a redshirt freshman playing for the first time off the injury that kept him out for all of last season to go to him with with those types of questions about how its resonating within the team his body language hops off the screen you know look lets begin theyre two and thirteen theyre not great and so when youre watching them to prepare youre trying to find some silver lining James is talented and I think as you look at what this roster might look like moving forward James is a guy to build around his body language his potential so we we directly asked him about Mike James Clinton from the corner that is an eight main three for Wake Forest as the six foot ten freshman gets involved Louisville on a run Wake Forest has had answers from Deep throughout this first 15 minutes Ellas summing the ball screen long three Perl Ellis hes got eight for the cards Williamson triggers his shooting has improved recently Carr battled on the boards but taken away by Ellis accelerates for James and lands cant haul in the pass and the ninth Louisville turnover Music Applause Appleby Williamson Monsanto Clinton and Bradford one through five for the Demon Deacons up by 15 Applause the early picked off by Lands Appleby back out for Clinton wants another and knock it down the rebound to Ellis Louisville being so aggressive in those ball screens hard showing and you can kind of get strung out its one of the reasons I think youve seen a lot of open threes in the half court for weight Appleby pushes good hands by Ellison then he kept it alive but threw it to the bench trying to save it great effort from LL is trying to will Louisville back into this late the first half Im a screen addicted tween here in this first half well for Danny Manning he sees the familiar old gold and black again for the first time going up against the team he was the head coach of of course for six seasons you know Danny has seen been a valuable member of every staff hes been on you know it was with Bill self for for a long time at uh at Tulsa and ultimately Kansas and then you know spent some time with Maryland uh after he was let go by Wake Forest and now I think its a great hire I actually think I think Kenny Payne had hired a terrific staff and I think this staff is going to do a really good job here when theyre able to get the guys you know get a recruiting class get into the portal a little better than they could this off season Santo too strong you saw Nolan Smith over there as well a guy you were catching up with pregame you guys have some fond memories together hes on staff there at Duke uh 2010 when we won a national championship and then 2011 Nolan was the accs player of the year when uh had a great year after Kyrie Irving got hurt nearly 21 a game that season for Nolan Smith Applause Josh Jamison as well guy who paid his dues out west bright mind in the coaching profession good staff here in Louisville land Rises cant knock it down Huntley Hatfield on the battle and tipped out to James Applause a lot of offensive rebounds in this first half for Louisville shot clock below 10 Ellis with a quick First Step kicks for trainer and the rebound to a tumbling Bradford crowd wanted a walk and instead its a foul against Louisville Applause thats it thats a good look for Louisville I mean it was a really nice pass by Elle Ellis and against this Wake Forest defense again theyre gapped up and so you really have thats the shot thats going to be there you drive that Gap you draw the two Defenders you pitch out and unfortunately Louisville two of 12 from three in this first half gapped up means what defensively for a guy driving yeah meaning youre youre youre coming in hard to help you know so youve got a guy whos in that I dont know another word for Gap yeah thats good enough for me leads to the kick out Lance backs it out for Ellis off the Monsanto Miss Applause for Huntley Hatfield James drives right by Bradford for two hes got six points to go along with five rebounds here in the first half hes got to stay aggressive you know the thing he did against Syracuse Mike he took 12 shots you got nothing to lose if you might James if you had yourself a nice first half here stay aggressive weights last bucket came at 5 26 and Appleby puts an end to that hes got such a burst hes so quick Applause Music 76 assists for Tyree Appleby lands attacks floater short gets his own Miss tried to sneak it up around Bradford and Appleby whisks it away heaves for Hildreth in transition and Hildreth finishes out of a match Scramble for way Applause Steve Forbes is barking at his team defensively now legal screen sent by Brandon Huntley Hatfield its his second foul and the 10th Louisville turnover Applause Kenny Payne trying to coach up his big man there coming up on a minute to go in this first half Applebee off the screen oval again showing hard against it five to shoot another double off the ball screen and now Williamson attacks and an offensive bout JJ Trainor takes the charge and the Louisville gets it back with 44 seconds to go well in the double those guards are small I mean Appleby and Williamson are small and youre trying to get the ball out of Applebees hands which they do a good take there I like to call nice job stepping up on the driving Williamson now what can Louisville do headed to halftime in this final minute James cant knock it down he was trying to stay aggressive Appleby the rebound he wants to slow it down with an eight second difference between game and shot clocks Applause Andrew Carr comes up to set the screen and ghosts in to the corner Williamson knocks it down a ninth three for Wake Williamson had something to say to the Louisville bench James in the waiting seconds answers right back Applause Mike James is a player now yes he is Louisville pulled tight as a team when they have that kind of an advantage yeah the season high in attempts for Wake from 3 30 against Hampton when they knocked out 15 they jack up 20 they only had two makes from long range from the Mario Monsanto but you see a big half for Damian Williamson and then that man right there Tyree Appleby as Kelsey told you seven points seven assists Louisville meanwhile the 10 turnovers only one assist they get their second assist to the Ball Game right there Mike James had a big first half yeah and he continues the trend yeah it was very good in that Syracuse game had a careerhigh 19 hes kept it going and he has stayed aggressive it only scored in double figures two times before Tuesday and now in backtoback games Monsanto on the drive on lands Applause trap on Ellis Marsh pounding him and Ellis walks with it and his first turnover not exactly sure what hes trying to do there he did have a reversal out of that hes trying to do a little too much aside from limiting turnovers for Louisville offensively what else do you need to see you gotta go theres got to be a greater sense of urgency Mike to get out on threepoint Shooters theyre Closeouts I thought were lazy and there were a lot of a lot of those threes were open shots have been tipped there stays with weight with 10 to shoot you know we asked Kenny Payne we were talking before the game are you having to coach scheme basketball are you having to coach effort and he said its about 90 percent effort which you understand I mean look theyre two and 13 its gonna take its going to have an effect on any team but you know I think some of that those threes that one there its just kind of lazy on one of the best players in the league ten points for Tyree Appleby believe that 19 for Wake Forest its about 90 seconds into the second half Ellis finds James in a high arc and three is short Marsh the rebound calling for it Appleby instead finds Carr open comes up short Huntley Hatfield the rebound Music that was shut off and he draws a foul second you asked Kenny Payne too I thought an interesting question about how much he can shape this the way he wants still while hes trying to Tinker with those things in in Year One how much of it is his pieces in place and how much can he still do what he wants Louisville basketball to be and his answer was was interesting because he was talking about how hes using players and you can kind of sell that to either recruits or ultimately guys in the portal like within an offense exactly yeah you know and putting guys you know posting your twos your threes you know because look they could slow the ball down and and try to reduce the number of possessions in the game and all of that and I dont think thats necessarily what he wants this program to be and so theres that balance between well how do we try to give ourselves a chance to be in these games and win these games and look theyve lost four games by one point man I mean theyve been they actually got to learn how to win Marsh kicks it out for Carr Ellis with a closeout on Appleby at Hildreth a weak side offensive rebound Santo thought about it spinning on Withers between the legs bouncing on Withers and Monsanto short well defended by Withers at a good stand by Louisville pushes and barrels over cant hildred Applause Kenny Paynes frustrated with his redshirt freshman Mike James Applause yeah I dont know I mean hes hes moving his feet which hes allowed to do a Hill Drift I think he starts to go down prior to taking that contact Id rather see a block there Id arrow on the side if its kind of in the middle Id arrow on the side of a block Louisville crowd is with you predictably as Appleby turns it over looking for Carr scoreless drought for the cards trying to slice into this here with a few Wake Forest turnovers James going to work out hildred Rises up and wanted to foul didnt get it March the rebound Monsanto off the bounce added Away by Huntley Hatfield hes had one go off his head and now off his wrist I think there here in these first few minutes out of halftime car short and the rebound to Ellis on the gas pedal L Ellis to the rack taking it right at Parr Applause Blake has missed its last four shots two and a half minutes without points good Bounce from Monsanto and Marsh draws a curry foul this is where Ellis is at his best in the open floor because hes instinctive you know hes not trying to run an offense run a team hes just instinctive and hes a good athlete guy that really started he actually played his best basketball for Mike peguese I dont know if it was a great relationship between he and Chris Mack kind of a struggle he started to play well towards the end of this in the last season although I dont think it was good between Chris Mack and most of the guys on that roster last year yeah Ellis like Curry more production late and then you look at usage rate like how many possessions are going through a player LL is according to Kent pump the highest usage rate in the ACC heres that one three one and they havent shown Zone all year theyre not just trying to break it out Force Louisville to have to think today with a defense that week hasnt shown a lot of length at the top of it with six foot ten Andrew Carr and Marsh in the middle Ellis no Appleby the rebound yeah thats not the way Steve Forbes likes to coach defense but breaking it out here deflected by Withers finds car anyway on a face up on trainer will be ball screen from Marsh always a loud threat Monsanto on the Baseline for two Demario monsantos got a dozen for the Deeks its gonna have to be more more comfortable off the bounce weve seen him drive it a little bit today that a one dribble pullup teams are going to fly at him three quarters of his shots in the year of Threes And hes a dangerous shooter 17 in that loss to Carolina on Wednesday Corner three doesnt go for Percy Miller five minutes into this second half wake in control in this triple header here on accn on a confrontational fans youre one at the helm for Kenny Payne been talked about a lot other comparisons of first year head coaches in in the ACC how some Legends fared early on in that inaugural season at the helm on that Coach K number a little bit misleading because the next two years after that werent great right you know and that was a time when you could go three years and and I think he got reups you know go three years and keep your job I I think they got the right guy uh I think Kenny Bain was the right hire he bleeds cardinal red we talked about his staff earlier hes got to get the right people in here the right players with the right attitude and that takes you know it takes time but they got the right guy theres no doubt about that five minutes into this second half youre early on in ACC action fifth game for both these teams in League Play as cam hildred scores largest lead of the day for Wake Force Jalen Withers 24 and white again coming off the bench Kenny Payne told us pregame it is bothering Jalen Withers these last two games not being in the starting lineup Kenny Payne said to us that is exactly the way I want it and that is fine with me he wants a little agitation and as you said to him some motivation well Withers played well against Syracuse and that was kind of what Kenny was saying hes like he didnt start he was a little irritated he played well in the game lets see if it continues to motivate the bench as a motivator a little bit different these days Mike and I think coaches are trying to figure that out but it was always the best motivator for me I think time has shown that but that portal has created a new dynamic in the coachs use of the bench it was interesting talking with with Steve Forbes today one of the ways he put it not necessarily with the portal trailer dumps that one out of reverse and he got as well how about that from JJ Trainor Applause Music and its interesting because they oh my goodness they both got the step after the free throw was shot Brandon Huntley Hatfield got in early and trainer beat his guy as well and a artistic finish on the other side of the rim that is something Kenny Paynes gonna love because he has lamented getting beat on Miss free throws for rebounds at times this year and JJ trainer steps right in and then flushes it but were starting to say Steve Forbes talked about the idea of one foot in one foot out kind of right when a guy shows up and you you alluded to it it is a different day and age with the portal being as accessible as it is Hildreth on a backdown of Ellis for two Applause cam hilderth has a dozen for the Deeks Withers skips to Miller shut off on the Baseline back for trainer Withers Rises trainer on the offensive glass Ellis attacks and went right at Hildreth who commits the foul thats three on cam Hildreth extra effort plays to create more possessions I think thats the effort that Kenny Payne has been skiing four hey every Sunday afternoon womens basketball right here on acc Network and the ESPN app two oclock Eastern time tomorrow its Louisville against Pitt and then four oclock top 25 matchup between Notre Dame led by Olivia miles and North Carolina 10 20point games for Haley van lit including three straight for the cards Ill tell you what Mike there are some bucket getters in the ACC this year on the womens side those we just showed there is a freshman at Florida State named Tanaya Latson shes got four 30point games shes leading the league in scoring I think shes like fifth nationally bucket getter extraordinaire unbelievable her dad was in the military she grew up a military brat moved around ended up down in South Florida at the Florida state terrific Sundays ACC womens hoops scoring a plenty from all those Stars I I was talking to her uh on our radio show ACC today Sirius XM 371 little plug there we were talking the other day Leonard Hamilton had said we need to get her on our team I said if you played in a mens game how many points would you get and she said I think Id get at least 15 I dont doubt it the way she is scoring right now she is a star Withers off the Miss Louisville battling for some of those extra possessions and again its JJ trainer stepping up for the cards crowd trying to will Louisville back into this still a long way to go in the second half Damian Williamson drops backs it out and now Hildreth Midway through the shot clock Williamson runs into Withers in an offensive foul you know its interesting no tie Appleby on the floor for Wake usually the guy to settle them down but its that effort thats gone in and out of games for Louisville that theyve had over the last few minutes and its JJ trainer his length around the rim and a nice draw of the charge there by Louisville it appears they are working on Applebees right hand at the corner of the Wake Forest bench right now Ellis got pushed by tamari Monsanto Applause as possible now theyre wrapping that right wrist of Tyree Appleby and Louisville is already in the one and one while Appleby sits Ellis two for four at the line today 77 as we told you for the season earns another Applause thats the other thing too Mike Ellis is the only guy who gets to the foul line with any regularity you know cues did a good job Syracuse did a good job keeping him off off the line he only took two free throws he took 31 free throws at three games prior but hes the only guy who can really get there he is getting there today Louisvilles on a 92 run theyve got it to 15 Music Williamson slows it down but Appleby still out who steps up for way Applause the fifth year senior Damian Williamson hes had a good game today shot clock at six for tomorrow Monsanto contested three in the face of trainer so confident hes got 15 Miller slipped it to Ellis back out trainer cant answer tipped around Williamsons got it weak has just had those threepoint shots to answer when Louisville makes these mini surges they have 11 made threes for Wake Forest if that double digit made threes now in four of their last five games that goes against Louisville its on Brandon Huntley Hatfield and back to wake on the other side its bow time we have seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help throughout this winter ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pic or take a video tag it with the hashtag all the devotion and post it on social and you just might see it on acc Network bells up here at the Yum Center saw the Joel as well in there you would be in huddles and you guys would be getting exhaust fumes yeah in them hey Coach K hated it and Steve Forbes brought that up today hes like I know Kay hated that it was obnoxious and they still do it at wake the the HarleyDavidson pulls up right in front of the opposing teams bench it faces outward and blows the exhaust into the opposing teams huddle youre getting poisoned right before the game its really obnoxious behavior Ive had that conversation twice with Steve Forbes knowing he did that Coach K hated it so much off the transition Miss from Wake Louisville back with him JJ trainers had a lot of really good effort plays here in this second half for the cards L Ellis is down he is grabbing at his lower left leg on the Louisville Baseline ah guy who plays so many minutes for this Louisville team and how many times has he been on the ground over the course of this season just in this game alone hes constantly putting his body in the face of you know the paint physical play I mean hes just constantly putting his body on the line Applause lets take a look at what happened to L Ellis Applause he heads off down the tunnel he had a play in the Syracuse game on Tuesday where he went full Sprint from the front Court running down a ball into the backcourt bull on died at the time the record two and twelve for Louisville and that jumped out off the film Percy Miller too strong on the floater tipped around does stay with Louisville is to the locker room we will keep you updated on his status here in this second half so its James Withers Huntley Hatfields Miller and trainer the five for Kenny Payne James with the size on Williamson double came Trainor moves it Withers skips it Miller comes up short offensive rebound for Withers for two Applause looks like Hershey Miller might have some blood as he goes off to the Louisville bench Tyree Appleby got some of that on him as well I think the two of them banged heads on the previous play Applause Music hopefully Percy still got all the Chiclets over there looks like he does cut on the lip nobody makes Cersei Miller bleed his own blood good flick oh Appleby is taking some bumps and bruises this year as well and playing through the bum ankle for stretches throughout December Steve Forbes told us today hes fine as far as the ankle goes as the wrist taped during this game and now took the head shot there for Miller still trying to stop that bleeding it looks like on the Louisville bench wake handles the pressure theyre up by 16 under 11 to go second half will be got James in the air through the lob for marsh might have just been able to go up with it yeah its too unselfish its got to be a shot car his misses have been short here today and a foul on the rebounding action goes against Appleby so thats four on Tyree Appleby with 10 29 to go and one you just dont need well it look if the game werent at 16 its absolutely a bad play by Tyree Appleby I mean you have three youre one of the most important players to his team in this league to have to come out of the game at 10 and a half minutes it was not smart and it comes off of it was frustration because he was trying to throw a lob hes got seven assists in the game I think hes trying to steal another one but Matthew Marsh doesnt hes going for an offensive rebound he assumes youre going to shoot it this was a bad play all around and then out of frustration commits a bad foul Anton nearly lost it off the Miss there at the strike from Mike James whos splits so its at 15 still over 10 minutes to go and Appleby sits we will see for how long Monsanto has to back it out defended by James Hildreth now Monsanto back for cam Hildreth they sagged off a hem Huntley Hatfield knocked it away shot clock winding down and Hildreth does not get it off its a shot clock violation forced by the Louisville defense you can tell Hildreth not comfortable with taking that threepoint shot has not shot it well this season he was as open as you could be at the top of the key decided to pass up on it Applause now can Louisville make a run with Appleby on the bench the effort has been there for the cards theyve got 14 offensive rebounds this afternoon swiped Away by Monsanto stays with Louisville with 11 left to shoot Applause we have not seen L Ellis come back up from the tunnel James gonna be counted on here misses from long range and wake tries to stop a threeminute drought car Monsanto car the offensive rebound goes right back up over the top of James for two I like the addition of Andrew Carr the transfer out of Delaware played two seasons there I think that Steve Forbes brought up today a guy who played at a winning program hes been well coached hes played really well in their last three games I think starting to get comfortable he can stretch the floor they run a lot of pick and pop with him weve seen him put it on the floor driving a little bit lands off the Baseline out of bounds no and then Marsh draws a foul on the rebounding action on Brandon Huntley Hatfield so thats his fourth as well with nine minutes to go foreign Music places him and L Ellis has come back into the bench area for Louisville hes headed to the scores table right now Monsanto barely does break the Louisville pressure under nine to go in this second half here at the KFC Yum Center Santo wants it himself gets doubled seven to shoot Williamson on a Baseline Drive blocked by Withers and then last touch Louisville they say not off of Matt Marsh this is a really good play by Withers because he has size and length over Williamston so you can even if you get beat you can meet him at the backboard and block this shot yeah thats tough that looks like it went off march three seconds to get it up on the inbound and Monsanto comes up short but an offensive rebound from Cam hildred that is a Backbreaker Applause shot clock winding down on Hildreth driving on James well defended and then the rebound clutched by Withers still eight minutes to go Applause Ellis bounces for curry on the roll dropped it off and draws a foul on the floor under eight to go second half and when we come back well tell you about the Legends honored ACC Network basketball is presented by Food Lion official grocer of the ACC well in Louisville here at halftime the 40th anniversary of the 1983 final four team but of course by the great Danny Crum Milton Wagner leading the cards out here at halftime really nice ceremony honoring such a great team they had the overtime win in the regional final of course against Kentucky and its set up that huge final four Showdown against Houston which was ultimately capped off by Jimmy Valvano in NC State that was an incredible final four that that 80s man of Louisville basketball he had the championship in in 1980 of course 86 I mean that what an era of Louisville basketball Lancaster Gordon once said playing in the backcourt with Mill it was like having a great wife he could read me and calm me down when I got mad and they could say things to one another that to other people it would upset them but to them it was part of their relationship in that great backboard another offensive rebound JJ trainer in a tie up gives it to Wake Forest so being a teammate is about man yeah its what its you know that sort of its not personal were all here with one goal in mind and I dont know if players talk to one another quite like that anymore doctors of dunk against five slamma Jamma gotta love the logo when you come to these games here at the Yum Center right there as big as could be a mid Court one of the great venues in college basketball 16 points spread seven and a half to go wake in a dry spell offensively Hildreth off the bounce on Ellis gets the roll Applause 148 for cam Hilder its been a nice bounce back for him he struggled in that game against Carolina I think was over three from the field hes low in points rebounds and minutes for the sophomore Steve Corbin said he got sped up again Withers knocks down in three just the fifth made long ball for Louisville Now by 15 Music great breaks the pressure Applause Mildred dropped it off for marsh couldnt handle the pass and Curry escapes with him Jameson transition right to the rim of the chat three for Mike interesting to see when Steve Forbes brings back Ty Appleby they need him yeah here he comes I mean you could tell like he he controls everything and a nice finish there you know we talked about the growth of James hes really started to come on I think off of that Achilles injury missed all of last season he needed some game experience Kenny Payne was talking about that earlier he just he needed to get in some games and get his legs under him Williamson pulls up in transition and miss get off the serious injury suffered in October in practice last year as a freshman and James knocks it down Appleby is down underneath the hoop and just Rises to his feet its an 80 run for Louisville they are within 10 with six to go do you have an invention at Ellis this is the contact he told he took no foul was called Mike James ended up hitting the three and Tyree Appleby was slow to get up and he was frustrated there was no call its an offensive foul Tyree Appleby is the primary Defender he reads this really well I think hes in legal guarding position the elbow to the face aside which certainly is part of that contact I think Tyree Applebees in leadable guarding position I think thats an offensive foul they missed 10point game wake handles the pressure and the lob for Matt Marsh back in a blur and a cathartic alleyoop from Thai Appleby Applause the lead at 12 under six to go good cut by trainer very nice cut weight came on a double cut from the strong side and a really nice pass twice now Louisvilles got it down to 10 as close as it has been since it was 187 eight minutes into this game a lot of dribbling heldrick pays it off with points you know thats thats where Louisvilles been cut down this year you know it was a possession going nowhere just a ton of dribbling from Hildreth and you end up with a layup winners from the corner its down to nine remember Steve Forbes talked about Wednesday wake Paving to some of the Carolina pressure and how loud the crowd got at the Smith Center as well and on the road again here this weekend Applebee trips Ellis lays it in Applebees got a smile on his face as he runs back down the floor as if hes welcoming this environment Appleby drops it draws a bound gotta catch our breath here this started a nice little back and forth the lob to Matthew Marsh and then how about Louisville theres that cut off at a post speed and then L Ellis in the open floor this lineup for Louisville Mike it has started with their effort and then from that effort theyve started to make some nice plays particularly in a half court first trip to the free throw line for Ty Appleby who has gotten there as much as anyone in the conference 85 free throw shooter has taken a couple of shots to the head in this second half banged up his wrist earlier as well splits at the line trainer the rebound he has injected life for Louisville in this second half eightpoint game four to go Applause goes back to a zone that was effective early on in this game Ellis slicing back out James knocks it down well to be clear every defense that wake was in was effective man or Zone Louisvilles just starting to move the ball and theyre making shots Ultra draws a foul on Jalen Withers at half court its a really nice skip pass over the top to that vulnerability in the zone Mike James have it himself a day give me three boom Music if youre Kenny Payne Mike James is a guy to build the future of your program around the registered freshman coming off a career high the other day against Syracuse had 19 in that game four threes he has 21 today four threes again hes been hyper efficient 814 hes done it all over the floor what a day for him hes got a nice job spotted up knocking it down how about that dime right there from L Ellis on the play go on the break against the 131 Mike James put two Big Time games back to back huge for Louisville which is down by five points now 332 to go in the second half a second half in which the cards at one point trailed by 22 five minutes out of halftime cam Hildreth at the lot and he makes the first to earn another Applause thing Louisvilles done in the second half too Mike we were talking about it during the break theyve taken much better care of the basketball Music Hildreth splits trainer another rebound Louisville one assist 10 turnovers the first half seven assists four turnovers the second half and a chance to make it a one possession game here Ellis from the elbow floats it home its down to Fourth Mildred on a step through for two more hes got 19 really crafty there in a paint the Euro from the European he is tough tough Applause Music Ellis off the bounce kicks for James hes got another Mike James has arrived Mildred breaks the pressure to Appleby Williamson to the corner Monsanto answers right back what a big time shot and tamari Monsanto looks to the first row and silences this crowd yeah he needs to chill with that you are up 20 brother all right youve now allowed this team to come back in this game so Id chill out with that the gravity of L Elliss penetration Mike Im telling you it is sucking in the entire defense and thats where these James threes are coming from we saw the one against the 131 that last three from James in a corner started with the penetration from Ellis Ellis had a floater in the lane before that so James is knocking these shots down but L Ellis breaking down that Wake Forest defense whether its man or his own has been the Catalyst L Ellis has not just 17 points hes got eight assists and you talked about limiting turnovers in the second half for the game hes only turned it over twice I mean you gave the stat they were on Pace for 20 turnovers in this game they you know and look they had 21 turnovers in that game against Syracuse and they lost by one so its their effort and I have to tell you its tied to making shots like it is for all players like they they started to see some things go in the basket and momentum is a crazy thing in the game of basketball Applause Mike James has been massive 24 points hes knocked down five threes I tell you what this crowd has given them life too give this crowd a lot of credit inside the KFC Yum center Ellis attacks again missed it off the window thats a big Miss youre right there on the doorstep and then a bad foul foul his third uh you see it on Kennys face and its frustration you said it earlier about Ty Appleby after the Aaron lob pass and Kenny Payne pointed to the basket you cant compound a missed layup by allowing Tyree Appleby to just walk to the foul line one of two today 85 for the season good on the first we came in talking about these two point guards tasked to do so much for their respective teams two of the top four scorers in the ACC and a battle to the finish line here in Louisville the lead is eight with two minutes to go for Wake Forest looking for a win on the road Applause Ellis drives on Carr Withers off the shot pick blocked by Hildreth and a foul is called on cam Hildreth who thinks he got all ball and thats his fourth he did get off all right unless he he caught somebody there it was a really nice shot fake and then hildra stays in the play unless theres body contact he got the ball there stirring daggers at Jalen Withers trying to get back the call theres some voodoo magic where hes trying to play its a dead stare man cold I do not want to be on the other side of that from Ken Hildreth 149 to go Withers at the line two up three there today after that make trying to cut it to a two possession game one timeout remaining for Wake Forest if it needs it in the hands of the sixth year senior Tyree Appleby wants a ball screen from Andrew Carr back for Carr Monsanto yes couple big threes from tamari Monsanto down the stretch hes got 21 Ellis is fouled going to the free throw line wake has 13 threes and they have just had answers throughout the day and tomorrow in Monsanto has he hes hes a sniper thats what he does hes a specialist threepoint shooter hes an irrational confidence guy and thats too much space and hes got really good positional size so even you know on the on the late closeout there hes gonna be able to shoot over the top of that Alice misses the first Applause Applause Alice misses pull and Carr the rebound wow Applause they just dont know how to win you know its why you have so many onepoint losses you cut it to three and you just Ellis misses a layup and then commits a bad foul winning is a habit you got to learn how to do it in 25 seconds into The Possession JJ trainer commits a foul and the Louisville bench went apoplectic it again it comes down to knowing what youre doing you play deep into The Possession clearly the decision was not to foul you dont foul at that point with five left on the shot clock and now Appleby the guy you dont want to foul and put at the line is parked there Wake Forest didnt just take some punches here in the second half they took some Haymakers from Louisville and this crowd in this environment and Mike James got a nine point lead 45 seconds left Ellis to the rim for two and hes got a chance to make it a threepoint play and Tyree Appleby has fouled out with 41 seconds left Applause yeah but it takes a ball handler off the floor because obviously Louisvilles going to press assuming they make this free throw thats close I mean he sets that foot late I mean Im fine with a block there Im Im so tired of analyzing block charts I mean its just ridiculous but Im fine with a block there but the point is you know you got to make this free throw and obviously youre going to have to foul but with no Applebee on the floor you know you could be really aggressive on the inbounds pass L Ellis is four for eight at the freethrow line in this game just missed two stamps the threepoint play and now without Appleby lets see how aggressive Louisville does get into Williamson got a foul and they do L Ellis his fourth 383 seconds left in a sixpoint game Damian Williamson 89 this season 83 for his career its the problem playing behind against wake theyre an outstanding free throw shooting team Applause fifth year senior Davion Williamson good on the first he had a big first half with 11 that was his first point since halftime and he makes both the lead is eight 38 seconds left James over to Withers Withers attacks matched up with Hildreth trainer Cuts back out Ellis cant hit offensive rebound Huntley Hatfield clock winding down on Louisville down by eight James forces it up no Monsanto the rebound and Louisville calls off the dogs Wake Forest takes some Haymakers from Louisville but gets a road win here in the ACC winning on the road aint easy and give Louisville a lot of credit and his fan base 2 and 13 they fought here in the second half played a much better brand of basketball but a wellearned road Dove for weight 13 made threes they get the win for Chris patola and our entire crew behind the scenes bike Monaco said
