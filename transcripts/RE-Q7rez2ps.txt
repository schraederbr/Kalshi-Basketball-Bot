tipping off against Max Brooks and waiting for the goahead here first ever meeting and its underway controlled by the yellow jackets Miles Kelly feeds it off to Amari Abram and were off in running jackets 2 and0 with those wins Over Georgia Southern and Howard meanwhile the riverhawks taking down Rivier University a D2 school and then blowing out Dartmouth on the road by over 30 points Kelly down the left side and Ta on Claud Has It swatted by Max Brooks hes led the American east conference John in blocks each the last two years yeah athletic bouncy hes got long arms really anticipates and these shot Walkers come off the ball off the weak side right there hes hes impressive at The Rim going to be an inbound from the corner there from Amari Abram the yellow jackets put up 80 points in each of their first two games and a sloppy turnover there on the first possession just a miscommunication right there on the handoff so L will have a chance to get on the board first in this one riverhawks starting four seniors cross their starting five Bren okon the sophomore joining the veterans and theres a block on the Yellow Jacket side and a quick turnover from Music gari this is a riverhawk squad John that came within one win of an NCAA tournament birth in America East championship its a group that knows how to win they went 26 and8 last year yeah a lot of experience uh and a balanced scoring attack um you know 11 guys in the scoring column in their last game but for Georgia Tech two turnovers already they only had seven Wy in the last last outing against Howard the entire game seven so got to keep an eye on the turnovers jacket like you said taking care of the ball reasonably well threepoint try there from aend AE whos coming up a 25point performance against Dartmouth Abram pops a three and it swirls out look at the Yellow Jacket lineup same group theyve had all three games only one returning player Miles Kelly the rest all acquisitions from the transfer portal the Conor down the right side and he hits looking for a foul yeah its a strong take the ability to turn the corner get to the rim Bren o Conor a sophomore and Coach duette thought you know he was high on him last year just wasnt ready with the game experience um had some uh seniors ahead of him on that roster so his opportunity is this season yeah he really turned it around those final six games of last year as he lets one rip that one in and out of the hands of Kelly and bounced off the shoes of taian Claud a Savvy move there from Kareem kabali and O Conor with that Miss three hes now 0 of six from Beyond The Arc this season but he uh hes got the green light hes capable hes just in a little shooting slump early in the season so for the shot clock at 19 seconds here and Brooks and aend AE going left short Corner jumper buries it that was impressive he gathered with the dribble step back to create space great arc on the shot hes a scorer hes theyre going to theyre going to go through him offensively yeah and and you talked to Coach Duke K he talks about how you know over his 10 years at um speaking of B scorers Kellys got two but in the case of AEM theyre actually going to be less equal opportunity and prioritized giving him a chance to find scoring opportunities and tonight were talking about a guy 93 games uh at the D1 level 58 starts uh played his first year at Lal there you see the face up by Brooks hes capable of knocking that down nice look looking shot yeah hes know more for his defensive prowess tremendous shot blockers led the league the last two years but looks like that jump shots in good shape Kelly from the logo off to the right and Brooks with the board six to2 riverhawks out to an early lead make it 82 ayende aes now got four and too easy right there so a slow start for the jackets AEM the ability to go three qus of the court to the rim with no contest um that cant happen Mar Abram down the left side Mari nearly lost the handle Kelly and OK Conor ripping down the rebound UMass LS hit four of seven three in a Applause row Yellow Jackets off to a similarly slow start like what we saw against Georgia Applause Southern kabali little fake and a nice finger roll and a timeout called by Georgia Tech UMass L up 10 to2 were not even 5 minutes into this one the riverhawks playing well on the road Music again well 60 run over the last minute has given the riverhawks an eightpoint lead early and John this time of year you think youre going to have a full roster the injury bug might bite you later but not on the start but for the yellow jackets this year Lance Terry a returning starter along with freshman Bay and Dongo those are two key players absent in these first three games yeah Terrys a guy that and you know you see the points right there second returning score um leading score returning on this roster but his IQ is toughness and then I think by will be ready hes got the length uh hes a fourstar recruit defensively hell be more ready on that side of the ball than offensively but thats two key absences on this roster early on the season now last week coach statamire noted that andanga could be as back as soon as the Cincinnati game next week as dvo Coleman Off the Bench hes adjusting to that role well meanwhile Lance Terry might come back uh closer to maybe the last week in November even early December and Debo in the opener against Georgia Southern had 17 points he was the spark plug off the bench and really got the jacket going down low kabali triple team for a moment going against the Freshman Sako batting it Loose seven to shoot and a blocking foul that time on Safar gapi and hakee right there The Savvy play to get oh we get a threepointer in the corner thats what Debo can do hes instant offense off the Ben bench thats his strength feet set shoulders squared hes hes 50 clip when hes got that um those you know those shoulder Square to the rim so key bucket now a freshman for unass L Anthony Maxwell theyre really high on him going Baseline and bumped out against kapari thats going be a quick second foul kapari Applause 13 you can see off the ball defensively sliding the feet late he had time too he just needed to get there and plant the feet anticipated the contact and shuffle them its a good call by the Baseline official Remy Stein crew led by Jamie Lucky in his 26 Season working ACC Hoops Maxwell flashes open freshman and they just hoping can find a way to slow the game down a little bit hes got some playing time early as that pass Works through Brooks and thes got it 8 seconds to shoot and the lob entry batted saved 1 second on the shot clock and a foul just moments away from the shot clock expiring and thats unfortunate because that was the best halfcourt defensive possession in the game for the yellow jackets and with the bailout foul 1 second to go on the shot Applause clock kaase Reeves just couldnt quite avoid the contact Hakeem fading away wont roll and Miles Kelly now the yellow jackets got the threepointer from Debo Coleman that was long defensive Music possession and Kelly that time draws one on fou Anthony Maxwell to number five Anthony Maxwell first Maxwells a talented freshman had 19 minutes against Dartmouth in the win there two points two rebounds um but coach jettes high on him as a freshman and hes getting some valuable minutes early on the season yeah I think its one of those situations John where you just kind of ride with him until he figures it out as Bren o Conor with an eye roll that time as he cant handle the rebound you know Conor was kind of a similar player last year that they were really high on and and kept kind of running with him and then the moment it clicked he went off yeah and here you see the last possession its the right call off the right knee out of bounds Georgia Tech gains possession 20 on the shot Music clock its Kelly going right lane Sako a freshman with the board and a second Music chance set down low to Coleman and theyre going to get hakee that time reaching in and UMass L switching the guard to guard screen at the top put Deo in a 6 in height Advantage rolling down the middle maybe something to exploit here if theyre going to switch guard to guard that action looked pretty good for the jackets on the mismatch with Debo Stant curling in to your point John that was one of the reasons Tech had early success against Howards they were going to the Lane just like that yeah Miles Kelly on Maxwell on that possession a 4in height Advantage uh thats definitely something to look at if youre coach STM continue to go at The Rim against the smaller Music guards well after putting up 10 points quick riverhawks are scoreless last couple of minutes yellow jacket is just two of 10 from the floor and he kind of felt like that poor shooting percentage from three against Howard was going to be an anomaly and you know all expectations of that it will be but another slow start for Tech Kyle Stan short Corner jumper yeah Sturman Savvy senior a lot of minutes under his belt uh solid assist to turnover ratio in his career and he can do that you know dribble stop on the dime make high quality shots hes not going to beat you out there t making poor decisions high IQ player Morris whips it to the corner and that one wont fall for Andre Applause Music feno Coleman with the step on Brooks and hell draw the contact against one of the top shot blockers in the league John he got a step on Max Brooks I think thats the growth Ive seen in his game over time uh he was purely just a face up shooter but the ability to get the defender to react and drive it to the basket get to the free throw line thats a new wrinkle Ive seen in his development around his game and there were some who thought Jordan Tech you know might have to make threes early to get inside later in a given game but it seems like Jack is trying to play inside out tonight by attacking the rim and like we touched on against Howard that was one of the reasons they got off to a good start was they were putting their nose down and going in yeah and you know credit Georgia Tech uh buckling down defensively but the ability to come off the bench with a guy like sturen and Debo and now its a twopoint game make that a one point game you weather the storm trailing eight early you go to these guys off the bench that were starters last season so depth a strength for Damon sodomy Squad and this has been close to the group theyve been closing games out with as well with those three returners of Kelly Coleman and sturon well they always said dont worry if you start its about who finishes you know Music exactly thats what they had you on finishing games on the floor here at Kem Court oh you need a psych degree now to to coach in D1 with the transfer portal guy has a bad night and you know next day that its not the right fit so the ability to uh you know play a guy on the starting lineup 15 minutes and then the guys you really want to finish with coming off the bench but its the sum of the parts and and Coach STM was done a great job early on in the season miny again reaching in Ibrahim aako creating a possible turnover and weve got a foul this is going to go against the riverhawks like sakos active hands here early yeah definitely a strength uh the five transfers that came in plus the Four Freshman for Georgia Tech transfer class was top 20 in the country ranked 17th length was an important part of uh the solution in terms of what STM wanted to addess defensively hes got athleticism hes got length Sako on that possession um hes definitely part of the puzzle there so the yellow jackets have cut it to one Applause and a heave down low good inside out Reeves a three another rebound for Claude and he works his way thats a blue collar too right there absolutely winning plays right there the offensive rebound The Gather the strength and Poise just to get there to the finish with the left hand Tai Shan Claude big play and a 90 run for Georgia Tech after that out called by coach Damon statam off the knees of Morris and Claw the Applause Music board seron fade away he didnt size Up the Rim until the about the time he let it Applause Music Applause go Conor this is a ball screen continuity offense what does that mean thats what coach duette told us how would you explain a ball screen continuity offense John well ball screen continuity youre going to see ball screens on both sides of the ball the action is going to flow uh so whether on the left side of the court or right side uh its going to reset so just continuity yes come on Wy you know that Tech but there might be some out there who havent heard that term before if I had the app Id be throwing an upright here give me give me the red give me the well see we we see if we can get that going in the break here Tai Clouds got a quick four points now and see theyre over 5 minutes UMass low put up 10 points but after that timeout theyve gone cold with continuity offense its read and react you youre going to stay in a pattern and theres read and reacts off what the defense does miny falling away his threepointer wont fall and save by Sako jackets already an 110 run looking to build on it Applause St lets it Fly and it wont fall Jordan te now one of eight from threepoint land riverhawks 0 of five from distance of a three just Music Applause short George attacked with that shot now one of eight from Beyond The Arc Coleman hits make it two and nine hes got both of them a halfcourt defense for the jackets really settled in here some space for miny that one too strong and Coleman with the rebound UMass L now 0 for their last eight Reeves oh that would have been pretty and it over the back bat so go halfway down and out Claude slow getting up he fell hard hes sucking some wind too I think he needs that immediate time out still looking for it and there it is Claude might have taken matters into his own hands there W the White Flag he needs a breather picks up the foul well be back jackets by Music six Music getting after you see great box out crashing from the perimeter grab the board and stur knocking it down again he came off the bench gave a spark plug for the jackets second chance points on that possession taian Claud and then the nice pick and roll action again a high quality shot at The Rim stur the senior coming off the bench leading the offensive charge and Debo Coleman right there you see hes the leader amongst all scorers with eight two of three from Beyond The Arc again coming off the bench hes embraced that sixth starter role as coach statamire likes to put it the riverhawks have gone seven minutes of game play without scoring Brooks trying to back down Coleman and that doesnt roll into the hoop for Brooks its a high quality shot coming out of the dead ball youat got it where he wanted it nice Lefty Hook by Brooks but left it short Abram the Lefty transfer from Old Miss they trying to get him going he can really shoot it Coleman going against Brooks once more dumps it off to Evie danana and its a soft rim on the Yellow Jacket side danana catching a good hands Debo threw it kind of at the midsection uh nice Gathering finish 160 Run for the yellow jackets and a nice give and go there AEM ends the scoreless drought for UMass 7 and 12 minutes and that Brooks and AEM duel right there in American east impressive GOI Reeves that was sudden the reverse Applause Music jam and a little bit of contact there between Coleman and Brooks and IND AEM look at kaasi Reeves though get up the Mak Georgia product local guy coming coming back from a transfer from Florida hes athletic I I love him defensively has the potential to be the best defensive player on the court hes got length speed uh had some big steals in the last game against Howard that were uh um gamechanging plays you know being a Mak and Native you think he grew up shooting at Peach baskets you know maybe maybe wouldnt wasnt that what n Smith was using yeah not much to do down there in making Georg either but they do host the G HSA state championships and correct me if Im wrong W I think kaasi was a a visitor to Mak for some high school state championship basketball solid player highly touted recruit and good to see him back home in metro Atlanta playing for the jackets over at Westside High School as hes got a little blood going on got to tape up his Music wrist what can a UMass LOL do here to try and slow down Jordan Tech after taking that 102 lead they Trail by six I think uh they got to make some shots theyve gone ice cold from the perimeter and that will help them control Pace at their ability to knock down a few shots and for a team that was one of the best rebounding teams in the country Jordan Tech is having success in the offensive glass danana double team and a blind pass looking for Kelly instead its over to Yuri Covington and the mix up to the zone defense on that possession uh really bothered the jackets were not ready for that audible Applause kabaly theres a ball screen and AEM inside to Kula Bali leaves it short toana the board transfer from NC State in this first year at Georgia Applause Music Applause Tech skip pass Abram lines it up short Abram now one of six on the season from Beyond The Arc hes capable of knocking it down but just left it short Wy yeah Abram hes shot official a team best 37 from three last year at all Miss still trying to find his rhythm in the white and Music gold Music third game of the season for the riverhawks John and boy you Mass low theyre not having the same offensive success tonight that they had in those first two games well different opponent on an ACC court again great percentage shooting for the riverhawks in the first two games 60 of those points were coming from the paint but again dartmouths not throwing the athleticism the size and length that Georgia Tech is and then youre playing on the road in a tougher environment so I think all those things combin credit Georgia Techs effort kind of after the first two minutes theyve really found their footing defensively well that was one of the keys for for Coach Pat duet as well this season last year 268 170 at home but just 8 on the road and a losing record on the road in conference can they play better on the road this year thats one of the big questions got off to a great start leading 10 to2 as you pointed out they have cooled off considerably since 8 seconds to shoot you know they 0 of seven from Beyond The Arc make that 0 of eight if that was a three from the corner didnt see his speed and they have not been to the free throw line Wy so nothing is coming easy credit Georgia Techs defense Georgia Tech not shooting too much better from Beyond The Arc either theyre two for 12 but with that said six offensive rebounds so the ability to crash use their size and athleticism when these shots are not falling an advantage for the jack yeah I know tari kapara threw that out of bounds but you can just see some of the the bunnies he has as he received that pass over two Defenders yeah hes a very talented young man uh hes just got to settle in thats his second turnover now game seems to be moving a little bit fast for him early on in the season yeah he started all three games but played just 10 minutes against Howard Conor going Applause Baseline hem Hook off the glass didnt know he had that in his bag huh big time finish he looked like STM on that the drive going up with you know throwing the hook shot Damon used to do a little bit of that in the league its pretty good Mighty Mouse impression it was as you saw 25 points against Dartmouth a career high for AEM Abram trying to get it to Claude and a jump ball I like the fine though by Abram that was a that was a nice find on the other side Hakeem going to the paint against the shot blocker nice finish yend aim senior began his career at Lal now in his third year at UMass L he actually decided to come to UMass L because of the familiarity with the fellow DMV players on this roster not a single player on this roster from New England John for the riverhawks yeah thats unbelievable you know its its a global game the transfer portal you got to you know get the talent thats out there at the end of the season if youre recruiting late in the game the whole recruiting landscape has just changed and Al you look extra pass Reeves for three and its Applause kabali Yuri Covington to take on Kelly there momentarily theres a three for cing its short as you said you Mass low now 0 for eight from threepoint l Kelly meanwhile that wont fall getting all these bricks out of the way early I guess so and that possession extended as comington plays it off a SD of him well the riverhawks not afraid to push Tempo theyre trying to change the pace of play theyve gone really stagnant uh theyve got to get some transition going so how do you do that you got to get stops get out fill the lanes and and push you know let hakee drive the pace of the game Maxwell Anon he backs well the Freshman coming back in and as far as the free Balls concerned for the riverhawks I me they lost their two top threepoint shooters from last year that would be ever Hammond and Allen blunt couple allc conference selections and that pass deflected Maxwell little scoop feed and Kula po cant finish from point Point Blank he has been limited so far just his fourth shot does have four Music points kabali the most experienced player on the court hes played in 116 games Wy uh you know started at pit for two years transferred to the bonni spent a year there yeah hes got a lot of experience here we see Miles Kelly Georgia Techs leading scorer on the season trying to get things going going to the rack yeah Max Brooks said nah not that way thats his second block shot tonight had 60 blocks last season after setting the school record was 68 the year before clauds three that one off the front of the rim and a AE the rebound and here comes this Tempo you were talking about all the way bowling his way into the lane and stripped loose three on one sturon nice finish at The Rim Miles Kelly giv the assist Georgia Tech again getting out the lanes turning good defense and uh transition Point opportunities and finishing there up six now 330 to play in this one first Music Applause half Maxwell elbow Jay no and Brooks wins the ball back he and Coleman Tangled Up and this foul is going to go against Max Brooks and UMass L Yellow Jackets ahead by six we step aside Tuesday night Hoops in mamas Pavilion its been a physical one so Music far Jord Tech sixpoint lead with 322 left on the clock alongside John Babel and Wy Ballard and you know John Miles Kelly has really gotten it going in the second halfes of games this year and so far tonight just two points in the first half yeah and then you know if youre coach Todd and the jackets dont worry about it because the trends like you said hes been a second half player 27 points against Howard 20 of those came in the second half against Georgia s in the opener 25 points in the game 19 of them coming in the second half but you had an interesting conversation with Coach duat yesterday yeah he was talking about how they really wanted to be an elite perimeter defensive team and I think weve seen some of that no yeah absolutely theyve been uh committed on the defensive side of the ball and especially in the half court but Elite perimeter defensive team was the goal and he believes thats what it takes to beat a team like Vermont in the American East whos been dominant in that conference over the years hes led the riverhawks to two aec championship games over the last three seasons they had a lead against Vermont on the road last year in the aec final could not hang on Vermont once the NCAA tournament and the riverhawks their season ended there trying to get to the postseason elevated to division one 11 years ago won a national championship at the division 2 level of course back in the late 80s and Hakeem his floater wont go kabalian offensive rebound and theres two snapping a thre minute scoreless drought kabals uh one of the top performers returning on this roster a guy that can get it done in the paint solid rebounder double figure scorer and just creates a steal that Music Applause time two and a half to play first half Conor directing traffic the ball screen kabali walled off by Kelly and so a Conor has to hang and he finds a way to make a tough shot hes got a big physical presence to him he uses it he plays with his physicality gets in there bangs the smaller guard and finds himself with a high quality look a lead down to two with two to play Claude searching for options gets it away to Reeves transfer from Florida down the right side double team and hes hit from behind hands to the head for cam Morris cant believe he was called on that Georg Tech been a twopoint lead kaasi Reeves well get a good look at it there is contact down low uh you know right at the midsection too much contact re at the line Rees 15 points each the first two games this season its the free throw theres one positive for Jordan Tech they havent missed a free throw yet in this first half thats only the third one theyve taken but that was another area where they really left some points on the board against Howard missing 11 free throws across 27 attempts yeah and in the opener they left 10 at the line so a 60 kind of free throw shooting team through two so good to see them um you know focusing in at the line coach statar brings in a little extra defense with Sako giv Reeves a Applause blow Georgia Tech been Rock Solid in the half court defense after about three or four minutes into this game Conor with a Applause crossover nice job of getting to the rim that time as he leans forward gets the contact and Braden o Conor from Ottawa Ontario making a his presence felt here in the first half yeah man hes Canadian got a little hockey blood in him check you know he put the shoulder in physicality toughness I like him and confident I mean hes not backing down at all as a sophomore playing on the road in the ACC a team like you Mass L you know not going to go into many environments High major like this and hes been impressive Got To Be Honest John I dont think that hair is fitting in a hockey helmet hes got the facial hes got the beard though man he can pass he passes the limus test for me Im a Boston guy I see what these guys look like hes got hockey written all over Souther what do you know hey now we got we got the Atlanta Thrashers here for a few years I I learned some things there 39° this morning you were cold I was cold thats true thats true I was Ser devant nearly Walks With It 8 seconds to shoot Coleman and hes bunked by kabali and hes whistled for the foul thatll put the yellow jackets at the line here for a one and one and that will be the seventh team foul on the riverhawks fan at the line shooting one and one no one really in foul trouble this one Brooks has two for the riverhawks and gapare with two for the yellow jacket so a relatively clean first half on both sides defensively aside from the threepoint shooting offensively yeah I was just referring to the foul just specifically you know not Applause fouling and we got a foul going against here against Ibrahim aako thats the seventh foul on Georgia Tech now so thatll put the riverhawks the line for a one and one Ry Stein had the call on that one and collectively a veteran official crew probably 75 plus years of experience in the stripes on the court and thats one yeah theres Jamie lucky this is season number 26 in the ACC for him hes seing some Talent huh you think Id say so he saw you play so oh yeah Quinton miny at the Applause line and the first free throw for miny wont fall so misses the front end of a one and one Sturdivant feeds down low Claude carving around theyll at least go to the line as he gets the foul call claudes a tough matchup down there hes agile hes got strength size athleticism kabali the minute he puts the arms down hes hanging all over him its like a coat L I would I would play that angle you know if if youre Georgia Tech put him in ISO situations thats a tough matchup especially you put some fouls on the front line of the riverhawks um got to look at that match up in the second half well and how critical was it the foul trouble that Jord Tech forced Howard into in the final 10 minutes of that win on Thursday and it was because they had guys like clog going to the Rim Yeah and a guy like kavali uh its a huge loss six points five boards you know hes you know borderline double double guy this uh every night this season and now hes got to sit the last minute so foul troubles going to be important stat to look at second half well despite some of the offensive droughts that have played UMass l so far they Trail only by five as we approach Music Applause halftime theem resetting the offense weaves his way past and Kelly got his hand on the ball hes going to stick with the riverhawks but AEM takes a hard fall yeah Kelly got in there from behind um distracted the play I think the momentum made it look worse worse than what it was but uh well have 9 seconds on the shot clock so situation basketball right here here you get another look just he was already falling and the you know the momentum that Kelly pulled over so but situation defense is important 9 seconds on the clock well see what transpires and its tipped into the basket by Georgia Tech essentally Miles Kelly got the tip in just in the wrong goal so one possession game Wy yeah that bucket will go to AEM or miny rather miny gets credit for it a 2 second 3 second difference the tech want to play a little four corners here kill some time yeah in the bonus look to get the taller guards Debo or Kelly going to the rim off ball screen freeze Kelly civant pullup threepointer back iron and theres still time on the clock they heard the the shot clock buzzer thinking it was the end of the half buzzer 23 but at the L that the defense is actually been winning the day for Tech in the first 20 minutes so here we go Amari Abram at the point for Georgia Tech UMass L looking for just their second ever win over a power five program and second half miles Kelly not Applause yet first possession for the riverhawks theres a ball screen hakee gets it plus the foul to far gari picks up his third in the opening 30 seconds and gapar is just going to have better awareness um ill advised foul on a good shooter in the paint he was not going to block the shot right there you as a player youve got to have the ability to not foul in that situation hakee makes him pay three points now we have a tie game give credit to L that gives hakee 11 points on 13 shots so it hasnt been a model of efficiency as much its just just been persistence for AEM in the riverhawks as Claude is stuffed oh Conor got his paw on it now the riverhawks looking at land to blow it wont fall Claud with the rebound and Amari Abram bringing it up high low and its swatted Away by OK Conor look at the activity for the Applause sophomore hes setting up shop on the wing he pops the three it wont fall but the tip in on the second chance is in thats a tough Trio right there and throwing cool kabali I mean in the American East its four really high level players now kabali began his career at Pittsburgh transferred to St Bonnies Reeves looking to respond wont go these teams combine two for 27 from three looks like its a nose to the grindstone here and try and work in the paint and a long jumper from kabali off the back iron 70 run to begin the second half for the riverhawks Kelly a three to Strong Abram penetrates with the left no but hell go to the line Abram the ability to probe dissect and take the contact chance to go to the line good lookoff good change of pace and takes the contact right at the end there by Brooks thats now three on Music Brooks Abram at the line hes now five of eight this year and cam Morris junor from Alexander City Alabama down by Montgomery two and a half hours here from Atlanta he checks in spent some time down at IMG Academy highly touted prep program year after year down in Florida were back even after those two free throws from Abram truly a threeman rotation in those four or five spots for UMass L and K Morris that third option still a solid one hes put up 14 points in each of the first two games they feed it down little Morris and hes swatted away by Kari with the second chance and Morris has got a couple his first points of the Applause night back Claude and he draws contact patet not happy with the call felt as though taon claw made the contact there you see kapar with a nice block shot the second effort the ability to stay with it the pois by cam Morris Music 23 Claud misses the first free throw and Coach bat du kids looking for some sympathies there from a fellow Massachusetts hey were newers you know caught up before the game he was coming up the ranks he was a great player at Williams College back in the day but uh when I was in my high school ball in in Massachusetts he was just getting his coaching start kind at the D2 level well if you believe in ball dont lie Tech misses both free throws Morris Four Points here in the second half riverhawks look out creating separation up four its a Sim similar start to the second half to what we saw in the first half UMass L lands the first blow a 92 run to begin the final Music 20 well all great Journeys begin somewhere right for head coach bat to Kit they was in Dalton Massachusetts where he fell in love with basketball went on the play at Williams college and then decided to pursue the coaching profession in turn with the Nets few years of D3 and then 13 Seasons at Boston College he worked his way up from Administrative Assistant to associate head coach and now the head coach in his home state at UMass L John yeah hes had a great run and you know working for a guy like Al Skinner during his time at Boston College lots of success Al was successful up at Rhode Island before Boston College um but you know hes a New Englander hes got hes got the hoodie sweatshirt on I mean its the bill bich inspired hoodie coaching fraternity up there in Massachusetts and much like Bill bellich coach du K building from scratch starting that division one program in his first season of course you Lola D2 program for decades but he was their first coach as they went to division one and twice in the last three years hes gotten them within one win of an NCAA tournament Coleman fading away and Kelly on the followup Taps it in and Miles Kelly may be coming to life here for the jackets yeah and a night where he was just one of nine from the field 0 of five from three that could get him going thats you know a little confidence boost well keep in mind in the first half riverhawks went at a 102 run coach statamire called timeout a 140 run for Tech ued looking for a similar formula Music Applause here stur driving hanging leaving its Applause short team will step back kabali on the Freshman Sako and Saku with the rebound enough of a challenge that time from The Freshman from Guinea Big Time rebound by Sako just going after it making his presence felt in the pain Tech looking to tie how about Take the Lead yes Deo Coleman his third triple of the night and credit stent the senior one extra dribble to suck the defender in the lookoff he knows where his Shooters at the corner great teamwork and Kelly reaching behind and hes caught as he tried to pick aes pocket and well get another look at that threepointer jackets now was good enough to take a onepoint lead stur at the senior the look off the kick nothing but net dvo Coleman getting after it on krins Music Applause court elivo Coleman is a tough shooting night the junior for the yellow jackets with a game high 12 points so far yeah 15 plus minutes of play hes made his impact felt from Beyond The Arc three of four from three Sturdivant with a nice dime on that possession Debo converting its also three of four from the free throw line 12 points been the impact player offensively again coming off the bench thats a new role for him this year and look at that number Debo col in three for four from threepoint range every other play on on the floor is a combined 0 for 26 thats you know thats amazing thats an amazing stat pound your chest Debo he got something to brag about out there say Ill show you how to do it three of four and were 0 of 26 collectively its unheard of Ill have what hes having so you m l out of the timeout here where will they go where else aen oh of 26 from three was a typical November for me on my stat line Im not sure you got 26 attempts up there though John no I didnt and hakeems jumper fadeaway short catch and shoot that one too strong and it continues for UMass L theyre 0 for 11 this a team that show over 40 from three Coleman gets his own Miss to the bucket and theres two more hustle play right there stent it was almost instant replay he missed the three and then the you know the Knack and the ability to just go get it Chase it down manufacture two points so the yellow jackets erase the 92 riverhawk run with a seven ho run of their own and looks like got a poke in the eye here yeah not sure if it was sturen or Music Sako foul is going to go against Music Sako well see active hands off the ball right there Sako bam right hand to the eye Covington looks like hes recovered doesnt seem to be in too much pain walking off heres OK Conor sophomore was hot in the early stages but quiet since then hakee taking on cant and theres a foul on the Yellow Jacket point guard yeah you had mentioned uh Braden Conor maybe the highest level in terms of talent talented recruit uh that coach duet has had on campus he made that comment to you when you spoke with him on the phone yesterday and I see it I mean hes arguably the best player or most talented and wellrounded player on the court theyre going to him bowling over Reeves and Coach duette adamant he wanted a blocking foul that time and rightfully so lots of contact on that Music possession abao he does a nice job keeps his arms at out uh it was a clean play he almost had a chance up the charge so youre good with the no call yeah D KY me sold man hes a Boston guys in Sals Debo Coleman taking the jackets for a ride here tonight 16 points Music Applause now here well see transition opportunity right now good decision making again pace of play Debo you know running the Lane but again that possession right there started on the defensive side of the ball were starting to see a trend Georgia Tech up five um they were absent of those type of runs in the first half Yi AEM hits the first free throw snaps a 90 Run for the Music jackets and here comes Max Brooks back in hes got three fouls Music Applause going to lead down to three Keem now with 13 points perfect three of three from the free throw line ceron taking on the Freshman Maxwell they get the switch and St of with the soft tear drop pretty the senior had him up in this put the hands up went under and nice finish Brooks didnt want to get the foul either hes got three playing with three so little to no resistance on the tail end of that play Max one to the Lane and a whistle comes in foul is going to be on Miles Kelly more look at Kyle Stans moves here yeah the straddle dribble side to side the step through thats a veteran move right there give it up for the senior little Up and Under substitution for saara gari will check in for Miles Kelly that was Kellys third foul by the Music waye pulls the trigger short he had kapari measured up had the space just came up short and ibraim aako trying to go the distance of the Court hell go to the line hey man he saw an opportunity he took it I mean there was no slowing down he said I got a mismatch miny come on put it on the hip get to the line nice recognition there uh the ability to see the mismatch get to the rim and have a chance to make free throws uh in a crucial tight game two possession game what does that tell you when you see that from a freshman like Sako you know I just think his awareness and and his confidence is what stands out he he saw the play he had the confidence to make it and then his ability uh to get there and do it putting it all together as a freshman sometimes hard to do one of two freshman from kakri Guinea Ibrahim Suare is on the bench also from the same Hometown and oh a sloppy turnover from Max Brooks o and hes trying to calm himself yeah he wishes he had that one back but uh you know only only the seventh turnover in the game for UMass low theyve done a very nice job in that department Brees looking for space couple of Crossovers and kapari taken on contact and we got a foul on the floor here uh kareim kabali K and that hes now at four John three all four in the second half yeah that that hurts hes one of the returning starters hes got a lot of Veteran minutes under his belt so hes going to play with four Coleman another three Off the Mark wide right Sako the offensive rebound and stick back Sako making some big plays not a stat filler by any means but the timely bucket right there on that possession and then his his energy its infectious well he leads the team with seven rebounds those are his first points and a high low feed and finish thats why you keep koua Bali in the game right there yeah it was a big time uh big time way to respond by the riverhawks they needed that one still a twopossession game cant shake him and sturdavant looking for a goal 10 call and he will get it this will be an an one opportunity for sturdavant yeah easy call it looked like from here Brooks went up the ball was on the way down well get a good look at it may have hit the did he touched the glass he got it like coming off the glass I cant tell from that angle one more look at it yeah its off the glass hits the board and you hit it going towards the rim thats automatic easy call the previous play is currently Jamie lucky and his crew want to take a look at it but again once once youre off the glass this ought to be pretty quick both teams have a chance to huddle up Music here yep that was quick after review the basket is good goal tending charge to so itll be 4336 with stent going to the line fou Char the river tell you what in the days of lengthy reviews John that was one of the quickest weve seen in a while yeah Im just impressed with how high Brooks got up on that play again hes 67 but he again the bunnies the guys led the American East Conference in blocks each of the last two seasons RW when you factor in Morris and kabali thats three of the top four shot blockers in the conference last year so I mean theyll be able to protect the rim absolutely thats thats a solid all Windex team right there on the same roster just cleaning the glass man thats an nil opportunity just waiting to happen yeah Windex get in there and the free throw is Applause short AEM burrowing through and finding a little bit of a sliver yeah hes now done that a few times tonight where he goes 34 of the court and right to the rim hes hes got great Court vision and he finds his advantages picks his spots stavon hits thats where hes at a disadvantage on the height side of things stent goes right back at him hes got the length and size and strength makes him pay yeah Keem is just Applause 511 but hes the river Hawks leading score with 15 and another two for kabali so here early coach duette getting rewarded for keeping kabali in the game even with those four fouls put the Freshman Sako on his back and an easy Applause Music Applause look kapari a three doesnt go a game thats 4540 pace of play Advantage you L they theyve got the ability to muck it up make it ugly keep it a one or two possession game then Anything Can Happen down the stretch that one wont fall for kabali Kari having trouble getting up and he and kabali are kind of going at it there and a whistle was called gari tried to get up while he was between kulab balis legs and K kabali took exception to it were going to step aside Georgia Tech a fivepoint edge things getting a little chippy here as we approach the final 10 minutes here in mamish Tech head by a Music handful what was it you said about its not how you start its how you finish yeah you said it right there I mean thats uh second half Trends in shooting Georgia Tech had a knack for showing up in the second half and were seeing it again tonight eight of 17 for the jackets 47 in the second half so theyre getting hot and to be fair coach stamar was clear the comeback they had against Howard down by 14 in the second half they they cannot do that routinely that cannot be their formula or theyre really going to have a tough time this year but at least youre seeing signs of resilience and an ability to Rally this one a long way from from over of course up by five with 11 minutes left yeah were talking about a riverhawks team that had 26 wins last year they returned three starters from that team and you add a senior with 100 plus games of uh division one experience to that group so theyre not going to go away Georgia Tech the stat that stands out theyve left Five Points uh off the board at the free throw line just two of seven in the second half and Claude bottom of the iron and now a foul going to be a one andone opportunity or maybe no two shots for Coleman its going to be charged to Andre fenio Junior transfer from division two Bloomfield State Line both teams now with six fouls we got solid 11 minutes left in the second half Coleman now four of five Wy four of five from the line so again hes coming through for the jackets hes now with 177 points miss the second one and fenos got Applause Music it things have improved for Jord Tech offensively in the second half theyve also improved for UMass L though theyre shooting over 40 kabali down low and hes going to have a chance for a threepoint play a excellent execution the high low that kind of went right down the middle of the paint kind of eliminate the weak side help going right from they say the nail at the free throw line what youre doing there is eliminating weak side the lob pass and convert tough to execute but its a great job all the way around by the riverhawks and now the lead down to three UMass L four for four from the free throw line in the second Applause half Kula balis got seven points in the second half again playing with four fouls and a turn turnover Hakeem racing ahead finger rolling in its a onepoint game and stent he he had the right idea just um turnover in traffic and the wrong guy gets it converts two on the other end if youre the jacket fan out there you dont want to give that guy the ball number two with a chance to make plays another turnover backto back possessions they had just one prior to that in the second half hem again look at the court Vision the awareness the lookoff too easy right he makes it look easy out there I think hes done that a time or two in his fifth season of college Music hoops Brooks finds o Conor whos wide open left alone and UMass L has the lead just a little Flex cut on the Baseline and former ACC coach uh not notorious for that action Gary Williams at Maryland that was a continuity offense the flex was were talking about continuity offense this maybe the best ever with ACC Ties That Marilyn Flex offense and Kola Bali another opportunity for a threepoint play the riverhawks a 90 run and that was a quick nine right there like a minute and 15 seconds or so yes minute 12 minute 12 threepoint lead jackets reeling a little bit right now right you know there kind of sucked the energy out of the building in this last uh minute and 12 seconds its quiet in here and what can you say about Coach Duke K you know a lot of coaches a guy like kabali they might try and steal a few minutes hes asking us now coach duette was asking us if we should leave him in roll with it theyre going to sit kabali now he came over to you Johnny wanted your opinion I dont know he said he said you should do I leave man I think you got a chance to win lets roll with it youre on fire dont dont mess it up well I think right now its not even a matter of protecting him from foul trouble as much as maybe just getting him a breather yeah yeah no its its its a right call plenty of time 928 UMass little in Command right now up four its a jackets team with their length size athleticism when weve seen it they can go on runs and this team for joria Tech hasnt blinked either this year in facing some deficits in the second half they tra by 14 against Howard on their home floor last week Mari Abram they get Miles Kelly going little roll there from Coleman Gap may have gotten away with the travel that time Reeves into the lane doesnt have the touch Morris the rebound well Braden o Conors been doing a nice job on Kelly just shadowing and and you mentioned uh you said hes one of the best perimeter Defenders on this roster now a skip pass Brooks free throw line jumper no Kellys got the rebound great contest by Reeves he was there on the catch Kelly denied by Mr Brooks that looked like a volleyball Spike he cant come weak against Brooks man hes going to send it Elite rim protector right Applause here Jack trying to snap a tenno run threepointer y Amari Abram cash his first threepointer of the night its his first basket of the night and oh Conor and these threepoint plays becoming routine for UMass L that was beautiful execution he turned down the double screen High read the back door we dont see the action off the ball there was a double screen set high you can see behind the play sets him up High Cuts back door unbelievable execution by UMass Applause l brayen o Conor now with 10 points one of three riverhawks in double figures kabali 16 hakee a team best 17 this a Georgia Tech team thats been solid in the half court through two games they havent had to extend and and take risks so if they get down in this one itll be Uncharted Territory at least this season if theyve got to extend the D and start trapping a little bit theyve been fairly conservative principle based defensively and doing a solid job in the paint step back oh man AEM drills of three and you Mass L with their largest lead of the second half the riverhawks on the road looking for the upset Music Applause win up by seven and the fifth year seniors put the riverhawks on his shoulders absolutely hes got 20 points in the game second half though 12 points and 12 minutes of play hes one of three from the three three of three from the free throw line doing it all over the court right now and his confidence uh it kind of exudes and permeates to his teammates feeling it right there you like that facial work right there huh yeah playing the drums hes hes hes relaxed hes feeling good out there that was the first threepointer of the night for UMass L they were 0 for 12 can the yellow jackets respond theyve brought Claude and Sako back into the game trailing by seven with seven and a half left on their home floor Kelly has been ice cold Applause tonight Abram into the lane a floater and its in nice job by Abram getting into the pains sweet finish the Lefty in traffic the teardrop he hadnt quite gotten it going offensively yet John but hes got some offensive pieces to his game best threepoint shooter on Old Misss team last year and his decision making has been pretty solid hes taken high quality shots hes is not forcing it kind of a veteran approach to the game oh Conor trying to answer and that threepoint shot is open now for the riverhawks lead is up to eight that matches their largest of the night Kelly cant buy it hes now two for 13 and 0 for six from three a big possession right here defensively for the jackets um try to keep this in single figures in terms of your def said ok Conor working against Kelly to the Lane hes bumped hes got the basket and a chance for one more hes just taking it to the jackets uh he just kind of bulldozes his way in there and uh hes a Believer finishes in traffic here you see with the three inside out hes doing it all how about this the contact the finish off the glass on the way down hes going to go to the line OK Conor the sophomore really stepping it up a new career high 15 points tonight for Brad and Conor the lead Applause 11 a 215 run for UMass L since the 11minute Music mark start ofon trying to find something Kelly in the lane claw the offensive rebound he goes up and itll go to the Applause line that foul is on a keep Jamie lucky the veteran official calling it from outside the paint had a great look at it definitely contact big free throws though right now for taon hes one for four there tonight Music Applause Yellow Jackets thats been an area of concern so far this year the free throw shooting right around 60 on the year theyre 10 of 18 tonight theyve left eight at the free throw line but trying to change that Trend chipping away as weve said a couple of times tonight John it all starts in the defensive end and the riverhawks continue to find open shots yeah theyre four of their last four from the field so theyve got a little momentum a little consistency hakee trying to create he does hes got a nose for the basket and coach duette wants a timeout he didnt get it Music okay Kelly desperately trying to get going he misses the layup claw there to pick him Applause up Applause Morris down the lane a bump and an offensive foul Remy Stein had his feet set had a great look at it veteran official going to go the other way here well Music see what do you think John little bit of movement I think Georgia Tech gets the benefit of being on their home court right there sometimes you need luck Wy jackets looking for anything they can get right now one things for certain they are running out or running low on time 5 minutes 20 seconds and as far as short TS offense is concerned John theyll have the ball coming out here do you keep pulling Triggers on the threes youre four for 26 tonight you look at the first three games you played this year including those two exhibitions they shot 46 from three but the last couple of nights that long ball hadnt been Fallen yeah four of 26 from be on the arc but you know its more important is uh are they quality shots number one number two whos taking those threes you got your best player 0 of six um to answer your question if Miles Kelly gets a good look from three although hes 0 of six Im saying shoot it all day the trends got to change but youre going to win or die by the threepointer and tonight you know trailing nine 520 to go if you get a good look from three you take it between Kelly Reeves and abrel those are three guys that Jordan te expects to be threepoint threats this year they were combined 1 for 14 tonight hey hundreds thousands of Threes these veterans have put up over time with their assistant coaches and Player Development hasnt dropped yet I say you got to shoot the three if its a good look take it Tech showcased it in their opener against Georgia Southern Aly claw stuff Kelly there with the loose bone and easy two trying to get him going hes now got six points on 16 shots yeah and its not like you know the alternative you go at a you know Elite level shot blocker like Brooks youre not getting easy twos so statistics analytics say take the layups and transition take the threes when theyre open high percentage shots OK Conor picked up his dribble kabals checked back in with four fouls goes to Brooks and its blocked by Reeves loose ball to Kelly the Yellow Jacket trying to make a run Applause sternan turns it over and trying to get it back and he picks up the foul AE makes two heady plays in a row the ability to uh he kind of trick stur ofan into the pass and then he stops on a diamond transition and picks up the foul but here you see Reeves this is where hes active he does a nice job rebounding from the perimeter and also making plays defensive stops right there heyhey defensive stop and then he stops on the dime the awareness to get the foul thats a highq player this will be two shots for aakeem a sevenpoint lead for UMass low looking for just their second ever win over a power five Applause opponent theres a perfect four of four from the free throw Music line3 they as a team you L is eight for eight from the line in the second Applause half joria Tech meanwhile five of 11 in the second half in the free throw line trailing by nine that one win for UMass L against a power five team by the way came against Boston College in the fall of 2015 Kelly taking on o Conor and hell get to the the line fou and for as much as weve talked about Kellys inefficiency offensively a lot of it has to do with the defense hes faced Music tonight and gets the benefit of you know driving and theres bodies theres traffic Kelly the star player hes going to get calls if he puts himself in situations like that he will get the benefit of the whistle his first free throw of the night does does not go just one of those nights Wy he cant find it cant get it going was averaging 26 per game coming in he has six points tonight three of six from the field 0 of six from Beyond The Arc 0 of one at the free throw line its the second but for Miles Kelly after setting the school record in free throw percentage last year hes shooting just 60 in the first three games this season from The Line eightpoint Game and again the guys put up 27 and 25 points these first couple of games so hes found a way to get it going but not tonight and that foul against Ibrahim oako no Conor tough he can handle he can post he can you know hes just a tough matchup and defensively hes doing the job on on Miles so thats three fouls on Sako now also three on Sturdivant Kelly gari and Claw and OK Conor continues the perfect free throw line effort from UMass l in the second half duette got a steal right here this kids a sophomore America East Talent hes I mean hes given the high Majors all they can handle right now is a soft 10point lead under four to play can Georgia Tech find their shooting stroke Kelly going up no batted high in the air and in thats what you got to love about Miles Kelly keep playing fighting clawing second effort made something out of nothing just from his hustle and effort kind of saw some of that isolation against Howard at the end of the game for Georgia Tech but they need stops can AE keep it going hes got 24 points feeds to Brooks who has it stripped Colemans got it great position defensively by Coleman being there ready for it can he get the three yes he can and the lead sliced in half in a matter of 30 seconds and Coach duet wants a timeout UMass L trying to hang on the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets seeking a final gasp here and Deo Coleman has hit four threes tonight Music Georgia Tech trying to stve off the upset first year head coach Damon statamire breaking the Music Huddle looking for some mental toughness from his team thats how he challenged his group this weekend hes talking to Kelly and Coleman here along with the whole team and mental toughness Wy what does that look like in the last 3 minutes take care of the basketball if you go to the free throw line knock them down defensively one and done dont give up the offensive glass you Mass L they have momentum theyve got nothing to lose playing with house money you know definitely their advantage plus five and really theres theres no pressure other than to hang on the riverhawks have put up 45 points in the second half after scoring just 23 in the first half they go to aakeem feeds inside a kol balling double teamed looking for Brooks who cuts in oh and he just missed a chance for another threepoint play but Max Brooks will go to the Music line these are his first free throws of the night right here boom boom got fouled twice Music foul on SOS his Applause fourth and Brooks misses have a chance though just reset form look Applause good Claude comes in for Sako and Kareem kabali takes a seat trying to play delicately hes got four fouls they want to use him on offense Brooks hits the second sixpoint Edge for the Applause riverhawks St stent the fifth year senior guarded by AEM a fellow fifth year senior Coleman another three yes and the foul Debo Coleman singlehandedly willing Georgia Tech back into this one and thats the fourth foul by Brooks on the tail end of that play so you got a chance for a fourpoint play you put a fourth foul on the shot blocker defensively their best presence on interior defense so big possession for the jackets unfortunate right there for UMass L Brooks got to find a way to avoid the contact on that play this circumstance Debo Coleman with now a career High 23 points make it 24 in a twopoint game automatic hes really embraced this role coming off the bench and you said its not who starts its who finishes Wy its Debo Coleman time the crowd here in m is coming to life and Claude deflects it last touched by the riverhawks and its j to te basketball oh Cam Morris uh he thought his teammate was getting held from behind well see now was just a bad angle taan claw a nice job getting into the passing Lane forcing that turnover position defense right there doesnt show up in the stat sheet but he worked hard to take away that interior pass Georgia Tech is trailed by as many as 11 in this second half and itll stay with Georgia Tech contested by AEM there and both teams with one timeout remaining in this one Music so situation basketball well see right here 15 on the clock almost going to Claude underneath hes bothered from behind by Morris riverhawks the other way they put it in the hands of aend AE what would be one of the biggest wins in UMass Ls history theyre two minutes away spin hakee no claw the rebound jch trying to tie it they go to Coleman for the lead clauds got the rebound now its Kelly hes hit some big shots been a tough night hanging up Jord te wants the goal tend they got it yeah I think if we get a look at that and hit the backboard thats going to be automatic goal tending K so the game is tied they will review it fending on the floor and more importantly for the jackets Miles Kelly is still down injured on the court I I dont hes getting up slow right there he hit it before the backboard yeah he did hit it at the highest point um be a tough decision right there Jamie lucky lead official all over it seeing if that was on the way down Kelly is up and in the Huddle hands on his knees grimacing but got up under his own power game currently tied at 69 itll either be one free throw to take the lead or two to tie if this is overturned and the signal is it is confirmed goal tending we have a tie game BK a foul charge to the riverhawks number 11 Andre speno his second Damon STM having words with his team going through all the situations all the scenarios got one timeout to use if you get in trouble but its more about defense and rebounding not fouling not putting yass l to the free throw line all the little things we pointed out how miles Kelly has struggled at the free throw line this year John but you go back to the end of that Howard game he hit two big free throws and neither touched any bit of the rim he drilled him a huge free throw here to give Georgia Tech the lead Kellys one for two tonight out the back iron the rebound control by Morris tie game 90 seconds they got to go to AEM here right absolutely or Braden going to the basket his size and strength he can draw contact to AEM he wants a ball screen hes got one from Morris guarded by sturdavant they get the switch another kick out Morris Baseline two to shoot he goes up hes got it count it the foul cam Morris Big Time finish right there unselfish play Georgia Tech did everything they could they switched they had great length for the pass at the end of the shot clock Morris line great offense um m l hes fired up Morris rightfully so m l is going to have a chance to leave Atlanta with a win that foul on Tai on Claude his fourth and he sinks his first free throw of the Applause Night riverhawks by three one minute left riverhawks 13 of 14 from the free throw line second half Coleman has been money tonight stavon drives to the Lane and cuts it to one big shot by the Music senior coach duad telling hem to kill some time hem nods when will he go your Tech youve got to protect the offensive backboard here you got to box out as a team try to get a oneandone situation A contested two five on the shot clock Hakeem step back three off the backboard an offensive rebound but it did not hit the rim thats a shot clock violation Georgia Tech basketball 17 seconds to go bonus situation Georgia Tech with one timeout left see if Damon star wants to talk it over and he does one more look a y AE distraught at that Miss stur event did a nice job containing wasnt even close Ill tell you what it was close to D John is hitting the rim yeah youre right but shot clock violation comes into play so John if youre Georgia Tech who do you go to to on this possession thats an interesting call right there it has not been miles Kellys night but Im playing uh you know the analytics the data the trends Miles Kelly hes averaging 26 points hes had unbelievable second halfs hes proven he can hit timely buckets put the ball in your best players hands get out of the way make him you know let him make a play let him create its Deo Coleman with a careerhigh 24 points tonight hes hit five of tech 63s Kell five of 19 from the floor 0 for six from three theyll put 310 of a second back on the clock so 18 flat the next question I have for you John is no matter who takes the shot when do you take it oh I think you got to give yourself an opportunity for a second second chance put back um you know Id probably try to put Debo and miles on the same side because the way Debo shooting the ball youre not going to get help off a shooter put one of your bigger guards go to the basket its going to be be a oneonone situation worst case draw the foul uh Miles Kelly can finish in traffic hes got the size Advantage but thats what I would do coming out of here ISO situation get Miles Kelly going to the rack on Debo Kelly side and um hopefully that negates the help if they suck in and help kick it to your best shooter Debo Coleman on the night its his its his time to shine youve got Brooks on Coleman and Conor on Kelly they might play with the senior Sturman takes care of the basketball might go through him as well here we go sturdavant 10 seconds Coleman doesnt have space its down to five Stant going up its smothered and blocked and Reeves fouls with two seconds and change left Max Brooks hes led the American East Conference in blocks the last two years that might be one of the biggest of his career riverhawk dialed in defensively right there no breathing room for the jackets sturdivan had a glimpse of Hope but Brooks swallowed him Applause up big free throws right here Georgia Tech has no timeouts in the transfer from division 2 Bloomfield Andre feno Applause shooting he was an 82 freee throw shooter last year and so far tonight hes now one for Applause one hits him both no timeouts for Georgia Tech ceran catches it going towards the basket hes got to go half court heave to tie no and UMass L takes down Georgia Tech
