done a remarkable job improving the fortunes of their basketball teams and we are underway Louisville with the basketball first a Cardinals team that looks to shoot the three ball and then shoot it again and again and again heurn with the pass to find rain Smith and it goes out of bounds to SMU well the Mustangs come in with that threegame winning streak 14 and four overall BJ Edwards bopy Miller a very disruptive backcourt Chuck Harris starting again tonight then Matt cross and CET igu who has NBA Scouts very intrigued about his potential Andy Enfield told us earlier this week that he thinks the upside for yiga with 72265 is the NBA you cant appreciate how big he is until you get up in person on him uh he has got a massive wingspan as well too number 24 and white were talking about heres Chucky heurn if you get him some room he can knock it down 32 but just last week in Syracuse he made six of those in one game yeah both teams thats going to be key defending the threepoint line Louisville makes close to 10 threes per game and you said it shooting a pretty high clip as well too Edwards trying to post up Rain Smith back out to Miller six on the timer little step back off the window no rebound pulled down by Chucky heurn the Wisconsin transfer who is the straw that stir the drink for the reborn Louisville Cardinals R Smith blocked by hiu and thats what he brings a rim protection great job that time of keeping the ball in possession a lot of times you see guys punch it out of bounds a great job blocking it and gaining possession gatu big size Advantage no double team goes a little too strong off the glass Cardinals with it up three nothing early eern got the three hes 6 to 190 lbs a junior from Omaha Nebraska and he helps to set up Javon Hadley another one of the capable threepoint shooters for the bill and thats why I love Chucky hurn right there again his ability to set his teammates up simple play high pick and roll gets into the lane and then throws it back out for an open three one thing it does when you make baskets against SMU it makes it a lot harder for this team to get out and run Harris with a strong drive and the finish with the left hand and thats all set up though by the pass out of the double by the big fell again thats going to be key theyre going to double when he gets it deep in the post can he become a very good passer out of double team Edwards pass knocked away Music Harris from long range nice job by cross one of the leading rebounders in the ACC to keep it alive but Edwards Miss f up ahead Edwards gathers yigu makes him think twice about it the dump off and yigu Stones James Scott who leads the league in dunks it leads to a run out but Miller Miss with a left hand Edwards cross got the rebound and found his teammate for the layup unselfish play that time by Matt cross again he could have easily put that offensive rebound back up saw his teammate had a better angle great job that time by Matt cross wide open again Chucky heern from the same spot 94 Louisville and thats just too easy can you give this Louisville team that much time and that wide open theyre going to make you pay Music another thing to watch in this game ball screen coverage again thats something that when we spoke with Pat Kelce we take a look work on the offensive glass he said defending SMU you must be good in your ball screen coverage well Pat Kelsey told us at shoot around earlier today this is going to be a rock fight both these teams rebounded very well they love to get up and down two of the better teams in the ACC Louisvilles net is 29 and SMU checks in today with a 36 net Miller bad pass on the Baseline out of bounds fight for it cross has it saves it from going over the timeline but the shot clock goes to zero and its a turnover forced by Louisville Chucky heurn and the Cardinals off to a quick 9 to4 start right here if you give one of the better guards in college basketball that much space hes going to make you pay Lille up early Music te Music Music te Music Applause te and Music ACC mens basketball is presented by T price invest with confidence SMU head coach Andy field was a terrific shooter at Johns Hopkins then made his name as a shooting coach first Consulting in the NBA for the bucks in the Celtics before being hired by Leonard Hamilton at FSU he spent 5 years with the seals and just loves coach ham to death he lit up when we talked to him about his time with Coach ham at FSU he had so many wonderful Stories We also asked him about his time at well with the Bucks as a shooting coach that team with Vin Baker on that team again this guy has a wealth of knowledge and has been around this game for some time well his players call him the king of the midrange shot cuz he never misses when they are at practice or shoot around from the midrange and the irony is not lost on them that their coach who tells them dont take midrange shots is great at taking midrange shots if you dont miss you can definitely let that thing fly and early on heern has been knocking down shots hes been getting clean looks right there pretty good action again SMU has to have better communication heper and definitely on rain Smith cannot give those guys too much airace well Harris seemed a little better connected that time he was at least within the air space of the shooter and so the ball goes out of bounds Louisville will keep and having attended multiple shooter rounds and practices for Louisville opponents getting ready for that as we saw earlier today the name you hear the most is rain Smith from the opposing coaches they want you to know where that guy number six is at all times oh he coach edville was screaming that all day as we take a look at excellent ball Movement by Louisville and again they continue to impress me with their balanced attack you look at their last game against Virginia they have four players in double digits and heurn in that game had eight assists so again their team that spreads the wealth a very Balan to attack on offense Harris little short on the Three cross got a hand on it hes already got a couple of offensive rebounds four offensive rebounds in the early going for the Mustangs but they havent been able to cash in the Freshman canai ruths number nine in red into the game Hadley from the corner no 114 Louisville with the sevenpoint lead Miller around he bur who is called for the foul got him with the hip and again this is a big reason why uh theyve had success and theyre on the Run they are right now look at the ball went left to right unselfish plays and in end result a layup you can ask for a better offensive possession uh if youre a coach and we had a chance to watch them operate at shoot around again the details the energy really uh theyre playing as one all unselfish with the ball well all four of their made field goals have been assisted so that number backs up what youre talking about h both teams very similar in terms of their balance as we take a look at a great blocking out something we dont talk about again we spoke with Coach Kelsey transition defense was number one and number two was rebounding first F on Edward leads to a lob that Scott cant finish back the other way just off the bench Caro quendo and the whistle comes on the shot bio quendo a 64 senior from Titusville Florida and one of the few times a poor transition defense that time by Louisville again that was key number one uh in this game uh speaking with Coach Kelce transition defense they worked on that repeatedly in shootaround Applause Wednesday night here on acc Network it is a mens basketball double header as Chase hunter in Clemson host JJ Starling in Syracuse at 700 eastern followed by Florida State and Cal from Berkeley at 9 Eastern probably a good thing that game is not at Tallahassee since the airport is closed down on the Florida Panhandle its amazing the amount of snow that the Southern United States along the Golf Coast has gotten in the last 24 hours on the East Coast thats like uh summertime at the snow but around this area certainly it shuts everything out sh everything down Kai Ruth with his eighth made three of his freshman season its an eightpoint lead for Louisville U draws the second Defender heurn got a hand on the pass o quendo the Miss pulled down by by ruths heper tries to get it back to him led him a little too far and the Cardinals fortunate to keep possession a great job of running the floor right here but again look at the operation of heurn the best league guards in college basketball his court vision and ability to find guys really impressive and again uh the run that wolv is on right now he is a big part of that when you have a guard you can put the ball in his hands and allow him to operate and set things up makes things a lot easier for everybody and weve talked about the parallels between these two coaches in their first years and their roster construction that has proved to be so good as Edwards Works to the Baseline Louisville has 11 new players who played in last years NCA tournament so they are a veteran experience Bunch meanwhile SMU has four guys on its roster who are 1000 Point scorers and you cant just necessarily throw all of that Talent together and assume its going to work it takes some thought to be able to get the right kind of guys together and both coaches talked about of the importance of that and the chemistry theyre very mature teams both these teams very similar in Styles heurn with his third triple of the night timeout Mustangs Louisville on an eightgame winning streak off to a flying start are Music Chucky hurn in seven minutes already has nine points two assists made three threes again he is playing basketball at a very high level he is and he does everything on the court yes were talking about his points uh hes one of the better assist guys in the ACC and for me though what makes him I think different his defensive ability uh his ability to shut down opposing players guards really sets the tone for this defense yeah 26 steals per game most in the ACC Scott rips down the rebound after a couple of Misses at that end for SMU lets see the adjustment by SMU early on Lille had some quality looks from Beyond The Arc they got to do a better job closing out on Shooters in particular heper Deon Ambrose Hilton into the game for SMU Music six to shoot Edwards spins into the lane Rises up little strong lob to the rim and a foul as BJ Edwards goes down hard that is Brian Edwards Jr his mom Tiffany his father played football at East Tennessee State he was a running back so he can take some contact had opportunities in the NFL was on a number of teams practice squads his son goes down hard but he trots over to the SMU bench hes just fine now weve got two Edwards in this game Terrence Edwards Jr for Louisville BJ Edwards for SMU no relation and then weve got two guys who spell their last name the same but pronounce it completely differently Johan trayor for SMU and a bubacar trior for Louisville there will be a quiz later now yeah thats just too much information for me right now to process for a playbyplay guy though weve got to keep track of that sort of thing oh I tell you right now Im failing that quiz if you give it to me right now D Sherman take my notes away Id fail it too that is trior to heurn trior so active on the glass back out to Edwards and again that is Terrence Edwards Jr Miller Nifty shot cant get the roll SMU still stuck on Six Points as we head to the Under 12 media timeout Music Music weve used the term Revival so Zack Bryan has that famous song change the end of the Revival world Music we zero final fours and national championships Applause be now make sure you weve used the term Revival so Zach Bryan has that famous song change the end of the Revival word to v i l l e our goal is simply to strive to have the number one culture in the country were Reviving The Community itself Newville basketball back to its Rich history of you know get to the tournament get into final fours and national championships well this Pro program that has three national titles in its history was coming off of consecutive historic losing seasons and ever since Rick patino was run out of town they have been searching for that guy and they have found it and then some in Pat Kelce well I think both these coaches talk about buyin uh but on the Louisville side uh I think again the buy into what he talked about the energy that theyve had again weve sat and the practices weve sat in the shooter rounds and its just a different energy but I think you have to have the Buy in from the players for that and again weve talked about their stats four players in double digits the assist numbers that they have in games to go along with the buy into the defensive mentality really to me has been the key for this turnaround and one of the things Pat Kelce doesnt have to do that you would think of course he doesnt have to but youd be surprised how many places dont have it he doesnt have to coach playing hard his guys get it and they play hard on both ends Smith on the receiving end of the law first two points for the 611 sophomore from fville North Music Carolina 37 dunks top five in the country Endo lowers his shoulder Smith took it right in the sternum and its an offensive foul well this setup right here for Scott all set up by Chucky heern his court Vision the pinpoint passing alls he had to do was go up catch it and slam it in excellent execution that time by Louisville Scott is one of the three players for Louisville who followed Pat Kelce from the College of Charleston along with rain Smith theres the big man again with his second dunk you can see why he shoots such a good percentage from the floor I tell you what having a point guard that understands and then also willing to give the ball up really a just phenomenal Port Vision Again by he bur Matt cross has his first two Edwards left alone well short so for SMU they put 117 points on the board there last time out in blowing out Miami Miami is a heck of a lot different than Louisville but what is SMU not doing on this end Malcolm well theyve had some opportun as we take a look at the chars bofy Miller coming back into the game hes had a couple of opportunities he normally makes in transition but just unable to finish those again its 11point game Ive counted at least two or three missed opportunities in transition well until that Matt cross layup SMU had gone about 5 minutes without a field goal and now the officials Lee Cel Tony Padia Tommy morrisy are going to go and review that last play previous play is under review curious to see what theyre looking at again right here yeah again he just got his hip out so again it looks like a blocking foul a legal screen excuse me and and now I think its more if there was any extra stuff after the play yeah again right there couldnt see whether or not he stepped on somebody or there was something extra going on after the Music play you talked about in this game early whats going on I think well get a better look right here to see if anything extra happen not sure theres much Music there again they want something uh done about that now lets see hes just walking through little push away yeah I think thats not much guys just having a little conversation Doug Sherman but I dont think theres really much else unless theres something on the back end that we didnt see so Id be surprised to see if any anything comes about other than just change of possession for the illegal screen yeah you know yigu may have changed directions a little bit but he may have been nudged by Terrence Edwards Jr as well so the uh after further review the play on the call stands so just common foul as what we thought didnt look like much yigu I think sometimes at 72265 this is not the case there he committed the foul with the hip but there are times when youre that big hu you hit a guy whos a foot smaller than you its not going to look good looks like youre fouling him yeah they definitely were trying to sell that one right there for SMU I think the big thing the guy with the ball in his hands he bur they got to do a better job in their ball screen coverage right now hes been able to manipulate this defense get into the paint and then find guys for open looks whether its live dunks or open threes here goes Hadley heper it was a day one starter at Madison for the Wisconsin Badgers so a fourthe starter in his first season at Louisville and the foul committed by Chuck Harris that is his first Harris is moved into the starting lineup another veteran piece for Andy Enfield and he has provided quite a lift he is their second leading score at 124 per game and his starting Co inides with this threegame winning streak for the Mustangs Hadley goes over the left shoulder great help side defense to come over and block the shot by yigu and here comes Music Applause Miller good job by Louisville to identify the trail shooter Louisville takes it Applause away urn uses screen from Frank Anum eay theres the former Syracuse Orange on the offensive glass kicks it back out to heurn Smith his first attempt nothing but net he doesnt need much room and when youre number six in cardinal look out three threes made per game if youre not there on the catch forget about it one of the best Shooters in college basketball and a quick release yeah he makes the most threes in the Atlantic Coast Conference over three and 1 half per game cross the Cardinals are Relentless and they have pretty clearly made themselves one of the teams to beat in the ACCC Duke is ahead of everybody but Louisville has a really good claim to being the second best team in this league and theyre playing like it I I think the difference in this game what Im seeing early on SMU not much ball movement on the other end Louisville a little bit more patient and getting a lot more quality looks smus got to settle down look theyre team that wants to get out in transition credit Louisville theyve done a good job in their transition defense so if youre SMU try to push the pace get out and transition in your half court sets though try to get a little bit more patience a couple bit more ball movement that was anelas first foul fifth on the team Harris throws it away a frustrating start to the night for the SMU Mustangs down by two touchdowns to Louisville its been all Louisville early Chucky heurn leading the way setting his teammates up Music SE car Music recogn thean Music Music I Music Music we welcome you back to ACC Network basketball presented by T Ro price thats Chucky heurn hes Malcolm Huckabee Im Doug Sherman it has been all Louisville so far and you talked about the connectedness of this Cardinals team nothing explains that more than what you see in the bottom of that list there nine assists on nine made field goals and its a reason why theyre difficult team to game plan for its not just one guy again weve talked about their stats and games obviously theyre on the winning streak right now uh but its their balance offensively four or five guys in double digits on any given night and then defensively really theyve made it difficult for SMU right now SMU 0 of6 from the threepoint line heurn now is responsible for 22 of the 27 louville points as Mr Smith hits his second triple and SMU went to Zone okay youre going to go to Zone the one guy you must identify is rank Smith if you leave him any space hes going to make you pay its as simple as that poopy Miller again another Point Blank opportunity for the terrific point guard from Chicago that has been missed yeah again hes gotten opportunities really uh not much other to say than hes just missed some layups and 11 field goals 11 assists third dunk of the night for James Scott I I mean that one should show up on Sports Center we got to see that again he threw it He adjusted did almost like a 360 spin in the air and then caught it and dunked it heu will head to the line with an opportunity to try and stop the eight nothing Louisville run and watch this play Chucky heurn throw it up adjust and then dunk it thats just too easy Sports Center my goodness what a play by heurn but once he gets by his Defender that draws yigu out and theres nobody there to defend Scott it was an easy lob pass and they got to make a decision SMU uh either you hedge and try to get the ball out of heers hand but you cant keep letting him come off ball screens because hes either going to snake it do do what he did last time and throw a lob or F guys for open threes weve got three great womens games for you this Sunday here on acc Network at noon Eastern Florida State meets 13th right North Carolina then at 2 Eastern BC takes on Wake Forest and will wrap up the day later at 6 Eastern with Virginia Tech and number 20 North Carolina state in Raleigh s yigu makes a couple of free throws hes at 59 on the year has a pretty nice stroke nonetheless yeah if numbers baffling because again he certainly has excellent form and rotation and weve talked about his potential and again you just cant appreciate his size until youre up on him he is all of 72 but the Louisville defense has been stifling SMU has made only three baskets theyve committed six turnovers going to be a foul called against SMU Johan trayor Music and I think this guy James Scott is The X Factor Doug you talked about this I think hes up to 43 dunks he came into the game with 40 dunks something they track fourth in college basketball but uh he is a lob threat and I think he also provides rent protection and rebounding for this Louisville team the Freshman Roots is fouled by Keon Ambrose Hilton one of the captains for Andy enfields team and Pat Kelce went out of his way to mention that Kai Ruth the 68 freshman from Washington DC is really coming on hes happy with how his freshman is playing a talent and again to have him with this mix I think thats key hes around a veteran core again guys that as you said have played a lot of college basketball so again you can uh sprinkle in a freshman like this U be at a very tent ented one but he gets to see how these guys operate and the coaching staff Braves about this young man at the line and his potential he was a top 50 recruit coming out of IMG who originally picked Michigan until Jawan Howard was fired and then in the springtime when all the coaches and the players were shuffling around he wound up choosing Louisville the second time around and theyre glad to have him he makes the first two free throws of the night for the Cardinals who lead by 19 watch how Louisville defends the ball screens again they bigs doing very good job hedging or switching on the ball screams Harris got it the senior from Ashburn Virginia makes just the fourth field goal of the night for SMU much needed Music bucket and again last time you scored 117 points the last time out how on Earth do you ever figure out this game of basketball well I think credit Louisvilles defense I think a lot of that uh goes to their defense theyre a very good defensive unit they can beat you with their offense but I think its their defense that sets the tone and youre absolutely right though SMU wanted a better offensive teams in the ACC and right now its been a struggle that was a second foul on Harris yeah for the the Mustangs they sent program records for points in a road game and points in a conference game it was the most in an ACC game since 2003 and its the fifth time this year SMU has gotten to Triple digits theyre stuck on 15 right now yeah I mean like you said baffling a lot of those again dont want to take anything away from the Louisville defense but theres been some missed opportunities early things that they normally make some layups and transition Harris Under Control on the post the former Butler Bulldog trying to assert Applause himself Luffy Miller remains on the SMU bench still without a point and that SMU defense loses track of number six who burns him again its like playing against Tom Brady again with heurn again you hes going to pick you apart if you leave any openings in your defense that time crosscourt pass to rain Smith again not sure how theyre leaving him but thats a breakdown in The Scouting Report R Smith one of the best threepoint Shooters in college basketball you have to be connected with him at all times Edwards a little short foul on the rebound Endo appeared to have his arm around the waist of Music Hadley and so Hadley quendo willll go to the line the fifth year from St Paul Minnesota quendo with his second foul you see Chuck Harris taking a seat and Hadleys one of those guys who has been around tremendous resume last two years at Colorado he played with three guys who were drafted last year and yet Pat Kelce believes he was the glue that held that team together and average double figures and then hes one of the guys Louisville is able to identify as our kind of guy and bring in and play for the cards yeah youre absolutely right guys like Cody Williams Tristan D Silva guys that were draft picks he played his role well on that team but make no mistake about it he has the talent they love his fit hes just another guy they plugged into this rotation and its wor Endo into the lane kicks it out to bopy Miller from the corner BJ Edwards Off the Mark 420 remaining in the half its been all Lille from the start here on the road at Moody Coliseum looking very much at home Javon Hadley from the corner and hes into double figures time out Music SMU well step away to catch our breath as the Cardinals are putting on a show Music St year n service Music Music Music Music thanks guys 4117 Louisville and once again Chucky heern doing everything for the Cardinals Malcolm got eight assists in this game he started a game off knocking down threes but his court Vision lobs right here stake the ball screen throw up the Lop 10point passing his ability to manipulate ball screens and then find open guys cutting to the basket or finding open guys on the threepoint line its been impressive Doug in his last game against Virginia when he had eight assists in the total game hes got eight and were not even done with the first half and Miller is shocking is anything 0 for five from the floor as you saw zero points zero assists that is the story right now see if the Mustangs in the final four minutes of the half can chip away at this significant deficit personal foul against trior senior from West Africa transferred in from Long Beach State where he spent the last three years first team All Conference of the big West a year ago another one of those veteran experienced pieces identified by Pat Kelce and his staff thats his first personal and the seventh against the Ville and so heu with a one and one and again in spite of the fact that hes only making 59 coming in hes got a nice stroke yeah it looks really good uh the release Point again uh the rotation really impressive for the 72 talented big for SMU and I like what theyve done again when they of course we Jinx him we say it looks good and then he goes and gets oneck up there yeah wide right but you can see why hes not a 80 free throw shooter but anyhow but I I I think couple things obviously dont want to file right there with louva and the bonus but offensively right now SMU really just not in flow and again credit a lot of it goes to Louisville keeping them out of transition mainly because they havent missed many shots so its hard to get transition when youre taking the ball out of the net but I think offensively again a little bit more patient and then defensively they got to figure out how to keep CH Chucky heern out of the paint again hes just breaking them down off of ball screens and just finding guys for easy opportunities you saw o quendo take a seat hes got three fouls and so Javon Hadley shooting a one and one 438 under four minutes to go Louisville looking for its ninth win in a row trying to improve to 81 and keep Pace with Duke in the ACC standings cross tough shot Hadley may have gotten a piece and here comes Louisville again numbers if they hurry but its taken away by Edwards keeps the dribble challenges Hadley and draws the foul theyve got not gotten much from BJ Edwards either he averages double figures hes got just two points they need him to get going as well well in in that situation right there Doug again theyve had some opportunities thats just should be an n one opportunity right there just missed the Music layup and so the former tennessy volunteer at the line gymnastics comes your way Sunday afternoon afterno here on acc network is 15th ranked Stanford squares off against number 25 pit at Fitzgerald fieldhouse in Pittsburgh coverage begins at 4 Eastern Malcolm Huckaby back in your Boston College days you must have played basketball at Fitzgerald Fieldhouse correct I did and a lot of battles Sean Miller on those teams Jason Matthews was another guard at that time but it is a wrestling and gymnastics venue now since the Peterson Event Center was built so we invite you to join us for womens gymnastics Sunday afternoon here on acc Music Network cross to Miller got the shot they wanted from the corner just couldnt convert Chuck Harris and its Louisville basketball great execution that time nice set get a wide open look in and out but they need more of that again that was a pretty good uh offensive possession by SMU just unable to convert the shot but again that was better because there was much more ball movement in that possession well theres so many ways to talk about the season Chucky heurn is in the midst of for Louisville heres another one if your name is next to Russ Smith he needed to make that shot to make this story sound a little better but he is the first guy since Russ Smith in Louisville uniform to have more than or six or more Steel in a game and that was only Midway through the regular season with the things he does at the offensive end its no wonder Louisville is so much better this year Edwards step back three way off the Mark didnt hit the rim so the shot clock continues to wind down now at six will Edwards shoot it again this time off the bounce Music tell abubacar trior is about as active as anybody in the ACC and thats what Ive noticed also in this game the activity of Louisville it seems like every 5050 ball has gone their way loose balls coaches talk about those plays we spoke with Pat Kelsey this afternoon in shoar around and he talked about that he said this is going to be a rock fight for us its going to come down to are we willing to go after those 5050 balls and do everything on the road to gain possession that has really been the case in this first half they just been the more active Applause Music team Edwards out and ruths back in Music Applause Jerell Colbert 610 Junior center from Houston has come into the game for the first time for the Mustangs Miller is fouled by Smith doing his best to stay in front of one of the quickest guards in the league but bopy Miller still sitting on zero when it comes to points and thats a heads up play that time by Boy Miller again youve been struggling from the perimeter struggling of just trying to finish see if you can get yourself to the free throw line dont settle for jumpers second foul on Smith well that is p Pat Kels son Johnny who has made his second trip of the year with Dad he went to Pittsburgh and now hes here at SMU and uh got to brag on him a little bit hes got a nice shot and as a matter of fact in a playful free throw shooting contest earlier today with the injured case in Prior 11yearold Johnny got the better up I think hes got better form than uh Doug Sherman hey now Ive seen you shoot uh jump shots and I tell you what Im taking him over you any day of the week now you could have taken him without throwing me under the bus Id be okay with that Id take rain Smith over Malcolm hucke any day Ill tell you what I cant argue with that one right there because that guy is automatic hes just getting too much air space again right now uh theyve got an issu SMU on both ends of the Court mainly though defensively they just have had no answer theyve tried Zone they picked it apart I I think again the inability to close out on rain Smith again thats just a breakdown in your Scouting Report hes the one guy you have to stay connected to at all times he very quietly has 12 points does Smith Colbert at The Rim now cross terrific on the offensive glass to Miller boys got his first made field goal of the Music night and again heper with the basketball 11 points nine assists they have made 14 baskets all 14 have been assisted and thats on the road too cuz sometimes you get a better ruling from the scores table at home when it comes to handing out assists and that will continue no assist but no M field goal as Chucky heurn will head back to the free throw line and thats something he does uh very well one of the best in the ACC at getting to the free throw line heurn again its just a heads up play he understands no need to force a jumper to see if you can continue to force the action going to the basket and get yourself to the free throw line the season high this year for SMU before tonight for points allowed in the first half was 46 back in November against Prairie View Cardinals have gone flying past that as they have reached half a Music 100 Miller Another missed layup Harris lost it out of Music bounds and smus biggest his deficit of the year was 15 at North Carolina back on January 7th they lost that game by 15 that number down 25 is going to be blown away here tonight as Louisville is just doing everything it wants on both ends yeah it its really been a clinic offensively in this first half and again theyve been doing it without Cas prior their fifth year who is out for the year with an injury out Corin Johnson as well but Pat Kelce just keeps dialing up plays and theyre getting it done J Music Music so Malcolm Huckaby you more impressed with Louisvilles defense or its offense pH I I mean it its hard its a toss up SMU a team that scored 117 points theyre stuck right now uh struggling to get maybe to 50 for this game if it keeps going this way but I have to say their offense uh their offense the way theyve been able to get easy shots to to me uh has been the thing that has impressed me the most its just been a clinic in the first half offensively and Louisville always takes a ton of Threes doesnt make a great percentage but if you take more than 30 and you make about a third of them thats a lot of points 5 seconds left on the shot clock they get the ball to Smith good job by Edwards to stay attached and make that a tough shot cross the other way gets it to Edwards under 5 Seconds to go in the half WI fed shot and the foul comes against the Cardinals so a good closing sequence for SMU and whats huge about that though I think that might have been on heurn second foul on heurn as Edwards makes the front end thats pretty STK difference right there it really is again credit Louisvilles defense a lot of it though again some of it missed opportunities theyve had a lot of missed layups SMU but make no mistake about it this Louisville defense has been equally as impressive as their offensive output in the first half heern beats the buzzer from mid Court a rare Miss for the Cardinals here at Moody Coliseum tonight Cardinals up by I think the biggest issue they got to figure out is defensively it was just too easy for Louisville in that first half yigu do a nice job getting the big guy involved to start on their first possession and nice job that time Louisville elected not to double and he was able to go to work now lets see if they can put together a couple of stops on the defensive end rain Smith back out to James Scott get the ball back into the hands of Chucky heer lobin inside the defender had his back turn and thats the easiest two James Scotts going to get here tonight his court awareness again weve been talking about him I can probably play a recording turn your back hes just going to find guys and again you have to be alert when he has the ball in his hands haris finds Miller boopy puts his head down Scott comes over to block the shot Music heurn 13 points to lead all scores along with the nine assists in the first half pass deflected out of bounds by BJ Edwards and the Cardinals will keep and against right here again turn your head for a second hes just going to find guys a excellent Court awareness and on the other end again understanding The Scouting Report heurn and in particular Smith must be connected with those two guys and defend the threepoint line and I jipped him an assist hes already got 10 assists now so a double double in points and assist for Chucky heern and their string of every made field goal being assisted continues it really is something how well Louisville has played theyve played one of the toughest schedules in the country they really challenged themselves in November and December they took some losses but Pat Kels team continues to get better were 2 months in 2 and 12 months in now and they are better than they were in November and at their rate of improvement Malcolm youve got to figure this is going to be a very dangerous team to maybe be a second weekend team in the NCA tournament oh I think they have all the things that you need to be successful to make an NCAA run you have a star player Chuck and Chucky heurn but then I think uh you have as you take a look at their resume a guy in Rain Smith and weve talked about it averaging three threes made per game he spaces the four so you have to identify him and then there are other guys Ive been impressed with Scott I think hes of The X Factor for them James Scott he catches lobs uh hes a good rim protector and hes kind of that XFactor guy that does all the little things those 5050 balls the things that may not show up on The Scouting Report cross tried to dribble through a double team hes got the ball back but now hes triple team on the court and and its a held ball the possession arrow goes the other way its been a quiet game for Matt cross for BJ Edwards for bopy Miller these guys are all double figure scores and nobodys been able to get it going yeah and and Buys again I cant give it all to the credit of of the Louisville defense hes missed some easy opportunities that he normally finishes just some point blank layups like frankly that have gone in and out and I think thats uh hurt his confidence early in this one and then hes had spend so much time chasing on the defensive end the layup missed by Scott but its the exact same thing we just saw soet yigu getting lost defensively has his back to the basketball and heurn makes a perfect pass around his head and look at the design of the plays that theyre running theyre putting yigao in the ball screens so again hes away from the basket so now hes chasing out on the perimeter trying to get back and protect the paint thats by design theyre pulling them away from the basket then Scott compounds the Miss layup by committing his second foul of the night 5529 Louisville the Cardinals back in the AP Top 25 for the first time in four Music Applause years AIS with two to shoot beats the buzzer and a rebounding Music foul thatll go against James Scott and that is number three on number Music zero so Scott takes a seat Harris leaves for Music SMU Kio o quendo back out there for SMU he committed three fouls in the first half poopy Miller off the front rim here come the Cardinals rain Smith with it got to guard him out to the logo he will shoot Music it good help by Miller he deflected the ball off the leg of the ball handler Javon Hadley coughs it Music up Kevin bopy Miller his uncle bopy died when Kevin was young his mom Asia saw similarities between her sons and her deceased brother so she bequeathed the nickname boopy and it has stuck one of my favorite all name team but in they struggle tonight thus far against this Louisville Music defense SMU Basketball SMU came into this game after picking up up two mustwin Road games theyre trying to build their resume as well and they come into the night Joe lardi says they were just on the wrong side of the bubble second team out and they could have used this win if they could have a miraculous comeback it would be their first quad one win of the year and probably put them on the right side of the bubble but they have so far laid an egg transition defense is something that SMU talked about over and over and over again in BJ Edwards did not identify rain Smith and he makes him pay one more time its all set up by their defense it still continues to be all Louisville in this game Music Applause home as Music Applause Music hallu hallu believe Music Music Music Music than Music Louisville 58 SMU 29 at Moody Coliseum again weve been talking about whats been better the defense of the offense they work hand in hand yeah and this is the reason why the score is the way it is stopping ball penetration and then get out and transition and find your Shooters uh it has been a continued Clinic uh in this game both defensively and offensively uh really uh SMU has struggled right now again uh offensively everything has been a struggle before them and then defensively they just had no answer to stop this Louis off offense and those those 11 assists are a career high for Chucky heurn with his second double double of the year that foul was on Smith his third PJ Edwards with the Music basketball Yan trayor picks up his dribble finds cross s taken a long time to get into any action on this end down to three two and one as cross puts it up and in Matt cross SMU is his fourth Collegiate stop Coral Gables for a year with Jim Larona then a year with Louisville and then the last two years at Music UMass had some good years under Frank Martin at UMass and again yeah First Team all 81 a year ago playing his final year here in Dallas Music Music now Music Music TR Music 2 e Music we have ask you to help people affected by the California wildfires in 2025 donate at redcrossorg ESPN to help the Red Cross respond and help people recover back in Moody Coliseum here in Dallas Texas with Malcolm Huckaby the former Boston College Eagle Im Doug Sherman glad youre with us for one of the Premier games in the ACC this week Louisville riding an eight game winning streak to get back into the national rankings for the first time in four years an SM you up until tonight Malcolm had been playing very very well yeah they just right now have run into a lisal team that is playing as good as anybody in college basketball on the eight green win streak coming into this one theyre just clicking in both phases defensively and offensively weve got an injured Cardinal down to the Baseline as you see its Javon Hadley the fifth year out of ceton Durham Hall High School in St Paul Minnesota comes away holding his Music jaw and didnt really see it from our angle we were blocked Im not sure if it was his own teammate or apparently we didnt have any cameras that got whatever happened but it if it was friendly fire then you wouldnt go to the video monitor but anytime you come away with someone holding their jaw like they were hit they would go to the Monitor and check so not really sure now would they check if I were to happen to Elbow you in the jaw in the middle of the game if they didnt I would tell them to you you would go for an official review on that I think you just threaten me on National Television BJ Edwards BJ Edwards I didnt realize it was going to come to this moment well you know what did I do to you sometimes you know Music shman Ruth driving dish plenty of cardinals to choose from around the perimeter they got it to the right one and a rebounding foul as Roose went down hard Johan trayor the Junior from France with the personal me and trayor had a nice conversation after shoot around he was born in France I spent two years playing professionally in France and did you ever punch anybody in France uh no that probably would have gotten me sent home only my broadcast partner every once in a while like to give a hard time keep you on your toes Kai ruths will have a chance for three but uh so did you speak any french to trayor when you saw him I told him I forgot all my French thats the one word I remember but right now uh Doug this Louisville team continues to impress with their unselfish play I think thats you know yes heern has been unbelievable in this but you look at this WOW 17 assists but look at the line of the bottom no AC team has assisted on every made Basket in a game since 1996 97 Music wow airball o quendo Here Comes Edwards Terren Edwards Jr goes right around BJ Edwards plus the foul 5050 balls going their way and then theyre getting out in transition another easy opportunity and Music one thats the fourth foul on o quendo BJ Edwards trying to explain to his coach why he really didnt defend the ball handler there as though he was going to try and take a charge perhaps but he didnt move his feet gave up an easy two and a chance for three here for Terrence Edwards in the fifth year from Atlanta does just that and Louisville has a fatigue this SMU team again they spent so much energy chasing on the defensive end really I think its impacted their offense as well too a 30point Louisville Music lead cross backing down little fade away he says Larry Birds his guy thats why he wears number 33 that had a little flare of Larry Legend back in the day yeah and thats head up play again thats something they can uh go back to again in that situation try to create some mismatch see if you can Force Louisville to double and then maybe potentially start hitting some threes but again I think thats going to be part of the solution the other end is right here trying to get some stops against this movable team Chucky heurn shot pocket three Hadley lets see if they give an assist on that or is the streak broken if this was being played at the Young Center I bet you theyd give him an assist I dont know about here at Moody Coliseum its like the official score in a baseball game when youve got a no hitter going yeah they cant give him assist on that one right there that was I counted maybe two dribbles so is that the rule come on you can give an assist on anything no they didnt give an assist at least not yet and so heurn will take a seat with his third personal hes like why didnt they give me an assist Johan tror see more and more Frenchmen making their way to the United States and making a big impact towards Victor wanyama leads the charge but the ACC has a marvelous Frenchman who might wind up being the ACC player of the year for Stanford rain Smith reigning threes one more Music time you know Pat KY said that he didnt necessarily think that rain Smith was going to take the jump in terms of productivity that he did going from the College of Charleston at a mid major spot in the ca last year to where he is now and what hes doing in the ACC but hes surrounded by such good players shares the back court with a guy like Chucky heern and hes blowing the lid off it thats the key its who you surround him with hes a floor spacer again when you can shoot the ball the way he does uh theyre going to find a spot for you and particularly when you have Playmakers out there that can find you and again its just been a really good mix in terms of the Personnel that Al Louisville has on this team and feeling looking over at the Louisville bench with the fans in cardinal red having fun here tonight in Big D I said I wasnt going to do it but Im going to throw it out there hes making it rain right now cross will have a chance for three but rain Smith third in the league in threepoint shooting percentage leads the league in made threes he is piling up more triples here today one of the best Shooters in college basketball ball on fire tonight rain Smith making it rain seven threepointers a season high for him Music Music is Music Music fo basket for just Music ACC mens basketball is presented by T rooll price invest with confidence we are here at SMU in Dallas Texas and the defense that we have seen from the 25th ranked Cardinals has been outstanding right from the opening tip Malcolm and I think look weve talked a lot about their offensive output and yes it has been impressive but for me what theyve done to this SMU team uh this Pat Peli quote really sums it up about the attitude and mentality that they have taken to each game and each guy individually you know Doug smm us a team thats very good offensively we talked about it put up 117 points right now 16 from the threepoint line to of 12 and theyre shooting 31 from the floor big reason is because of this Louisville defense they been equally as impressive uh as their offensive output on the defensive end well they have a net of 29 did I undersell them when I said they could have a chance to get to the second weekend are they better than that are they as good as that where do you think louville is right now as a team when you put it all together what we have seen from them during this eight game looks like soon to be nine game winning streak where would you put Louisvilles ceiling this year when we get through March and into April dangerous they can beat you with their defense they dont have to have a great offensive night to beat you because they are very solid defensively I think the biggest thing is the way they shoot the ball and then when you have a point guard like Chucky heern again Ive talked a lot about Mark Sears when Ive been in studio the Alabama point guard LED them to a final four you have a lead guard that can control the tempo and pace and set his teammates up but oh by the way he can score if he needs to as well too you become a very dangerous team I think theyre look the way theyre playing right now I would not want to see them uh in the NCAA tournament so to answer your question I think theyre a very dangerous team and yes I think theyre a second week a team that can go on an NCAA tournament run if theyre able to get in AJ George just into the game for SMU picks up the foul here is heurn who you talking about hes put on a show tonight guarded by cross Cross by the way seven of his nine points have come in the second half keep an eye on rain Smith always lurking instead Scott with a shot clock down to three put it up Rain Smith with 21 points to lead all scorers as we mentioned his season high is seven made threes hes got six and Counting Up Above the Rim yigu puts it back through well you can see why though the upside uh Scouts get excited about it again hes got something you cant teach Elite size and length and hes not just a statue he can move and hes got good hands as well a lot of guys who are that big not that there are many on the planet who are 7 2 in tall but hes a freshman whos already thick and hes mobile very mobile we had a chance to see him and shoot around round and again mobile as you said and not bad shot mechanics as well either so again the future very bright for him ceiling really is just so high for what his potential could be tough night so far for bopy Miller he takes a seat with two fouls heper inside to Scott another field goal without an assist whats going on with Louisville Hadley with the tip in offensive rebound again its been that as well too cross doing some work here in the second half he leads SMU with 11 points well although its been a struggle uh as a team again Matt cross boopy Miller those two guys have been playing well for SMU and and its been a struggle tonight but they can continue to battle and thats a nice move by cross that time taking advantage of the mismatch down in the post fourth foul on Scott and cross now with 10 of his 12 points since the break four fouls on Music Hadley cap Bur nice pass inside kick it out Edwards for an open three well we talked about SMU with its threegame winning streak more impressively Louisville winning eight in a row thats one of the longest streaks in the country Duke meanwhile has won 12 in a row ever since putting C on James the twolane transfer into the starting lineup but theres another team trending in the right direction right now in the ACC and thats Wake Forest and they were in the midst of a big stretch right now playing Carolina over on ESPN and the last I saw they were winning wake is another team that could wind up doing some damage if they can get themselves into the NCA tournament and the star player has been playing great lately I love Hunter Salis again one of the best players not just in the ACC but in college basketball the guy that flirted with going to the NBA and again another guy that is a matchup problem now right now wake home against Carolina is leading 5149 with 7 minutes to go over on ESPN and then their next game is home against Duke on Saturday so they are getting an opportunity for a couple of big resume boosting wins this week at home and you know the Joel Coliseum is rocking tonight and itll be rocking on Saturday when the Blue Devils come another dunk for James Scott and another assist for Chucky heurn Music okendo dribble hand off to cross goes right through the chest of the freshman and its an offensive foul I dont think theres should be any argument on this right here he just barreled him over and again just thats a player control foul right there and its been that type of night for SMU theyre going to take a look on replay to see if there was contact to the head you know Matt cross tweaked his back in the season opener missed some games and continues to receive to receive treatment for that but he does not play in a manner that hes nursing a bad back he just goes 100 all the time yeah he does again going hard looks at theyre taking a look I dont think there was anything there again I dont I dont think there was anything from that angle right there its just a player control foul hes just lowering his shoulder and there was nothing extra afterwards M Keli was upset thought there was maybe something flagrant but I dont think theres much there from that angle right there again its just player control Foul Play on and again its just been a frustrating night for SMU call stands on the floor offensive foul thats Lee cel vetan officiating crew think take a look at it and then make sure theres nothing there and play on not necessary to take a lot of time on that one right Music there did you bring your cowboy boots down here to Texas from Connecticut hear the country music playing here for a couple of guys from the Northeast I am a Dallas Cowboys fan ah and you admit to it still I I admit to it but I certainly am not going to be wearing cowboy boots uh my brother martin who lives down in this area I told him I better not see him with any cowboy boots but Ill live with a Cowboys Hat I guess a rare Miss for rain Smith who has made six triples tonight cross wide open got it he continues to play hard and again thats one of the things I really like about his game up or down hes going to continue to play Music hard from the high post Ruth nice shovel pass Scott goes strong to the rim and hes fouled and going to get yigu who fouled him on the arm well Scott you put him in the dunker position and he doesnt try to do things hes not capable of and again he had a really good year a season ago at the College of Charleston for Pat Kelsey made the all rookie team in the CA and at that time he was the fourth youngest player in division one so hes still a very young sophomore and his upside is pretty significant and James Scott fits what Louisville needs out of him hes again I said it earlier yes we talk about Chucky heurn yes we talk about rain Smith rightfully so some of the other guys but for me James Scott is that xfactor guy and you all the things they track he came into this game fourth in college basketball in dunks I think hes going to move up in the ranks after this game I havent kept track but I got to imagine hes got at least four or five dunks in this game alone most of them from some lobs thrown from Chucky heer fourth foul on Scott whos got 11 points getting close to his career high which was 14 points a couple of times last year Music for BJ Edwards out of Knoxville Catholic High School he stayed home to begin his college career played for Rick Barnes as a reserve as a freshman on their 2023 sweet 16 team but he didnt get a lot of minutes transferred to SMU and now a seconde starter last year for Rob laner now the head coach at rice and this year year one of the few holdovers with first year head coach Andy Enfield and they made a nice jump as well too last season only three points per game 18 minutes per game this season a different role and hes doubled his production and up to double digits and second on the team and assist as well too so doing a little bit of everything for this team can I Roost with an easy 10 points five rebounds so far tonight BJ Edwards drains the three Music pass deflected out of bounds by Edwards Louisville will keep in the corner with 15 to shoot well be back for the final 723 at Moody Coliseum Music Music Applause great Music Music n Music Music Music if this game was being played at the Yum Center in Louisville the Cardinal student section would be wearing umbrellas on their head because rain Smith has been making it rain its simple as this one of the best Shooters in college basketball he came into this game second in college basketball in total thre made at 68 hes got seven tonight 7 to 10 from the threepoint line most of them have been breakdowns uh defensively by SMU just too much earspace fourth time for him this season to go for 20 or more you see the Louisville record for made threes in a game was nine over 20 years ago but uh Smith has done better than that he had 10 in a game for the College of Charleston when he had his career high which was 32 points last February against Campbell so he may not be done still on the floor with 715 remaining abubakar Applause trayor Edwards lob it inside igu huge size advantage and he takes advantage off the glass for two yeah great job that time posting cealing getting great position using that large body and then soft touch its a little jump Music hook Smith his attempt for an eighth made three goes out of bounds for a team defensive rebound for SMU thats how you get a team defensive rebound no individual grabbed it but youve got to account for the missed shot so its a team rebound always educating that chairman I love it both my parents were School teachers cross having a huge second half 16 of his 18 have come in the second half well Doug its a 17point game right now again 624 Louisville has been in control but Ive seen crazier things happen in comebacks again there still plenty of time I shouldnt say plenty but there still is time for a comeback Smith give him eight two off his career high and the lead is back to 20 not though if they cant identify rain Smith out of the Zone again you cant trade buckets with them right now with this type of deficit again SMU playing Zone Smith is the one guy you have to identify cannot lose track of him jockey hurn with 13 assists which are the most for anybody in the ACC this year calls timeout so if youre Pat Kelsey in this timeout as youve seen a 30 plus point lead dwindle a bit what do you reinforce in this huddle well again do what youve been doing which is defending uh theyve had a couple of breakdowns uh defensively I think offensively the biggest thing you want to do 537 you got to be patient uh you may have to turn down some shots to run clock right now but you dont have to take the first good look you get again layup if its rain Smith open three okay thats almost as good as taking a layup if hes open uh but you want to run some clock right now 8265 lead and then I think defensively again you cannot uh lose focus thus far in this game youve been solid uh defensively Im sure thats part of of what his conversations with them is get back to uh that same intensity defensively that got to the big lead I find interesting during practices and shoot around that Pat Kelce changes the volume of how he speaks Smith my goodness nine made threes and its back to a 20point lead and watch the screen were going to probably get a replay on that but the screening uh thats key in this again we talked a lot about rain Smith getting open but the GU setting screens for him they do a great job setting flare screen pin Downs those bigs and wings do a great job freeing him up for these looks 27 points for R Smith now starting to say how coach Kelce changes the volume of how he talks to his players goes almost to a whisper to further make sure that he has his players attention Terrence Edwards for three and I found it interesting as opposed to yell yell yell or the same volume all the time he always seems to have his players attention Id never seen a coach do it that way there were a lot of things that we saw just in his approach that were different and got a little distracted though cuz Chucky heern seems to be okay now assist number 14 but he was winsing coming up to court was holding his shoulder for a second but that lot pass looked pretty good so a good sign if youre moving car man seeing him Music okay well people knew he would be impactful transferring from Wisconsin again a threeyear starter for the Badgers but I dont think people outside of Louisville thought hed have this kind of impact yeah I mean all big 10 defensive team I dont think many saw the offensive output and impact that he would have on this unit again he just makes them a very difficult team to match up with because of that right there again his ability to break down uh the defense and then kick out and find guys really is what makes them a team that again Ill say it they are a very dangerous team a new career high for James Scott this time on an assist that wasnt to the rim back right after this Music Music Music basket back wed right United States right and you see his 16 assists tonight the most by an ACC player since 201617 Dennis Smith Jr for the wolf P its really impressive Clinic you know you can pick many words it was just a dominant performance by him he set the tone early in this game and but that high assist number really was some of the best passing that Ive seen this year in college basketball and its not just Chucky Malcolm theyve got 29 made field goals 27 of them have been assisted so hes got 16 but his teammates have whats that 11 assists in addition to that and not surprisingly thats a new season High Smith misses from the corner another rebound for Scott and bring it back out with 20 on the shot Music clock in and out the folks who are here in Louisville gear making some noise a lot of the SMU fans have headed home but those from Louisville are many of them on their feet behind the Cardinals bench Johan trayor throws it Applause down well the last time SMU allowed 100 points was at Texas Tech over 20 years ago go it could happen again here tonight tiet gorner with the pass up ahead and weve got a foul on the layup attempt Louisville if it does get to 100 would be the uh second time this year theyve gotten there they put a 100 on their cross town rival Beller back in November team the half at the line foru Thursday night at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game and look ahead at the best matchups of the weekend theyll also be joining you right here after our game tonight with a minute 48 remaining PJ Edwards made the first missed the second well bopy Miller never got going tonight in our premium point guard matchup it has been all Chucky heurn and the guys around him have played their role to Music Perfection Smith even with the 61 Johan trayor in his face the corner three is good and you can see The Joy among the Cardinals 10 made threes ties his career high set last year against Campbell when he played for the College of Charleston theyre checking to see if his foot yeah thats right there thats a three and so now he is too shy of his career rear high of 32 points and it looks like that will have to wait for another day because he is receiving congratulations on the Louisville Music bench Frank Anum eBay back into the game Devon Hadley is out Music there heres Edwards Music in the second Music Applause Music Applause Music down now from here Louisvilles got the next week off they are reaching their by riding a nine game winning streak before they play Wake Forest at home one week from tonight now if youre riding a nine game winning streak if youre Pat Kelce do you not want the buy do you want to keep playing I think you want to keep playing I I think again if you had guys banged up and needed to readdress some things then yes certainly you want a little bit more time but the way theyre playing right now obviously you want to keep that momentum Music going tell you what Kai ruse has put together a really nice game for Lou Music shot clock is off George is fouled by ruths and so the 66 Jr from Fresno California will head to the Music line well Doug we talked about the importance of this game for both teams coming into this one Louisville we talked about it first time since 2021 uh theyve been into the top 25 and they certainly wanted to stay there they didnt want it to be a shortlived uh adventure for them uh and then on the other end the importance for SMU to have a statement win on their Applause resume certainly you have to credit Louisville how they came out and really no other way around it dominated this game that Kelsey is emptied as bench Aiden M Cole Sherman Patrick Antonelli Spencer leg as well and with a shot clock off theyre not going to get an opportunity to shoot it but theyre in the box score and part of a now nine game winning streak Louisville with ease takes down SMU 9873 it was a dominant performance led by Chucky heern and
