and Mo Vassel sophomore from Brooklyn fores The 202526 season is underway here in Midtown Atlanta The Yellow Jackets control the opening tip and off we go Chaz Kelly the third tries to float it to Cila He wasnt looking and a turnover in the opening possession A look at the Hawks starting five Four newcomers in the starting five for Maryland Eastern Shore including Jaden Cooper Michael Teal a first team preseason selection in the MAK on the conference team And how about the freshman Levi Beckwith also getting the start and he lets it go from the left wing Offensive rebound for the Hawks Quarter three ball down the well for Jaden Cooper Second chance opportunities Thats something the Hawks uh will need to do tonight Crash the glass Second possession for Georgia Tech A look at the starting lineup Two returners Jaden Mustaf and Kesi Reeves taking it to the hole Kui Reeves a chance to tie us up with an and one And for the Yellow Jackets great to see Kui Reeves He played the first six games last season but did not play after that His season ended in November with a foot injury and opted to return to Georgia Tech for one more season Yeah in the 23 24 season on the flats he averages shy of 10 points Uh hes athletic Uh hes got a lot of experience Played two years at Florida as well So a mature player Misses the free throw The Yellow Jackets 10 newcomers on this team Last year Tech 17 and 17 10 and 10 in the ACC That was just the third time in nearly 20 seasons they have finished 500 or better in league play Long entry pass Crab jars it loose Its Georgia Tech basketball Well I think weve already seen a turnover on both sides of the ball That will be key Its a season opener Theres nerves obviously uh new faces new teammates uh who can take care of the basketball slow themselves down stay disciplined to the system theyve worked on in practice here in the preseason And that might be the biggest question for coach Damon Stamire with this years team is can they take care of the basketball Chaz Kelly transfer from Boston College feeds Cila down low HES TRAPPED GOING UP HE FINISHES ANYWAY The first points for the freshman from Sagal Great demonstration of his patience his poise inside He had himself gathered Hes got great hands and hes strong You know hes almost 21 years old Uh not your typical freshman Yeah Turning 21 in January Meanwhile 6 and2 last year Those six wins only two against division one opponents That three is way off the mark Koisy Ree runs the break They feed Cila again back TO THE BASKET SPINS AND JAMS IT HOME MO Sila announcing his presence in Atlanta Oh he faked inside Quick spin You see the agility right there Thats what you know pro scouts are excited about that This guy can really move his length uh and finishes well above the rim And Georgia Tech little fullcourt press here Something Damon Steinmar has also talked about with the depth he has in this roster John they want to play up the floor all 94 ft as often as they can Good handles from Michael Teal Kick out Beck with second three wont fall And another rebound for Reeves Right now its the Kelly and Cila show Kelly a parttime starter last year for Boston College Jaden Mustaf is fouled on the feed down to Cila Hawks pick up the foul here Well get a look at Cila Uh look at the patience sees the floor knows theres no help on the baseline side and the quick agility Throw it down See welcome to college basketball And a couple of subs coming in Aai Fleming in for the Yellow Jackets as Jaden Mustaf has a seat Another one of the six freshman Georgia Tech brought in this year Kai Fleming another SC next top 100 recruit Craft lobs to Cila A lot of contact down low and Ron Groover our lead official tonight makes the call in his 21st season officiating ACC basketball And thats going to be on Levi Beckley That was a good look at you know Craft right there Number 12 for the Yellow Jackets Transfer from Miami Ohio Shot 43 from beyond the arc last year His ability to command respect from beyond the arc allowed him to make that dribble penetration and then lobbing it to Cila at the rim That was a nice read by Craft Baseline impound from Kelly Cila going against Flipping and hes fouled Third foul pardon Fourth foul now ones Sila showing the skill face up the ability to put the ball on the ground Uh hes not your typical back to the basket plotter Thats becoming extinct in todays game and Damon Stomire knows that Hes recruiting to his system Hes done a great job recruiting bringing in highlevel talent 610 freshman Misses the first free throw Look at head coach Damon Statamire in his third season leading Georgia Tech And John we mentioned it at the top of the show but this might be the most talented roster Georgia Tech has had in over a decade You factor in a couple of SC Next top 100 recruits That doesnt include Cam Craft with his shooting prowess Cole Kiraak we might see a little later on Sila hits the second Hes got five of Georgia Techs seven points More pressure by Georgia Tech Got to get out of there Hall dumps it off to Teal Racing past Davi Remachin Corner three Hall No And CEO with the rebound Controls it for Georgia Tech There you look at the recruiting rankings Georgia Tech 17th nationally and sixth in the ACC And a poor pass from Kelly cheering Playing a little fast Yeah you see the nerves You know its first game of the season The ball just got away from him Let it fly out of bounds Mustaf in for Kelly Georgia Tech a 70 run after that early three from the Hawks of Maryland Eastern Shore Michael Teal against the freshman Reagan cheering And thatll stay with Maryland Eastern Short Davi Ree out of Germany So still fair number of international flavor on this Georgia Tech roster Two players from Sagal checking out Jaden Cooper And now Payton Marshall making his Georgia Tech debut Spent last season at Missouri but from Atlanta Went to Kell High School They won a state title at Kell High School up the street in Marietta Empty possession for the Hawks Marshall a sevenfooter on the floor for Georgia Tech wearing five in white Freshman Fleming double team The Jackets whip it around Reeves to the rim Cant draw iron Solid rotations by the Hawks on that possession Theyre playing manto man and uh theyre helping recover has been on point Teal trying to break down on Reeves and Reeves called for the foul Well step aside Opening night Georgia Tech Maryland Eastern Shore The Yellow Jackets on a 70 run early preseason all ACC selection by Dongo not dressed out tonight You look at the numbers he put up last year 13 and n third team all conference selection and we are told he is unavailable tonight but John you look at the bigger picture over the course of this season youve got Bongo returning Moila whos already been impressive in his first five minutes as a college player you also mix in Payton Marshall transfer from Missouri at 7 feet and Cole Kiraak who we havent seen yet he too a sevenfooter thats a lot of size for Georgia Tech in the front court yeah front court is definitely a strength of the brackets Its probably one of the better ones in the league Um B is a guy that you saw his statistics there but he actually averaged a double double in ACC league games at 14 and 10 Most most players are stats go down when you get in the league play By rose to the occasion thats just the second shot attempt inside the threepoint line for Meanwhile Georgia Tech theyve yet to take a three Theyve been pounding it inside And they go to Marshall again Flipping goes down Thatll be an offensive foul on Marshall And Marshall was getting a little ISO right there but the Hawks playing physical brand of basketball Um theyre really getting after it on the manto man Uh on the offensive side they just havent been able to find it Shooting threes uh on most possessions One of five from beyond the arc are the Hawks Here comes Michael Teal spent the last two years at South Carolina State transferring in to Maryland Eastern Shore within the conference Flipping kick out works it back outside Gustav knocks it loose Five to shoot Baseline falling away and the shot from Zion Oanla but the pass picked off by Oanla Over five minutes now without any points for Maryland Eastern Shore Little Helter Skelter now Teal open in the corner His three wont fall And now one for seven for from three and a foul coming here on Georgia Tech Its going to be on Davi Remagan That was off the ball on the rebound action But what I like about the Yellow Jackets team their wings have some great size I mean when you have Mustaf playing point guard 65 220 you know great size in the back court and thats going to help them defensively Fleming really good looking prospect I love his length Hes got some good bounce We just saw it on that rebound there after the whistle Thats what weve been talking about Georgia Tech working in the paint Maryland Eastern Shore Fourth in the MAK last year in threepoint shooting Again a lot of new faces for both these teams Dont look too much at last season stats 4 seconds to shoot Flipping is fouled with under 3 seconds to go on the shot clock Payton Marshall quickly picks up his second Marshall will get a break Its not a bounce situation 20 seconds on the shot clock And Damon Statmires first ever recruit Cole Kiraak who would have come in last year but reclassified is making his Georgia Tech debut He obstructs the pass entry pass and Fleming picks it off Twoonone Akai Fleming tries to label it in back to Fleming Now load to Kiraak and hes fouled Its on Justin Mond So both coaches already going deep into their bench here in the first six plus minutes Really good high low action Number 12 Mond foul occurred below the waist When youre Mond at six feet and youre guarding Cole Kiraak at seven feet a lot of those fouls are going to be below the laughter waist Going to be hard to foul him up high See youre a smart guy Youre a Georgia Tech grad You know every once in a while I dont know how I got through this place They like you John They Thats why they let you through Flip and reverse under the rim And this foul on Mohamd Cup the team there Well get a better look at it right here It was a late whistle Minimal contact Cila nice job staying vertical but a little bit of body Puts Chris Flipping at the line cheering Flippin hits the first free throw This is the second year for head coach Cleo Hill Jr for Maryland Eastern Shore And Chris Flippen that was his first recruit out of the transfer portal Spent two years at Highland Community College in Kansas And Flipping was eager to get to in fact he wanted to take an official in June but coach Hill had yet to move to Princess and Maryland So he had a little trouble getting flippant on campus He said Im not on campus yet I just took the job Coach Hill said he was We were talking to him the other day on the phone He said I was still living in a hotel I didnt have I dont even know my way around campus And it looks like this foul here is going to be against Flippen Good look right there at Coach Hill Great pedigree almost 20 years as a head coach Has had tremendous success at a 27 win season It was at Shaw University uh and a title there But hes won wherever he has gone and hes hes been able to rebuild programs Thats whats most impressive about him You see his father Cleo Hill senior He was a St Louis Hawk back in the early 60s before they moved to Atlanta Mustaf down the baseline And off the right leg Trey Brown Played with the great Bob Pettit Numbers hanging in the rafters down at State Farm Arena here One of the great Hawks and NBA players in the last 50 60 years now No kidding Some inbounds will come from the baseline Cam Craft to trigger for Georgia Tech Looks right at CEO Wastes no time CEO looking to bang here on Landro And Cila rejected by Locandra Straight up Good defense there by the transfer from Concordia University Irvine Theyre 13 to play Good hands by Fleming Cant quite corral it but good active hands Thats that length youre talking about in the wing And hes hes bouncing Fast twitch muscles Hes gets in there in the lane Here we see a look at Dongo Hes caught a little backboard on the way up too Lost it Uh but Georgia Tech defensively on the wings Uh tremendous athleticism Thats something coach start and the staff recruits to I showed last year they were fifth in the ACC in field goal percentage defense Uh so its definitely recruiting for length size to help on the defensive side of the ball At the end of the shot clock a right hand laying wont fall for Trey Brown Here come the Yellow Jackets up the floor Kelly back in Cila moving screen there Offensive foul and thats his second That was one of the things Coach Datimire talked a lot about in the preseason Theyve got to be able to defend without fouling And thats now two bigs for Georgia Tech with two fouls Sometimes theres an art to that Its an IQ thing especially when youre big Youre playing against smaller quicker guards So youve got to be able to read your opponent Allow create space and not let a great point guard put a foul on you Yellow Jackets havent scored in over four minutes And in that time theyve committed four turnovers Both teams easing into this season opener down low Thats Dorian Staples The extra pass to Locandro cheering Nice big to him Kelly looks to craft cheering and he tries to beat it to Reeves Scrum for the basketball Curax all the way down Hes fighting for it And now weve got a jump ball and thatll be Maryland Eastern Shore basketball as theyve cut lead to one And well step aside here from Mameish Pavilion Opening night Hey hey go down on yourself How you doing Maryland Eastern Shore cuts Georgia Techs lead to one Might be asking yourself who is Maryland Eastern Shore Well glad you asked And HBCU founded just a year after Georgia Tech in 1886 You can see in the Delm Marva area Princess Anne Maryland little over 3500 students And what are those alumni names You got Clarence Clemens the great saxoponist They call him the big man And Art Shell tackle for the Raiders way back about 50 years ago Now out of the timeout after the jump ball Eric Chadfield Jr number two in white making his Yellow Jacket debut True freshman at Pace Academy here in Atlanta and a chance for the Hawks to take the lead And look at Chatfield and itll be called for the foul Its now seven personal fouls for the Yellow Jackets The Hawks on the other side of the ball have six fouls So little sloppy early on And you said it Wy who has the ability and the discipline to uh not foul not give up the freebies at the line And that was over 40t away from the basket That second foul is Justin Mond hits the first of the one and one Boy you you in no doubt Mond transferring in from Georgia Southwestern State Division 2 school about 2 and 12 hours south here of Atlanta Southwest actually Georgia Tech a little bit of foul trouble and another foul cheering Just a little miscommunication there on the wing Uh Craft was catching on the run and the ball screen was never set right here Dribble handoff Little bit of movement Tough call Georgia Tech now has seven turnovers Theyve taken seven shots And that one right there was you know it wasnt forced as part of the action so to speak Just unfortunate Uh and it was an aggressive turnover If youre going to make them you want them to be aggressive Well Condros pass ricochets off the rim right into the hands of Chaboy Thompson And good contest by Craft forcing the turnover Kiraak gets it off to Kelly That number about says it all right there on the RIGHT TAKE YOUR BOY TAKE YOUR BOY Kelly gets the switch so far Joseph Landro Hes been very disruptive Yeah for sure And Georgia Tech a team thats going to play point guard by committee Uh that thats going to be the scout on them Get up pressure and force the perimeter of the Yellow Jackets to make plays Can they handle get it heated up on the perimeter draft into the freshman Chatfield Kick out Kelly lines up a three Levi Beck with the board Its a nice pass by Chatfield Inside out gets to the paint Create Sucked in the defense Yellow Jackets cant buy one First threepointer Tech has attempted tonight The left side screaming now Thats Dorian Staples Corner three wont fall John is the first game of the season Teams trying to find the rhythm offensively Re steps into a three way off the ball 0 for their last six from the field cheering An offensive rebound extends the possession Celas got four seconds Ball didnt hit the rim Hes got to go up Falling away cheering And the rebound controlled by the Hogs Like you said open for their last seven Reeves did a nice job defensively on that possession holding his ground against CEO Come on boy Mond pump fakes a three Gets a look around the rim and out Neither team having much success on the floor Ume is now one for eight from three Two of 14 in the game And Chapfields three wont fall You know John its its how you finish not how you start Both these teams perhaps a little opening night jitters here when it comes to shooting screaming Joe Hawks playing east to west Uh they really need to get north to south on the attack Cila and good hands by Reeves Fed ahead to Moila Liftoff A TWO HAND SLAM from Cila And thats Georgia Techs first points in nearly nine minutes Cila went blastoff from the ACC uh paint right there He was well out when he took off You see his length his size athleticism Highlight film stuff right there Yeah he doesnt move like HES 610 WATCH THE HAND Kick it Landro tries a three He swishes it Its a game of runs The Hawks have been able to answer They took the first blow from the Jackets and since then theyve really settled down Breeze a corner three that drives things heating up a little bit Its bound to happen Shake off the jitters Two threes in a row I wasnt sure wed see that two consecutive possessions tonight Quy played just six games last year but he shot close to 40 from three two years ago We talk a lot about Cam Craft and his shooting stroke but Kuwaits got some as well as the Cs part AND CIA SWATS it away Staples rejected Transition three from Chatfield Its true And here come the Yellow Jackets Great defense getting the momentum going Sealer with the block shot Thats two consecutive threes now And you saw Damon Starter on the sideline He was saying Push it Push it He wants the tempo He knows the athleticism the energy is in the building They just got to get it going Georgia Tech now with more points over the last minute and a half than they had in the first 10 plus cheering Okandra up against Cila Threepointer for Staples Too strong An offensive rebound cheering Landro got craft in the air and he makes him pay Kandras demonstrated the ability to go inside out Hes shown physicality on the defensive side of the ball Great skill high IQ and he knocks down the triple on that one Going inside out from down under for the Aussie Its a shot fake sideep impressive and sila Pass disrupted by Landro Both teams perhaps starting to find a little bit of their shooting stroke Georgia Tech with CELA on the defensive end protecting the rim A lot of signs for the Yellow Jackets in 2025 cheering Everything Opening night here at McCus Pavilion in Midtown Atlanta And for head coach Damon Statamire it is year three A look back at year one 7 and 13 in the ACC with three wins over top 25 teams Then last year 500 in ACC play John A postseason appearance in the NIT And look hes made it no secret he feels like this years team is capable of making the NCAA tournament Yeah And big wins uh last year against Louisville and Clemson who were both ranked two at the time So the ability to knock off the higher ranked ACC teams Coach Dama has demonstrated Inbounds coming from Mustaf Yeah it was quite the finish for Georgia Tech last year They were sitting three and seven in the ACC nine and 12 overall as the calendar flipped to February but they finished the year going seven and three in their final 10 regular season ACC games and got a buy to the ACC tournament with an eighth place finish Heres the other thing too John You look at the preseason projections Georgia Tech picked to finish 13th out of 18 but you got to take that with a grain of salt because the Yellow Jackets have outperformed the preseason poll eight of the last nine seasons One thing Yellow Jackets did well last season is they won at home They took care of home 82 in ACC play on this home floor on Kremans court 145 overall Thats so important as youre trying to get to March Madness and get a bid is to take care of your home court especially in league play And theyve done a pretty good job of that in conference play the last couple of years Whats been the challenges in these early season home games is Remagan has his three well short freshman from Cologne Germany And heres what were talking about the last two years So under coach Damon Statter the Yellow Jackets are seven and five this month 11 of those 12 games have been at home But the rest of the ACC playing nearly a 700 winning percentage Thats something theyve got to improve upon this year if they want to keep that tournament as a goal Yeah thats the challenge in coaching You know theres with the NIL with the transfer portal youre really trying to mold a roster that may be 75 80 new each year and thats a huge challenge Good contest from Aai Fleming Lets see if the Yellow Jackets push tempo into the half court now Fleming lets it loose Way too strong John youre right It seems like Georgia Techs best offense has been when theyre running up the floor And like you said with this match up particularly with some bigs in foul trouble could be challenging Good look down low but Oama cant finish it And the Yellow Jackets are going to call timeout here 29 total points scored in this one Uh what youd see expect in an opening night game Jitters turnovers missed shots Well be back in ACC action at Kman Sport Do you have a hometown hero you would like to recognize during the Georgia Tech event Go to hometown to nominate yours tonight Stick up 5 I got you Yeah heat Stop Go Well weve joked a little bit about How tonight hasnt been an elite shooting performance from either side Well theres an elite shooter in the house Anthony Morrow alltime leader in free throw shooting and third all time at Georgia Tech and threepoint field goals made And John he continued that in the NBA shot 42 in the league In fact there was a time where it looked like he might set the alltime threepoint percentage record in the NBA about five six years in his career So phenomenal shooter Great to see Amo back Got bad news John He turned 40 last month I dont mean to out How is he 40 man Yeah And again I I said that for all of us Not Not for AO Thats bad news for all of us I love watching Able play there in the mid 2000s And Marshall cleans it up His first points as a Yellow Jacket Thats a high percentage shot right there Doesnt get much higher than that Thats how I used to play here Maybe you were just savvy You laughter werent taking the shots unless they were high percentage I was setting screens and diving on the floor I had to do something to stay out there Craft with the steel Craft weaving down the right side trying to push pace Marshall a long way from the basket trying to direct somebody to cut Hell put it on the floor AND NOW HE FEEDS FLEMING DUNKS and hes got his first two points as a college player Marshall nice job finding Fleming His ability to move without the basketball Catch and finish The vert on display right there The two hand splash And thats a good sign for a guy who ended his season last year in December Had to get knee surgery Hes been rehabbing since then And look for any freshman youre going to have some jitters for a guy who hasnt played in a competitive game in nearly a calendar year You know hes excited and happy to get that monkey off his back getting those first two points Another three wont fall for they are now three for 13 I I think uh you know when Dongo gets back uh with him and Caw the ability to move without the basketball a guy like Craft right there known for his threepoint shot midrange on display there But if youre playing around those two guys as a perimeter player basket cuts sliding the line finding the open spot theyre going to command double teams and youre going to be able to find yourself in scoring advantageous scoring positions whether its a poor close out or youre cutting off the ball when your man goes to double I think that can be a strength for Georgia Tech this year in that perimeter And on top of that it probably is mutually beneficial for Cila and Dongo themselves trying to find space down low in the front court That really is the key for this Georgia Tech team You look at their strength You mentioned perhaps the best front court in the ACC Damon Statamire thinks its one of the best in the country Little too zealous there from Justin Mond and he picks up his second foul Georgia Tech is in the bonus now Ca and Dongo two guys that you know theyre rim threats with the lob So you know sprinting into ball screens roll replace action high low uh on the dribble drives just throw it to the rim let those guys catch it Uh thats going to be a strength this year Mustaf at the free throw line He was uh the best on the team last year at getting to the stripe He has a knack for getting fouled cheering Misses the front end of that one and one though Georgia Tech they did struggle from the free throw line last year lowest percentage in the ACC at 69 And a foul here on Reeves Techni Reeves his second 19 foul Georgia Tech in the last two minutes on a 6 run Three of their last three from the field And what theyve done Wy is they picked up it on the defensive side of the basketball Uh now a stoppage in play The Hawks will have a chance to cut into this deficit Looking for their first points in five minutes Cant hit the free throw Reeves turns it over to Must from Buoie Maryland cheering Cuts right and coming over to help Trey Hall Fouls going to be on Oanley Get a good look at it The left to right cross there You see the strength the size And Mustaf at 64 and a half 65 playing the point guard position He is explosive And if he gets a smaller guard on him you saw it right there Hes going to put that hip on the guard draw the contact and has the ability to finish The next step of that is hes got to be able to throw that lob because hes going to command the help You think hes the best slasher on this Georgia Tech roster You know from what Ive seen hes the best returner obviously Uh hes very good with the basketball Uh very comfortable as well Um theres a reason why theyre looking at him as the primary ball handler in a team that is a point guard by committee Misses both free throws You can see Georgia Tech really struggling at the free throw line tonight I mean playing point guard at the ACC its such a mental game I mean youve got to have skill obviously but the ability to think the game And I I think Coach Dtomire feels like hes the most confident guy on the floor with the basketball in his hands and thats why hes playing kick off the window for Justin Mond And we havent seen Lamar Washington tonight the transfer from Pacific who is probably the most experienced point guard on this Georgia Tech roster He is unavailable tonight like Dongo but at some point he will contribute this year and be a big piece of the point guard puzzle Final 30 seconds here Hawks want to run down low Flipping hooked Yes And the lead is down to three as we approach halftime cheering End of the clock here Rusts got to go Midrange jumper wont go And after 20 minutes the Maryland Eastern Shore Hawks have kept it close And theyll go into the locker room trailing Georgia Tech by just three Five points at the free throw line One of six from the foul line for Georgia Tech in the first half Uh if Im the Jackets Im throwing the ball to Cila and playing through him If not put the ball in Mustafs hands Let those two guys handle it and make plays Kesi Reeves looks towards Cila And looks like we got a reachin foul coming here Yes thats going to be against Mo Vassel two A nice concerted effort to throw the ball inside to Cila on the first possession of the second half Tighter Kelly looking for Craft Not there Floats it to Cila Thats really how the first half began for Georgia Tech They were feeding Cila down low Its Kelly knifes in corner three Reeves No Offensive rebound Sila goes down hard but its won by Jayen Cooper and the Hawks Teal racing around the corner For Maryland Eastern Shore John we talked about how many threepointers theyve taken You think that could be a winning formula for them with 5 seconds here on the clock Were going to find out reverse lay and what a move from Zion Oanla Senior out of Houston Texas His first year at MES Hes cut it to one Took the shot clock right down to one and finished on the other side of the rim Using the rim to protect themselves Beautiful beautiful attack to the basket Kelly jab step three Two strong rebound to Aanla And now Maryland Eastern Shore with a chance to take the lead Circle into the hands of Michael Teal Preseason allconerence guard He had to score tonight trying to feed down low to Oanla And itll be Georgia Tech basketball contending It went off Reeves One more look at this take from Oanla Yeah shot clock winding down Beautiful spin and then he knows Cila there the shot blocker He has the uh the knowhow just to get under the basket Use the rim for protection so he doesnt get blocked Ball screen from Cila They got a whistle and a foul Its going to be on Oan Its his third You know Zion on that last possession if he shoots on the left side of the basket hes probably eating that one or its going out of bounds Sila with the wingspan out here It was just a perfect finish Coach Hill described him as ridiculously athletic Played the last couple of seasons at Division 2 Claflin University in South Carolina Krab zips it into Reeves Pump fake drive No look feed down to Sila Cant handle it Another turnover for Georgia Tech That is now eight tonight cheering Cooper warded off They go down low to Vassel He goes up for THE LEAD HES GOT IT HAWKS IN FRONT cheering applause Yellow Jack is looking for an answer here cheering And Zea walked with it Another turnover for Georgia Tech Youll see the freshman Chadfield local product out of Pace Academy here in Atlanta checking in at point guard position Bound to Staples and Beck with some trouble Got to get across the floor on and does it with a couple seconds to spare A threepointer No And CEO rising up for the rebound He wants to get out and run to Craft transition three and ITS A BLOCKING FOUL on Mond That is a huge call Cila entered the half with two fouls uh you know had the ability to avoid the offensive charging right there It was close though Justin Mond You can hear him getting called from the Maryland Eastern Shore bench What is it that is doing to disrupt Georgia Techs offense Just solid I I like their communication now The bench is very active over here You can hear them communicating Uh you know great defensive team especially on mantoman action Youve got to talk youve got to communicate Theyve been quick to the ball uh and help side as well Right there the ability to close the gap and block the shot and they might get an easy one BASSEL WITH THE BLOCK Breeze contends at the rim cheering No review coming on the goending so far Chadfield his three wont go And a quick empty possession for the Yellow Jackets Come on Tech has yet to score here in the second half Read it Zip down low cheering Count the basket and the foul Dorian Staples How about that for his first points of the night Carried two shooters in the corner Its just threeman basketball screen roll replace and a great job Good spacing movement under the rim and Chadfield gets the foul on the way up So Melanie and Shaw playing to a threepoint lead a chance to make it a two possession game And theyre doing it John despite shooting 30 from the floor and 21 from three Of course the Yellow Jackets they too have struggled shooting just over 30 below 20 from three But its really the turnovers right now that the difference I think you talked about communication but effort is another thing I what I like about the Hawks team defensively their effort is there Theyre not dying on a play They never quit You saw the block shot on that possession Those little things add up over time If you can be consistent with your effort and your communication youre usually going to be a decent defensive team One of the big challenges for any team coming from a low major conference trying to take down a high major is believing you can win I think Maryland Eastern Shore has cleared that hurdle no problem with 16 minutes to play a fourpoint lead here on the floor at Georgia Tech Yeah theyre giving up some size and the the rebounding battles equal and its 2222 on the board So theyre theyre getting the job done there Chadfield its already got two fouls pressing up on Brown And a foul and its on Chadfield Thats his third The Yellow Jackets now trailing by four under 16 to play in the second half Maryland Eastern Shore Hawks are trying to spoil opening night here in Midtown Atlanta And it has been a collective effort The bench has teamed up for 18 points tonight for the Hawks Its been everybody John and its been a gritty tough effort Yeah been a collective effort Second half they three of five 60 from the field Georgia Tech 0 of five uh scoreless right now in the second half Wally And two of the things concerning about those five shots John One four of them have been from threepoint range Theyre not getting inside Moila hasnt taken a shot either as Chadfield dishes off to Fleming and the freshmans rejected at the rim And now the Hawks a chance to run the other way and Brown slows it down and around Fleming Dorian Staples lays it off the glass Its a sixpoint lead for the Hawks cheering Its a game of runs for Georgia Tech You got to weather the storm Again youre playing without uh you know Nate George led the ACC in assists last season He was your point guard Hes the guy you look to in this situation Bango is out Hes injured Hes your best returning player Uh you know second team all ACC preseason pick Hes not on the floor So for the Jackets right now whos going to step up I like the guy checking in number six Cila Hes the most talented player on the floor I think if youre the Yellow Jackets have the discipline throw the ball inside of him and play off of him good things will happen But you dont press the panic button Again its a two possession game Uh you just got to play hard and consistent and throw the ball to your best player Still a long way to go Yellow Jackets with two big men on the floor Mustaf carving in and a foul Its going to go against the Hawks and thats on Dorian Staples Now four foul five foul figure pardon on Maryland Eastern Shore Two quick ones on Staples You know Mustafs another guy You know you get him going downhill and playing downhill Put him in some ball screen action some dribble iso you know on a ball swing He can rip put some fouls on the defender But Georgia Techs got to get some rhythm Jackets in desperate need of a bucket They have not scored yet in the second half Marshon the high post down low to Cila and he misses the layin But thats what you want You know you had Chatfield with the steal and the missed layup on the uh on the they didnt get the finish there Right there Cila at the rim Those are two high percentage shots Great defensive efforts on both plays by the Hawks though Hawks trying to go to the hot hand and Staples working again This time on Reeves Back to Teal Threepointer for Brown Drills it And the lead is nine for the Hawks here in Atlanta And now they smell blood The bench is in it Uh that was a great inside out three A very uh patient offensive attack and it paid off Breeze cant get it to go Cila sticks it back in and finally Georgia Tech has broken the seal in the second half Second chance points from Cila Maryland Eastern Shore 6 and 25 last year Looking for what would be a historic win if they pull it off tonight But a long way to go and off of CEO And a quick look at our last two buckets First the three from ground The bench erupts You got to love the energy on the Hawks bench Theyve been in it the entire game And theres Sila right there You have your red shirt senior take inside uh inside out three which was a good shot Kasi Reeves went in and out And then Cila there to pick up the scraps Cila now nine points nine rebounds in his collegiate debut Six seconds to shoot Flipping in the corner Hes going to have to go up with it against Cila Double team comes He heaves it up And thats going to be applause our official Italo signaled foul for a moment but first it was a shot clock violation That was close Yeah Pton Marshall came with the double late in the clock Hes got to be careful though Hes a guy that 6 6 10 611 He was reaching down big fella Just put your hands up man I mean youve got Sila and Peyton Just throw your hands up vertical again It looked like it was with fire if youre reaching at it No doubt Looked like it was going to be a foul if it wasnt for the shot clock violation So a break there for Georgia Tech and Payton Marshall Jack is going to try and cut into this lead here Kelly weaving down THE LEFT SIDE HE IS BLOCKED CHRIS FLIPPING SAYS Get that out of here Second effort plays right now for the Hawks off the basketball You got Teal right now heating up the point guard And there you have the effort flipping coming from the backside Crafts got to get it in Goes to Marshall Helps to have the sevenfooter on the floor He feeds Craft down low and Cam Craft transferred from Miami of Ohio Hes now got four High IQ read right there I mean he saw the opening back door One hard step change of pace change of direction and a beautiful pass by Marshall That was your boy Thompson on the floor for Teal directing traffic cheering And good hands from Kisi Reeves Interferes with Halls pass And now the Yellow Jackets force a turnover Trying to make this a onep possession game Craft too strong He had 97 threepointers last year for Miami of Ohio Cant hit that one A little out of control And a turnover right to Cila cheering Kelly surveying feeds Reeves who flushes it And its a onep possession game 6 run for the Yellow Jackets And now here comes the press cheering cheering Marshall the switch Space for Staples Three wont go but the rebounds to Flipping Cila didnt think it was going to touch the rim Second chance No And another rebound flipping And Marshall blocks his shot Hawks want a foul instead Were going to have a timeout but the Yellow Jack is trying to climb back in it Down by three now The steal and the finish on the other end from Kaci Reeves Look at a ball game here Georgia Tech trailing but John they found a little more rhythm those last couple of minutes and they did it by playing through their big Wow what a concept right You have the patience have the discipline Uh Georgia Tech 06 from beyond the ark Uh theyve taken some good threes in the second half 06 from beyond the arc in the second half but when theyre when good things are happening they played through Marshall at the high post Craft got the back door layup Cila always if hes open throw it in Hes going to pick up fouls Hes going to command the double team And I think if they can hit the glass theyre going to dominate the paint Thats where the win is at for the Jackets Have the discipline to get into the paint and play through your boots And that was David Statimires message and we spoke to him before the game He said two keys One guard without fouling Techs done a better job of that in the second half to punish the Hawks in the paint on both ends and so far starting to do that offensively here as of late So out of a timeout if youre going to beat the Hawks tonight youve got to match their intensity Youve got to play with effort on every play because they can smell a victory here on the road to start the season and theyre going to give it everything they got Theyre going to empty the tank Halfway down and out Coach Hill slams the table He thought that one was going to drop out of the timeout That would have been a big shot there from Staples Instead Georgia Tech has a chance to inch closer cheering Marshall zips it inside and a foul coming here on Dorian Staples Again good execution by the Jackets You see coming out of a dead ball situation The intent to throw it into Cila Great things happen You pick up a few more fouls you get in the bonus Thats where your points accumulate And mind you you put the Hawks in foul trouble Its so Staples with his three fouls now all in the second half goes to the bench and Sila turns it over Its going to be a backcourt violation if Reeves went after it and Kiy Reeves a veteran giving the freshman a little encouragement Coach Coach Stom needed a drink of water on that one Hes like Man we get it to you and then you throw it in the back court I mean what can you do Thats not Theres nothing to do with coaching there Thats just uh you know it is what it is Coach Dtomire shaking it off Let me sit down and have a glass of water Hes already back up coaching Im pretty confident hes going to sit down after this game regardless of what happens and have a drink of something else Got to get it up Minan got it AWAY AND HE HIT IT Second time at the end of the shot clock the Hawks have come up with a big shot cheering and applause Snaps a 6 run for Georgia Tech which on a night which both teams are struggling to score feels big looking to see Landro guarding him They get it to him Flipping over to help into the corner Reeves a three No wont fall Georgia Tech two of 16 now from threepoint land An over in the second half But your corner three wide open Feet were set Thats the highest percentage three in the game And youve got a red shirt senior shooting it whos already made one Good shot And Sila makes the right play there Quality possession Landro to answer Thats so he has been redhot from beyond the arc Now three of three cheering Hes got a game high 11 points and the lead has swollen to eight Short corner jumper Payton Marshall hits it And a timeout after the make here Georgia Tech trailing by six trying to dig deep here and avoid what would be a big upset on their home floor on opening night The Hawks meanwhile you said it John they can smell it Well forget about trying to find belief Theres confidence right now in that Hawks huddle as they look for a historic win Maryland Eastern Shore has never defeated a team currently in the ACC Theyre definitely feeling it tonight And uh the effort weve talked about it all night Theyve sustained 100 effort on both sides of the floor And theyve been able to stay in this and take the lead even though only shooting five of 19 from beyond the arc 13 of 39 from the field But theyre winning the battle of the backboard Theyre winning the effort plays and a turnover out of the timeout CRAFT A THREE NEEDED GOT IT Cam Craft last season at Miami of Ohio shot 43 from three and he hit 97 of them Last time a Yellow Jacket hit that many was 10 years ago It was Adam Smith Its a big shot Georgia Tech looking for a stop Its Landro Hawks have been good at these end of the clock situations Not that time though a turnover in Georgia Tech basketball And I like what coach starter is doing here Hes playing as veterans Uh guys that have been there before Dont see freshman on the floor right now Again hes a guy you know started his college ball at Xavier transferred to Miami Ohio Chaz Kelly had 30 games played 14 starts at Boston College Marshalls been in big games at Missouri Youre playing your veteran presence And then Mustaf obviously had tons of minutes last season And he picks up a foul there Long way from the basket Its the first foul on Rust though Oklahoma Dorian Staples coming back in with his three fouls as Chris Flippen takes a seat Staples was playing at Division 2 Miles College last year where he mostly came off the bench Hes been a big player tonight Five in black Landro goes up What touch Tough shot right there Landro gathers at Concordia University Irvine last year Appeared in 17 games 10 points Uh you know before that he was at St Leo University Mustaf answers at the rim playing downhill I love that Thats his game going right Big shot that closes the gap Struting right through the lane What stood out I was looking at um bio He played in the Barton Community College which is in the Kansas JHawk Community College league Thats the best league for Jos in the country And he was a second team allconerence player Doing the research for the game that stood out to me because youve got to be really good player really talented to make all conference in the Kansas JL Community College League Air ball shot might have been contested but it lands right on Oana as he roars for an and one A lot of John Babels in that uh community college power just you know the hustle play right there right there second effort knack for the ball nose for the basketball the Hawks with a fivepoint lead Georgia Tech trying to get something going Well be back at McCamish Reme Courts heating music up Hey hey hey Joseph Loandro from Melbourne Australia And when Cleo Hill head coach for found him he said Finally I got an Aussie He played it professionally in Australia Did music coach Cleo Hill Jr And boy Joseph Landro hes looking like a stud so far tonight Its perfect Five of five from the field three of music three from beyond the arc Throw in three boards I mean this guy has been the key player on both sides of the basketball for the Hawks tonight Hes anchored the interior and defense Although was given up a couple inches his tough toughness has shined through and then what can you say Perfect from the field cheering Trying to complete the and one Zion Oanla and he cant hit it and the ball secured by Cam Craft Good effort by both Marshall and Cila And now the Yellow Jackets trying to respond MARSHALL THE QUICK PASS CILA CUTTING OH WHAT A PLAY That was designed too Coach Stomire called it You saw Cila He was buried in the opposite corner As soon as the roll action occurred Cila basket cut Love that play right there Not a lot of guys at 610 are that quick No hes unbelievable man He moves like a guard highest ranked recruit according to ESPN for Georgia Texans Derek Favors 15 years ago cheering making his debut tonight Moila Mustaf at the controls thinking about a three HELL PULL THE TRIGGER OH it wont fall And Landra with the board Just over six minutes to play Maryland Eastern Shore looking for perhaps their biggest win in school history Sea has got 11 points Hes the only Yellow Jacket in double figures in the game And Landro has 13 leads all scorers So two players on the floor and in the game are shooting in double figures for points scored And a poor pass on the inbounds right to Cam Craft STAY UP STAY UP cheering Into Mustafs hands Yep Throw it in Arcs it high and over the head of Mo Cila Sloppy turnover Perhaps a little miscommunication if you thought CEA was going to go further south Yeah thats just you know cant be casual Under six minutes to go Trailing Um but you got to get get to the next play GET OUT GET OUT Hawks have a chance to capitalize on the turnover All the way down goes Trey Brown Leaves it short Battle for the board Marshalls got it Mustaf pressing Reeves to THE HOOP AND HES STUFFED BY FLIPPING And its Georgia Tech basketball Chris theres no flipping way this is going in He gets there Big contest above the rim Highlevel block shot Got a little arm there Got away with it Wy got away with a little uh foul on the hand going up but officials reward effort in that situation Must crosscourt Marshall facing up Its going to work on flipping GOES UP LOOKING FOR CONTACT AND HE GOT IT CHRIS Flipping cheering in disbelief Coach Cleo Hill Jr can only scowl the other way And Georgia Tech will take its first free throws of the second half here Lets see if he brings the arms down You got verticality right there The right hand comes down If Flipping has the ability right there to just stay vertical he avoids that foul Thats a big make for a guy who went five for 19 from the free throw line last year at Missouri And Payton Marshall just a great story Hes weighing in just shy of 300 Back in high school he was at 400 lb Hes lost over 30 pounds here at Georgia Tech in just the last few months and he hits both free throws That does not look like a guy who shot 25 the free throw line last year Big free throws I was at practice uh two days ago and they they start a lot of their actions their drill work from the free throw line shooting free throws with everyone lined up I like that what coach Dami and the staff are doing It teaches you you know to shoot in situations that youre going to see in a game This is the loudest McCamish has been all night They force another turnover as we approach the fiveminute mark John how significant psychologically is it for Georgia Tech to retake the lead both for the Yellow Jackets and the Hawks Well I think for Georgia Tech you have a crew of five out here minus CILA whos your most talented These guys have played in big games before and its about poise When youre under five minutes take care of the basketball get high percentage shots and then defensively you want one and done Contest the shot and rebound MUSTAF STEPS INTO A THREE AND GIVES GEORGIA Tech the lead And theyre picking up full You just got to be mindful of not fouling and you dont want to give away any three points Just play solid A 70 run for Georgia Tech Can the Hawks answer Staples on Marshall Here comes Cooper Crossover jumper air ball tech ball Great defensive effort by the Jackets And how about this shot from Jaden Mustaf cheering The ability to make one extra dribble to draw the defense and the the court vision to find the shooter I mean just an it was one dribble sucks in the D crisp pass Coach Style in that practice also got on his players about sending crisp passes on the reverses Thats the exact pass he was teaching in practice the other day So dont be lazy Put something on it And that was perfect execution by Craft Ca meanwhile an offensive foul Said a lot of good things tonight but he has turned the ball over five times for Tech And going back to Mustafs three this might be a little personal for him tonight his older sister Ashley played for Maryland Eastern Shore on the womens team Yeah you cant go home for Thanksgiving and you know have a have a loss Youre going to lose that family battle right there This is pride This is family pride right here Look at Mustaf digging in Tech leads by two under four to play Bond rises up and he hits Tie game Big shot Hard dribble right shoots over the extended arm of Mustaf That was big time Stop on a dime Let it fly Who the Yellow Jackets go to in crunch time As youve said theyve got veterans on the floor Marshall with some daylight HEADS TO THE HOLE HE CANT FINISH but he will go to the line Another foul coming on Chris Flipping And thatll bring us to a timeout Maryland Eastern Shore looking for their first ever win over an ACC opponent Georgia Tech trying to survive opening night season Georgia Techs got more than they bargained for from Maryland Eastern Shore They have outscored the Yellow Jackets in the second half but the turnovers John 10 of them for the Hawks thats cost them It has And Georgia music Tech has scored 10 points off of those turnovers just in the second half alone Thats been the difference Thats music thats allowed Georgia Tech to creep back into this one when they fell behind Uh so look for more you know extended defensive effort from the Jackets Uh and you got to do it without fouling Foul with the Hawks Plus six uh on the backboard Plus six advantage on rebounds in the second half Second half alone And you know the Hawks have also shot 50 from the field in the second half So its really just been a story of you know the turnovers have hurt them but if if you would have told me going into this and its going to be a tie ball game with under four I think theyd be happy with where theyre at The Hawks and Georgia Tech is now just three of nine from the free throw line Moila a double double in his yellow jacket debut The question is will he get a W here tonight trying to give Georgia Tech the lead back Said seven lead changes tonight Missed them both Offensive rebound by Jaden Mustaf A little help from Kesi Reeves Huge board Detect three of nine from the free throw stripe tonight Where will Mustaf go Down the lane and a blocking foul Thatll put Mustaf at the line charge number zero His first another example of Mustaf going right Hes so good going right and picks up the foul on that play Number zero Cooper was stepping in just a little bit little bit late on the action He tried to get the charge was a little bit late getting there Nice effort though Big free throws Wy Mustaf shot 71 last year at the line 0 for three tonight Thats big cheering and applause We discussed it earlier but Georgia Tech one of their points of emphasis this season was getting off to a better start in the season Theyve lost four home games in November the last two seasons Thats the most losses by any ACC team at home in the seasons first month And theyre in a battle here Two big makes from Mustaf at the free throw line Staples receives the inbound Hes playing with four fouls Paul flips it to Mondon Gets around Cila Jacks a three and Ca with the rebound applause and cheering Jackets looking for some cushion STAY TREY STAY UP TREY STAY UP TREY GET OVER TREY Reeves into a three OH AROUND the rim and out It wont fall He got a good look He stepped into it shoulder square Just didnt drop Did everything but drop Yeah his shot just around the rim and out Fallen tonight Hes one of eight from three A guy who shot over close to 40 two years ago Yeah just a little bit flat but it it looks good Um you know a guy like him a senior how many reps hes put in not falling tonight Reaps but hes got to keep shooting that on this team He needs to make that shot All right 8 seconds to shoot Conversation here Oh theyre going to say reset the shot clock Put it at 20 seconds London with the inbounds Theyll go to Staples DOWN LOW NOBODYS HOME HE MISSED IT cheering And Marshall with the rebound Perfect execution Double back screen Got the wideopen layup Could not finish So the lead for Georgia Tech is still intact Mustaf floater No Offensive stick back from Marshall Wont go either Down to the wire Here we go on opening night Maryland Eastern Shore wants a timeout as theyve got perhaps the biggest win in program history in their sights Yellow Jackets clinging to a twopoint lead Dont go anywhere Well it wont be the last time Maryland Eastern Shore has a chance to take down a power conference opponent this season Plenty of big names on the schedule but John this very well could be their best chance of the season Theyve got the basketball down by two And if youre coach Cleo Hill Jr where you go here on this possession I think continue to you know space the floor and go in the paint attack the basket And if youre going to shoot a three its inside out London trying to get inside Down to Staples Bodied up by Reeves Inside out three THREEPOINT TRY BECK WITH GOT IT AND MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE TAKES THE LEAD WHAT A HUGE SHOT FOR A FRESHMAN PLAYING IN HIS first college game cheering in timeout Georgia Tech Levi Beck with Mercy 117 to go Yellow Jackets have one timeout remaining The Hawks have two And that was a huge shot Lets get a look at it The inside out three high release Bottoms Big shot right there And if that wasnt cool by itself his older brother who Im sure won a lot of oneon ons in the backyard I should say in the driveway hes on staff at Maryland Eastern Shore He just did that in front of his big brother John you know that feels good Oh its got to feel good Family effort right

we go out of the timeout for Georgia Tech Where do they go Reeves inbounding from the sideline Corner Reeves three ball NO IT WONT FALL AND TWO JACKETS GOING FOR THE REBOUND EVANDRA WHO WINS IT BUT HIS FOOT WAS ON THE BASELINE Its yellow jacket basketball with a fresh clock cheering Reeves got to keep his head up I mean that was a skip pass designed play He wanted the senior the red shirt senior shooting the ball with his feet set Another one went in and out Just Reeves just cant get it to drop tonight Theres your BEST SHOOTER CRAFT NO IT WONT GO A RACE FOR THE BALL MOND wins it Maryland Eastern Shore threeon one Staples is fouled Under a minute to play and is going to the free throw line with a onepoint lead Marshall nice job contesting the shot here Hes looking to time it Swatting down on the ball Thats going to get you the foul right there cheering Just got to stay vertical Big free throws right here cheering for Staples Hes one of one from the line tonight Misses the first one This is his sixth year in college basketball John and his first ever division one game Maryland is sure looking for their first ever win against an ACC opponent He missed them both CEO with the rebound Georgia Tech has one timeout remaining applause Mustaf into the corner Looking for Cila trying to get open on Staples Reeves driving in HANGS AND HITS KESI REEVES THREEPOINT SHOT HASNT been falling Instead he slashes inside and gives the Yellow Jackets the lead with 40 seconds left Marian Shore wants a timeout and they got it 35 seconds left John Onepoint game Opening night If there was any doubt college basketball was back it sure is And Boisey Reeves huge moment A great one to call tonight on opening night Big shot right there by Reeves in traffic And again the threes werent going Hes in and out in and out And he drives I love that hes staying aggressive Hes not hiding in the moment Hes stepping up Hes been here before Happy to be back on the court after a red shirt last season with the injury Inside the Maryland Eastern Shore huddle You mentioned it out of there last time out John trying to get inside attack the paint and if need be go back out You think thats the same philosophy here Well its worked all night I mean spread the floor keep good spacing have patience uh and if youre going to shoot an outside shot try to draw the double get the inside out three like uh Beckith hit on the last possession But uh theyve been very good offensively just music uh you know getting their stuff and theyd miss some at the rim too I wish they probably wish they had back For Georgia Tech its about communication talk jumping to the basketball uh not fouling and then secure the miss shot with a rebound Five guys needs to box out Timeout situation Georgia Tech with one remaining The Hawks also with one timeout remaining 10sec differential between the game clock and the shot clock ball game Georgia Tech with six fouls So the next one would put Maryland Eastern Shore at the line for the Yellow Jackets Its four veterans along with Moila Meanwhile for Maryland Eastern Shore Chris Flipping cheering and applause along with Landro their two leading scorers Mond as well with eight points And itll be Jaden Cooper Brad transfer from Columbia to inbound Can the Hawks pull off what would be the biggest win in school history Where do they go here Cila on Landro 15 seconds to shoot And loose ball will stay with Maryland Eastern Shore 12 seconds to play or rather to shoot 23 seconds left to play in a tricky place to inbound the ball too right here Not a lot of plays designed Inbounding deep on the sideline And coach Cleo Hill Juniors going to call his final timeout You know we spoke with him before this game You know he mentioned how our goal is just to keep it close See if we can hang around Theyve done just that John And hes won a lot of places but hes never had a win fight like this Youre right about that And you know hes coached for 20 years as a head coach Uh hes got his stuff I know he knows what play he wants to call right now but its not so much what the coach knows Its about execution And inbounding the ball in this situation is so difficult Youre below the hash Youre deep on the sideline You have no timeouts Situational practices How many have you had this season Probably not many where youre practicing this exact situation So your quarterback the guy whos inbounding is so important in this position because its its a tough play to make Need to set good screens have good space but uh you know dont underestimate how hard of a pass this is especially if Georgia Tech guards the basketball Its going to be the freshman Levi Beck with to inbound He just hit a huge three that briefly gave the Hawks the lead Kesi Reeves on the ball They might clear Gets it into Landro Double back screen action Nope 5 seconds to shoot MOND LET IT GO HE GOT IT THE HAWKS HAVE THE LEAD WITH 11 SECONDS REMAINING MUST ACROSS THE TIMELINE TIMEOUT GEORGIA TECH AND JUSTIN Mond who WAS AT GEORGIA SOUTHWESTERN State last year just hit a dagger shot to give Maryland Eastern Shore the lead with less than 10 seconds left Mond 10 points three boards one assist three times on a broken play action stops on a dime elevates nothing but net Hes made three of those tonight Late clock dagger Yellow Jackets with that timeout now they have no timeouts remaining So with 88 seconds on the clock youre talking about hey we want to get something going to the rim You know if we if we can draw the foul well get to the free throw line make our free throws lets go home with a dub But you want to give yourself a chance to to get that foul 9 seconds away from an unprecedented win for Maryland Eastern Shore They have been so good in late shot clock situations John tonight Thats going to be the difference in the game if they hang on to win Meanwhile for Georgia Tech as you said gets driving to the basket If you do draw the foul you will get two free throws Can you throw it to CIA inside Yes But you know if he gets fouled hes one of four from the line And you have a decision to make there I think you put the ball in Mustafs hands get him going downhill and spot up Reeves and Craft If the double comes kick it to two good shooters two upper classman that can make the shot And then if youre Georgia Tech crash the glass Might be one of those situations where you get the miss and the putback for the Hawks vice versa Youve got to box out secure the rebound What a game Wy Here we go Craft to inbound Mustaf Reeves Cila and Marshall on the floor Its to Mustaf down THE LANE FEEDS MARSHALL GOES UP MISSES 3 SECONDS LEFT AND A FOUL COMES WITH LESS THAN TWO SECONDS REMAINING And its the fifth and final foul on Dorian Staples And its going to be two free throws for Georgia Tech with less than two seconds left See where the foul is Did they get Staples Thats what they signaled I didnt see Staples in on the action right there And hes still on the floor right now Hes got five fouls But Im with you I did not see Staples reaching in Yeah Staples says Yeah hes saying I got five Somebodys got to get him So Payton Marshall so far tonight two for two at the free throw line but he was just five for 19 last year at the stripe cheering Georgia Tech trying to survive cheering tie game Hold that follow through big fella Got to love the confidence He stayed with it Good shooters hold it Thats what 3D Dennis Scott used to say Hold it I tell you what its tied up baby Big time shot right here Marshalls had a great debut 77 boards three assists and a chance to be a hero in his first game on the Flats for the lead Missed it AND WE ARE DESTINED for overtime on opening night Wow Why not Lets lets lets play some more ball Theyre going to miss Staples Staples number five fouled out there in the last 30 seconds He was a guy that you know he only scored five points but he was six boards four assists I mean he was all over the place Had some great size They will miss him And you made the point John at the time It didnt look like he was in on that play in the final two seconds Looked like it was somebody else but hes out of the game We play on Landro Fadeaway over Marshall too strong And this will stay with Maryland Eastern Shore Should get a fresh clock Georgia Tech unable to secure the missed shot right there 5050 balls will be crucial in overtime You know can you win the 5050 balls Can you make your free throws and youve got to limit turnovers I mean its a sum of the parts effort from both sides of the basketball Monds been clutched tonight Ball in his hand again 3 seconds to shoot Flipping goes up and its blocked 1 second left I did They reset the shot clock John They did And it was at 10 seconds and I Its a quick time Yeah I felt like it should have reset the 20 The 20 I dont think they re obviously that didnt touch the rim but I dont think they reset it after the last shot Catch and shoot No rebound CEO Craft double team Got to get rid of it 10 seconds to shoot now for the Jackets Marshall is fouled Thats the wrong read applause So Payton Marshall will go to the line again He hit that first free throw to force overtime Thats four on Mond now Yeah the combination of Marshall and Celock combined 21 rebounds between the two of them You got to wonder is it starting to wear on the Hawks You know those are two huge bodies banging on you all night So Chad Chaz Kelly comes in for Georgia Tech Meanwhile itll be Oban Oanla to head back to the bench as it was applause Trey Brown who came in under four minutes to play after Marshalls two free throws A twopoint lead for Georgia Tech Marshall playing with four fouls Mond for the Hawks playing with four fouls Landro gets around Cila and were tied up again His ability to you know know where Cila is put him on his back and then use the rim for protection You know a guy that plays you know hes not playing above the rim like Cila but hes so crafty Speaking of crafty it wont fall for Cam Craft A battle for the board and last touched by Trey Brown Georgia Tech basketball Good 20 on the shot clock 327 to play Mustaf checks back in Hey Hey Reeves trying to get it in He goes to Marshall and Sopie with the basketball The Yellow Jackets retain it Near turnover Jackets cut down on those in the second half in overtime so far 5 seconds to

shoot Good hands BY CILA HE DIVES AND LUNGES The clock is still ticking and with two seconds left its a jump ball and itll be Georgia Tech basketball cheering Thats the hustle playing the 5050 ball

feet cheering cheering and applause I think he took about all 250 lbs of London on him laughter on that Lucky to get up without an injury Great hustle on both sides tonight cheering Hawks will expend mantoman defense Mustaf casually up the floor and Mandum meets him at midcourt Must floats it short The tap in from Cila and its a fourpoint game cheering Love what coach Dami did right there Just keeps Cila and Mustaf in the action Your two best players going to win or lose with those two Cila comes way out Mond down to Brown who takes some hard contact Payton Marshall is going to pick up his fifth foul Marshall a big reason why the Jackets are still in this one in overtime with a chance to win But he picked up his fifth on that one There you see Mustaf going downhill to the right And Cila unaccounted for on the offensive glass Cila now 13 points 14 rebounds in his Georgia Tech debut Marshall with nine points of this one He was five of six from the free throw line including the big one that put Georgia Tech in overtime Had eight boards Hell go to the bench now with five And that you know if theres a takeaway for him a teachable moment is he had three fouls That swiping at the basketball that last one right there Can he slide his feet and take a charge You know like theres teachable moments in this one but a very good debut for the big fella Local product from Kell High School in Marietta Georgia Now they called this on the floor John so its one and one The junior Trey Brown at the line hits the first transfer from Salt Lake Community College Hes played 15 minutes in

effort from Jaden Mustaf Georgia Tech faithful feel like Mustaf had possession cleanly Coach Cleo Hill thought otherwise if theres a camera over near that bench He thought it was all armed So what do you think Wy You got a good look at it there I think both coaches have good points on on their notions It looked like Mustaf had the lion share of that ball and it also looked like Mustaf might have uh assisted uh getting him to the ground He made he made a nice read on the ball though Thats you force a lob going away from the basket and you know hes a competitor One minute to play inside Landro five to shoot on Mustaf fades away and nails it We are tied again 5252 50 seconds left to play under Ball screen Reeves a three ITS TWO REEVES Hes had a tough night from distance but that was the biggest one hes taken and he hit it Hes got 12 points four boards four assists and uh no bigger three than that one Hes two of 10 from beyond the arc but a lot of the miss has been in and out Great

preparing to come in applause Reeves doesnt want to go out but hes logged 42 minutes You know he he played six games last year the first six and then hurt the heel His first time back out logs 42 minutes and his bodys paying for it right now SA misses the free throw Keeps the door cracked open here Yeah for Maryland Eastern Shore And the Hawks do have a timeout but hard to get one called with just two seconds left They need a miss screaming Will Sila give it to him No A fourpoint lead A timeout called by Maryland Eastern Shore And Moila jawing at Joseph Landro And Maryland Eastern Shore looking a little maybe for a tech Its about the only way they get back in this game Ca not bad in his debut tonight 14 points 15 rebounds in 34 minutes of play And thats the big free throw You see the talk right there Back and forth Got to be smart What an incredible effort from Maryland Eastern Shore tonight to put the Yellow Jackets on the rope They had a lead with less than two seconds remaining in regulation Payton Marshall hits a big free throw to force overtime And going back to Kesi Reeves that shot John for a guy who hadnt played in a game in nearly a year by his standards having a poor shooting night That shows some pretty serious guts and option to take that shot You know I think you know Coach Stomire is a players coach you know theyve logged a lot of minutes together especially having a year off last year Im sure they were able to forge a relationship that you dont get when youre a player on the court When youre red shirting you know you get to spend more time with the coaches and I think right there you see Reeves in the second half Although he missed some he kept shooting He kept shooting and that shows me he music has confidence one in his game but he knows the coaches have his back and they want him to take those shots and uh he came through tonight You saw Kelly German Georgia Tech Basketballs firstear trainer replacing the great Richard Stewart who decided to hang it up Happy to have Kelly here in Kesi Reeves He wants to be on the floor for those last couple of seconds A look at the upcoming schedule for the Jackets Bryant on Friday night then a week from Friday at Georgia Thatll be a big one But I love what Damon Statmire said about Coaci Reeves before the start of the Saint saying hes hes kind of like my my comfort piece You know hes one of just two guys who has been with me the entire time at Georgia Tech And boy hes going to sleep well tonight thanks to Koi Reeves and that big shot Well sleep better This was a good one I mean a little closer than you wanted but remember by Dongo not on the floor tonight Hes you know hes your best returning player He averaged a double double in ACC play last year Thats a big void No contact Three at the buzzer And that is the ball game as Georgia Tech survives an opening night terror
