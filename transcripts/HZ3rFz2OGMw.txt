of for his Louisville Squad so Louisville in the black jerseys BC in the white jerseys Quinton post will jump against Brendan Huntley Hatfield and were often running at Connie form Jaden Zachary will bring the ball across the timeline as Louisville starts out manto man Devon mton the pass in the post to the big fella for the easy to oh when we were at Louisville shooter round uh this morning that was key number one how we match up against Quinton post that time they decide not to double excellent post passing that time by Boston College you see that Louisville lineup got a huge contribution from many in their win against Georgia Tech including that guy white who just hit the jumper the transfer Trey white from USC but another guy youll be looking at tonight is Caleb Glenn his energy off the glass yeah they must do a job Boston College keeping them off the glass but thats the area of Quinton post game that I think is underrated he is an excellent passer but hes a guy uh that draws so much attention that time beautiful back door cut by Zachary pinpoint passing by Bose that Bose was 63 assists 60 turnovers a three by Huntley Hatfield rims out the rebound to Jaden Zachary theres Mason Matson hes 11 for his last 22 from the field post backing in on Huntley Hatfield and the rebound for the big fellow who Kenny Payne the secondyear Louisville coach calls one of the best forwards in the ACC M Music improved fre is good as Mike James the heart and soul of his team Nails it hes 37 from three 31 for Music 82 can score too now and I think the thing is the post touch that time and again pinpoint passing by Quinton Post Louisville very aggressive in the passing lanes and thats two nice back door cuts that time a wheel cut by Zachary an emphasis on the high low game for the Eagles Louisville yielding 78 points per game white from the foul lines too strong but he tracks down the loose ball rebound heres James Tyler Johnson an impressive freshman Huntley Hatfield on the Baseline yeld off by post but James from three and he had an open look our beautiful offense that time split the screen and then James uh with the finish and then right here again a back door cut off a nice little wheel cut by Zachary what a block by Matson to frustrate Trey white thats good Hustle by The Eagles defense something thats been a little bit in short supply for them the last couple games yeah he caught it break that time almost got beat back door that time for a layup great recovery by Matson post out of padell Harris the transfer from Charleston Southern post aims for the three and hes got it what a start for the sevenfooter Quint BST he has that type of range hes 43 from three and thats all set up though by Jaden Zachary beautiful a pass back that time to post and early on though both these teams executing at a high level offensively a back and forth and that time nice high finish off the glass yeah Caleb Glenn has been really good the last seven games a developing project but playing like a junior now desite the fact hes a freshman mson from three Here Comes Tyler Johnson dropping dimes all over the floor recently and the putot back is good a Louisville ties it up after white put it up and In Trey white averaging 13 points thats third on the squad and Louisville does a great job attacking to offensive glass good pass again from the high post by Matson this time in mcglockton most of the bucket by Boston College have been assisted that time another back door cut all of them five assists five field goals Hunley atfield jocking for position too strong doubled Glen gobbles up the rebound he eats them for dinner and out of bounds a quick post feeling it in the early stages well nice action by Boston College in this the sevenfooter PO stepping out and hitting the three Boston College up two early BC with a twopoint lead Over Louisville and Louisville has been active on the offensive glass five offensive rebounds early thats a concern coming into this game for Earl Grant but then offensively Boston College has run some nice actions and theyve been active getting back door Cuts going against this aggressive Louisville defense Good Start offensively for both these teams earol Grant johning the bright blue jacket you think pull that off I tell you what its sharp and another thing I will say is sharp but the job that he has done uh with this Boston College team again I think the key word is progress we had a chance to speak with him uh prior to the game and he likes where his team is at in terms of the progress theyve made crosscourt Johnson to Trey white good ball Movement by the cards a double on Johnson almost a steal by mclock fighting for the 5050 ball and out of bounds off of Louisville BC basketball our officials are Roger SS Lee Cassell and Jamal Spearman theres Kenny Payne its been a process for him still trying to rebuild the Louisville program with just 12 wins after many stops in the Pro ranks and in colls with John caliper and Company but he always has a bright dis position I do and again I think there is some uh cause for optimism again the last four games they have been much better on both offense and defense but I think the biggest thing is theyre attacking on the paint both on the offensive glass and then off the bounce they did a good job of creating opportunities cross cour for white three by Johnson is good he gives the cards the lead Tyler Johnson shooting only 18 from three thats his ninth threepointer of the season season but nine points a game and I mentioned his assist total 86 assists just 55 turnover yeah and he also leaves them in steals as well too good counter punch by claudell Harris Harris a volume shooter BC needs him to be effective yeah I think hes the X Factor Great elevation on his pullup jumpers and thats a good sign if youre Erol Grant and Boston College claudell here is hitting an early jumper hes taken 144 threepointers 38 from three the three James the follow and out of bounds off of BC Tyler Johnson has put up impressive numbers in that game against Florida State February 3rd the only player in Louisville history to post 27 11 assists and six rebounds decorated history of basketball and Louisville tells you a lot about his game yeah and theyre again excited about him and you look at what hes done the last nine games again hes doing a little bit of everything we talked about his assist but I think his defense as well too again he leads them in steals very active with his Applause hands in the paint James musling in and drawing contact and N1 opportunity be Cassell calls the foul on Jaden Zachary its getting physical yeah these are two of The More Physical guards in the ACC battling that time James wins out and thats going to be a key matchup Jaden Zachary going up against Mike James again two of The More Physical better guards in the ACC you like Jaden Zacharys game why is that well I think he hes I think the heart and soul of the Boston College team similar to Mike James at the freeto lines those guys do a little bit of everything I think they set the tone both on offense and defense again thats going to be a key match up already our fifth lead change Zachary the crossover looking for Chaz Kelly sophomore from Houston and he is fouled good idea by Kelly to shoot that absolutely I think attacking again youre playing a Louisville team thats very aggressive to start this game off dont settle for jumpers see if you can drive the ball and either get an easy deuce or set your teammate up or do what Kellys done and get it to the free throw line first foul on Mike James with Kelly at the line BC is a team shoots 75 12 per game but we saw our Spotlight package to begin the game free throw shooting has waned for them in the last five heres Saturdays ACC Network mens basketball triple header number seven North Carolina host Virginia Tech at two Eastern then Miami against these same BC Eagles at Connie for and we C theight with Louisville and Pittsburgh always outstanding action on acc Network and the ESPN app Syracuse and North Carolina the orange moments ago 18 seconds left in the game leading by six the league is so deep and we showed the standings there is a loog jam in the middle they quality teams no easy outs uh in League Play thats for certain a block on Johnson trying to drive on the Baseline Eagles collapsing effectively in the post and that games a final Syracuse beat North Carolina 8679 number seven tar Hills go down at the Dome signature win for Adrien atrey in his first year Syracuse coach armont Mighty off the Eagles bench called for a double dribble by the veteran official Roger SS Mighty is a project for Earl Grant he really is but hes got something you cant teach which is a great size and length again he is going to be a guy speaking with his coaching staff theyre excited about this young man and has added a 20 plus pound since hes arrived very strong and and you saw in the previous play defensively uh providing some Rim protection for Boston College and the shot is good by Trey Applause white well he has got it going early white thats a nice little pullup jumper not bad defense thats just great elevation on that pullup jumper there has six of the Louisville 17 points Zachary got in trouble dribbled into traffic here comes Johnson number 23 and black is Alexander Payne for Louisville the son of Kenny Payne and the easy laying for Huntley Hatfield created by the penetration of Johnson yeah Johnson really he is a jet flying up the court thats all set up by him hes putting a lot of pressure on the defense with his speed Zachary for three weak side rebound by Huntley Music Hatfield Music Hunley Hatfield Big Boy move and that was effective largest lead of the game for the cards and Hatfield is absolutely right uh playing like a grown man down there again he is just barreling his way down and theyre doing a nice job setting him up where he can catch it almost one foot in the post Donald Han in the game for the Eagles to Prince Elite Bay back to hand hand has had a hand injury the last couple games o the three no good pay the rebound BC scoreless in the last three plus minutes and droughts have been an issue for this team throughout the year Johnson holds hes a confident guard I really like how he has started this game off again hes changed base and then right there show off of the soft touch but he has controlled the temple and Pace in this first half thus far and Johnson passing to Huntley hfield this is pretty well this right here again is showing off the midgrain that time the floater a Louisville up seven Love is in the air at Toyota abroad early though on in this game the issue has been rebounding and turnovers for Boston College the goal is to get out of that Tuesday first round of the tournament for both these Music squats Syracuses Big Win moves them up to the ninth spot at the moment obviously fluctuations will continue throughout the month wed expect post and hes got the two nice job using the glass thats what you want coming out of a timeout again uh Louisville had it going early on uh they got a nice little lead call a timeout get your best player back on the floor play through Quinton post but thats an excellent adjustment by Boston College out of the timeout how about the steal by Chaz Kelly athleticism for the sophomore oh claudell Harris coughs it up here comes Tyler Johnson the trailing three and a crash on the glass its an offensive rebound after the Miss by Curtis Williams but Quinton post isolated well if Louisvilles going to stay manto man and not double Im giving Quinton post a touch every time if Im Boston College again let him go to work if they double hes an excellent passer and have him passed out of the post and again hes right at the top of every Scouting Report anytime opponent goes up against Boston College and feasting at home against ACC opposition with 17 and8 a foul was on the cor for his Music first second team foul so Harris at the point for the eagles with a screen by post thought about the three low dribble and he had to track it down six to shoot Matson the runner quick out led by Huntley hfield to Johnson and hes got it man is he outstanding in transition he is so fast again they are looking for him transition defense was another concern for Earl Grant and and Boston College again thats what Louisville wants to do great transition off of their defense Quinton post has nine points seven below his SE season average at 16 points and eight rebounds per game he shoots 51 Im not going to say hes just the best one of the better players in the ACC one of the better bigs in the country Quinton po a foul on claudell Harris any great freshman in the league Johnson is one of them and out that by Huntley hfield was terrific and what I like about Johnson his body control again hes not just out there running fast without a purpose but hes changing directions changing pace and then hes got great body control when he gets into the paint and those are some tough finishes through traffic Cardinals have made five of their last six shots Johnson from 17 as Matson the Cincinnati transfer gobbles it up Aris streaking and hes got it off the glass tough shot oh thats again uh many may say thats ill advised when you got post down there with a guard on him but it went in degree of difficulty off the charts that time by Claude El Harris James through the double team Kelly in the front Court hell hold for Deon mton post from three yes sir Quint post to one man scoring spree for the Eagles as theyre down by one it was eight moments ago well this is why this guy will play at the next level a sevenfooter he can post you up but this is what makes him special he can step out on the threepoint line Boston College on a run now only trailing by Music one well theyre doing a nice job Boston College finding him theyre moving him around theyre posting him up down low on the Block theyre putting him in high ball screens and then hes able to step out on the perimeter he is a guy that can hurt you inside and outside thats why hes a very difficult matchup and hes got it going early on we take a look at some Valente Valentines Day Spar early here but you and I have known each other a long time we can spend Valentines Day together what do you think uh no chance Im sorry I like you man but I love my wife better I was going to say Im not sure your wife would like that either or my girlfriend for that matter but back in live action with Tyler Johnson back and forth the fair we expected this type of game Malcolm as both teams offenses are likely going to thrive Louisville loves to play wide open question is can FEC run with them and hang with them what that happens is the shot is good by Trey Weiss he maneuvered and somehow got around Mason Matson who picked up the foul that the matchup problem right there again he is uh really been physical and one right there through contact and well just like on the other end I think the question becomes do you double post and then with this matchup right here with Trey white as uh Roger SS is going to talk to him felt like there was some extracurricular words being said afterwards veteran crew knock it off lets play ball but uh make no mistake about it white really uh he has gone at him as we take a look at a Music turnover now a pause in the action as official Jamal Spearman blew the whistle they had to sub in after the free throw and they forgot so Louis will with possession white has nine points and they switched up and now they a change who was guarding James the three a league Bay the rebound and they put a league Bay on White for more size and strength to keep white out of the paint with his post UPS rebounding Edge for the Cardinals 12 to7 Harris trying to back in what a pass to mton superb by claudell Harris and Harris that time with the size advantage over Johnson backed him down drew a double then beautiful pass to mclen and sloppy by Tyler Johnson but the no look by Harris right here again patience and spacing by Boston College spin move and thats a beautiful pass by Harris to mlon for the easy deuce eagles with seven assists on 11 field goals theyre shooting 65 well above their season average of 46 Harris driving and hes got it B Harris playing with momentum and thats how you beat a team thats aggressive into passing Lanes Boston College has done that multiple times uh in this first Applause half and a travel against the Cardinals so its off the hinges for them as BC has scored five buckets in their last five attempts and right here again look at the back door pass timing is great and then thats a nice pass by Chaz Kelly game has already been tied five times no gr told us that he thinks Kellys a stabilizer do you believe yeah hes been giving him solid minutes at the point guard position it allows again Zachary and also claudell Harris to play off the ball Kelly eyes the shot clock theres six to shoot the Music launch glockton and out of bounds off of BC despite the fine Hustle by Devon mcglockton every Thursday we have a womens basketball double header for you right here on acc network of the ESPN app at this week Isaiah James and number six NC State take on Hanah Doo and number 16 Notre Dam six Eastern and Elizabeth kentley at number 12 Virginia Tech H Duke Kenny Payne trying to Rally his team and he feels like that theyre just trying to still get out of that Abyss theyre two and one in their last three theyve shown some signs though they really have and right now though the wrest are going to take a look at that last play now again I think theyre looking to see if theres any type of hook or hold right here again post uh and for James it looks like like they got tied up and yeah they might get him yeah again thats a dangerous play there that certainly would be a huge uh a blow for Boston CS again obviously any type of flagrant fou and they may get him for that again from that angle right there looked like he held on there might have been a little bit of a hook certainly a dangerous play again right here again uh two guys lobbying now again right there you cant tell again James is holding on as well and and its a wrestling move yeah Ian that certainly definitely looked like a little WWE on both parts Music but when post is out of the game the opponents have capitalized when hes in hes a defensive presence and thats one thing about his Arsenal I know that you like is the fact that he can play defense effectively well again thats uh there have been obviously a lot of uh NBA Scouts uh watching him hes a sevenfooter make no mistake about it theyre here because his ability to step out on the perimeter and knock down threes that obviously is the key thing that separates him but he does a lot more than that for this Boston College team excellent passer and also obviously providing them Rim protection and sometimes s of composure and lack thereof has been an issue for him as Kenny pin and Errol Grant will talk to the crew chief Roger s and get an explanation about where this is headed do you think its a flag well I think its probably more about cleaning this game up it has gotten physical its been physical from the getgo but I think thats more hey look were going to were going to clean this game up and were going to get an explanation right Music now there a flagrant one foul against Quinton post as Jamal Spearman just gave us an explanation so Mike James will have two shots and play without Zachary right now too who has two fouls its the right call again hes held its a classic hook and hold right there its a dangerous play I think though the conference of the two coaches is more hey were going to clean this thing up its starting to get a little chippy guys are chirping after and uh they want to clean this thing up 612 to go uh in of the first half and theyre going to clean it up and I think its excellent job by the refs yeah its much better to stop things and give each coach a warning than it is to let it go yeah absolutely in there see how both teams adjust yous made five of its last six shots Lis was shooting close to 50 and then the the point Tyler Johnsons been a big part of that James in the lane Huntley Hatfield so active on the offensive glass and he travels another turnover against the Cardinals thats their fifth they average 13 per game well Louisville seven offensive rebounds in this game and they are relentless on their attack of the offensive glass Boston College is going to have to continue to put a body on a Louisville player every time the shot goes up a league Bay ran into Trey white heres James Louisvilles fifth in the ACC and offensive rebounds per game think about the confidence they have after that win against Georgia Tech 28 to7 run to close the game and theres another big bucket by Trey white white a confident shooter he has 11 points threepoint Cardinal lead at former USC guard and a pack 12 all freshman team a big pickup and hes a guy again I like his pullup game excellent elevation and release Point Devin mcglockton the three thats the fourth of the game for the Eagles in nine attempts mton 32 from three this year thats only his 13 triple and thats where Chaz Kelly has a grown thats a nice read to find a shooter in the corner uncontested shot for Huntley Hatfield high percentage post laate off him I really like his game again a big body and like post as well too uh hes got soft tou for a Applause big post trying to back in Kelly three and the rebound for white movile clear emphasis on running at field cross over by white on Prince El Bay knifing through did the heart pop but missed the easy Applause one leag Bay the runner too quick for your Applause liking that will bring us to a timeout but Deon mlin range all set up by Chaz Kelly mton with the three Louisville still on top Music two Love is in the air at Toyota prominence hes Malcolm hucker Im John me Perell producer Russ Ken director Mike Baker an outstanding crew Bell Harris two strong off the glass paying the rebound here comes the Cardinals Mike James has got it thats a twopointer foot was on the line but Lis is now on a run you cant run offense transition offense any better really impressive Tyler Johnson thats a great lead pass to James the ball barely touched the ground wide openen three again that is his textbook transition offense again right here you get a stop team rebound put it out one two three not even three dribbles throw it ahead for a wide open jumper and show that on replay for young players how to run transition offense post his strong half continues he has 14 the lead all scores hes made six out of seven shots thats great action that time again they not only just posted him up put him in ball screens and then rolled him away again hes such a tough matchup for opposing bigs because of that ability right there and I like this change up by Earl Grant and Boston College go to a two3 Zone try to force uh Louisville into some jumpers Fade Away by Huntley Hatfield he has eight the thing about Louisville their last three games theyve been spreading the scoring around its not just one guy yeah they last one six guys in double digits and we talked with Kenny Payne about that he said look uh that is how he wants them to play not just one guy getting all the action offensively m glockton double on the Baseline and flumix by it here comes Johnson three hoisted by James hes got it Mike James five of the last six shots have been good and a sevenpoint card in the lead the largest of the game was eight what a read by Johnson again he has played an excellent floor game for Louisville thats in the flat three and a steal turnovers are piling up for the Eagles this is Curtis Williams a freshman they like a lot its easy to see why they are so high on Tyler Johnson the guy with the ball number four look how quick he is and the rejection by post but post said no way but right here back to the previous again look at the patience this is a freshman point guard let the play develop in transition and then find your shooter on the perimeter thats a two transition of Threes all set up by Tyler Johnsons Reeds post already has four Applause blocks three is good Curtis Williams first triple of the game largest lead of the Night 10 points for Louisville theyre on an 80 run 122 over the last 310 Jaden Zachary playing with two fouls that was a wild shot pain the rebound Johnson with five assists another three Williams and the rebound for Quint Music Applause post hson thought about it instead the runner is good and a foul ason Matson 11 for 22 for the field his last two games yeah he has been playing really well for Bosa again because his a threepoint shooting ability he has guys running out at him thats a smart play nice little head fake great body control and one thats a big bucket to stop this run by Louisville by Matson second foul on Alexander Payne who heads to his father Kennys bench the softball season rolls on with the Shriners childrens Clearwater invitation ACC network is the home for these five games starting Thursday morning at 11 Eastern North Carolina Kentucky will start her day and then the final match up will be Sunday morning with the tar Hills taking on Washington dont miss a pitch on acc Applause Network Boston P shows a little full court pressure trying to slow this Louisville deam down James the drive post the Applause board Bell Harris Lockton hes got it so a mini run for BC as the counter punchers Applause continue L will hold for the final shot of the half where are they going well again uh this guy with the a ball in his hands he has been impressive The Freshman Johnson Id put him in some type of ball screen action and then let him go make a play way heres your man johs it to Huntley Hatfield and contact Hunley Hatfield what a target for Johnson who has six assists and thats 10 points for Huntley atfield and Johnsons got six assists in this game again his ability to make reads really has been impressive to go along with his uh speed again thats just a great read draw the defense in and then kick it to your big and one fou on mlon is first Eagles have mton Kelly post Harris and Matson on the floor and the threepoint play connects for Huntley Hatfield hson full 94 ft calling for help from mton Matson gets it back Harris three rebound Huntley Hatfield and that will do it for the first half we had seven lead the big issue though now defensively I like when they went to Zone lets see the adjustments that Boston College makes to come out to start this second half BC and the white jerseys Louisville in the black officials Roger SS e Cassell and Jamal Spearman Trey white he had a terrific first half the USC transfer to Huntley Hatfield lob doesnt connect and Matson comes away with it Matson third start of the season of three and transition is good what a swing of events Louisville looked like they were going to get a lot dunk to start the second half they dont convert and then Boston College Matson goes down the other end starts it off with a three eagles fifth three of the night in 13 attempts Johnson playing 20 minutes in the first half Skips a pass out of bounds BS for Caleb Glenn but the steal by Matson triggers the pass break great team defense that time Matson with the steal and one of the better threepoint Shooters right there Matson burying a three excellent start of the second half for Boston College atson 43 from three here he is on the curl from a glockton wide open in the lane Erol Grant talked about the first five minutes of the second half is key for his team he has to be pleased with how they come out to start this second half now only trailing by three a Glock to the double figures five for five for the field one the accs best Shooters and before the shot went up a TI NBC basketball jump B Eagles quick hands and thats excellent individual defense by Jaden Zachary again James uh and all all the other wings for Louisville very physical in that first half that time Zachary holds his ground comes up with a turnover Zachary quiet in the first half of productive plane with two fouls transfer from Chipola Community College mlon misses his first shot of the night but a foul on the Cardinals thats on Brendon h Hatfield Jaden Zachary last three with 12 points and four assists and he drops times like Malcolm hucky back in the day well Ill tell you what credit the coaching staff of Boston College uh they did an excellent job his progression uh under Earl Grant and staff he just continue to get better but a takeaway Trey white denying the ball and almost a steal by claudell Harris Lou with 24 to shoot Harris voices his contention Zachary can also shoot the threes and theres some familiar names on that list whos number five but I tell you what Dana Barrows uh one of those guys up there one of the best to do it Howard Eisley one of my teammates as well I think thats going to be key though for Boston College can they get somebody else besides post shooting the ball from the perimeter thats going to be key Tyler Johnson cerebral point guard six assists in the first half and sees the best 11 in that game against Florida State where you had the best stat line one of the best in school history you when put up 27 and 11 assists I really like his game so impressive Johnson his assist his court awareness and then his ability to finish in the paint that time on display future very bright for that young man again love his speed change of pace but his decision making really has been key just called for the foul as first hson on the Baseline its BC ball 13 on the shock clock the Eagles have only LED for 5 minutes and 52 seconds game has been tied six times so its been a dog fight and the refs again they going to have to clean this up again it started off and they shut it down uh in that first half and post on the lob but H and up up offensive foul called on BC lucky youre lucky do you agree well again Id like to see the replay on that one who they got yeah again it might be because of the shoulder not sure he even needed to do that called on clo Harris yeah and again it looked like he threw a shoulder check any case can Louisville capitalize they do Trey white deadly wind distant he has been impressive in this game for Lille thats 14 point for him now midrange that time though showing off the threepoint range just think about what they do on a nightly basis four players in double figures a glockton pops one from 15 on the wing well weve seen Excell offense both teams that time Matson again stringing to play out Johnson shakes the defender good ball movement Again by the Music cards Zachary fights for the loose ball rebound from Glenn like a blur he runs into the defender and thats a foul on Tyler Johnson well this is a heads up play right here by Zachary again Johnson backing up hes just pushing the pace that time and on the other end a break for Boston College as well though and L with a wide openen three off a excellent ball movement Johnson to the bench for Kenny Payne replaced by Curtis Williams post for Harris blockton hes got another one last six games in double figures last five hes averaged 14 and six rebounds thats great body control by mcglockton again the passing key that time set up by post career 57 shooter Deon mcglockton but the pretty Touch by Trey white a confident shooter M much like many on this Louisville Squad well therere just going at that matchup right now him and Matson and theyre just allowing white to just work his way down hes using his length and athleticism to raise up over him Harris counters with a three lell Harris has the six three of the game and 12 attempts for the Applause Music Eagles Williams launes hatson the weak side Applause rebound post from 25 oh my goodness international waters and he ties it up you cannot ask for better transition game of the Eagles sparked by the 64 senior Mason mats impressed with his uh decisionmaking an assist this one right here to mcglockton and then in transition right here strain the defense out Heads Up played by Matson another assist hes done a little bit of everything for this Boston College Team Six points four rebounds and four assists and that stat line again is what Earl Grant and staff have talked about cannot just be Quinton post uh he wants a more balance uh from all of his players on the offensive and defensive side he said theyre looking for a breakthrough what does that mean to you well I think it its really Wentz and at the end of the day theyve had some close games in particular at home they have to close out games played a full 40 minutes trailing by eight at the half theyre five nine when trailing in halftime this year theyre eight and4 at Connie Applause form Huntley hfield fronting post a double by mton three to shoot drive and a shot clock violation good defense by the tenacious eag Eagles and that brings us to our imediate timeout its nipp and tuck with 1435 to play BC stand out Stefan Mitchell is a first year graduate assistant with Louisville at BC from 2017 to 21 he started 98 games averaged 7 points8 rebounds ASC all defensive team selection in 201920 after graduating Mitchell played professionally in Germany in Norway and he is a terrific young man yeah really terrific young man had a chance to speak with the staff about him and they are thrilled he actually still in great stape out there we saw him going in shoot around practicing with the team as we take a look at a beautiful pass again this time by Zachary to The Cutting mlon Stefan Mitchell certainly had a great career at BC now in the coaching ranks now on the Louisville Staff first BC lead since they LED 16 15 defense by mton cusing a turnover so the Eagles becoming feistier and Jaden Zachary great pass to Deon mcglockton pinpoint passing that all set up though by the spacing again great spacing by Boston College and then the cut on time by mcglockton Beautiful Finish set up by a nice pass from Zachary block to one of the most improved players in the league he has 17 points his career high as 30 set earlier this year and a foul against the cards heres Saturdays ACC Network mens basketball triple header number seven North Carolina against Virginia Tech at two Eastern then Miami squaring off against these BC Eagles and we C tonight with Louisville and Pittsburgh the glockton on the offensive rebound is called a foul is called against Louisville thats the first on Williams so the Eagles gaining some more confidence on the offensive end why have they been better in this half I think a couple things obviously the turnovers thats the key thing and how they started of the second half I think thats key as you take a look at Devon mcglockton the last five games really have been impressive for him and overall his progress uh at Boston College last season six points per game Yep this year up to double digits and a lot of credit to Earl Grant and his staff again in the Player Development piece they know theyre a developmental program well theyre going to need that and I think the change up matching uh the aggression and also physical play that Louisville basically in that first half had they matched that in the second half I its a big reason why theyre up four its 10 points in the half for mcglockton Johnson with the air ball Here Comes Jaden Zachary punched Away by Johnson and hes called for a foul much to the chrin of the Freshman guard Kenny Payne his seconde coach and the physical nature of the game continues yeah this game again dont come in the paint uh do not be weak with any passes or rebounds uh there are going to be guys coming to try to grab the ball from you it has been a physical game H is bleeding again just shows you the physical nature of this game right here guys are going to walk out with a lot of bandages the trainers are going to get a lot of work on both benches tonight Zachary to Applause inbound Donald hand off the bench and he hits it first bucket of the night for Donald Han coming back from a hand injury Eagles building on their largest lead at six points we saw him out here early working on that before anybody else got out onto the car a court that exact play right there he was going over and over again with the assisant Music coaches in the half the Eagles are 8 for 10 for the field Jamal Spearman official calls a foul its on Donald hand and right here again look at this cut footwork coming off right into his shot and thats a beautiful set play out of bounds underneath B set up though by an excellent screen by post Johnson the inbound to Trey white DC riding a 162 run over the last 345 and bodies flying once again e Cassell calls an offensive foul thats on Brandon Huntley Hatfield thats his second and John this is key right here again two guys trying to block out but right now Boston College in a bonus situation again and now Louisville may have to back off again theyve been very aggressive in this game in the passing Lanes youre Boston College now again no need to settle for uh quick contested jumpers when youre in a bonus situation and lead a one and one for mton Glen the rebound oh by the way when Louis will goes to the free throw line more than its opponent theyre eight and eight when they dont theyre 0 and eight tonight its five out of six for Louisville the line BCs five of six and Glen backing in the post Lee Cassel H the big fella for the foul Quinton post whistled forth Caleb Glen coming off a game where he had nine offensive rebounds and uh we asked coach Payne uh what has been the difference and he said look I gave him a date January 15th youre no longer a freshman and I expect you to get it hes got great size and great physicality just kind of threw that date out there was that threw it out there and and he responded 15 points nine offensive rebounds 13 total rebounds but nine on the offensive boards thats the thing with Louisville think about some building blocks they have I know its been a rough few years under Kenny Payne at 12 and 44 but Tyler Johnson Caleb Glenn Williams theyre all building blocks arent they I think the key thing is they have a young team but Ive been impressed again with Johnson some of your young pieces haris industrious and it pays off for quell Harris sevenpoint Eagle lead as Harris has 10 points one of three in double fig and I like what uh Zachary did again they denied uh Johnson trying to make somebody else run the point of for Louisville could get the ball out of his hands Johnson flx turnover and it Applause midcourt Johnson and Zachary Applause colliding the chippiness continues and theyre going to go take a look at the Monitor and see what happened again all I saw was bodies flying and they had a Advantage Boston College on the other end theyre going to take a look at it sort it out right now though Boston College still with a sevenpoint lead yeah this game has been physical start to finish take a look right there here post and then uh Parris with the hip check SL shoulder check and then this one right here breaking up a fouronone break yeah they called him for a flagrant one intentional tripping right there and so Boston College is going to get two free throws and the ball back and that is a huge swing of events it could be potential four or fivepoint swing Jaden Zachary hits the first so theres two makes for the Eagles who have their largest lead at nine third foul on Tyler Johnson the flagrant one hes on the bench for Kenny Payne Zachary has the ball Zachary in the back court with claudell Harris and Donald Han EV mcglockton and quit post up front bton a COR of four carals the loose ball rebound hes played limited minutes off the bench for the Applause cards ECs out score Louisville 25 to8 the second Applause half Glenn has been Applause quiet take by white step back Williams and post engulfs the rebound and if youre Boston College right now you want to try to run your offense through Quinton post give him a touch ankle breaker by Jaden Zachary oh and in doubt te it up thats hated Zachary beautiful step back and Louisvilles offense seems uh stagnant uh with Johnson The Freshman point guard on the bench just not flowing as smoothly as it was with him on the court takeway Zachary Donald Han and he lays it in Eagles capitalizing on Sloppy Lille play and youre right Malcolm it has been extremely offkilter for the cards BC a 20 to1 run over the last 5 minutes theyre up by 13 guards in the ACC no doubt he is the heart and soul of this team right here beautiful step back jump shot and then defensively he came into this game 143 steals uh he is a second in the ACC he is one of the more uh complete guards physical uh guard for Boston College and big reason why theyre having success in this game right here eight points five assists but I think he has set the tone defensively for Boston College and thats where its happened for BC much more juice for them in the second half Trail by by eight at halftime you were calling for the necessary defensive adjustments yeah absolutely and I think again big thing for Boston College theyve also limited any turnovers that have put Louisville in transition theyve done a great job taking care of the ball and then in their half court defense and they made it difficult for Louisville white directing traffic their point guard Johnson on the bench moments ago a fler on foul against Tim as James backs in gets the rebound and puts it in Mike James leads Louisville at 13 and a half per game he has 14 points first bucket of the second half three by Donald Han he rattles it home the sophomore is giving BC some life yeah and he has played well for Boston College and he and Trey white jarring with each other Hunley hfield stops the 233 Run well atfield has been impressive battling against post that time again both these bigs uh can shoot with soft touch from the perimeter for their respective teams and seven and a half Zachary the Energizer punches it out of bounds but Donald H got a nice look from claudell Harris yeah there again excellent offense get a paint touch off the bounce and then pitch it out for a three and the bench was loving that right there BC has 19 assists on 28 makes three for Williams rebound pushed by post Here Comes hand two on one and an n one Donald hand nine second half points a rebounds get a stop and then get out in transition right here two on one and one eyes were on the rim great body control and hand has been the difference in this second half for Boston College I believe his energy both defensively and offensively has provided a spark hes had some time to rehab from a hand injury he had 16 points against Central Connecticut state earlier this year the largest lead in ACC play this year at 15 points right now for BC traditionally a team thats had to come back Hunley Hatfield hes bit aggressive and the matchup of these two bigs going back and forth both of them can play off the bounce both of them can step out on the perimeter and both can post you up and theres been some talking between post and Huntley atfield jocking for position and eigh rebound for Huntley Hatfield another name to remember Huntley Hatfield for Kenny Paynes Cardinals yeah he thinks hes one of the best post players in the ACC and I would agree with them hes been impressive in this game and there he is again attempting the reverse laying instead of foul thats on Quinton post every Thursday well have a womans back basketb double header right here on acc Network in the ESPN app this week asaiah James at number six NC State take on Hannah hgo and number 16 Notre Dame at 6 Eastern and Elizabeth kley and number 12 Virginia Tech host Duke atfield was supposed to be a impact transfer last year struggled through a foot injury but his last 15 games he has been really good 15 points a game eight rebounds and shooting close to 60 s from the floor transfer from Tennessee as post heads to Earl Grants bench Prince the league Bay checks in for the Music Eagles rebound Trey Applause white Moville shooting 49 James on the run and a tie up caused by the pesky defense of Jaden Zachary Donald hand has been a spark for BC Off the Bench as he celebrates 10 points in the second half its been all BC in the second stanza Dr Martin Luther King and a 12point BC lead over the 86 Louisville Cardinals hes Malcolm HCK young John me Perell willll be back in these same seats on Saturday at four when BC honors great John Austin say Jersey will be retired he takes on Miami in a driving layup attempt by Mike James but a foul against the Eagles thats on Armani Mighty Off the Bench his first but you see a dominant performance marock in the second half leading 35 15 why is it happening well I think the adjustment uh for Boston College and how they started it and I said this earlier theyve matched the intensity of that Louisville had in that first half I think another number points in the paint Boston College right now leads 34 to 24 points in the paint that was the emphasis coming into this Louisville does a great job doing this right here what Mike James just did attack the paint getting to the free throw line Boston College has limited that in the second half and the two misses by James and a foul on Louisville thats on Caleb Glen The Freshman is first and this tells you something where in in hand to have 20 points combined in the second half Louisville has just 15 as a team well Boston College again has done a good job keeping lva out of transition a lot of that again uh the uh freshman point guard on the bench Tyler Johnson after that flagrant foul has uh really not been a factor I felt like he controlled the pace in that first half Boston CS really had difficulties keeping him out of transition that has not been the case in the second Armani Mighty missing the Applause two Zachary gar James this is Glenn his father played football at Louisville Off the Mark and Jaden Zachary directing traffic looking for help from claudell Harris oh hes muscles in for two the Charleston Southern transfer over 1000 career points 14 tonight yeah Harris has been huge for Boston College that time tough finish in the paint rille shooting just 35 in the half that one rims out hards have an eight plus eight rebounding Edge but a foul flashing out on Armani Mighty on Mike James B Harris effective yeah this right here again in transition you got a oneonone situation and thats a tough floater through contact and you look at what hes done tonight 14 points I think the big number two or three from the threepoint line and they need his offense I think you talk to anybody you want to talk about X factors hes an exactor for BC see if he plays well should be a pleasant development well I think the key number again for Boston College four players in double digits has not just been Quinton post Glen no Huntley Hatfield his perseverance pays off hes impressive remember that name again he is a guy 610 soft touch and you can see his work aggressive on the offensive glass and an offensive foul its on Prince El League Bay the sophomore from Minneapolis team seven first on a league b yeah not thats an easy one for to refs the call right in front of him really no need heve already done to dribble handoff and again ill advised foul that time loss of possession now the only good thing is its not a aive ball turnover Tyler Johnson the prman point guard for Louisville back into the game first turnover for the Eagles in 11 minutes Johnson goes Music down looks like he is Music hurt looks like he took a really tough shot again Zachary going after the ball now theyre going to go take a look at it and right here hes trying to swipe the ball up yeah he just got him right in the face yep third on Zachary first foul on Zachary in the second half now hes trying to snack the ball up and unfortunately caught him right in the face and hope that young man is okay Tyler Johnson some anxious moments as Danny Manning is out there movable associate head coach well take a 30se second timeout come back to tell you more about it right after Music this so that last foul uh on uh Jaden Zachary upgraded to a flagrant one that is obviously huge but first and foremost THS and pris with that young man hopefully hes able to get up as hes up now Music and yeah and looks a little woozy but again Jaden Zachary I think classy move went over check on that young man and looks like theyre going to take him back to the locker Music room Tyler Johnson struggling after the flager one thats the third third flagrant one foul of the game both teams have left it all out there its been more intensity than we thought entering this one we knew it would probably be a highscoring game mouu came in the last three averaging more than 85 points per game had 79 against Georgia Tech and their win Saturday Earl Grants Eagles have been playing some good offense as well as white makes one out of two Louisville retains possession but the chippiness has been interesting yeah it is and I think again the refs have done a good job cleaning it up first and foremost obviously uh going to hope Tyler Johnson freshman point guard who has been excellent for them in this game that young man is okay but now how Louisville moves forward without his court presence and ability to break down this defense thats going to be key to close this game out see if they can erase this deficit in the post Huntley Hatfield beautiful pass for Glenn and the slam wow what a pass by Huntley Hatfield who continues to excel hes played a terrific game you cant ask for a better pass from a big right here C to double drop it off and one with the dunk beautiful offense by Louisville and the fup post is for Malcolm threepoint play complete for Caleb Glenn who has six points key for Boston College right now again youre in a bonus situation if Im Boston College Im giving Quinton post a touch or anything going towards the basket dont settle for jumpers and the fadea away not what youre looking for hes been hot in the second half with 10 bouille riding a six to nothing run here comes Music white and a foul says Lee Cassel on the Eagles its on hand his second so bonus situation both ways again right here nice head fake that time by white yeah right there again good call by the ref but we is right on that and again if youre Boston College thats not a good foul again you dont want to stop the clock and then obviously put them on the free throw line chance to set up their defense and Matson checks back into the game right now for Donald Music man Tey moment for Donald H Sixpoint BC lead they led by as many as Applause 15 well Boston College has gone away uh really from a post again I try to get him a touch and then let him go to Applause work Harris for three wanted the foul didnt get it right the Applause rebound plus 13 rebound Edge for the Cardinals good ball movement Williams and a punch away here comes BC o post to Harris hes got it claudell Harris that is his third three of the night in five attempts he has 17 points unselfish basketball and transition post passed up a jumper to give up up for a wideopen quad Al haris look out Huntley Hatfield always seems to have an answer 20 points for Huntley a Hatfield to lead all scorers and hes playing with three Applause Music Applause fouls good match up between post and Huntley Hatfield under four to play post wants it trying to back in two to shoot the hook shot no and the rebound for Music Glenn cranked it up youll live with that offensive possession if youre Earl Grant White against Madson 5050 ball off of Jaden Zachary but Cloud L Harris has given BC some more juice unselfish basketball by Boston Collins hang on to win its fifth ACC game and our game summmer Lille had that 10point lead but the Eagles have been extremely efficient offensively Malcolm since that point yeah I think also keeping Louisville off the free throw line that has been huge Louisville only 17 free throws in his game Boston College 21 and I think the offensive rebounds in particular in the second half have been Limited by Boston a great job on the defensive Music glass last 323 for Kenny Payne and Company see if they can continue to claw back in this Applause one unley atfield a huge night with 20 points both teams in the double bonus and thats a foul on Mason mad second on Matson Tyler Johnson the man on your screen is available to return after he suffered a apparent nose injury does have three fouls but 10 points six assists and four Steals and huge part of the Louisville attacked as Huntley hfield is Off the Mark yeah he missed the free throw but Ive been impressed his footwork when he catches it in the post quick feet he knocks down the second free throw and he has been impressive and then right back into the game Tyler Johnson he has really uh been uh effective for louiso take a look at the foul trouble of for Louisville right now try to close this game out 305 to go Zachary yes sir confident Jaden Zachary in the post 10 points five assists for Zachary a three from The Wing by James and the rebound for post thats a break though by Boston College again they just left James wide open hson and post both passed up open shots and thats smart again run quock no need to shoot the first three you get theres a three for Applause Matson youve been loving his game tonight and impressive again passed up the three post passed up the three understanding time and possession run some clock and result another open look beautiful execution theres third start he sparked the Eagles out of bounds off of the Cardinals and Roger ears just called a double technical on Zachary and Trey white and again theyre going to clean it up it has been physical guys have been jarring and thats a good call again they need to clean this up first half they brought both coaches together and warn them but theres been a lot of discussion between the two teams and right now again if youre a Louisville you dont want to get beat long Boston obviously you need to take care of the ball in this situation M glockton dribbling like a point guard good handle by the sophomore from coming Applause Music Georgia deliberate Eagles offense under 10 to shoot for Zachary Applause Music Baseline three for post on the Applause clock and white carals it 90 seconds to play Hunley Applause Hatfield mton has it mton has been huge for Boston College in this game that is his fifth rebound 19 points efficient 8 of 10 from the floor you see Killing more Music clocked Applause and there you have it how about another three claudell Harris 20 points hes made four threes and six attempts and the slam for white timeout Lille 302 timeout but the Eagles up by 12 and Harris combining with B glockton on for 39 points well this right here again beautiful step back three by claudell Harris and uh he has been the expector but you look at the stat she for Boston College you have 1 two three four five different Boston College players in double digits that has been the key in this game earol Grant when we spoke to him before the game he said yes Quinton post gets a lot of credit a lot of attention but were better uh when we have a stat sheet like this and I think that message was received for Boston College in particular in the second half yeah they got the memo as theyve outscored mlon and Harris have out scored louville 3928 coming up Thursday night 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every game plus a look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week coverage you can only find in one place on the ACC Network and the ESB NF can you imagine what Caitlyn Clark is doing for Iowa 1000 career assists 3000 career points thats the only player in college basketball history with those numbers unbelievable is shes almost Im going to say shes unguardable when shes on fire as shell hit from anywhere across the court really remarkable what shes doing and as you take a look though at this balanced scoring attack for Boston College led by Deon mclock and obviously post you know hes going to put up good numbers for you but I think its been of the balance that Boston College has shown thats been a difference in this game its exactly what Earl Grant ordered out of this Eagles offense and similarly Kenny pays got production from four guys in double figures led by Huntley half fields and white 21 each but Eagles have been red hot the second half but a foul approaching the timeline Mason Matson hounded by Trey Music white two shots for Mason Matson well hes known as a shooter Matson and yes he does that well a guy thats above 40 from the threepoint line but for me uh tonight his assist well he set his teammates up for some easy looks again he draws a lot of attention coming off screens but the floor game that he played setting his teammates up for easy opportunities was impressive last time the Eagles scored 85 or more points was at Georgia Tech when they scored 95 a win Johnson with the three and post the rebound Here Comes Madson theres a 3 second differential shot clock game clock glockton red hot misses the bunny Johnson the drive and he converts Eagles eliminated Louisville from the ACC tournament last year and with six Eagles in double figures in a sterling second half effort thats going to do it as be C walks away with an 89 77 win to secure their
