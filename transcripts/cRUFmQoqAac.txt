was the game in Coral Gables couple of months ago it it was normal coming back here he felt it was normal coming back in here during shoot around so well see he really struggled in that first game perhaps a sense of normaly for him gets him shooting the basketball better here this afternoon jir Watkins with the first two points in style today but heres the worst part about that ke George never even made an attempt to get back and stop Watkins just the bucket NORAD omir 43 thats what he has done very well as of late hit three threes in the game against North Carolina in Chapel Hills we look at the FSU starting lineup the senior L lineup yeah pay attention to number 40 Isaac spainhower hes a fourth year member of fsus Fame Green Team thats the walkon group that coach Hamilton always has to get his starters ready and he was a part of the sweet 16 team as a freshman and so getting the opportunity to start here today heres Cleveland with booze coming down from the stands able to calmly bury his first shot attempt of the day but already a much better performance from Matthew Cleveland than what we saw from him on January 17th he struggled mightily against his former team Josh nickelberry also getting a start the grad transfer Jaylen gainy a grad transfer as well starting in the middle for Florida State he comes up to set the screen for Watkins Cleveland cant get the nice job by Watkins to knock it away and itll go the other way 7s basketball you see early what one of the problems has been for Miami throughout this season turnovers and very uncharacteristic for a gim Lena coach team normally they handle the ball extremely well but thats been one of the Achilles heels for this throughout this season well Cory youve seen a lot of the canes this year now 15 up 15 down six and 13 in League Play and not at all what was expected coming into the year when they were picked number two in the preseason ACC poll of course made the final four last year and the last couple of sweet 16s what has gone wrong in your estimation over the last couple of months for Miami big round of applause as Cleveland has it blocked out of bounds by G well when you start talking about Miami basketball we get a look at gainy who three seasons ago was the ivy league Defensive Player of the Year bringing his talents to Tallahassee TOS ACL early did not play last year but making a contribution early here on his senior night when you start with Miami you have to look first at the injuries you know they this is the 12th game of the 20 ACC games where they played started without one of their starters but then that number goes up when you consider how many times guys have got got hurt early in those games thats another one of those guys wer popper who has spent a lot of time in and out of the lineup because of injuries thats where the beginning of the issues came for the Hurricanes 7 for the sna by the triple off the fingertips of Darren Green Junior and that string of injured starters not playing continues today because Nigel pack sidelined with the recurring knee injury that he reinjured last time out in Miamis lost to Boston College green one of the best threepoint Shooters in program history cant make it two in a row 75 Miami theres some of the uh story of the injury bug without Nigel pack for this ball game but they went in December and January Cory Miami did weeks at a time without being able to practice properly just because they didnt have enough guys yeah didnt have enough guys and then the guys that they did have were playing banged up so Force coach larer really couldnt use them in practice as much they had to basically try to get better through film study but this Miami team is coming off coming into the tuck on a eight game losing streak benley Josephs been playing very well for Miami lately he penetrates gets a paint touch and finds the terrific freshman Kean George for three and thats what Kean George has done a high level shooting 415 from Beyond a threepoint Arc and all the great shooting first years in the ACC hes at the tops as far as accuracy were not in Charlottesville theyre freshman Darren Green says I can shoot with anybody in this building hes got his second made jump shot its 108 Miami so if they red shirt it would that make them still a uh a freshman yeah okay yeah just checking heres George being defended by Jaylen warley whos come off the bench today on senior day here in Tallahassee omir kicks it out a rounding out on benley Joseph one thing for certain Miami will use the threepointer as a weapon they struggled only six of 27 in their last game against VC but made 14 out of 30 against North Carolina and the three has been a weapon for the simal as well as they knocked down another here in the first rame yeah taking 1110 lead off the turnover looking to build on it Jaylen warley was looking that way Cleveland knew where he was warley with a rare threepoint try you know his coach told me earlier today he thinks by next season warley could be a good threepoint shooter likes the work hes putting in likes the form as its gotten better by the way theyre wearing the gold home uniforms at the beest of one of their outgoing seniors jayen gain 1110 NOS state so thats the one thing that Miami cannot continue to do especially against a team like Florida State who leades the ACC and for turnovers per game kanes in the road Black come in 15 up and 15 down the exact same overall record as Florida State the seal with a win would get a Buy in the first round and not play until Wednesday in the ACC tournament the Hurricanes meanwhile are locked in to play a first round game on Tuesday but more than that bragging rights between these two State rivals Baba Miller has come into the game for Florida State Leonard Hamilton using a much different starting lineup because of senior day Jaylen gainy got to choose the gold uniforms at home also Isaac Spain hour started they are both on the bench in a more typical lineup but coach ham always goes deep into his bench anyhow he absolutely does and I love the choice by gainy to pick the gold its something about having a home color thats not white can you tell these are not white yes I can tell theyre not white okay and you should not be making color blind jokes no jokes you know that was a joke no no no no no Im Im honestly curious about how you see the world yes I can tell that these are not white uniforms and I like the choice by gaining Cory can tell that Miamis in their Road black uniforms and here come the booze for Matthew Cleveland his first two years has a SE and then transferred to the other side of the Rivalry theres a beautiful move to to the bucket hes got a couple of M shots thats more than he did the first time these two teams met back in January in Coral Gables yeah Matthew Cleveland told you earlier that he was he felt pretty comfortable coming back into this building and hes looked comfortable with the ball in his hands here but this has been the weapon for Florida State already made three threepoint field goals which is not necessarily their strong suit Matthew Cleveland nor Chad oir heres the Freshman Kean George looking to work the Baseline and hes every bit of 68 now again when they signed him he was 65 and by the time he actually got to campus he had grown three Ines and the scouts are still very much intrigued by his upside yeah dougy fresh hes the tallest member of their starting five and hes the point guard and so when you think about that that shows you really you know part of the the height discrepancy that Florida state has over Miami this game yet the potential that George has well heres Baba Miller who is 6 12 doesnt like to say sevenet 7et no 612 is his size and you see the S getting on the floor after the basketball great Hustle by Watkins to tap that away from omir get our first look at Primo Spears who will have a birthday tomorrow he turns 23 to his jersey tomorrow by the way his teammate Josh nickelberry its his birthday today he turned 23 today thats pretty good celebrating your birthday on senior night maybe next year the calendar Falls correctly to where Primo Spears is able to do the same could be nearly seven minutes gone on this final day of the ACC regular season well go popper playing on a less than ankle got great bur looked pretty good on that drive hes played on a less than ankle ever since December 29th when you and I were in Coral Gables to call the game against North Florida turned his ankle in that game and its done many times since as jir Watkins knocks down another three and just has a little quick comment for the Miami Ben well he has now 18 points from 1000 in his career which began at VCU makes the score 1412 Florida State and nor omir now 17 points away from 000 in a Miami uniform well he told us this morning he was feeling more normal coming into this building he certainly looks good to start Matthew Cleveland with six points and he ties the game at 14 but often times hearing those boo can actually motivates you it can help you and Matthew Cleveland hearing the booze from the the fiful here at the Donell Tucker Center every time he touches the basketball hes playing against more than just the seol on the floor throughout this game he also playing against his crowd and hes approached it the right way and he said this morning Cory he was expecting to be booed and its not just from the opening lineups theyve been booing him like you say every time hes touched the ball so far but this is you know a rivalry you just cant go to the other side and not expect to come back you and not hear about it Im not sure its quite a rivalry and the reason why is because Florida state has won 11 of the last 12 games Im not sure you can count that a rivalry until both teams start doing some winning uhoh above the r he has been brilliant with his the last three or four games coming off a careerhigh 25o performance Tuesday at Pittsburgh his first two go right onto the Highlight Reel today Michael noo with a basketball off the Miami bench brings it back out to Cleveland finds an opening along the Baseline noo fights for it but its Florida State basketball Chandler Jackson with it under control into the paint left it short Cleveland pulls down the Miss George spins thats going to be a go on the way down jir Watkins blocked it so two points go up on the board for Miami cam cor coming off of a career high 25 points against Pittsburgh not sure if any of them were as emphatic as these two on the followup was the Hurricanes alltime winning his head basketball coach but the numbers the awards just keep coming in Cory na ABC golden anniversary Award presented to the nabc member with 50 plus years in basketball I congratulated coach ham earlier today on receiving that and to put it in perspective ladies and gentlemen I am 50 years old so that means that Leonard Hamilton has been in basketball college basketball my entire life youre old yeah youre older hes been in college basketball since I was seven then there you go well weve got two Hall of Fame nominee coaches going against each other Jim Lena the winning as coach now in hurricanes history and Coach Hamilton the alltime winning as coach in Florida State program history both have been nominated in the last couple of years for potential into Springfield and we need both of them to get in for not only what theyve done for these respective universities but also for what theyve done for the game of basketball more important than anything that theyve done as benley benley Josephs knocked down another threepointer it is they have helped develop so many young men into successful people going out into this society and that is what each of these coaches value more so than any final fours or any records on the basketball courts yeah coach Hamilton was talking about that again as Corin has his second slam of the day he says were judged by wins and losses but we should be judged by these young men five and 10 years down the Music road Joseph lost it another Miami turnover seven trying to turn it into points Daron green Jr finds Chandler Jackson spotting up jakai Robinson getting playing time lately Richard sophomore from ausing New York looking to go end to end a wild shot gets the whistle and hell head to the line for two you talk about Miami as of late with all the injuries its given a number of guys a lot more opportunities is giving Bley Joseph more opportunity to become a scorer especially with Al Nigel pack in the lineup Bley Joseph averaging over 15 points per game throughout the last four games he has been very good for the Miami Hurricanes as we get a look at Nigel Pac who in his last two games is 0 for 12 from the field if you go back to when he played the majority of the game against Clemson and went 0 for seven and then 0 for five in the first half on his senior night against Boston College and cor Gables earlier this week averaging over 13 points per game he did not participate in shoot around today he was dressed did have his shoes on was over on the stationary bike but the hope is that hell be able to go on Tuesday in their ACC tournament opener in Washington DC as jakai Robinson tries to make the second for two now two for n on the year but he tracks down his own Miss and those are the type of plays that jakai Robinson has made has been the hustle play been the energy the effort speaking of effort how about the effort from gy coming from the weak side coming on the Block side and again his knee is going to need another procedure after the season he cant even walk a normal gate let alone run but hes out there trying to get it done senior day yeah and you have to take your hat off the guys like that understand as this basketball career comes to an end in college at least anyway but wanting to make sure they go out on top Taylor bold Bowen off the Florida state bench hes number 10 in Gold Primo Spears missed the three and a whistle on the rebound one of the struggles for nadir has been finishing oversized and you see gainy coming across we mentioned earlier gainy was the ivy league defensive player of the year two seasons ago but because the ivy league shut down during the co year gave him an opportunity to be able to come finish his career at Florida State well hes a seconde grad transfer coach Hamilton was anticipating anchoring this usually vaunted defense each of the last two seasons it just not worked out omir with a nice pass but his teammate went down while trying to get the ball up Paul Joe Bay and its Florida State basketball but another hustle play by jaki Robson unable to Come Away With The Possession but still getting the flexion getting his hand on the basketball and more importantly stopping Florida State in transition all right Cory Florida state is giving up nearly 76 points per game second worst in the ACC only to Louisville their last in defensive rebound so those numbers just are atypical for Florida State but on the flip side Florida state has overtaken Syracuse for most steals per game so are they good defensive team a not so good defensive team how are the seol right now on the end of the floor that you usually can count on them being really really good well theyre not a good defensive team we start with that to make sure that we get that clear however they can cause chaos and thats one of the things that Leonard Hamilton wants to be able to do but he also has been a coach thats preached a system that allows them to be better in the half court defensively the problem for Florida state has been the fact that they do not have veteran players teaching the younger guys the culture of this program and its really been the case for both these programs this season foul on the penetration Bley Joseph by the way as you talked about Cory he has been playing really well scoring the basketball hes the only hurricane to play in every single game this year 31 in counting as we had to great youre watching the ACC on ESPN on senior day here in Tallahassee Florida seven different Seminoles recognized along with Coach Hamilton for their contributions to this program Darren Green Jr told me this morning hes not a crier said his parents werent criers sisters not a crier there were going to be no tears shed today and indeed they uh held true to that and there is number 22 Darren Green among those who get one final tip of the cap here at the top theres still time to cry though you know its a lot of people that say they are criers until all of a sudden they feel precipitation running down their face but theyre inside and its not raining theres a lot of is still a lot of time left to cry well we saw Darren seniors dad his mom Nina green by the way is also from Gastonia North Carolina same Hometown as Leonard Hamilton and Coach ham has been recruiting for a long time he youre old he recruited you he understood I got to recruit mom and use the Gastonia angle dont worry about the player if I get Mom the kids coming see if if you really knew about Gastonia you refer to it as the gas house thats the gas house and again I understand you read it but you got to know it its the gas house thats what you when you talking Gaston its got to be referred to as a gas we need to bring you North more frequently so I can be on my my home tur well we hear the booze as Matthew Cleveland the former seol takes his second free throw young man who joined the 1000 point Club earlier this season at Virginia Tech back in mid January so youre youre assuming that you know t is one of my homes because youre saying that this is my turf no you were talking about North Carolina you have had homes in North Carolina correct this is true many people here feel as though this is one of my homes also Ive got a lot of Florida State Games over depending on the time of the year I dont think youre hanging out in the summer time in tah I have though believe it or not I have played a Nationals in this building way back in the summer of 1991 myself and Jason wiford associate head coach at University of Virginia lost to Chris Weber and in the Detroit Super Friends in a national championship I I didnt realize it was called the Leon County Civic Center backo Spears make the bucket this building must be old if you played in no see you know thats like the third time you call me old in this broadcast you did turn 50 in the last calendar year and Bley Joseph fires away lets get back to the real action unable to knock down the three ball been a lot of three taken by both these teams where normally we see Florida State doing more of that attacking the basket was Watkins able to save it indeed he was he knocked the ball off of wga popper so the seol keep it with 18 on the timer what kind of years jir Watkins had in your eyes averaging over 15 points nearly six rebounds a game hes been shooting the lights out lately I thought I think hes played very well but its difficult to come into Florida State and understand the culture but more importantly how you have to defend were watching them shoot around earlier today and just listening to the different calls that are are made based upon how youre switching its not just one way to switch defensively there are multiple ways and seeing hearing the lingo I believe its difficult for players to be able to come in and have this type of effect in their first year but give Jamir Watkins a lot of credit for doing so nor Chad omir says uhuh to Baba Miller well defensively it has not the the newness of the situation for jir Watkins he has a season going on with Steels that puts him in the same IL as all time sem old great like Sam Cassell Charlie Ward Tony Douglas in terms of how many times he takes the ball away so now let me tell you this deals are not always a determining factor of being a great defender because absolutely I played against Charlie Ward and Sam canel and Charlie Ward was a great defender my man Sam I Am was not my games were always better against Florida State in December while Charlie was on the football field Spears block by orir his second Denial in the last minute and thats why I specifically talked about the steals not saying they were great defensive players because there is a distinction to be made well this is a great defensive play by NORAD omir blocking the shot of this 612 Baba Miller and then of course going into the 510 Primo Spears denying two opportunities for Florida State to try to put more points on the board NORAD oir was picked preseason all ACC he going to wind up on one of the all ACC teams well find out shortly Darren Green Jr The Catch and Release and thats Darren Green Js game he is a knockdown shooter ever since he stepped on the floor here at Florida State hes been locked and loaded always looking to get an opportunity from Beyond The Arc and one of the better percentage threepoint Shooters weve had in the ACC over the last two seasons and hes doing that despite lingering shoulder and Ankle injuries he like usual today Cory was the first out to get shots up he is endlessly in the gym working on that shot hes getting shots up already three for eight in this one but knocked down three threes to start it off and Darren Green Jr playing on his senior night making sure he goes out the right way played his first three years for Johnny Dawkins at UCF itll stay at this end after both Watkins and Joseph hit the deck Bley Joseph just slipping like a wet spot on the floor and then jir Watkins that same West spot getting the best of him as he kicks the basketball out of bounds so now do we call this gentleman who was not a boy a ball boy who was on the floor cleaning up the West bot I didnt see him now Im looking at him yeah he you cant call him a ball boy if youre shaving you cant be a b another turnover for Miami nine turnovers already to only three by Florida State however Florida State hasnt been able to take advantage of many of those turnovers part of the reason why we have a tie basketball game one other final score on this final day of the ACC regular season Virginia Tech has beaten Notre Dame 8276 everybody but Syracuse closing out the regular season today before convening in the district either Monday or Tuesday depending on when you play your first game you will be there I will be there and I believe that puts Virginia Tech at 10 and 10 if I am correct 10 and 10 in the league which puts them in the mix with so many different teams Florida State trying to get to 500 in ACC play a lot of different scenarios as far as seaing is concerned still to be determined ACC tournament action as wer Poppers able to use the reverse layup for the dece you know first name you know Ws first name you know its Im sure at some point I did but I dont any longer nyine oh okay remember I remember that apparently only his mom calls him nyine of course when shes not happy with him bu Bowen with the threepointer but theres one of his teammates who likes to call him by his given name NY its Nigel P just trying to keep it real I guess yeah no thats just thats trying to be antagonistic is actually what that is 2625 Florida State back on top after the jump shot by B Bowen hir puts it on the deck tries to will his way through warley and he turned it over but can Florida State take advantage of the turnover B Bowen was wide open just knocked down to three but great job by Miami getting back defensively heres B Bowen off the bounce fighting for the basketball but it comes to the canes here is nyine hamir popper and wga by the way came from his grandmother lahti poppler who we understand is probably watching today from her home in the Francisville neighborhood in North Philly well she loves to see Wier going Baseline to the reverse and on the other end Taylor b b stepping up and Coach Ken Im going to go with Josh passner because hes got so much paper on the studio desk I mean he looks like the mad scientist over there trying to figure it out so Im going to go with Coach with with Coach passner simply because hes got some type of paperwork that applies to his theory contact on the shot Matthew Cleveland continues to play inspired basketball in his return to Tallahassee he leads all scores with 10 well he absolutely has to when you come into an environment like this after leaving but what you thought was going to be greener passers you better show up as t b comes up with the a rebound and the put back Hes listed at 610 what do you think his reaches he was way up there definitely has the wingspan but also has bounce thats part of the reason he was way up there but I love the fact that hes crashing the offensive glass which can be another dimension offensively for this Florida State team well you know he only played eight minutes in the game down in Coral Gables but came up with four steals in that game he is so active when hes out on the floor yeah and to the actual question as we see jayen warley doing a little bit of a whirly there you see what I did right there that to the debate that Kevin Conor asked the two coaches on the set I agree Florida State I go with Coach K to be completely honest I think Florida state has more of a chance to make some noise in the ACC tournament because they play with so much depth dep and so much speed and when you get Jaylen warley making plays getting downhill finding his teammates or scoring at The Rim both these guys from the Philly area going at it warley and wer this is not the first time they played against each other you going to have any more witty word play oh Im sure I will can you say how many times can you say that fast yeah exactly wiy were Laughter play there you see Tom house into the game a sophomore forward from Dayton Ohio cam Corin right there on the screen as well 3027 Florida state with a lead late in the first half on this final day of the regular season both teams trying to St snap skids the NS have dropped back to back games kanes meanwhile are on an eight game skid its been more than a month since Miami tasted victory and boy would they love to get this one before heading to the ACC tournament Darren Green J with his and its now for Florida State and Darren Green Jr is feeling good about things here the last time most likely he will play in the tuck and he is shooting the basketball lights out here this young man whos had eight threes in a game in a Florida State uniform he may go beyond that here on S yeah that was when he put 30 on St Johns last season so he can really heat up on Pace to perhaps make a run at a career high today 3327 he and Matthew Cleveland their teams respective top scores so far Primo Spears back into the game with benley Joseph the Junior from Arlington Mass missing the front end and house the rebound heres Primo Spears who was on his third stop as a Collegiate player started at Duan then went to Georgetown now Florida State and understand the Primo Spears didnt get eligible till December 16th when the NCAA allowed for guys who had transferred twice to become eligible and this Florida State team got much better with Primo Spears in the lineup hes a double figure score coming off the bench that Im sure Leonard Hamilton would have loved to have had to start the season I asked him did you like Pittsburgh did you like Washington DC or to prefer Tallahassee he said he like the cities but he likes being here for a real college atmosphere in tah yeah different College atmosphere and I would go with the climate here maybe a little more advantageous to Primo as well it didnt come up but youre probably right see you didnt ask the hard question no its an easy answer to weather do you like better three ball good by Paul J The Freshman from France Paul Jo another one of the young players for Jim Lara getting minutes and gaining experience for the Hurricanes who could be big for them next season Spears trying to work on Cleveland rising up off the front rim omir back into the game clears the rebound omir keeps it alive to himself and then the foul on house I got a figure nor cadir knows the fact that his rebounding average right now is at 96 and he would love to get it back up to double figures where he has been for the last three years one of the elite rebounders of our time in college basketball MH however armo Bott the only ACC player averaging a double double nor shadir trying to get back into that company where he was as you mentioned for the last three seasons omir is the only player in the country to average a double double each of the past three seasons first two at Arkansas State then last year with Miami and hes averaging 17 points in 96 so far this year and you look at the numbers only Zack Ed Hunter Dickinson and Im not sure who Freeman is Enrique okay thank you for for adding your your input in that one but when you any anything that youre doing where theres only four players naturally doing that that is High Praise especially when the top two guys are Dickinson and Zach eeden you need to follow the Akron Zips a little more closely Cory you know Ive got my hands full with this ACC so Im going to stick with that long rebound track down by Watkins Spears down the lane and he banks it in thought he had way too much speed up off the window yeah thats a tough bucket by Primo Spears more importantly to be able to get through that them allowing him to get to the rim to go off the glass we wont call that a kiss off the glass either no has some velocity noes can hold for a final shot if they so choose ah will they make the intelligent play here Primo Spears says uhuh Im shooting that was not the intelligent play fortunately Chandler Zach is able to get the offensive rebound and now Leonard Hamilton not excited about the fact that they did not make the intelligent play on the floor to call a timeout well take a break with him and come back to the tuck in 30 seconds with Cory Alexander Im Doug Sherman back in Tallahassee where Florida State holds a slim threepoint lead in this final game of the regular season for the NES and the canes now you said something earlier and I agree with you this is a rivalry around here but if one side dominates a rivalry which has been the case lately at least its tough to view it in that manner the great and I I I date this the great Washington Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs once said its only a rivalry if both teams win everything then my Cowboys were whooping his team which means it was no longer a rivalry because they never won so until Miami wins some more games in this one it will always remain a rivalry between these two schools but its been onesided yeah and its not just in basketball oh beautiful set up camp Corin Above the Rim to throw down the feed from Primo Spears corins third dunk of the half Cleveland at the buzzer no he had a productive first 20 minutes for the Miami Hurricanes against his former teammates but he and the canes head to the locker room trailing by five to Florida State we send it back to the studio with Coach K coach heres Kev clean up all those papers Josh back inside the Tucker center for the start of the second half with the homestanding seals up five on the hurricanes on senior day and welcome back everybody along with Cory Alexander Im Doug Sherman Florida state has the lead with a little extra effort through that first half they absolutely have 12 offensive rebounds allowed the simol to make this a lead in the first half but also they have 17 more field goal attempts than do the hurricanes in the first half of this game so the 11 turnover by Miami and the offensive rebounding has giving Florida State the advantage however they have not shot a free throw yet in this game yeah Miamis only been called for three personal fouls as we start the second 20 minutes a more customary starting unit for Leonard Hamilton he went all outgoing players seniors to begin the ball game so Jaylen warley back into the starting lineup and he misses the junior Guard from Philadelphia individually Matthew Cleveland 10 points to lead the canes hes got the basketball and here come the boo birds for the former seol and Darren Green Jr doing all of his damage from outside has 12 points to lead all scores Baba Miller blocked the first one couldnt get the second you know but one of the things I sat right on that area about with Coach Hamilton in shoot around earlier today and Darren Green was supposed to actually switch to front on that Baba Miller did a great job coming over to help but that was an opportunity where Darren Green was actually supposed to front nor Chad oir and not allow him to catch the basketball in that spot Clevelands going to be whistled for the foul trying to contend with the much taller Baba Miller who told us to shoot around today when asked what are you most working on he said I got to be aggressive all the time and Coach ham said yeah Ive got to reprogram some things out of him as a European coming over to the States but he also mentioned that he had to reprogram that really with the majority of his team because when you consider the fact that jir Watkins Primo Spears You Justin G youve got so many transfers on this team that of course they have habits from their former programs that you almost have to deprogram to show them the Florida state what Cory by the way that was the first time cam corn has missed a shot today or this season against the seol he was a perfect three for three but that was not a dunk attempt a little tougher on that one well hes gotten great looks as and now defensive rebound opportunity for nor Chad oir who flushes it home over the much taller Baba Miller however there are very few guys as strong as NORAD omir in college basketball and omir using his strength to finish that one off look at how much damage he does to this Rim he barely gets the ball over the rim however he uses all of the Breakaway in the springs that are included Miller a rainbow three long rebound to the corner for green another one of numbers we didnt even talk about Florida State shot 23 threepointers in the first half of this game as Baba Millers able to come up with that offensive rebound thats the Improvement leard Hamilton wants to see from Baba crashing the offensive glass using that 6 12 frame to impact the game missed layup at the other end by benley Joseph Green uses the screen from warley around and out another rebound for nor Shadow and he will dribble up bounce it to Cleveland who attacks and lays it in on the other side in that whole sequence right there Cory weve talked about the excellent rebounding that omir has but some of the guard skills that he has if he can can extend continue to expand on those can he find a place in the NBA someday do you think I believe hell find a place in the NBA the way he is right now when you think of the strength and he has the ability to facilitate offensively hes been a very good passer throughout his career struggled right there to score over the size but his shooting ability hes showing off that touch from Beyond The Arc I believe thats what helps him be able to play that small ball five and even some four into the next level crial just keep firing away from outside green with another threepointer to retake the lead and Darren Green Jr now five of 12 from Beyond a threepoint Arc in this game omir trying to answer hes got his average up to about 37 so you think that is going to be okay going forward I believe so I mean again now Derek green Jr you want to talk about averages knocked down two of his three threes here to start the second half I love the way Darren Green Jr has approached this game today if Im going out Im going out with the bang and this will be his last opportunity here in the tuck and he has taking advantage of it well he has scored the last six points in the game to open up a sixpoint Florida State lead Kean George with the terrific feed and theres the bounce of popper but he comes down hobbling once again playing on a bad ankle most of the season Darren Green Jr on senior day has found a rhythm from Beyond The Arc the nice drive and kick from Watkins Doug foress it doesnt look any better than that line up per going to be flat out bananas in Cameron Indoor Stadium for this matchup and I can tell you Ive spent a lot of time with both these teams since the first matchup and regardless as to what they say theyve had this one circled on their calendar yeah and I I think that stat that we just showed is fascinating that its the 50th time these two programs Carolina and Duke have played while both were in the top 10 in the AP pole the next nearest I think it said Carolina and NC State 14 times its a really remarkable rivalry no question about it it absolutely is that a nice move by jayen warley getting to the rim using that left hand to be able to finish over the top of stretch Defender but you see warley on the switch fronting wo on the box as Kean George is able to knock down another three we talked about his accuracy from Beyond The Arc shooting 415 coming into the game and that numbers going up yeah thats tops amongst all freshman in the ACC here goes Baba Miller hurricanes with numbers Here Comes George nice catch ses got back nicely on defense thats how you attack a big man I was about to say for benley Joseph is disrespectful to allow Baba Miller to guard you that far away from the basket and benley push the Jets on gets right to the rim for the Finish Florida States been lighting it up from outside they go back inside warley almost put that in the foul against Cleveland and so will head to the free throw line but Florida State on the season came in averaging 31 from the ark they at 56 so far today that is not Wars game hes more accustomed to trying to get into the paint and get to the free throw line and this is the seols first free throw attempt of the game and he is at 71 on the year coming up at 630 Eastern at Cameron Indoor as weve been talking about on ESPN and the app Lots on the line in the 262nd meeting between the tar Hills and Blue Devils the ACC regular season title ACC tournament seating and this is again the 50th meeting where both teams were in the top 10 by far the most ever in the history of college basketball and of course youve made that trip so youre familiar with it Angel gray of course our great sideline analyst drove from one to other the other day and said I didnt realize how close this was what she stayed at the hotel at Carolina yeah but she did a game at Duke and she was she was shocked at how close they are to each other I was like have you not listened to all the promos for the last 50 years of basketball however angel of Florida State Alum now knows the close proximity of the two universities nice pass unfortunately for Miami noo couldnt handle it Florida State takes it away up by two Watkins calls for the screen now youve got to take advantage of the switch you got a smaller Defender goes right into the help however bail out by foul yeah well it was set up beautifully off of the switch and they get the foul call some more free throws upcoming for the seol jir Watkins coplayer of the week in the ACC along with RJ Davis back on November 27th he was the sunshine slam MVP with wins over UNLV in Colorado and Watkins has an opportunity to return to Florida State he is a red shirt Junior so in his fourth year of college could have gone out with the seniors today but opted not to do the ceremony well he had to take a medical red shirt for a knee injury back in his time in VCU still has the co year so thats why he still has another year if he so chooses and he has indeed left that door open and again I believe that he would be so much better if he does return to Florida State next season because now he understands whats expected of him from Leonard Hamilton its difficult to be able to do this in one year but often times and thats one of the things that coach ham has talked about hes normally had Juniors and seniors to teach the freshman and sophomore he hasnt had that in the program for the last three seasons which has been part of the reason why this Florida State team has not returned to the Excellence that it once was years ago Bley Joseph back outside to omir heres Wugga popper driving around gy able to lay it in again attacking a big out on the perimeter and again coming back wiing limping back down the floor as we talked about the ankle of wga popper definitely nowhere near 100 last checked it was 85 and 85 isnt going to help you when you got to get out cover a guy like Darren Green J is now shooting 50 s of 14 from Beyond The Arc omir strong to the bucket left it short got it back poppler tries to attack again has it knocked out of bounds by gy the canes will keep it underneath with 11 to shoot I got a credit wga popper for going out there and playing again today he is clearly less than because of that anle and through it yeah last check was 85 hes not even close to that right now you see every time he runs up and down the floor theres a significant length however his classmate benley Joseph these two came in together and right now they have been the offense here in the second half for the Hurricanes yeah last six games benley Joseph is better than 50 from Beyond The Arc Premo Spears back into the game for Florida state lines it up another rebound for omir trying to get that rebound average back into double figures here goes Wugga to the left hand little Philly right there and hell Lim back up floor again but I tell you what hes explosive with the ball in his hands and and I can tell you for certain Ive watched him turn his ankle multiple times hes not faking but when he gets his mind together that he is going to the rim hes going to get there and he has finished here this evening Taylor B in Baba Miller out Matthew Cleveland will take a seat as Michael noo returns to the Miami Lineup Florida state has done a better job here in the second half of attacking theyve gotten themselves to the free throw line a couple of times just drew the foul that was a non shooting foul so the inbound comes from underneath give Miami credit tie game now and a lot is because the their defense and the ability to turn defense into offense another turnover for Florida State noo is denied its a held ball and The Possession errow will stay at this end in this rivalry game the seals and the Hurricanes going blow for blow on his senior day Darren Green Jr Cory is doing Darren Green Jr thing he absolutely is he said he wasnt isnt going to cry but he is trying his best to make the Hurricanes cry seven of 14 from Beyond the threepoint Arc here and we still have just under 12 minutes to go Darren Green Jr all of his points from Beyond The Arc all but one of his field goal attempts from Beyond The Arc however he is going out swinging here on his senior day yeah nine shy of his careerhigh 30 but only one shy of his single game careerhigh eight made threes that came last season against St Johns and uh if youre the seminal keep finding number 22 in Gold Miami basketball itll be Wugga popper into no Chad oir Bley Joseph on the floor as well as Paul Joe Bay back out there for coach laraa and just like that Paul Jo gets into the ACT an offensive rebound and stick back plus the foul but it starts with North shadow taking advantage of the mismatch hes got a smaller guy guarding him gets right to the rim but with so much attention on trying to help out onoir Paul Jos able to come in pick up the offensive rebound put it back in for two an opportunity for the and one here to increase the lead for the Hurricanes Miami has four of its players in double figures so far today Joe Bay nearing his personal best thats six he has scored eight in the game and the canes an eight nothing run to take the threeoh lead or threepoint lead Darren Green out Jamir Watkins back on the floor averaging over 15 points per game the top score this season for Florida State Jaylen gainy also in the grad transfer from Brown University Chandler Jackson Off The bouns by the way omir I think to 13 rebounds in counting now I was expecting for you to have the number necessary for him to get to averaging 10 I mean again you know normally dou fresh would have that thats a great point I didnt bring my a game today clearly Cory now heres the problem with that scrum Samir Watkins grabbing at that left hand left wrist area after getting on the floor for the loose ball as you see does a great job getting the deflection but whenever you get mixed up with NORAD oir it could hurt and that time with loins going to the floor continues to favor that left hand going to have to keep an eye on that as we move on well they go right to him it was his non shooting hand and wrist Spears loses his footing in about the same spot we had somebody go down in the first half it goes out of bounds after ping ponging off of a couple of legs Florida state will keep with 13 on the shot clock pass intended for B Bowen but it was sniffed out by omir and the call on the floor is that it be Florida State basketball but M making it very difficult for Florida State to have any level of comfort under the basket difficult getting the basketball in bounds 10 on the shot clock Spears off the shot fake able to score over Cleveland Primo Spears is a young man that can get it going in a hurry we mentioned hes a double figure score coming off the bench for the seol who at one point pretty much owned the Sixth Man of the Year award as Watkins comes up with the steal out of bounds Spears was on the sideline when he received the pass Primo Spears a candidate for the accs Sixth Man of the Year we averaging over 10 points per game getting into his bag gets the bucket but the turnover stepping on the sideline with an opport for Florida State to regain the lead Cleveland bottled up and then denied by what I really like the way B Bowen has approached this game in another strong contest with a offensive rebound pass a little too fast and through the hands of Cleveland and back to Florida State noad omir looking at Matthew Cleveland patting his chest saying thats my fault thats my fault love that from a teammate because it actually wasnt his fault in a tough situation delivers the basketball and it wasnt the best pass he could have made but definitely a catchable pass for Matthew Cleveland Jaylen warley back out cam corn as well on the floor the nles with Spears B Bowen and Watkins and now warley out of Westtown the Westtown School in Philadelphia Watkins attacks and he is foued by Michael noo The Freshman from Toronto and well have more free throws up coming for the SE now you talked about me coming to your region West hwn is not in Philadelphia okay there you go there you go right okay all right you said outside of Philadelphia so you know okay we got to do a geography test yeah were going to do it for the 39th year champ week continues tomorrow with three women title games on ESPN of the a the ACC Championship game is at one Eastern followed by the SEC Championship game then the Pack 12 championship game caps the afternoon what a day with so many teams crowned and turny Applause bound Watkins the free throw picks up in the back court defensively omir the turnaround little strong grabbed by Jaylen warley now Florida State keeping Miami to one and done on the their defensive glass and now getting the second chance opportunity of their own had 12 in the first half but its been Miami dominating their offensive glass here in the second the lead hes got Florida State on too spear makes it 5956 and Leonard Hamilton opting to go with both his point guards on the floor Primo Spears as well as warley which freeze up Spears to be more of a score Cleveland even though he didnt make the shot om and George did a great job to get a good shot for him another rebound for nadir and here comes kesan George throw it toward the rim and wapo says I cant go up and get it anymore but I can catch it and put it in wga does not have the balance if hes healthy now hes finding different ways to dunk that With His Head Above the Rim but playing on that gimpy ankle makes the smart play just lays it up gets the two points to make it a onepoint game Waton foul omir with the personal day in ACC tournament as far far as the seatings are concerned so much left to be determined Florida state with a win goes into that nine seed to play Virginia Tech who is already 10 and 10 in ACC play Florida State trying to get to the same however Miami not going to allow that to be easy going down the stretch would you take Duke and Carolina or the field to win it all without much thought Im going to go with Duke Carolina in comparison to the field I think that those two teams specifically North Carolina has been better than everyone else throughout the ACC season but I think its because of their defense and again when you can rely on your defense on each and every night that always gives you an opportunity to be successful Bley Joseph able to get a paint touch but then the ball bounces away from W popper back to Florida State so if not the Blue Devils or the T heels who would you say would be the next team up the Clemson Tigers okay and the reason being I believe they have enough confidence for the big wins that theyve had throughout this season if theyre able to get to that fourth double bu which of course they got to get a win at Wake Forest today to be able to do so if they get to that that would be the team that would be my sleeper to cut down the Nets in Washington DC this years ACC tournament Jaylen warley is a Philly kid hes got Vivid memories of the Finley Recreation Center growing up just like Will Chamberlain Kobe Bryant others in front of them hone their game at Finley and now here he is as a junior at Florida State University trying to help the seminal to win their regular season finale has handled the basketball extremely well throughout this game seven points hes averaging six assists in his career versus Miami but yet no turnovers in this game which brings me to my trivia question for you dou FR all right you bought up the fact that jayen warley went to West hwn School which happens to be an hour drive from Philadelphia outside we wont talk about oh wait a minute there we go head to career high with threepointers had to pause to see Darren Green Jr tie his career high eight threepoint field goals before we continue with trivia and Darren Green now with 24 ties his season high as norads able to get the bucket to go in the paint all right give me the trivia what Westtown School alone won a n forgive me won an ACC Championship and also hit a game winner here against the Florida state s oh its too easy I gave you way too many hits whos the other kid out of West Westtown School in the NBA Derek like come on stop it but I tell you what the one young man from the Westtown School Zen warley getting to his business attacking the paint once again takes the contact finishes and now an opportunity to get into double digits for warley as he gets it a free throw line and this by the way Cory is their largest lead of the ball game largest lead for either side as its been nip and Tuck throughout you kind of glossed over my correct answer real fast I didnt get enough credit for coming up its because I gave you way too many hints but I think the Westtown talk has inspired Jaylen warley who is getting busy here making the free throw now FL has an opportunity to set up pressure trying to force another turnover as you mentioned they extend the lead to eight which is the largest lead of the day for either team George and Joseph with Cleveland around the perimeter Bley Joseph just continues to produce for the hurricane but he is attacking the switch in the way that you should Baba Miller for his talented as he is hes going to have difficulty trying to keep Bley Joseph out of the paint and benley doing a great job of not playing with the basketball nothing side to side north south getting to the rim and finish cam corn back to green being hounded by Wugga Poler Cleveland got a hand of the pass Florida State tries to keep but its the former n who comes up with it back to Cleveland with a full head of speed missed the layup to the Delight of the fans here at the tck I was with the fan in the Strand saying attack the rim to jayen warley who has had so much success he gave up an opportunity right there to get downhill once again and put pressure on Miamis defense omir on the reverse he saw Baba Miller coming and got away from him for the layup yeah North shadow is a problem when he catches the basketball on the Block especially when you got a smaller gu defending him you got to get help there as soon as possible and the help did not get there soon enough up to the rim and throw down theth dunk of the game by cam Corin the sophore from Allen but you please make sure to give JY his credit for creating that play that was a that was a settle shot from Bley Joseph you cant tired doing the right thing getting into the painted area with Baba Miller guarding Corin steps out on rebound kicks out of bounds back to Miami thees will have it down when we come back NORAD the wire Florida state with a Sixpoint lead over its rival Miami with Cory Alexander Im Doug Sherman and the noes on defense after giving it back to Miami Paul Joe B back onto the floor for Jim Lena number 10 in Black by the way North shadir with another double double near turnover it is a turnover warley to Watkins to give it up but it goes through the hands of Darren Green J and out of bounds Opportunity by Florida State lets mark that 328 remaining you got a chance to make it an eightpoint game once again you come up with a turnover but you do not take advantage of it just a little too much sauce on that one slips out of the hand of Darren Green Jr who should have had an easy layup Joseph creates space goes to the right hand has it trickle off the iron Applause though Watkins dribbles up Florida State again with another opportunity to stretch the lead back to eight once again youve got the mismatch take advantage of it good but a by Cory and a great pass by jir Watkins once he sees the double coming whips it across to cam corn whos able to finish once again around the rim very efficient game offensively for Cameron K yeah last five games hes been aaging about 15 points per including a career high last time out against Pittsburgh Cleveland with a big shot for the hurricanes Matthew Cleveland has been aggressive throughout this game and of course what would you expect he playing against guys hes practiced against for the last two seasons and very comfortable playing against understands the nuances of each and every one of them timeout called here at the Tucker Center fugh this is a great job defensively as he goes straight up and then blocks the shot Im okay with the foul call though I am okay with the foul call because when you look at one angle omir does have his hand on Jaylen wys back as hes trying to attack the basket but give Jaylen Wy a lot of credit hes been very aggressive this Florida State team did not shoot a free throw in the first half of this game and now theyre seven of 10 from the line Jaylen woy three of in his own makes a pair to once again run the lead to eight matching the largest of the night for the SE foul called against the seol and against cam Corin trying to stay in front of Matthew Cleveland his second and just the third against the nolles here in the second half so a non shooting foul will give it to the hurricanes on the sideline Cleveland left it short and the ACC leader in doues with his 16th rebound and the throw down Im still wondering when youre going to tell me how many rebounds he needs to be able to get back to averaging 10 but well my guy Kurt sitting to my left gave it to me and said he needs 20 so I was waiting for him to get to 20 okay to get that average up to double figures and so youre certain that hes going to get to 20 no Im not well this one should count for two when you go get offensive rebound and put it back and to finish like that it definitely counts with two points but there should be a style Point added for that one as North Shadow comes up with the tip slam and so warley back to the line where he just made a pair his dads Godfather Will Chamberlain great Philly family New Orleans trivia question after the promo and after another switch by warley and here is said promo our star started NBA Saturday Prime Time game on ABC in the ESPN app should be a great one between Jaylen Brown of the Celtics and KD and the Suns our coverage tips with NBA Countdown 8 Eastern five Pacific as warley misses the second Cory Celtics actually losing two straight going into that game big game tonight a whistle comes in what looked like could have been a clean steal Watkins and warley converged and took the ball away from Joseph but the foul was called not a popular call here in the building however they will not be free throws so as we have time my trivia question to you very quickly as we look at the foul jir Watkins coming in and I can understand why the crowd here not happy however there was contact forcing benley Joseph to lose that basketball quick trivia what school did will chamberling go to gotta Cleveland has it taken away and then the foul will send Florida State down to the other end the Hurricanes running the risk of losing their ninth straight game heading into the ACC tournament not a season Jim Lena and the canes fans coming off the final four ever imagined would happen but Jim Lena also understood that he had a lot of young Talent on this roster if you think about not only Losing Isaiah Wong the ACC Player of the Year and all ACC performer Jordan Miller who I thought should have been the ACC player of the year last year you also lost Harlem Beverly and Anthony Walker Off the Bench youre talking about guys who have been in the program for Jordan Miller only two years but the other four have been other three guys have been there for four years and thats the leaders that Jim Lena has not had amongst his team this year for a player Le team that he had a season ago that helped him advance to his second career final four yeah of course he took George Mason to the final four in 2006 before taking the canes there a year ago it has been close throughout until now this is by far the biggest lead one way or the other the seol have stretched it out to a ninepoint lead but the canes have not been able to take advantage of turnovers and missed opport on one end for Florida State and that has been the difference for Miami down the stretch they have not been able especially to take care of mised like when Florida State got out on the break turned it over but Miami did not make them pay for that turnover and while were in a break that would be Overbrook High School oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah now oh yeah which is also also the uh famous School of one huge movie star rapper and also another NBA champion who happened to be my teammate Eve no Im just thinking of Philly Will Smith oh yeah yes over Brook High School and Malik Rose Ill still take Eve over those shes smooth Cleveland tough hes got a chance for a threepoint play that is a tough bucket Matthew Cleveland getting downhill playing with conviction was not going to be denied on that opportunity getting to the rim off the catch attacks Boba Miller and gets his body into Miller taking away Baba Millers any ability to be able to go up and block that Applause shot holds at seven for Florida State but Miami able to set up that pressure even off of the Miss free throw Miller in trouble and the foul is called Cleveland and Joseph look at each other say did I get him did you get him it goes against number four in Black Bley Joseph Jim Lena out near half court questioning it and so Miller at the line for two the 71st annual ACC Mens Basketball Tournament begins Tuesday afternoon at Capitol One arena in Washington DC and well have all three first round games for you on acc Network and the ESPN app we will see the hurricanes and if this score holds up we probably wont see or we wont see the seol they with a win today will secure a first round by and thats why we go back to the question asked to coach Tom Ken as well as Coach Josh passner earlier why I feel like the simal would have a better chance of winning the tournament based on the fact that they would only have to play four games as Bley Joseph keeps it keeps the door open here still lots of time just under a minute to go kanes go for the Trap its kicked out of bounds and before we go off air let me make sure I give some love to the officials Ron gr of course Mark nerve done a great job here but how about my guy Trey San son of Ry Sans doing ACC games now so weve got a fatherson combination calling ACC games it doesnt get any better than that wonder if they can do the same game yeah why not hey why not there a lot of rules for officials that you nor I know about it you could see he got a full head of steam with an open alley on the right side and it was going to finish with some Thunder but when youre pressuring often times you have to give up something this time the Hurricanes gave up any protection at the rim and jir Watkins recognizing theres no one back there to stop him from the Highlight finish that we could possibly see on Sports Center top 10 this evening another one of those Philly area guys hes from across the state line in Trenton played at Trenton Catholic big Eagles fan he was football player you could see him being the wide receiver that he was as a kid now is Trenton South Jersey or Central Jersey well it Camden is South Jersey right it depends on who you talk to and it depends on where you are in the state of New Jersey okay Camden is Philly area South Jersey Trenton I think is Central Jersey geographically you are correct but people from North Jersey would call it South Jersey no no no no its like Ive taught you many times Upstate New York has a lot of different definitions depending on where you are same thing in New Jersey okay Im not sure Philly area will call Trenton well they they will talk Camden yes Im not sure they take Trenton I think theyre more you know we talking about that hes a Philadelphia Eagles fan I think people from Trenton more identify with Philly than they do New York City oh so thats how you gather that yeah okay I think youre wrong again and not just because of that thats just my opinion but because Ive spent an awful lot of time in the Garden State have you yes I have actually North Central and South Jersey all right final 4 41 seconds unless we have overtime of the regular season for the seol and the Hurricanes but dont discount Miami in their ability to shoot the three Bley Joseph just knocked down one and for Florida State its more important knock the foul and give them extra opportunities and stop the clock there goes Joseph going to work again for two more 358 on the clock Spears pass to Watkins near midt gets around om and now theyre going to have to give the foul after8 seconds went off the clock they couldnt Force the turnover down six they give up the foul and will send Florida State to the line jir Watkins playing what could be his last game here with the Florida state seol because of course he is a draft prospect a young man who could test the waters the che for Max Thorp another one of the Green Team WalkOns who was on the a sweet 16 team four years ago he didnt get the start in todays game that went to Isaac Spain hour but Max Thorp is going to be given the opportunity to finish this game well I do believe they are cheering for Max dor however I believe the cheer actually for Darren Green Jr who walks off the court for the last time for the Florida state seminal after knocking down and tying a career high eight threepoint field goals here in the Last Dance well you can be wrong again because cheering started when he got up off the bench before Watkins was heading out and then it mored into cheering for okay and now he gives it up because the shot clock is off and then a timeout is called by coach ham to get more of the guys from the bench Spain hour back into the game were GNA have Jason Simpson the younger brother of Scotty Barnes coming into play Jessie Jones a junior from Claremont Florida and schola atabc another one of those seven players who were recognized pregame here on senior night and nothing better than getting your guys from the Green Team an opportunity to be in the game against the inate Applause Rival in your regular season finale Thor puts it up I gave him credit for trying absolutely but in this final game of the regular season the seals continue to dominate this rivalry 112 of the last 13 Im not sure you can call it a rivalry until Miami starts getting
