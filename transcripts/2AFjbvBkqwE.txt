can drain it final nonconference game for both of these teams an opportunity to go into the Christmas break with a win our officials Bill cing to Jr AJ Desai and Tony morresy we are underway in Raleigh and its Ryder that starts with the basketball NC State defending in white this is a bronx team and Paul said in all four of their wins this season have come on the road battle tested a tough schedule so they will be undaunted today against the reigning ACC Champs shot clock already down to four pull up pop contested look falls off the rim no good they take it the wolf pack starting Applause five guard heavy lineup middle Brooks The Lone big man and hes double teamed and who forces a travel so doubling that post paying off on the opening possession for Ryder and Ryder worked on that this morning at the shoo round when the ball goes into the low post youre going to see Ryder double the post rotate from the weak side Play Zone and behind that was a good first defensive possession for Ryder this is the Bronx starting five Cole MCC The Freshman from IMG Academy making his first Collegiate start this afternoon Alvarez picks up his dribble finds MC trying to ignite this Rider offense that is Fallen around a six game losing streak trying to snap that here on the road and Riley thats a good start count it plus the foul for TJ weeks Jr told you TJ weeks Jr an aggressive mindset wants to go to the basket if he cant go to the basket hes going to shoot the threepoint shot look how low he is he gets down pulls up lefthander has really a sweep touch thats a tough shot because hes going to his right and hes shooting it with his left thats the guy for Ryder in this game so if youre NC State you got to limit his touches and you got to help when he puts it on the deck little bit of pressure right here by Ryder completes the end one they go back inside to Middle Brooks tough take gets it to go and he was tough against Kansas been middle Brooks big strong physical post starting to shoot it a little bit from the outside but Ill tell you what 15 feet and in hes got great hands and good footwork yeah 14 points and eight rebounds at Allen Fieldhouse going against Hunter Dickinson aint too bad theyre going to see Ryder work for good shots they dont want to take quick bad shots because thats the quickest way to lose a game good look from three goes begging Zion Cruz couldnt connect nice job by Ryder getting back in transition defense the Marcus Hill takes it right to the rim contested no good inside McCabe fresman finds a wide open no good Ruben Rodriguez couldnt connect Tangled Up and oconnell steals it away three on two for the wolf pack up ahead and a foul call Applause our two head coaches tonight keys of the game according to our coach Paul being cage well number one set the tone if youre NC State theyre trying to do that on the defensive end but they must run run run you see fast break points thats where NC State is best on the offensive end is scoring in transition and if youre Rider you need the the three Ts in my opinion you got to limit your turnovers you got to get back defensive transition and control the tempo of the game and also threepoint success Ryder has to win the threepoint shooting game against NC State the officials are over at the monitor taking a look at if this is a goal or not lets take a look at this drive to the basket it hits the backboard does it get over the rim I dont know if thats on the way Music down call on the floor is confirmed basket is good one shot they called the basket good on the floor they stayed with the call yep whatever they called on the floor I think they had to stick with given the angle that we just saw not enough evidence either way so an and one opportunity for J aen Taylor in part of last years Final 14 you thought with DJ horn moving on maybe Taylor would be the guy to step up and theyve yet to see it on a consistent basis 11 games into this season Alvarez weaving through traffic I see the tempo by Ryder a hard push to try to get something quick if not theyre going to set it up space it out work the clock and keep NC State on defense as long as possible until they see something thats wide open like that a tough take by Cruz well defended and a foul called on the ensuing rebound and thats why I think the three ts are so important you have to limit your turnovers especially the live ball turnovers transition defense is vital when you play NC State and I like the way Ryder is trying to change the tempo of this game its not going to be straight one way its a little soft pressure its a little bit of running and then they take their time to set up offense now you see Ryder slipping into his Applause own coach trying everything for this game before Christmas yeah you pull out all the bag of tricks see where the double comes this time its straight up no they dug it out the middle bricks Brooks Off the Mark just a little dig out by Ryder change that shot upping the tempo coming up empty though theyve struggled at The Rim against State its a bigger just one of seven from the floor middle Brooks inside a great start to this game he has four of State six but you see the physicality by 34 in the white Ben Middlebrooks the strength to put his body into the defender concentration to finish and thats where the wolf pack have the clear Advantage when you look at these teams that Ryder doesnt have a guy like Ben mid Brooks inside and most teams in the Matt conference not you know quinc Marist St Peters their post guys are 66 stolen away OK Connell Off to the Races the scoop and the score thats the energy that NC State needs to get the crowd into the game8 nothing run for NC State timeout Rider Ben Middlebrooks in the pick and roll screen roll pocket pass bump and finish stay up Music Applause Music five all eight wolf pack points have come in the paint lets take a look at Ryder Paul talk about a brutal nonconference schedule theyve only had two home nonconference game to see UCLA Iowa Villanova all on the road but they are Road Warriors here again in Raleigh scoop to the hoop Falls for Zion Cruz to end an 8 nothing wolf pack run and in those four wins its been their defense Rider theyve held opponents to 63 points per game theyve held them to under 30 from three and they shot the ball at 35 in their four wins so its been the defense and a little bit of good shooting obviously when you play the schools like Iowa and Villanova the competition changes and your defense doesnt look as good as it does against other teams but Ill tell you what theres a sense of toughness on this team to win on the road yeah those four Road wins tied for the most in the country trying to make it five against NC State wont come easy Brion pass off the window and in thats going to pay off when they get conference play coach baggot told us look were going to be fine once we get to our conference they got to play a lot of what we like to call money games and a lot of them have come during this losing streak a bronx team that started the season 4 two but now has lost six in a row trying to avoid a seven straight loss against NC State yeah good contest by state on weeks Jr You got to have a hand up when he shoots at 35 in a red Dennis Parker Jr into the game and into the box score for two Dennis Parker Jr had some really good moments last year for NC State and then as the season goes on you have to shorten your rotation you didnt get a chance to play as much has some nagging injuries but he brings athleticism and scoring to the wolf pack number 11 on the ball right now called for the foul there Dennis Parker Jr you still finding his footing this season you mentioned the nagging injuries three sprained ankles in three weeks for him yeah that one looked really confident the catch the swipe the hard drive and he squares up at the end to finish thats a player that Kevin Keats has a plan for over in the course of time he told us Kevin Keats about Parker Jr today he iss a guy that needs time in a gym practice time well eight days off between their last game Kansas to now finally feeling healthy after the sprained ankle injury set him back an opportunity to really get into a rhythm yeah some guys can not have a lot of practice time and still play well other guys need practice time to get their Rhythm and timing shot clock down to two the Ryder comes up clutch there Reuben rodri RZ the sophomore knocks it down that could be a great sign for Ryder because he struggled shooting the ball this year hes still trying to find the balance of facilitating and scoring as the point guard Ryder back into their zone defense they have changed their defense multiple times already in the first half feels like every other possession theyre giving NC State a different look you have to keep a better team off balance you cant give a a team thats better than you or more talented than you a steady diet of one defense unless youre exceptional at that defense nice back cut TJ weeks junor lines up a three cant connect in perfect position for the fou flying in Jay Alvarez to make it a threepoint game love that 45 de cut on the jump shot guys are being taught that right now when the shot goes up flying from the 45° angle up in the slot try to get the offensive rebound good job by Applause Applause rival good look and its buried immediate answer by NC State Kevin Keats worked on his zone offense for half the shoot around this morning knowing that Ryder had some zone defense in their package nice job screening the top penetration and kick and after Ryder had cut it to three its back to six point lead for NC State stolen away Brandon Huntley Hatfield hammered in a hard foul the officials quickly come in and give the flagrant Applause sign Brandon Huntley Hatfield going straight to the rack hes going strong Defender with his hand straight up lets see what the defender does he jumps straight up and at the end yes he fouls he comes down and Huntley Hadfield thats a clean foul if theres such a thing as a clean foul well the officials disagreed with you they immediately gave the flagrant sign so they would they would say its not a clean foul well I understand that offensive players Airborne if its unnecessary contact theyre going to call Hunley Hatfield at 61 240 lb and the ball out of bounds Brandon Huntley Hatfield cant connect on the first I think what the officiating crew was telling us in the break there was it doesnt matter that Hundley Hatfield is okay its good that hes okay right we didnt know what the result was going to be when that excessive contact happens to an Airborne player and without knowing intent cuz you never know intent you could just see that he was trying to stop him from going to the basket but it ended up F1 now they go right back inside to Huntley Hadfield good call by Kevin Keats to get the ball back inside Im telling you what Brandon Huntley Hatfield can be the ex factor for NC State this year is talented big strong and hes experienced in the game the wolf pack at 12 of their 18 points coming in the paint taking advantage of their size and they doubling up Rider largest lead of the game defense has been Relentless shot clock under five again and Ryder has just struggled to get any flow shot clocks been feels like five four three all their possessions for Kevin dag its team whats going to have to happen if youre Rider if you cant run offense and cant back cut it and cant screen it going to have to put on the deck and go by them Jaden Taylor knocks down the Applause triple and Kevin bagit arguing with the officiating crew Applause that and the official is exchanging words with Kevin bagot and hes been issued a technical foul so more free throws coming for EDC State they have a flagrant foul against Ryder and now Kevin baget the head coach called for a te that doesnt help you when youre already playing a team that on paper has more Talent than you youre giving him extra opportunities from the foul line yeah he might have been still upset about that F1 call didnt get a call down this end NC State came down in transition knocked down the shot bager trying to get a few more points in before the next possession two time Matt coach of the year NC State on a seven nothing run in the last 55 seconds yeah their defense is really extended you have to back cut it or back screen it or eventually just put it on the deck you cannot run offense against a team that is up chest to good cut that time you got to cut it to loosen it up shot clock down to five again and now youre in a bad shot quality situation heaving a three way off the Mark Credit NC States defense theyve been dialed in in this first half and they need to they they need to take this game seriously because it is a game as we talked about in the open its somewhat of a track game we saw American take Virginia right down to the wire you got Christmas break start starting at 605 tonight as soon as this game over over and and then you have conference play coming up you just came off for 5 days of practice and some days off you lost to Kansas probably feels like a couple of weeks ago so lot going on right now at this time of the year for college basketball you have to be dialed in and Kevin Keats was dialed in this morning at shoot around he was who was the Grinch this yeah he was going hard yeah he he was hard on the guys this morning from the very beginning of shooting around to the very end didnt see him smile didnt talk to us I said Kevin youre like the Grinch he goes this game is going to be a tough game and it is yeah he said until 600 until this game is over hes got to ride these guys because you want to go into that holiday break with a win you know and then you can really come back and focus on acc play he said look after at 6 o00 today one teams going to win one teams going to lose I know how I want to spend my Christmas with a win and its a 9 nothing run for Kevin kes team and theyve done it really the backbone of this first half has been incredible defensive effort and and thats what theyre best at this year right now they struggle to score at times especially against the the power Conference teams but this manto man defense has been stifling the rer guards of Ruben Rodriguez and Flash Burton yet to get going you cant go east and west you have to go north and south sh loock down to one pull up pop Cruz nothing but the bottom of the net desperately needed for Ryder Zion Cruz has been in the game for a while hes battle tested the Paul transfer understands what its like to get pressure hes a former ESPN 100 guy and I was about to get to that 2022 so talent and experience for Zion Cruz nice job by our Graphics Department oh nice strip Jay Alvarez digging it out three on two for Ryder up ahead Cruz everything but the Finish re attacks and draws the foul so Zion Cruz will have two coming at the free throw line what Zion Cruz comes off the ball screen pulls up thats a long two but he sees the drop coverage so he knows he cant get to the basket so when the defense starts the back up thats when you pull up take your jump shot good read by Cruz Cruz coming off a career high 16 points two nights ago against Penn you know this is a team that needs a a player to step up and be that consistent scorer I I would think just based off the pedigree Cruz would be the guy yeah its Cruz its TJ weeks Jr came from UMass outside shooter I think those two guys for Ryder are going to carry the bulk of the offensive end this season for Ryder and they need to score 25 to 30 points in this game combined Parker junr almost ripped the rim off creativity oh so crafty Marcus Hill acrobatic we know Marcus Hill can get to the C only shooting 28 from three right now oh nice Ste midd Brooks us the long arms and hes fouled on his way to the rim weve talked about the NC State manto man defense and they are overplaying every pass they are pressuring every time Ryder puts the ball in the deck Ryder has to loosen that up with a back cut or a back screen Ben middle Brooks was denying at the top of the key and got that still hey we are more than 10 minutes into this game and I cant think of one single Rider possession that has come easy no when they get into the paint they have a difficult time scoring against the size and strength of NC State theyve been down to 5 seconds or less in shot clock situations this is when you know your team is dialed in theyre locked in is how they play defense its its the energy that they bring to the game and the multiple efforts they possess on the defensive ENT right now if youre Kevin Keats youre extremely happy with the defense and the focus Andre young into the game has it here off to the Freshman M TJ weeks Jr and they cant get anything going right now the Bronx another turnover thats six in this first half every time Ryder tries to make a pass its pressure Hill splits two count it plus the foul Marcus Hill the Bowling Green transfer starting to heat up and thats where NC State is best on offense this is Fast Break basketball they inbound it they push it one or two dribbles Hill right to the cup Marcus Hill splits two great concentration of finish seems like Ryder is getting worn down a little bit in the first half but the fast break opportunities for NC State thats their bread and butter that is their bread and butter on the offensive end getting points from turnovers and getting fast break opportunities when teams miss the wolf pack on a 152 run to blow this game wide open in the first half and the defense continue suffocating up ahead NC State turning defense into offense Bryce herd the freshman with an easy finish and over the last four minutes NC state has taken this game over a 17 two run try to get to the basket if youre right or create contact get to the free throw line do something aggressive against that aggressive defense dont settle for shots take a charge if you have to shot clck down to three and its another turnover Applause NC State dialed in defensively and it is all wolf pack in this first half a 32 11 lead for NC State in the ACC from defense to offense and they are shooting 75 from the floor 12 makes off 10 assists good defense good offense everything you would want to see headed into the Christmas break if youre an NC State fan good look here falls off the rim no good from Marcus Hill NC State when it comes to defense behind the arc opponents are only getting 29 thats top 10 in the nation Kevin KS makes it an emphasis to run guys off the threepoint line right now Ryder 0 for five from distance and you know thats thats one of the recipes for the upset double figure threes get near double figure threes are over it you got a great chance to pull off the upset especially on the road right now they cant get a clean look they might not even get 10 threepoint attempts the way NC States been running them off the line contested deep to no good Ryder has gone 3 minutes and 30 seconds without scoring and over the last 6 minutes MC State on a 202 run Dennis Parker Jr whos in the game gives him some good energy and length on the defensive end pressure by Marcus Hill Michael oconnell on the ball has been terrific in the first Applause Music half heres Tyreek Ingram hes got the one ACC body on the team originally recruited to Wake Forest draws the foul now you can get that if youre Rider because the defense is so extended by NC State its going to allow a postfeed well Ben Middlebrooks has his hand in there but Ingram almost with a extended arm yeah after the foul was CAU that could have been a dead ball technical foul looks like hes bleeding a little bit under his Music chin Kevin Keats gets the officiating crew to at least take a look at it so while they look at that we remind you that ACC play picks up on New Years Eve right here on acc Network Notre Dame Tak it on Georgia and then Cooper flag and Duke hosting Virginia Tech at Cameron indor the officials are going to review that last play and when you think about how theyre calling college basketball its above the head theres e e e after review we have a common foul against 34 white followed by dead ball contact technical on 33 red two shots for SC State ball on the end line 30 second shot clock res so that is a very important phrasing of that dead ball technical is not a flagrant so Tyreek Ingram stays in this game it is his third foul though yes the foul on middle Brooks first you got the foul on Middlebrooks right there theres the foul dead ball technical foul on Ingram but not a flager not a Applause flagrant Bonnell still gets two from the line now its interesting with Michael oconnell nice to see him knock both of those out before those shots only shooting 52 from the foul line his career average 72 he has been struggling Michael ell when it comes to shooting free throws and making shots but youre right Jay the phrase of dead ball technical foul which means they didnt upgrade it to something where they thought it was excessive or unnecessary thought that was a good piece of officiating a 222 run for NC State this game is blown wide open you just want to manage this if youre Rider right now can you get some stops consecutive stops and turn those into scores good defense right here shot clocks at five thats been maybe their best possession defensively in a while for r a wolf pack shooting 70 from the floor that way off the mark from Dennis Parker Jr now you got to convert Rodriguez went right to the rim up against some trees came up Applause empty you make the stop you get the push took it strong to the rack now you have possession Baseline out of bounds well they are waiting for Ruben Rodriguez to break out the sophomore is yet to deliver consistently in the scoring Department something he did very well at the high school level hes the alltime leading scorer at reading high school and thats produced some pros Lonnie Walker Danielle Marshall Ste Jackson the name a few and Coach baggs waiting for all those points to transfer to the Collegiate level you know it takes time everybody wants freshman and I know I cover that game for ESPN in the recruiting circles but not all freshman can impact basketball sometimes its its your sophomore year when you start to grow or your junior year when you break out but its going to happen for Rodriguez well nobody has the patience anymore thats the problem both the players and the coaches shot clock down to five again athletic directors too good point come on now what about fans yeah theyve got the least patience of anybody Parker Jr splits two and a foul call so golden opportunity for Ryder think about it they got a stop shot clock under five transition couldnt finish Baseline out of bounds couldnt get to the basket I dont know if theres been anything golden in this first half for Kevin baggot and his team its all its all learning experience look what really matters for them is what they do in conference play but youre trying to build habit right now to take into the season and and you want to measure up to see how you get exp you get exposed in games like this right you get exposed something gets exposed that you have to address when it comes conference time because other teams are going to try to expose the same thing against and bagot told us its as simple as the team needing the confidence back you start the season 4 and two you get four wins on the road in your first six games you feel really good about your group and then some tougher competition at Villanova at Iowa six game losing streak now you got to go on the road and play the reigning ACC Champions at their place Ill tell you what they came out with good intensity Ryder but it was the intensity of NC State was greater and it took Ryder out of their offense and NC state has scored a bunch of points from their defense and from there its just snowball where Ryder are be scoring drought of more than 5 minutes Rodriguez ends the drought and theyre making tough shots because everything NC State is doing defensively is not allowing ryer into the paint thats a great Point only 13 points but all 13 have not come easy youre sweating on the sideline if youre Rider that the ball goes in contact and the bucket Marcus Hill impressive performance from the Bowling Green transfer this first half yeah well Marcus Hill is a downhill guy he catches that basketball how about the jump up body control and focus to finish it was a big gap he saw it this Sky scored a lot of points at Bowling Green and the other Mack out in the Midwest and he give Kevin he gives Kevin Keats a pain toucher a guy who will be aggressive when the offense bogs down his jump shots got to come around though only 28 from distance so hes got to look to catch and shoot a little bit more versus catch and drive a hill lead all scorers with eight hes had to play some big minutes maybe more minutes than they anticipated when they brought him in because of the injury to Mike James yeah Mike James is a another a former ESPN top 100 Prospect really talented young man out of the state of Florida 66 aggressive and strong he would have been a great addition this year for Kevin Keats that injury is probably going to keep him up till next season yeah we havent had official word on that but it seems to be lingering it was originally reported just 3 to four weeks and he is still on the sideline as we head to the new Applause year and yet Kevin Keats told us Mike James is still the leader of this team he said who Whos Your Leader whos your most vocal guy he said Mike James and he may be the hardest worker when he gets the practice this guy here plays all out all the time caught in between a guard and a small forward could be their best defender offensively he makes open shots but hes that aggressive postup type of guy he brings great energy to practice and to the defensive end and theres really nothing you can do when you look at a guy and say how you feeling and he goes somethings still not right I Im not where I need to be before I get on the floor and you cant rush injuries right you cannot Rush an injury its better to come back two weeks too late than one day too early because if you come back early you may have to go through the whole process again this is the guy right here forc state in my opinion H Hatfield kicks it out Taylor knocks down a triple how about the pass Big Time shot but Huntley Hatfield in the middle at 69 with the awareness to make the pass to the corner I think he is such an ex factor for NC State every everything going down for the wolf pack Hunley Hatfield cant get his hes got three on him beautiful kick to the corner Jaden Taylor a triple full headers right here on acc Network our first lineup you dont want to miss it Hannah hadalo at Notre Dame taking on Virginia tipping things off at noon Eastern and then three games to follow all day basketball Sundays ACC womens hoops right here on acc Network how about the ACC six ranked teams on the womens side its going to be a fun fun watch as we get ready for some conference action West Moors NC State wolf pack beat James Madison 12 game winning streak right now for the womens team theyre one of those six ranked teams yes coming off a final four appearance of their own what a game last night between USC and Yukon on the womens side both of these teams could use some of those Shooters absolutely Paige Beckers J Drew Watkins there is so much talent Ill tell you what that game was so exciting last night it went up and down shots execution intensity and USC Le scores Connecticut with a win I I think you could see those two teams meet again in March absolutely some where lead eight Applause forish so whats most impressive about NC State in this first half theyre up 4216 and Dantes Styles one of their leading scorers has zero well they havent needed them in this game Ill tell you the stat even though the stats right now are blown out of proportion when I see the 11 assists on 14 field goals thats what Im looking for State more ball movement more assist they did that against Texas they had 15 assists on 24 made field goals thats thats 60 assist rate but a lot of games they havent had the assist numbers that they needed especially against Purdue and Kansas when you were coaching What were what was your target you want to hit at least 50 yeah if you can thats a high number to hit but thats the number I want to hit so you have Michael oconnell who really sets the tone in that department one of the best in the country assist to turnover r sh he has four assists tonight and no turnover so this is proving the point perfectly little stat on Michael oconor when he has three assist or more during his time here at NC State they like 26 and five when he has three assists or more I felt like when he got inserted into the starting lineup last season NC State hit that that different gear now did anybody think they were going to win the ACC and go to a final four no but okell definitely raised the level of the players around him when you share the ball everybody gets involved the guys want to touch the basketball they dont want to watch somebody else dribble it all the time Michael okono is a great passer very unselfish hes an excellent decision maker nice take Marcus H continues to fill it up hes got 10 in his first half when I watch him I think about a guy whos at the top of a hill going downhill as we like to say with the ball in his hands he just continues to try to find his way to the basket Marcus downhill Im telling you he can promote that nil a deep three which is all Riders had to settle for in this first half a lot of contested looks from far away from the basket Alvarez trying to get something in transition got to get it out for a quick three now thats a good look weeks J knocks it down best look of the night and TJ weeks Jr converts its just so hard for Ryder to score inside against the physicality and size of NC State so what do you do you throw it out you make the extra pass okell pull up pop too much on it and a foul called on the ensuing rebound watch Ryder right here they cant score they get it out but then they make the extra pass because they recognize that TJ weeks Jr is standing in the left slot all by himself no player can move faster than the basketball on a close out thats good ball reversal by Ryder TJ weeks Jr a great story for how Ryder recruited him sixth year senior and have been playing college B basketball for a long time now all the way back in 2019 he was a freshman for um hit a career high 63s against Rider so when they saw his name in the portal theyre like hold on a second we know that guy its Dad Tyrone played it UMass in the 9s you play your BC teams play BC teams played against UMass they had Dana dle Dante Bri Marcus candy Jeff whos on staff for Ryder a great relationship with Tyrone reeks then the transfer Applause happen they got to set some hard screens Ridder like really screen hard even if you got to take a Applause foul down the lane off the window no good his brother Tyreek weeks digs it out kept The Possession alive but comes up empty here steam Marcus down hill passes out and its Brion pass who connects on a triple and NC state has put up 50 in this first half how many 5 z pass is more than capable shooter he comes off the bench to State just gives them solid minutes but Brion pass hes a unicorn in todays college basketball hes going to graduate in the spring four years at one school up ahead Huntley half field running the Applause floor coach Kevin baget looking down his bench looking for some answers you know it became a little bit of a toughness Factor as well in the first half NC State composed their toughness on Ryder Ryder really hasnt responded to that toughness on the offensive End by being aggressive there you go there you go that thats how you score against pressure you either back screen it back cut it or attack it but you cant dribble the ball East and West you have to go north and Music Applause south the bright spots of possession like that one few and far between in this first half for Ryder 10 seconds left in it Cross Court pass no good from Marcus Hill and NC State goes into halftime with a near 30o lead this is the most points scored in a half this season for Kevin ke relax you could lose that game so what you want to team for 20 minutes and go on Christmas break I was going to say easier said than done when you know whats coming your way which is some days at home and a Christmas break for a team here you go redot another assisted basket see the ball is moving for NC State this afternoon when theyre not in transition not a lot of guys over dribbling the balls not sticking Quick Pass that time Taylor with the knockdown and he leads all scorers with 14 see these are highlights that you can show when you get into ACC play fellas look at the way we played in this game look at the way the ball moved oconnell gave up the three and then draws the foul I know this score is Big right now but Kevin Keats this morning at Sho around he was concerned about this game knowing that it was Christmas break conference coming up 7Day layoff you can come out flat or you can come out and dominate but I think the way we saw Keats attack his shoot around today is a big reason why in state has come out and played so well he he had that scarl on his face look at him hes hes locked in right now cuz hes saying to himself weve got to sustain intensity weve got to continue to build habits on both ends of the floor and hes looking for guys that are going to continue this energy level just play the exact same way you play the game you dont play the score well the defensive intensity is picked up right where it left off everything coming contested shot clock down to seven Ryder has taking the shot clock down to single digits it seems like on every possession nice Jay Alvarez knocks down that jumper you know hard penetration can beat pressure defense but you got to get low you got to be strong with the ball that time a little simple penetration short jump shot lets see if Ryder can get some stops they get one here Zion Cruz rips down the rebound and for Ryder its its okay can we get couple of stops couple of scores can we get some confidence going can we get momentum going in this game thats a foul on oconnell so itll stay Rider ball underneath their hoop OK connells first foul afternoon and look what happened before our game with Virginia and America American took UVA right down to the last 2 minutes well weve been together since 900 this morning and Rider shoot around and you first thing you said to me and you probably said it a dozen times since as a coach you hate this game when everybody knows theyre going home as soon as the final whistle blows yeah everybodys thinking about what flight how they going to get home who they going to visit who they have to call what Christmas presents do I still have to buy and then before you know it you got to come back back 4 days later so these guys have been together for a couple of months right now between practice and games but Ryder is off until January 5th and Kevin bag said regardless of how this game goes today we need a break weve been on the road with each other all season long weve only had two home games in the nonconference some time apart could do this Rider team from good yeah sometimes in a good relationship its its good to spend some time apart you have the nonconference you have the conference schedule and then for for Ryder the most important three days of the year come in March at their conference tournament so it truly is a long season college basketball and he understands that whatever happens today doesnt matter in terms of how theyre going to play in the map and they have a legitimate chance to be here at the top of that you get a good seed going into the tournament as we saw with NC State Anything Can Happen teams get hot they get confident they get on a run yeah for for Ryder no doubt about it thats a one bit League you got to get hot at the right time for NC State theyre looking to play their way into an advantageous spot in the ACC and and we were talking about the conference earlier Paul feels like okay Duke has separated themselves as the top team after that two through 10 11 up for grabs 2 through 17 yeah exactly you think about the ACC Duke should be a lock for the number one spot okay unless injury happens or they fall apart after that I tell me whos number two because I think its Clemson when its all said and done at the end of the season I think theyre the second best team in the conference they give it to you on both ends Pittsburgh always I was going to say Pittsburgh always under cells over delivers the clch she picked up a good win against wake Force Ill give you my Dark Horse SMU theyre at the bottom of the screen oh they crushed my Eagles Ill tell you what they have two experienced guys booy Miller who transferred over from Wake Forest he is quick and explosive Matt cross has been in college basketball a long long time together they scored 38 points combined in that win against BC how about Louisville the job that Pat Kelce is doing they could be the sleeper this year in the ACC its wide after duke it is wide open I wouldnt be shocked if Louisville could get in that middle of the ACC this year again I like pit I like Clemson I dont trust North Carolina just yet theyre like a roller coaster right and I dont like rides that is really beautiful thats beautiful sure a lot of foot traffic this weekend as people are getting ready for Christmas day just a few days away oh great steal Michael oconnell the active hands out of the timeout Kevin Keats came out with full court pressure yeah youd think this game z0 see hes keeping his foot on the gas pedal hard and hes trying to let his guys know hey fellas were not sitting back in the zone were not were doing what we do and what were going to do this year in the ACC and were going to be an aggressive defensive team all season long that thats where they hang their head on the defensive what is on Kevin kes Christmas wish list more wins how do you how do you get those more wins all right first of all he needs better field goal percentage they they got to shoot the ball much better than they do more assists so hes got an early Christmas present right now with more assists because it was a team that did get a lot of assist during the season and better starts they didnt start well against Purdue they didnt start well against Texas they were down n nothing down 15 nothing against Kansas now I know those are power conference top 20 teams but again youre developing habits and they got off to a great start here against Ryder and as you said great start foot on the gas and in terms of assists 15 of NC States 18 made baskets have been assisted yeah they have to shoot the ball better I mean first half they were four for eight from three thats great but theyre 31 from three coming into this game theyll have some practice time before they have Virginia on December 31st shot clock under five once again for Ryder and Jay Alvarez connects on a triple Ryder with a little bit of juice right now little bit of bounce on their defensive stance after that shot sometimes when you score the ball it can really energize your defense middle Brooks double team heres oconnell midd Brook steps out for a three ands it down nothing but the bottom of the net for the big man big man Ben midd Brooks that was inside out basketball at its best by NC State that is a clip Kevin Keats has to show his team when they come back from Applause break Alvarez from the same spot comes up empty that time NC State pushing it like theyve done all afternoon long J and Taylor an easy two at the rim and Ryder doesnt look tired to me but they look like they ready to get knocked out or theyve been knocked out and theyre trying to get back up on the mat like I dont see fatigue I just see a team that just doesnt beli in themselves right now and it happened about the 5 minute Mark the 15minute Mark excuse me in the first half a losing breeds that and Ryder in the midst of a losing streak and NC state has been Relentless best possession of the night offensively middle Brooks doubled throws it out they skip it one more penetration middle Brooks spots up knock down three that was gorgeous Inside Out basketball by the wolf ready decorating the tree buying Christmas presents I was going to say last minute shopping probably yes yes but I I tell you what this crowd got here early too got students behind us standing up my daughter Alyssa was a student here in NC State now in the Working World but she would be right behind us where we are standing up supporting the wolf pack and I tell you what they got great fans here do you have her Christmas present all taken care of I give her Christmas just about every month shes on a permanent Christmas Applause plant NC state has delivered an early gift here oh and they almost added an Ali oop Dennis Parker Jr everything but the Finish he was fouled on his way to the rim explosive player the sophomore yeah they screen the middle of the Zone they threw it upstairs try to get the lob cu the back line is really flat for Ryder that means theyre backed up so theres room to throw a law plers this kid got hops now Dennis Parker Jr hes got a lot of hops hes got vertical burst hes got lateral quickness hes got a good second jump tell you what he does this off season will decide what type of player hes going to be next year sophomore year hes still trying to figure it out but the junior year he should establish himself on this team and NC State loses when we talk about seven guys their top seven scorers are out of Eligibility yeah so if Im Dennis Parker Jr Im going crazy this summer in the off season everything but the finish for Ingram that rolls around and does not Applause Music TR Trey Parker into the game The Freshman has it here five and white BS with Freshman Class step back for Parker no good and the other Parker in perfect position to clean up the spill if they dont run plays for you then you go get the ball off the glass its good opportunity right there by Parker J oh nice drive low by and it rolls in Reuben Rodriguez with a nice take so if youre Kevin baggot youre youre looking for your team not to quit not to give up you know the score but you can work on things you can work on defensive principles you can work on your Zone you can work on blocking out you can almost treat this like a practice thats what I would do at this point I would start working on things and say look forget the score lets work on a b and c right now the Dennis Parker Jr backto back offensive rebounds that hes cashed in on Wolfpack forc to turnover I was speaking with Michael oconnell after the shoter around today and he said this team compared to last years ACC Championship team does have more depth so last year obviously DJ horn and DJ Burns he said look we dont have guys that can score 20 every game like the two DJs but youve seen Kevin Keats rotate some quality depth into these game its going to be a balanced attack this year they dont have a goto guy as you just mentioned I think dant T Styles who has not you know been a factor in this game he hasnt needed to be but I think he can be one of the goto guys for State Brion pass and deep three everything following for the wolf pack but youre right NC State is going to score with balance this year theyll have three or four guys in double figures if Brandon Huntley Hadfield can really turn it on for state that will give them another weapon not only on the inside but he can face up a knock down shots as that as that small ball five man Alvarez has been a bright spot for Ryder hes got nine yeah I I think he he gives NC Stakes some upside if he can practice hard you know he came from Louisville its an adjustment they had a couple of Bad seasons hes got to understand what it takes to succeed at this level Parker junor lines up a triple couldnt connect Ricochet off TJ weeks junr and it leads to two like a volleyball Spike off TJ weeks Jr and thats the way its gone for NC State everything going their way Jaden Taylor up to 16 Music Paul you coached a long time sometimes its just not your day thats what its been for Applause Ryder and theyve been overmatched physically in this game and again the intensity level by NC State went to another level early in this game and they needed to set that tone to establish themselves in this Applause game Wolfpack have gotten whatever they want in this game how about the that skip pass Reon pass makes a triple everything going down for the wolf Music pack at final four run where are they now DJ Burns in South Korea DJ horn in Germany mod diara in France Casey morcel calling the digital games right here in Raleigh and DJ Burns he wanted to come home for the holidays but he has become so popular in South Korea he play for the sky Gunners over there and they said no hes in demand hes got appearances that hes got to make in South Korea so hes won the fans over in South Korea like he won the fans here in Raleigh and think about his journey for a minute out of high school a top 100 Prospect went to Tennessee decided to transfer to winr LED them to a big South Championship he was the big South player of the year did all he could do at winr and said you know what I want to try to play my best against the best in the ACC and he did so and and city of Raley just fell in love with DJ Burns I mean you just love him like hes a big teddy bear hes always smiling he was easy to play with cuz he was a great passer and and down the stretch in in those nine elimination games that NC State played and won DJ Burns was the goto guy with DJ horn yeah and as 2024 comes to a close as being the final home game here at Raleigh that 2024 is going to hang here forever I just think about what they did Ive won two conference championships one of the big 10 one of the Big East Ive been to the final four Ive been to the elite eight but never in the same year winning the conference Championship and getting to an elite eight or a final four its incredibly special to to win both usually when you win your conference tournament you run out of gas and you and you just you have no emotion left its like being at Space Mountain at Disney okay its like its a highp speeed its a high speeded journey I didnt know where you were going with that oh when you play in your conference tournament think about have you ever been on Space Mountain at Disney yes yes okay twist turns dark light high speed and and thats what conference Championship Games Alik you you just have no idea of how much emotion you have to consume to to play those games and win those games then in the NCAA tournament its a whole different game because its about matchups and then its about you know chemistry at that point yeah that nine game Run will be remembered and celebrated forever five in a row to win the ACC and then four in a row to the final four and this is a fan base with big expectations but Kevins delivered and there was a lot of negativity thrown his way prior to that run but starting with those five magical days to win the ACC Championship and then the final four you know he has come through and that 2024 run will be remembered forever and before those five wins they had a four game losing streak going into the ACC tournament came out of nowhere and you said it the fans were restless they were rumor that he may lose his job they were they were ready to drive him to the airport but the guys in the locker room didnt care he didnt care because you know what he did he did his job as Bill belich always says whos by the way down the street right now at North Carolina coaching football yeah what do you think of that hire oh I love that hire I ABS oh Im a Patriots fan number one so you know I love the hire but theyre going to use their nil money that they can generate theyll get the players and Bill will do an outstanding job coaching he has the ability to recruit players because they have a budget obviously they have a budget for nil they wouldnt hire he wouldnt have taken the job if there wasnt a commitment of resources wolf pack fans would want me to point out that they have had the Tar Heels number in recent seasons and I love that their quarterback CJ Bailey had to say which was oh they hired D thats okay well beat him too but the fans of NC State I mean theyre tremendous fans theyre so passionate about their teams but when it comes to the basketball they were living in the past to some degree they were always talking about what Jim velano the 83 team now theyre going to talk about the 2024 team and Kevin Keats so they need to understand and appreciate what he did for this program because as I mentioned you see the guys on the bench and the red sherps and the white sheriffs theyre the only group that believed in what they could accomplish and thats the power of a team thats the power of baying yeah as we as the calendar turns to 2025 just wanted to make sure that know one final time we got the 2024 year not just with the mens team but the womens team going to the final four and the baseball team going to the College World Series theres just not many programs athletic departments in the country that have had a year like that in fact theres only been three Texas in 2003 and Louisville in 2013 only the third time its happened ever Applause so I have two daughters one went to NC State and the other one went to Texas so theyre part of History Tas and so my tuition money was well spent exactly oconnell fouled shooting three hell get three at the line when we come back as the wolf pack well on their way to a Christmas break victory Music the ESPN 100 you put it together every year since what year Ive been doing it since 2010 since 2010 the top 100 high school recruits in the class the ESPN 100 put together by yourself how many years in advance like what are you working on all the way till 20 what right now well you identifi the best freshman in the country then you start to rank the sophomores only 25 sophomores but we have a database list of hundreds of players in each class and by the time theyre seniors we look for the best 100 we also do top 50 by position so we have a list of 250 guys on the ESPN website by position point guard shooting guard small forward power forward and Center whos been a guy that you kind of uncovered before maybe got all the big offers and then went on the great things tell you what one guy I can think about his name was Kyle guy yeah at Virginia I saw him in the mid West and he had Ball State he had some other mid major schools and I said son youre going to be a high major player Virginia jumped in they got the commitment and National Champion y he he was somebody that not a lot of people really were going after hard and he had a great career for Tony Bennett and NC State under Kevin Keats has done a nice job piling up the ESPN 100 commitments yes theres a freshman on this team Paul mcneel whos going to be a star I believe here at NC State 65 shooting guard hes got great elevation there he is right there Paul mcnail Jr he can light it up I mean hes got to learn how to play with teammates hes got to learn Pace hes got to learn execution defensive principles but all the talent is there Applause well every program of the country I I imagine is balancing what you do with the transfer portal versus High School recruiting used to be all attention on high school recruiting and now maybe an overcorrection to recruiting the portal so Im curious what youve seen Kevin Keats I think has done a nice job still recruiting both hell bring in a good transfer but hes piled up a bunch of good freshman classes in a row as well you always want good high school talent when you look at the top 100 90 of them are committed already why because coaches want to make sure they have talent coming in next season another oh miss the layup you think about this what do coaches spend their most time on and money recruiting you need a healthy blend of freshman coming in players coming back and then yes you got to go out to the portal and get the right guys you have to evaluate the portal just like you evaluate high school players its so important look what NC State did last year when they brought in all those players but Kevin KS made sure that he could coach those guys they fit the culture of this program and they had the talent to win and boy did they win big Styles been quiet couldnt connect there its interesting Kevin Keats has his starting five out there despite this game being well in hand with under 6 minutes to play I think at the 4 minute timeout we still have to change the lineup but hes still riding these guys like you rote him and shoo he hes still standing up coaching and thats thats a guy whos locked in this fan base has a wonderful head coach so relatable understands his players great desire to win hes brought greatness to NC State timeout Kevin bagget after the Ryder make time out Ridder well step aside for 30 seconds Music acpm crew right here on acc Network at the ESPN app and theyll be shifting to conference Play Talk certainly come the New Year football in the rear viw mirror and itll be all Hoops for the acpm Music crew Carlos Boozer part of that team ACC Network had a chance to see his two sons play this yeah hes got a couple of boys right theyre studs Cameron Boozer number two player in the entire country Kaden boo a top 20 Prospect both going to guess where Duke very good guess Duke with the number one recruiting class for next year as well they had it this year so its interesting Paul you mentioned it at halftime even though NC State had a commanding lead that both coaches will say its z0 lets see what we can do in the second half well the score is 2726 NC State oh you mentioned Duke and our crew find finds the one Duke fan brave enough to wear that sweatshirt in the lovo center very courageous young man to wear that but now when you mention Duke NC State says we beat you in the ACC tournament and we beat you to go to the final four that had to feel sweet it it does but look one thing about NC State and all the other teams in the conference you dont want to try to be like Duke and Carolina you want to beat them not be like them because its hard to be like them with their history and tradition but you can absolutely beat them in games and thats what you have to do you know you dont want to compare yourself to somebody else you just want to be who you are and Kevin Keats has brought great identity to NC State I hes done it his way so the way they defend yes although that uh little too much intensity foul called on the Freshman Bryce herd but when I think about NC State basketball think about fast break basketball turnover margin every year low turnover team they defend the threepoint shot exceptionally well so theres an identity each and every season no matter what the roster Applause says and that becomes so important with how much turnover youre seeing in and year out well Kevin coach at hardre Military Academy at prep store and thats where he cut his teeth in the game you have to have a new team every year you recruit new players from high school you have them for one year they go on to college so Kevin is experienced in putting teams together for one Applause season thats a new world were living in theres not many Brion passes anymore that been in the same school for 4 years and are going to graduate in four years most teams youre not going to see an identity until conference play unless you have a returning Superstar will say like Kansas has Hunter Dickinson who middle books went up against 8 days ago battled in you know toe for toe and hes had a really nice game 8 Days Later here against Ryder you need returning players you need Superstars and then you can figure out your identity earlier rather than later big block Ben middle Brooks on both ends and thats the first made bucket of the night for dant Styles hes been kept quiet until that make Kevin KS doing the Tom Tibido he keeping all his main players in and the games already over I play I play for Tom tippo so I understand that you play for him at Salem State division three but the problem is I wanted to get in the game I was a walk on so I was really mad that he kept everyone in 328 to go before the holiday break NC State well on their way to 8 and Music four Cooper flag he leads Duke in almost every category keep an eye on Andre stovich for Cal second leading score right now in the ACC and you take a look at your New Years Eve slate as ACC play really gets underway you the teams have played one or two games but now itll be all conference play double header on ESPN 2 double header on acc Network and then four more games on acc Network on New Years Day and and the one game Im going to keep my eye on is the Wake for Syracuse game because wake has all the makings of an NCAA tournament team theyve had some opportunities in the nonconference uh they beat Michigan which is a really nice win but they need to get on a streak in the ACC if theyre going to get a bid to the tournament because lets face it the ACC is not as strong a conference as its been in the past can they get three or four teams in I think if the two three four and five teams they just wipe out the rest of those teams at the bottom and and they have great you cant have a 500 record in the ACC this year and think youre getting into the tournament thats not going to happen no I agree with you now NC State its very interesting what do you do with a resume like this theyre going to be 80 against favorites and 2 minutes and 57 seconds when they close this one out but 0 and four when theyve been Underdog so theyve beaten everybody theyre supposed to beat but they havent upset anybody oh theyre right on schedule right now now they have to get you know everybody has to beat Duke if you want to get into the NCAA tournament in terms of ACC team thats your quad one opportunity right thats your quad one Carolina could be a quad one Clemson could turn into a quad one maybe Pittsburgh but theres not going to be as many opportunities for Quad ones but there is going to be opportunity for a lot of wins and youve got to stack up wins this year in the ACC if you want to get in I agree with you I think what Kevin Keats has done a really nice job of with his schedule is you went out and you played Texas Purdue Kansas on the road at Allen Fieldhouse that should in theory help your neet that you went out and played those teams yeah and if you win this game by 30 points that helps you net as well that that could be a reason why Kevin is has kept some of the starters in he kept them in until the 330 month and you think about North Carolina top 10 schedule in the country when you think about who they played right I mean they they now they they beat UCLA was a tremendous bounce back win for Huber Davis in the T Hills I mean they played Florida great in the second half but they didnt play hard in the first half and I know coach Davis was really down about how they played in the first half the second half they were phenomenal RJ Davis had 27 big win against UCLA big bounce back win thats going to be a reson win two minutes until Christmas break begins here in Raleigh and an early present delivered by this Wolfpack team as they close the 2024 season here at home yeah this this was a great effort performance by NC State from start to finish like they did not take their foot off the gas intensity wise and the score reflects it timeout Kevin baget his final timeout as this team has gone on a 7 nothing run over the LA built a 30point lead and kept their starters in until the 330 mark one of the Bright Young coaches in the college game you know I believed a lot in Kevin KS before the NCAA tournament run in the ACC championship did a terrific job at NC Wilmington was an assistant for Rick patino at Louisville relatable connects with his players hes got a great staff this FC State program is in tremendous Applause hands the highlights for the wolf pack 21 assists to go along with a defensive effort that really set the tone now the walk ons get a chance and his son KJ KS gets into game number 13 right there and hes saying dad it took too long to get me and well discuss this during Christmas yeah hes the only one that doesnt get a break from the head coach during Christmas break know but Ill tell you what the house the Keiths house is going to be happy itll be marry and bright you got to give TJ a look here right yeah WalkOns got to touch it and shoot it here you go right to the rim Jordan Snell into the box scor from right down the road and Applause carry youre got to get it back with 6 seconds you got to get it to KJ KS oh playing nothing but the bottom of the net oh crowd wants it the crowd urging Keats to put it up and the coachs son he knows better he know he wants it but he knows back out got a win with class smile from Dad and NC State improves to eight and four and well go into the Christmas
