days dating back to 2024 so two weeks off for the NS qes felt awake earlier in the week NS in the whites cuse in the orange and the NES and dayquon Davis have the rock to start things off the visiting team the past four seasons has won the game between the noes and the orange heres Watkins averaging nearly 20 a game Davis outstanding freshman has shot the three ball well over his last four games and he connects to staring off not really known as a shooter a bulldog point guard who is super aggressive but a great way to start the game for Davis in his confidence knocking down the open three 61 176 lb freshman from Baltimore Starling Taylor Carlos Freeman lamin Jr the five for the orange on the drive Carlos with the left hand Nifty to the bucket and Carlos after a slow start to the season his December has been great averaging 10 points and almost seven assists hes a guy that is key for Syracuse tonight if they want to come out on top therell be a key on the glass as well as that ball thrown away turnovers have been an issue for the orange this season yeah averaging almost 21 in their last two basketball games they have to be able to take care of the basketball especially against this Florida State pressure Florida state is a defensive team that wants to create offense from their defense Syracuse has to do a better job of taking care of the basketball get Starling back in there to start after seven games bbo and three ball in the corner is good the NOS have drained a couple from be be on the arc early I tell you what Florida States not known as a great shooting team but when you make your first two threes your confidence just goes to another level and you go from a not so good shooting team to a good shooting team great sign for Florida State early b b and was just 24 coming in from Beyond the arc on the year size and length what bbo and hangs his hat on hits the three so the NOS up four six to2 heres lamin transfer from Colorado started his career at TCU starling hello welcome back JJ Starling Syracuse fans there you go I mean you love to see you just love to see one of the best players in the ACC back out here competing on the floor it just makes the game that much better youan skilled big man wrap around laying is good Watkins has just been a man among boys this whole season just punishing Defenders getting into the lane not only creating for himself but you see right there creating for his teammates and Ying with the tough finish Ed what do you want to see early from both of these sides a St PS again uhoh two for two maybe thats something youd like to see theres a key well I want to see that I want to see shots being made and obviously Florida State and Syracuse off to a hot start both but I mean what a sign for Syracuse seeing JJ Starling make his first two shots after missing the last seven basketball games a breath of fresh air and no doubt the Junior from Bonville New York started his career at Notre Dame to JJ Watkins Jackson Nice feed inside e impatient foul call holds is it on Freeman or Applause lampin what a sign for Syracuse I mean JJ after missing seven games knocked down his first three and then getting into the midrange area and saying what rust Ari Im knocking it down two for two to start the game great sign for the cuse and is Yan first free throw rattles out thats something cuse has been missing over the last seven games a guy who can create his own shot late in a shot clock well I think a lot of guys are outside of their roles with JJ wasnt playing you know theyre trying to figure out you know what can they bring to the table what what value do they add and bringing JJ back into the fold they could kind of sit back and breathe a little bit more and now they could just kind of sit into their roles and really be the team with that they were trying to be with JJ back in the lineup here he is early hes looking for the heat check back iron battling for it goes out of bounds itll stay with the orange and AR despite you know Syracuses defensive struggles this season theyre theyre really not a bad rebounding team averaging almost 39 rebounds a game one of the best defensive rebounding teams in the ACC is cous have struggled to force turnovers with a pressure defense oh turnover again Davis open court attacks Lefty layup is that going to be goaling it will be how about the Freshman early for Florida State dayquon Davis five early just being aggressive like we said hes a bulldog he wants to get to the basket he wants to apply pressure on the defense but Lucas Taylor with a a bad crosscourt pass against this Florida State team thats something that you can not do at all Syracuse has to see the mismatches on the switches Florida state is going to switch one through five they have to take advantage of it right now with lampin right now being guarded by Jackson they have to see that starlings got two excuse me five early points shot in the air bang thats a good sign Lucas Taylor hes been heating up from Beyond The Arc over the last four games 16 points versus Wake Forest last game hes a guy that you want to really see continue to be aggressive to continue to make shots tied at 10 Watkins on the catch Fades against Starling double team comes Q forces the turnover heres JJ open court kick Taylors got one want another that one off to the left offensive rebound lampin turns lays it up and it rattles home Addy l thats what he does down low and all that was started from JJ Starling pushing the pace getting into the paint early offense despite the Miss from Taylor lamin was on the boards and be able to get the offensive put back Davis snow maliku and offensive rebound one of the best to do it in the country this season b b and back iron on the three rebound cleans great box out right there by Taylor on Watkins Starling launches back iron too strong rebound by you and Applause malikan can push the ball up the floor hes so skilled attacks and he rips it down AR you love the pace that both teams are playing with theyre getting up and down when youre playing like that you have to make quick decisions and you see Yan right there with the slow down into the fake hand off turning the corner into the dunk and youre right hes one of the most skilled big men in the ACC if not the country talk about skill Donnie Freeman potentially projected lotto Pick turns it over B Bing off the glass torquing his body sweet finish with the left hands just being aggressive just pushing the pace trying to get to the best look make or miss when you apply pressure to the defense its hard to guard you see Florida State doing a great job of attacking the Rim Early on B Bowen hes got five early lamin a good pass or not that time turns it over this is what Florida State wants to do lpin right there is starting too far away from the rim and a foul called on the floor looks like on jquan Carlos maliku and one of the breath of fresh air for the orange just having your best player back on the floor it just gives everybody a little bit more confidence a little bit more energy one thing Syracuse has to do they have to be able to take care of the basketball four early turnovers and we know thats what Florida State wants to try to do but the pace of this game is exciting I wish I was was out there playing right now this is the type of pace that I wanted to play with when I was playing its fun to watch and its fun to see what are the biggest challenges for JJ as he worked his way back into it I think just confidence getting his timing back and and knowing hey my hand is healthy I can get to my spots and I can be aggressive and I can just play basketball we see how many minutes JJs able to go tonight in his first game back Watkins no offensive rebound B Bowens been a bright spot early and he connects again hes got seven and B Bowen he has the length he has the athleticism hes going to learn as he gets his reps but great move right there just a spin off the bump and then controlling it off the contact finishing at The Rim Florida State by four Jer Davis is entered for cuse as has a talented freshman Elijah Moore he fires the three that rattles out good look there for Mo from the bronos back door cut Watkins oh baby I tell you what how about the no look from your Center you know a dime on right on Cube Ying is we talked about one of the most skilled players centers in the country how about your fiveman with a no look dropping a dime to Watkins who knows what to do with it and hes finishing at the rim with the right hand Malik Yuan has come in and just made a major statement in the ACC conference for this Florida State team L Hamilton set of the former Joo Player of the Year his passing is an underrated aspect of his game hes averaging nearly 16 in his last 10 games good defense from the orange they force a tie up jump ball Arrow to Syracuse AR this is what Syracuse needs to do they cant let Watkins just sit back and Survey the defense they have to get up pressure him and and make him play quick and hope to cause turnovers well Adrien arry former associate head coach for Jim beheim luse here in his second season as the head coach its been a challenge in here right trying to figure things out but he said were alsoo close were a couple of buckets away from being N9 and four and that changes the complexion and really the story lines for this team he feels like JJ Starling getting back in there though could be the biggest boost of the Year obviously Syracuse fans I understand I know the expectations that you have you want to win right away this is a different landscape in college basketball with the turnaround youre getting new players every single year that is difficult for coaches to be able to navigate and lets not forget coach red had 20 wins in his first season and like you said a lot of these losses could have been win a Miss free throw here a turnover there a made three there and yes he hes catching a lot of heat but I think coach arrey has done a unbelievable job in in his first two years and obviously not the record that Syracuse fans want to have but if you really dive deep into it this Syracuse team isnt so far away he played well against Texas and Texas Tech with Starling right and then the injury couldnt compete against Tennessee got blown out by Maryland tough loss to Georgetown as Starling was looking and ARA players going to play coach re cannot get out there and make threepoint shots the players have to play hes going to put them in position the best he can to go out and Excel and and have a good game they have to make shots they have to make good decisions and its up to them on the court theyre going to check to see if JJs shot beat the buzzer there shot clock was winding down take another look see JJ right here just going into his floater and see B bour right there hitting that left hand hopefully JJs all right just good to see competition in the ACC you dont want to see teams play without their best player on the floor you want to see competitive basketball games we saw early in the game the matchup between Watkins and Starling thats what this conference is about seeing your best players going against each other and competing at a high level youre going to count the basket look good there on the replay as well so seven for Starling hes pacing C Florida State leading by four a great defense there from Qs Kyle cuff hell go Coast to Coast block shot alier Malo The Freshman from Pennsylvania I mean this length florid to say I mean you see it every single year with Leonard Hamiltons team the length and the athleticism and how guys can make up and cover space great job running down getting the block shot right there but how about Kyle cuff doing a great job getting up there defending Watkins and hes a guy who brings a lot of energy for Starling no put back blocked as well third chance coming for the orange more against bbo and shakes kicks Starling hesi attacks floater rattles off crashing the glass there was movich another three that time no cus is getting an abundance of opportunities and Movic the energy player rewarded AR and they call him Pistol Pete its not cuz he can handle the basketball its because of his energy and his effort you see it right there two offensive rebounds ending up in an offensive putback The Freshman from Serbia has the orange with in two BB and Hol three ball dials it up off to the right no good long rebound to bbo and NOS will get another shot both of these teams are competing at a high level and thats all you can ask for its a competitive game guys competing at a high level Lovich a bit too aggressive in his called for the valow mol by two well be right back media all you guys on social media saying this and that you really have no clue what goes on behind the scenes and all the stuff that they have to deal with and Coach red is doing as well of a job as he can and theyll continue to get better S The Freshman too strong on the floater rebound cuse heres cuff Davis Jer Davis transfer from Delaware one of the best players in the CAA one season ago good ball rotation open three right corner not there a movich has had a great first half rebounding the basketball but he was stripped Holt on the attack strong to the rack hes going to the line you just see Florida States aggression on both ends of the floor you see active hands on the defensive side and then say going right down you see HT right here just putting the pressure on the defense two hands on the ball like a running back getting in there and drawing the foul with opportunity to shoot two at the line awon Hol brought into Tallahasse for his experience now his fourth stop playing college basketball as he knocks down the first free throw do want to remind you that next Saturdays ACC Network mens basketball triple header starts with Clemson hosting Florida State at Little John at two Eastern then UNC and NC State and Raleigh and finally Virginia Tech taken on Cal should be a great day of Hoops on the ACC Network I cant wait for some of these matchups Ed the ACC didnt get the job done at nonconference play that means in League every win is Paramount I tell you what everybody is going to be beaten up on each other its going to be a lot of good games over the weekend and we got a good one right here going on Florida State in Syracuse ARA how about the drive there from cuff aggressive wasted no time hes going to the strike for two ARA cuffs a guy who didnt see a lot of time in early in the season but has come on of his late and hes a guy who impacts the game with his energy being aggressive on both ends of the floor you see right there just using that strong body getting to the cup and an opportunity to knock down two free throws 70 free throw shooter 36 minutes a career high against Wake Forest in the last matchup coach ay res just looking for a spark right some energy somebody to provide just that little bit extra well especially with JJ being out the last seven games obviously its great to have him back great to have your best player back but he was really looking for somebody to give him a spark give him some energy and effort on both sides of the Court question marks now for Florida State right no Watkins no Yan on the floor where will the offense come from heres Deng the transfer from Hampton midrange Jay pulls up that will rattle off rebound collected at the free throw line by Starling heres JJ guarded by Dan looking for options inside hell do it himself all the way inside drives kicks three ball in the air foul cold is that Taylor no it was Chris Bell Number Four whos checked into the game a veteran threepoint shooter and the noes commit the cardinal sin they foul the threepoint shooter see right here JJ doing a great job of just continuing to be aggressive and you have to stay down on that close out and just put up a hand we know coach Hamilton is not going to be happy about that when youre following a threepoint shooter no coach is going to be but how about JJ staring just Syracuse team is is a whole different team with him in the lineup and him being aggressive changes the whole landscape for this basketball team its the second Watkins you and back in Lin as well guy like Chris Bell really needed someone like JJ Starling right to feed him to be able to create have defenses collapse and allow for some cleaner looks he really struggled without stalling on the court honestly hes one of the best Shooters in college basketball he showed it last year he showed at the beginning of this year and you know he had guys like Malik Brown and Judah minz who put him in positions last year and then early in the season with JJ Starling handling the basketball but its going to take a lot of pressure with JJ back in the game off of Chris Bell and now he could just get to his spots and be the great shooter that he is H fighting for it Jackson short jumper thats good Florida State ties the game at 21 it didnt take long for Watkins and Yan to get back in the game but I I think that is a talking point for Florida State who is going to be that third scor option we talked to Coach Hamilton in practice and he was talking about usually he has 10 12 guys all who could score the basketball and that hasnt been the case this year whos going to step up and really help those two guys out star its not there whos a guy for Florida State that could do that as D steps through oh that was sweet well I think you he D just answered your question right there I mean hes a guy right there whos pretty versatile hes a guy who strong body he can shoot the threepointer and hes showing his versatility right there putting it down on the ground and finishing at The Rim could it be a guy like Taylor bulbo and a Chandler Jackson dayin Davis Florida State hung its hat on nine or 10 guys that could get the job done for so many years a whistle theyll say its on the floor Chris Bell making his case that he was shooting as we take another Music look theres the foul just put in when you put pressure on the defensive player and you force him to make a play and sometimes their hands just get caught in there and you get called for a foul thats Yans first belt steps into a three thats good thatll make Chris Bell feel good C retakes the lead you get a guy like JJ Starling back you get a guy like Chris Bell back in his Groove Back hitting shots this is a totally different serat basketball team Jackson cut off by Bel now to Watkins quiet so far here in this first half and olds lead leading score top five in the ACC Yan against lampin good match up here Yan turns faces shot rattles ho how good is maliku maliku hes hes a Pro Prospect hes a guy who could do it inside he could do it outside he can put it on the ground as he showed earlier in the game and driving from the threepoint line and and ducking the basketball but you know I think he if he gains 10 to 15 pounds and he gets a little bit more physical he hes a guy who his skill set trans to the NBA level the match up between him and lamin who sticks it in will be fun to monitor throughout the night both teams desperate for a victory Yan turning facing shot oh missed everything heres Carlos working against Watkins interior feed Lamkin sticks with it Baseline Drive trying to muscle you and trying to create space and angle shot no oh a number of white jerseys converged on at you and I dont know what he was looking for you see that length of Florida state is tough to finish right there but if you got to be able to attack you on the defensive side of the basketball and L can do a good job of that Florida State just doing a good job collapsing and helping out right wing three is launched that ones front ey are no good The Freshman Davis collects Watkins three ball in transition nope knocked out of bounds it will stick excuse me it will go to cuse from the matchups against the nuls remember Florida state would go 12 deep and the 6 through 12 options at times were just as good if not better than their starting five that was something Leonard Hamilton hung his hat on this is a little bit of a different recipe for FS but he did mention as well a lot of those 10 to 12 guys that hes used to have were three fouryear guys now hes getting to turn over and and these guys are new guys every single year so they dont know the system they havent bought into the system yet they havent learned the system so its uh its much harder now you know for these coaches in in the turnover in the landscape of college basketball to you know just to have these guys in come in and contribute right away theres you and on your screen you saw Davis at the top of it just a moment ago speaking of freshmen who are outstanding Donnie Freeman has yet to score in this basketball game as Davis provides a boost of energy it will stay with Syracuse the Freeman of five star dud right who comes in Syracuse New York hes shown flashes of Brilliance but as he gets into ACC play and becomes a focal point of scouting reports theres a game plan within that game plan well I think Freeman has already been on the scouting reports I mean hes one of the top scorers for Syracuse his second lead scorer behind Starling and I mean hes a guy whos super talented hes super skilled he just has to be aggressive he has he cant worry about making mistakes or missing shots you just got to play basketball the great players the good players they continue to play through the mistakes through the Miss shots and they stay confident throughout that how much does a guy like JJ stlying coming back though open things up for Freeman oh opens up things for all the guys on the team we talked about Bell and Carlos and lampin and really all the guys it it just puts them at ease a little bit better knowing that theyre best players out there on the floor with them onepoint game now the other way Jackson gives the NOS the lead in this back and forth Affair in the first half AR Jackson is a guy who has he has a great build at at the point guard position at the guards position hes hes tall he can get into the lane I think if he continues to be aggressive continue to get to that pain area he can make shots he can create plays for his teammates Taylor nice look lamin couldnt stay with it on the ground they call it timeout lamin was able to call timeout 26 Watkins Yan combined for 42 points but the Cardinals made 15 threes in that game Pat Kelce also another big win earlier this week against North Carolina so maybe Louisville starting to figure some things out the injury ridd Cardinals heres Davis and the NOS leading by one gets into the teeth of the defense into the lane shot too strong lamkins got the board one of the best rebounders in the conference Syracuse doing a great job of getting back in trans transition defense something that theyve really been struggling with the whole season and we know Florida State wants to get up and push the pace and thats what they really excel at Syracuse making it hard for him in the half court jquan Carlos the Hoster transfer Freeman midrange Jay has a Proficiency in the midrange not that time not a good shot right there by Freeman you want to see what you got and attack the basket and thats what Jamir Watkins does better than maybe anyone in the ACC gets downhill creates contact finds a way to get to the free throw not only in the ACC or in the country hes one of the best players in the country just putting his head down getting downhill playing through the cont attack hes either going to finish with the and one or is he going to give himself an opportunity to make two at the line jir Watkins top five in the country in free throw attempts on the year if you look at kenpom the advance metrics nobody draws more fouls per 40 minutes than J jir Watkins its hard when a guys being aggressive and hes attacking you like that you cant help about the F except about the foul them and 6 7 210 lbs that its a running back coming through you to the rim our next AC she Network womens basketball quadruple header is tomorrow but were looking ahead at next Sundays four games featuring three top 20 teams Duke Virginia at noon UNC BC right after that and then 13th rank Georgia Tech and Louisville capping the day with Miami and C ACC womens basketball off to a fiery start how about tonight Ladson dropped 40 against a Virginia Tech earlier this week WNBA is watching her very closely maybe the best finisher in the country foul holds on jir watkinss first hand check ARA talking to Watkins at shooter around earlier today and we all know he used to wear the number two and now changed to the number one and its a unbelievable story behind that hes going to be the first person in his family to graduate as why he changes number from number two to number one but he wants to be able to set an example for the younger generation of his family what an what an accomplishment what a young man I mean what a mindset to have to set an example for the younger generation we were told Aon Davis wanted number one and quickly was told guess what jir is getting it thats why Davis wears five it was a quick conversation it was a very I dont think it was a conversation it was more of a directive that he told you hey this is whats going to happen it wasnt wasnt a conversation but when a guy like Watkins wants to come back youre going to give him that number how you you went high above the talah Housey Sky all right this is where Florida State really excels getting out playing with Pace attacking the basket and playing Above the Rim Malik Yu the athleticism on display how about there from Lucas Taylor through the contact and after a lob like that you see the pace that Florida State wants to play with it it just gives him some more excitement gives them the confidence to go ahead and attack the basket and play at that pace the pace that they want to play at bbo and it shot four times from Beyond The Arc in this game Freeman there he goes that could be a confidence booster his first points this is something Syracuse has to see early on when they when they have these switches when they have these matches they have to attack it its been a good one so far Watkins three ball rattles Out Boy that was from way downtown all right hes capable but hes more comfortable getting to the basket and I think right now hes settling Syracuse doing a good job of making him shoot tough contested shots both of these teams really struggle to shoot it from Beyond The Arc so Freeman starting to find some some comfort here thats where he needs to get the basketball free throw line jumper turn face up see what you got really known for their shooting area Syracuse a different basketball team with attack that middle of the floor area you saw just right before the timeout Donnie Freeman doing a good job getting at that free throw line area turn make a decision do you have a shot do you have a drop but continue to be aggressive in the middle of the floor Bowen cant connect from the midrange q a little 60 run has them up by a point theyve hit their last three shots Starling NOS will switch Starling on the attack floats it off to the right rebound Watkins poked it away from Movic Watkins downhill and theres the foul oh red ay doesnt like it I mean he did seven shuffles from his standing spot all the way down the bench yeah this is the pace that Florida State wants to play with in coach arry he might not be happy but again Watkins forces you to foul him being aggressive getting to the bucket with that strong body showing the ball and when you show the ball like that you see the defenders arms all on slapping him down and he forces the ref to to make a call great players Force the refs to make that call and jir Watkins is obviously one of the best at doing that anyone from your playing days that you went up against or played with that were proficient at finding ways to create that contact I tell you what there is a guy just last year named Judah Mintz from Syracuse who did a great job of getting to the free throw line at will but back in my day a guy like I dont know you might know this name Johnny Flynn oh yeah I mean he was a guy who was ahead of his time and he could shoot he could pass he could dribble he put so much pressure on on the Defenders that they had no choice but to follow him to try to stop him and but he was one of the great Qs point guards judan off to the NBA Watkins hopes to join him there later on this year Watkins has six Florida State retakes the lead final few moments here of this first half this opening stands up four on the shot clock cus got to get something up and does thats off to the right rebound bbo and he came flying into the week side Davis crosscourt pass Watkins ball fake attack gets into the defense poked away Freeman picks up the loose ball talented freshman in oh block shot bbo and denied you see the length right there of Florida state Florida State doing a great job of pushing Syracuse away from the basket in the half court and transition opportunity right there from Syracuse but Florida State doing a great job of hustling it back and getting the block shot b b and called for the offensive foul had a match up he wanted against the smaller Kyle cuff take another look at it yeah I dont know you you just let him play through it I mean this is basketball is a contact sport you let him play it was a bump to the chest and I guess it was a warning from the Applause officials see how far out s ex is from the basket Florida state does a great job of making the offense play so far away from the basket getting up in the passing lanes and Syracuse has to be better with their passing and make better crisp passes and just better decisions overall with the ball well cuse did have four turnovers in the first five minutes of the game theyre at six right now in the first half theyve cleaned that part up its allowed him to get some good looks like this one oh that rattles out for Freeman on the attack count it and on Ara thats something right there that should get you going as a Syracuse basketball fan seeing Donnie Freeman right there getting on the offensive glass being strong saying Malik youan I got some game too going right up flexing a little bit and Syracuse fans thats what you want to see from your star freshman getting in there mixing it up being physical not just settling for jump shots in the midrange area but getting it around the rim mixing it up a little bit and playing with contact basketball is a contact sport are you want to be able to get up and you cant shy away from the contact you got to be aggressive and you got to be able to play through it fre free throw and you got to knock down your free throws yeah no doubt Freemans got six here in this first half q spy one Davis lost it on the way up itll stay with Florida stake all right we talked about that that third option and Davis is more than capable of stepping up and making plays you see right there just just losing the ball but he has the ability to get by and now once he gets into that pain area he has to be able to make the right decision Florida State team that hasnt made a shot from the floor in the last three and a half minutes Davis trying to end that and he does or do that straight away Bullock come off the screen and knock it down pure from The Freshman hes got eight and hes been cating his last three games from Beyond The Arc better than 50 what does q have right here at the end of the half F he does not lack confidence well give the ball to your best player and oh we dribble out dont turn the ball over but ARA going back to Davis I mean this is a kid that was a former football player in high school and he does not lack confidence whatsoever Davis at the buzzer off to the left partner pretty fun first half good 20 minutes a lot of up and down a lot of pace to this game and AC she win of the year and honestly are we know both teams arent great shooting teams but both teams in that first half got some good looks they just didnt knock him down Florida State top team in the ACC this year and blocks a game five over five they got four in the first half cuse not really proficient at forcing turnovers but they did get five steals in that first half this final 20 minutes goes Jackson on the drive Nifty as he knifes his way through for the bucket I think his head might have also hit the hardwood on the fall all right we hopefully Jacksons all right and hell be all right but we mentioned Jackson earlier in the first half and hes another guy besides Davis who could really you know step up and help this Florida State team and contribute see him right there attacking the basket and he he has the strong body he has the capability of getting to the rim and finishing Taylor Jackson 65 Jr from Memphis Tennessee right there Jackson just playing off a two feet and looks like he hit uh Bowens knee hopefully Jackson will be all right and he be able to come back in hell take a seat for a moment well keep monitoring that Thomas in the game for Florida State noes by four Lankin on the catch inside outside Freeman three oh rattles out Syracuse they missed lampin early they had him right away and Florida State was able to come back and get their help defense Muses best offense comes from feeding lampin inside to which he can find Shooters Beyond The Arc as you little turnaround hook not there Carlos aggressive to to the rim good ball movement Starling yes AR jquan Carlos started that possession right there pushing the pace collapsing the defense kicking it to the corner and a great extra pass right there by Lucas and JJ starlings continu to shake it off shake off his rust knock it down to three see Florida State right there answering with a three of their own they heard us talk about how bad they shot in the first half so naturally both teams make their first threepoint buckets all this is division one basketball its a high level basketball right these guys are capable of knocking down shots how about that hes capable of that and so much more Donnie Freeman continue to be aggressive I know you cant hear me young man but dont settle continue to be aggressive to get to the rim you see him right here turning around with the hand in his face playing through the contact we talked about playing through the contact and was able to knock it down and a chance to make it a threepoint play hes got such a high release that allows him to get those shots off well when youre 611 you could stretch pretty Applause far Im not comparing him to KD thats not happening but thats the type of thing that makes KD so hard to guard right when when youre all in his gr yeah and Im glad you didnt make that comparison Im not doing it as Watkins lays it in so dont at home say oh AR you called him K I did not say that I played with KD at oill my senior year and I tell you what when I saw this guy in open gym 610 handling the ball like a point guard shooting like a shooting guard I called my mom and I said Mom I have never seen a basketball player do what this guy could do just an unbelievable a generational Talent Carlos tries to sneak by bubo and reach it see who thats on is that on Thomas 25 I believe it is indeed his second AR you like what you see from Carlos hes continuing to put pressure on the Florida State Defense and get to the teeth of it right there and thats where youre able to collapse and make a play for your teammates Thomas three yes Justin Thomas all three of those and honestly he hasnt been getting a lot of time as of late but hes probably the first or second best shooter on the Florida State basketball team and hes done such a great job coaching this basketball team over the years what an accomplishment for him bad pass noes want to run a little sloppy but it ends in a throw down Ali bu it on the finish and thats what Florida State wants to do they want to pressure you they want to turn you over and then they want to get to the other end and throw lob and play Above the Rim Malik Yi his third lob of the game ball Bs length almost causing an issue on that one C has protected the ball relatively well so far had that flurry early oh Carlos dragged to his pivot foot another turnover there back to back as Florida state has up the Angie on the pressure Syracuse has to be careful you see right B bow just taking off his hip and throw it up maliku and Im going go and grab it it is third Al for the game and all right he likes to play Above the Rim yes he does you and averaging over 15 points per game in his last 10 contests started his career at Old Miss off the curl Watkins no another chance coming as Davis controls this is dangerous territory right now for syracus they need to be able to get a stop and then they need to come and get a bucket on the other end Watkins fouled by Lucas Taylor one of the best on ball Defenders on this Qs team a great on ball Defender but a silly foul playing that that far away from the basket you know Watkins isnt going to shoot the ball from there and if he does let him would you have sagged off just a little bit Yeah will he was 5 ft behind the threepoint line you dont foul him right there it was just a silly foul perhaps Taylor trying to create a turnover and get cuse back into it the orange down nine the NS strong on their home floor both teams in desperate need of Victory Davis had been hot from Beyond The Arc let it rip not that time big possession right here for Syracuse they need be able to move the ball move the Florida State Defense and be aggressive and attack the Gap and thats not what you want right there from Eddie Lin starting from the threepoint line diir Davis had it poked from behind Starling with 10 JJ with nine cuff with eight fires away yes big shot there for cuff Big Shot you just see the length of Florida state theyre so disruptive and they Syracuse got lucky right there that cuff just hit a big shot and batt him up but Florida state is just so disruptive defensively with their length and athleticism Watkins doing what he does best drawing fouls when we come back how about some New Years resolutions for these teams NS by six now coming into conference play its going to be tougher competition and Florida state has to be able to step up and get some wins Florida State team N9 and0 against quad three and quad four teams on the year and 0 and four against quad one and quad 2 H against lamin its a tough ask now to Davis oh shot blocked but he was fouled dayquon Davis going to the line right there Lin he he did a good job of standing youing up and I guess thats one thing if you want to talk about you and you want a nickp pick get lower to the ground use your leverage and be able to play through that contact right there you see Eddie lampin winning that battle but we talked about Davis just being aggressive put putting pressure on the rim and that allows them to get opportunity at the line Davis Barrys the first and want to remind you coming up next after our mens basketball triple header the nothing but net crew will break down the day and night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule for next week weve got you covered all season right here on acc Network and the ESPN Davis pair of free throws hes in double figures hes got 10 Florida State re extends the lead to eight the ball pressure right now that Watkins but it it just makes here you have to make a decision but C doing a great job just having that body control switching hands from right to left and finish and we talked about his energy Watkins with great ball pressure but cuff just keeping the ball alive keeping the dribble alive probing getting into the lane and hanging finishing with the left hand what a tough finish right there by cuff and early on he didnt get a lot of time but he has come on as of late bringing that energy and effort and see his athleticism there at the rim with the opportunity to get a threepoint play and he does convert on that 14 points against wake a lot of those coming in the first half shot out of a cannon red ay asked for a spark Off the Bench and he provided it in the end Hunter Salis and a wake just a little too much theyre in central New York AR Im going to tell you a big separator for basketball players theres a lot of skilled guys but just playing hard and competing at a high level could separate you from the pack Davis three back iron offensive rebound Watkins leans no oh fenetic few moments here in this game fivepoint game Starling against bbo and has he shakes midrange Rises not rebound Thomas it was tough to play against that L on offense I mean bull Bowen how about bull Bowen hes close to a double double night 12 points nine rebounds we talked about Davis being that third score but B Bowen is stepping up and just showing his versatility theres that man again Chris Bell a key might be to get him going here in the second half that is a big key for Syracuse they need Chris Bell to be able to hit shots one of the best threepoint Shooters in the ACC one season ago just a frigid start Midway through the year though here for Bell and his junior year theres a foul on the floor Watkin just does such a great job of forcing you to F weve talked about it over and over in this game I dont know what the percentage of is him getting fouled but he has to be one of the highest in the country just not only getting to the foul line but just being foul period he forces you to be active with your hands he gets into your body and just such a tough cover proed NBA second round pick at the moment is Watkins Watkins is a matchup he likes turns fad fires nearly missed everything how about dang crashing the glass and then was fouled yeah we weve talked a lot of positive about Watkins but that is not the shot that you want from him you dont Fade Away against a smaller guy and you know being 67 210 lbs you go right in his chest and get to the rim Chandler Jackson will come into the game for jir Wat its good to see Chandler Jackson back on the flour fourpoint Advantage NOS with the Applause ball Davis Jackson steps into a three short rebound Carlos hes feeling all right hes feeling all right Im get Im going get one up real quick heres Bell

Freshman Peters guard him and he says Hey Im going put you in a spin cycle and get a bucket s got 12 NS by six Davis CU finger roll yes good job by cuff just finding that open in the middle of the pain area being there right by The Rim finishing Kyle cuff who started his career at Kansas providing a spark here in the second half for Syracuse dang way downtown the answer Ds another guy versatile

see him right there getting into the action Chris Bell yes his third Applause triple Davis fouls I tell you what stovic has been active lot of energy I he is filling up the box score Florida State by four couple of flashy moments important for this Syracuse basketball team last year he had a terrific season we talked about in his last four games only nine points and hes a guy that has to make shots for this Syracuse basketball team not only to open up the floor for the driving Lanes but just overall to win basketball games they need Chris Bell to get back on track Bells got three triples and 12 points in this game alone how about dayquon Davis hes got 12 now the outstanding freshman from Baltimore as I love contacts I love getting to the hoop thats the way they taught me how to play in Baltimore hes Fearless hes coming from Baltimore you you know hes Fearless hes a guy who grew up playing with contact grew up and playing in a competitive environment and you can see it when he plays here out on the floor ball was just ripped away by maluk he just ate that up how about a big man pushing it up the court himself Holtz on the deck floater nope he was fouled bumps and hell go to the line and really are another thing that makes Florida State you know so good is all these different guys that they can throw at You Off the Bench you know we talked about in previous years henard Hilton is playing 12 guys in the game and everyones capable of getting seven points or more you talk about whos can be that third guy but if you have 12 guys with eight points or more youre going to be in pretty good shape for so many years thats what they hung their hat on heres next Saturdays AC Network mens basketball triple header Clemson host Florida State at Little John starting us off two

dont know if it was the Rochester shout out or what but hes playing extra confident with the Step Back Lean Back a little it doesnt matter hold it up and knock it down you know why wheres number seven Jerry D tell me because of Carmelo Anthony cuz its a its a heck of a player to model your game after one of the greats one of the Syracuse greats but one of the alltime greats Hall of Famer see how we tie that in together its good story Laughter telling Chandler Jackson at the line Chandlers got six points a steady Defender for Florida State Florida States in the bonus with 1026 left to play in

Florida State shirt if the Nolls win I promise I would wear Syracuse Orange Im a man of my word if if Florida State wins I will wear a Florida State shirt and then I have extra shirt to work out in there you there you go Taylor trying to prevent Eric from having to do that cuts the lead to nine maluk NOP pretty move finish not there rebound cuse the orange need a run to try and get back into this thing this is something Syracuse need to do we know Florida State likes to play with place but Pace excuse me but Syracuse needs to get up and play with pace and try to get these easy opportunities instead of playing against this length in half court Starling flose it oh the rim not kind Malo rebounds it hell push was 611 pushing the basketball feed inside and easy two pushing the basketball passing ahead not giving up getting it back under the ren finishing alier maluk the cousin of bbo whos on the Phoenix sons and the nephew of manul South Sudanese descent about what South Sudan did in the Olympics this summer incredible some unbelievable talent coming out of there Freeman got a good look from the top of the keate didnt connect Florida States up 11 trying to push this thing into a comfortable Applause lead ball rotation Holt dang thought about the three ball in the deck he attacks midrange steps through back door cut holds H lays it in Freeman sagged off him right at the rack and the nlls now lead by 13 great job by hold just moving without the basketball just because you dont have the basketball in your hands dont mean you cant be involved in the play Florida straight extended you put him on any team and hes a immediate game changer saw highlights of what he was doing against Team USA this summer little pull up he hit on Lebron and on ad thats when you know yeah its real hes talented hes skilled but his confidence is Sky High when you have that combination it you know sky the limit cuse needs baskets in a hurry still some time under eight minutes though now Freeman fouls hell go to the line and again its good you want to see free be aggressive and get to the free throw line but look where hes starting with the basketball hes all the way out by the threepoint line two dribbles three dribbles four dribbles by that time the defense of Florida State everything is set now youre forced to take a tough shot you want to be able to get it in that mid post area free throw line area and then make a quick decision rip and go or shoot the shot or you know keep the play Applause going but nonetheless I mean Donnie Freeman is one of the best young players in this ACC and and really the country hes had a the Stellar season so far for Syracuse hes averaging 15 in his last eight contests for red atres orange only had seven against Q in the last game now has 10 back in the double figures with six rebounds as well trims that deficit to 11 Syracuse right here showing a little bit of Zone trying to Florida State out in the perimeter Force some jump shots this is what I remember about keeps has the turn to go then how about maluk alir maluk the sevenfooter shows you traits of a guy who while still developing become a pretty nice player down the line FL state has done a really good job this second half of moving the basketball you know how do you break down the zone you have to move the basketball you have to get it in the gaps see the short corner and the High post area Flor State just doing a good job contining to move the ball and getting opportunities at The Rim maluke should be in High School 17 years old when he stepped foot on campus reclassed to join Leonard Hamilton Squad this season its hard to imagine that theres a bigger team in the nation than Florida state but I guess Duke has that title right do yeah Florida States top five and usually in the top five every single year under coach ham zone defense again forces a Miss rebound collected the orange down 13 Bell has been hot tonight why not his four three Syracuse has to pick up the defensive pressure you see right here with the L full court pressure dropping back into the zone and timeout lonard Hamilton time out Florida be a quick one Nolls by Ted both teams looking for their first AC see in of the year Music Florida State by 10 qes would love to get Chris Bell going on the season tonight hes done a good job of knocking him down no hesitation when you get when you get a sliver of space of your Chris Bell that thing has to go up hes one of the best Shooters in the ACC one of the best Shooters in the country and Syracuse is going to need a few more of them to get back in the game versus Florida State Bell did have 22 points against Texas Tech its a season High earlier this year and you saw flashes of what he did last season but having a penetrator right that can collapse a defense and allow him to get some open shots will be the key now with Starling well it definitely helps him and you know hes a guy thats not really a guy who creates on his own but hes more than capable of getting 20 points every single game hes a guy who could put it on Deck with one or two dribbles and knock down the mid range as well but he excels at shooting the threepoint shot that could have gone either way there Watkins extended his arm Taylor fell to the ground at the top of that two three Zone instead a blocking foul is called and Watkins will go to the line for two again we talked about it you know earlier Taylor had that foul 5et away from you know behind the threepoint line against Watkins you dont need to follow up there you just want to play solid defense be there on the shooters and keep guys in front of you Watkins misses the free Applause throw he had been four for four on the night he was shooting better than 90 in his last five contests from the charity stre starlake three ball Taylor thats a big shot and thats another thing that Syracuse is missing a guy who can create for somebody else JJ Starling great job of getting into the teeth of the defense and Lucas Taylor with the quick trigger knocking it down C has hit nine threes now tonight they Trail by seven Watkins jab step against this zone three ball straight away oh my goodness Watkins pulling and connecting thats a big three ball and I Syracuse will live with that if youre knocking it down its theres really nothing you could do Syracuse will live with Watkins taking that shot and great players make tough shots hes got 11 now Florida As got three players with 12 Davis bow and Yan Freeman open three he connects its a threeparty here in this second half now defensively Syracuse you saw him make one now you got to shade up a little bit higher you got to watch that middle of the floor thats where you can really attack the zone five minutes to play Watkins back to the line thats a three Bonanza huh yeah good job by Starling just getting into the teeth of the defense quick trigger right there by Taylor Knocking it down and great players make tough shots again Syracuse who live with that but Watkins knocking it down and Donnie Freeman coming back down said hey I can play that game to Ed if I told you C would be 10 for 24 from Beyond The Arc for 42 now Florida State seven of 18 for 39 two of the worst threepoint shooting teams in the conference AR I understand the percentages I get all that but this is high level college basketball these guys are capable of knocking down shots and if you give anybody on the floor an open shot theyre capable of knocking it down and you know both teams doing a great job tonight of taking what the other team has giv them and taking advantage of the opportunities and knocking down shots Watkins five for six tonight from the line bricks that one its an eightpoint advantage for the NOS that nowers Jinx or five for six yeah thats not a JX at all yeah theyre going to add that to my KD highlight arent they of things I didnt do wrong not a good play right there by Freeman thats a critical turnover four and a half to go the NOS have Force 13 of them they do it better than anyone in the AC picking apart that zone foul called dequin Applause Davis that was a good Zone Break by the noes we talked about getting to the middle of that of that zone free throw line are and how about Malik Yan in his passing ability hes talking about Eddie lampin in his passing ability but Malik Yan he had two or three no look passes just knowing where the guy is supposed to be in a great job by Davis playing behind the Syracuse Zone you can get behind especially when theyre lifted so high and another chance for Florida State at the free throw line Music Davis will have two shots hes got 12 couple of rebounds and an Applause assist knocks down the first tune in to acpm with Mark Packer and Taylor tanom weekdays at 4 Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN Music app lead extended back to double digits Davis has 14 see with lampin on the bench four fouls just a little bit easier for Florida State to get into the middle of that zone without having that big body of lampin in there darling quiet second half after seven in the first Freeman down low foul he was hacked in the ACT where they give him the free throw well they say its on the floor see he got the ball on the help side of Florida state was already there Syracuse has to recognize that somebody has to cut from the top of the key right down the middle the middle is wide open the help side is coming all the way over and Syracuse players have to recognize that help out Donnie Applause Freeman Freeman carries that first free throw hes got 14 to go along with eight rebounds remember the Bahamas National Team B there before moving to the states doesnt knock that one down Taylor bbo and grabs the rebound another double double for him second in his last three games hes got the ball here what a feed unselfish and Watkins fouled on the way up theyll go to the line and we come back Florida State leads by nine one of these two teams there a couple Choice Davis boo it Jackson has come in in cuff as well with four fouls Florida State doesnt have a player with more than two fouls in the game and Watkins who lives at the free throw line has attempted seven tonight will have two more s you hear coaches say all the time play defense without foul well Florida state has done an incredible job of doing that just being active flying around and theyve done a really good job of getting into the teeth of that Syracuse defense and being able to finish to the rim and give themselves a lot of opportunities at the free throw line as well and Watkins guilty of a foul on Freeman silly foul right there by Watkins speak on those turnovers right that defense for Florida stand activity wise they forced 13 Qs turnovers and theyve gotten 15 points off those turnovers and the thing about Florida State their length even if you do get by and get to that spot its like theyre still there I mean its like a Go Go Gadget arm is still in your face right there so the shot is not going to be a free shot its going to be a tough shot and Florida state is one of the best teams in the country is making up space and using that length and athleticism to be disrupted staring started this game two for three from the floor hes now two for his last 11 y through contact play on Jackson comes away with the ball y has to do a better job of being physical I mean he has to take advantage of that right there falling away from the rim you got to go into his chest to the basket Watkins with eight looking inside deflected itll go out of bounds itll stay with the noes six on the clock in Florida State right now obviously 6 seconds on the clock you you want to try to get a quick play and get a clean shot but they dont need to rush up 10 right now 3 minutes left in the game they just want to be able to get a good shot Jackson with three off the curl Al as the buzzer sounds U throws it down and already I saw I thought he was going to go for the shot because it was only one second left on the clock but I mean just throw it anywhere around the basket the you hes going to grabb it an explosive athlete is Malik U and hes got 14 Rising Fire not there Watkins cleans the glass Florida State start to smell Applause it Watkins attacks nope rebound movich and Syracuse has to go they have to start playing with some more urgency right now get to the basket like that there you theres that leg full forward denied by B Bowen NOS want to run B Bowen attacks floats it and scores on both sides of the ball Taylor B Bowen have a night I mean b b to have a game like this this could change the trajectory of his season confidence is at another level right now when you play like this doing it on both ends of the floor run down blocked and running down on the other end and finish Florida State leads the ACC in blocks another one here from bbo look at buo coming all the way from the other side of the floor and then having the awareness to run down the floor the offense in gather the ball and finish at the basket have yourself a basketball in the game tonight B Bowen doing it on both ends of the floor B Bowen of sudin descent his parents fleeing during the Civil War he was born in a refugee camp in Egypt when the Bowen family had adopted him in Jericho Vermont a town of 5000 his brother Deng also played at Vermont college basketball Bobo and so proud of his suing he descent but hes had the opportunity here in the states to excel as a Hooper you love hearing those stories of guys overcoming adversity and then making something out of theel great game tonight by B bow and an even better young man NOS by 13 under two to play frean COD Watkins number one on number one crme really right now AR all Florida state has to do is knock down their free throws it looks like they you know they got this one in the bag and and still you you got to give Syracuse some credit I I think they did a good job of of competing and I think we all knew JJ Starling was going to come back and have 30 but did he come back and make an impact yes absolutely he came in he was aggressive and kept the Syracuse basketball team in it for a good portion of the game I mean Florida State just too tough defensively theyre disruptive they got their hands everywhere theyre active and then once theyre able to get deflections theyre out you know theyre playing at their Pace theyre playing Above the Rim and were getting easy opportunities you got technical fouls looks like on both cuse and Florida State some jawing going on at the free throw strike hey Im not Im okay with it hey anybody who used to watch me play I loved a little bit of John back and forth so it just makes the game fun obviously we dont want to get let it get out of hand but guys are competing at a high level and sometimes tempers are going to get out of control but its a part of the game another frustrating night for cuse as Starling has his shot block theyre going to give it goal tending so you can count that 8370 now for Aus Team Ed return the calendar year and entered the new year with a sub 500 record for the first time since the 1969 19 70 season on the verge of starting 0 and three for the first time since 2015 a lot of basketball Left Right 17 League games left you get Starling back yeah and continue to try and find answers yeah look its been a tough season for Syracuse basketball and again we talked about it earlier in the game and we know how the Syracuse fan base is love the Syracuse fans Ive been in Syracuse since 2005 and we know how passionate the community is they they cant wait for winter to come because of Syracuse basketball but in this new landscape of college basketball with the turnover and all the different players you have I dont know if they really understand how difficult it is to get these guys to come in and buy into what you know the coaches are trying to do you know coming from different schools where their roles were different we talked about a guy like jayquan Carlos coming from hastra you know now hes coming to Syracuse Eddie Lin coming from Colorado like these guys if you look at the averages theyre averaging just what they average at the school said they were at so really theyre doing as much as they can its just you know I I understand the fan base I I I get it but I think red has done a great job in his obviously in his first year getting 20 wins and look youre going to hear the back and forth youre going to youre going to hear people say oh he should be fired but this is his second year give the guy a break let him figure it out let him get some players in he has a great recruiting class coming in next year and and not to mention Carmelo Anthony son that bringing a lot of hype to the Syracuse program so it takes time the jump ball possession arrow to cuse look on an I like tonight Chris Bell score 16 maybe refound his shooting touch you look for pieces that can come together with Starling back as he continues to get healthier where does this Q team go from here look its a positive that you have your best player back on the floor and even when he was on the floor they were still struggling you know they were just getting by against these mid major teams but again patience like let these guys figure it out they have to get you know their guys in there and look theyre not going to quit its a long season left you think these players dont want to lose either you know they want to go out and have a have a good show going for themselves and for their fans and just hasnt been you know going their way this season good foul there on movich a painful way to go out Watkins was looking to put someone on a poster and it looked like Watkins was going to get a little bit of that but hes dishing it out I mean he 6 seven 210 lbs hes coming down the lane I said a running back more like a linebacker hes a guy hes a guy who has a chance to play at the next level and got a got a chance to talk to Watkins a quiet kid but really good kid comparisons to Caris LeVert right on the Cavs with the way he might be able to impact an NBA team its so versatile length the defense versatility to handle the rock can shoot the three thats why he came back to Florida state was to improve that number and show NBA Scouts and hes just so strong going downhill very tough to go look at the next level hes going to have to be able to defend I mean his size is you know his best attribute right now at the guard position 67 210 lbs hes versatile he could guard multiple positions but hes going to have to continue to improve his jump shot you to really be effective at the next level almost like a you know a three and D guy on his way to being a first team all ACC member averaging nearly 20 a game another foul this one on cuff and hes done thats five what do you make of this nolles team on the flip side for FSU a team that nine wins they dont have any bad losses on their resume its been a decent team not one that has flashed or been incredible against the good teams they played on their schedule but theyve taken care of business against the teams theyre supposed to whats their offer yeah first of all I love coach Hamilton just being able to talk to him talk to the guys like you know coach baheim and those type of coaches Roy Williams coach Hamilton just be a fly on the wall and listen to all the stories that they have but I mean to have this versatility this length and this athleticism I mean this Florida State team is a team that could come in and and win big games in this ACC conference and if theyre active if theyre getting out and transition and playing at their Pace man look therere a team that can be that has to be reckoned with you know as they get further into this ACC conference play talk about the real estate available in the ACC to make a run and climb those standings this will be a site thats welcome to nlls fans hoping to see a program thats made in the Elite 8 multiple sweet 16s under coach Hamilton try and get back to that level Florida state was one of the best programs in the ACC Guided by a Hall of Fame coach in Leonard amilton and look I think the defensive part they they have that right they they just want to bring consistency you know to that part of the game and then they have seven threes tonight if they can find some more consistency shooting the basketball and look this Florida State team is they got some going Freeman connects nos trying to break the Press Christian needu into the game Throw It Up There It Is swi the hammer I look he got a guy in the middle of the press hes 7 foot pushing the ball and then he throws alive right there to your freshman and need to hard racing over 150 beats per minute no doubt commits the foul there I mean come on new right the guy 7 foot pushing the break right there throwing it up to your freshman guard catching it you know finishing Above the Rim sweating another guy whos super talented a young fella out of DC theres so much talent on this Florida State roster Bell continues a strong night hes got 17 now a bright spot for C and and if you want to take some positive away for Syracuse thats one of them right there getting Chris Bell back on track because without Chris Bell Syracuse is half the team that they that they want to be they they need Chris Bell in the game they need him make making shots they need him confident Florida State 90 to 74 lead theyll run out this clock a lot of fun my friend good game between the Nos and the orange all right man Ill wear the shirt Im going to wear it all right Im going wear it and then Im going to cut the sleeves and then Im going to wear it to workout in and then
