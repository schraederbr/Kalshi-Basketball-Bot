PJ Hall versus Steven Clark in the opening tap controled by Carolina in the all black uniforms Clemson and the home wies and Clemson starts in the manto Applause man heres mil sty the transfer from Vanderbilt the spin and too strong Dan lets talk about Keys tonight what do you like both teams shoot the three very well neither team turns it over very much and I think those two facets are going to be very important for this game first touch for PJ Hall going to work on Clark hes short and Clark the rebound Hall looked like he had a couple more dribbles he could have gotten closer that time and thats going to be a dilemma for South Carolina how do you defend Hall down there do you let Clark play him oneonone they did that time and they had success game cops have been outstanding in the transfer portal the starting five tells you that Clark who came in from the citel connecting from downtown now when were talking about their threepoint Shooters we W arent really thinking about him thats his second make on his third attempt you give him that much time he can knock it down H inside the response and thats where hes going to have a problem I dont think hes big enough to handle PJ Hall that close to the basket tigerss big acquisition in the offseason Joe Gerard III who came from Syracuse after four quality seasons in the Empire State and he has paid immediate dividends from threepoint range and in the assist category as well early for Brad Brownell shot clock down to five heres BJ Mack in the big fella connects and Mack for South Carolina presents the same kind of problems hes a guy who can shoot the three he can muscle his way to the basket hes a trans grad transfer from wford hes got all the skills down on the inside he is going to be a problem for Ian sheflin tonight well in a state thats known for its football more than anything else the basketball fans have showed up in droves and its important to point out here little John Clemson students still on campus that kind of assists in the atmosphere much in the same way South Carolina students were on campus at this time in this game a year ago Hunter logic Clark another rebound is second and Hunter comes in as a 38 threepoint Applause shooter Mei Johnson the Euro and the finish that was some tough move and hes attacking Joe Gerard and remember Joe Gerard spent the last four years at Syracuse where they didnt play a lot of manto man its a lot of two3 Coach beheim PJ Hall no mil sty the rebound so Clemson starting out cold from Beyond The Arc Applause early Mei Johnson thats a three and its 10 to2 game Cs and Johnson he shoots 40 from out there his last two games hes been averaging 26 and a half per game really good start by South Carolina four for five from the floor Clemson just one of four and Gerards been bottled up early shot clock down to five Hall sensing that in sheelin the rebound and a press 20 Gerard for three I think Clark got that shefflin and Mack on the deck and a jump ball itll stay on this Applause end we told you Mei Johnson is a 40 threepoint shooter and if you get up on him to try to stop the three he can go right by you and actually he didnt go by Joe Gerard that time he went through him thats one way to do it yep absolutely off the screen Chase Hunter PJ Hall in the offensive glass and a chance for Applause three Clark called for his first personal one of the things thaten happens when you drive the basket hes got three guys on him and nobody blocks out PJ Hall and talk about strength there was four black shirts around Hall and hes still able to get it to go almost 6 11 from spart andberg South Carolina chance for three the Hard Way Off the Mark Josh gray just checking in the transfer from U the rebound gray had played a whole lot this year hes big hes strong he presents some real physical challenges for the Tigers we talked to Lamont Paris about the possibility of gray getting more PT tonight to help contend with PJ Hall in Clemson size he said yep thats a possibility shot clock down to five ton Cooper a little shake a little bake a little Up and Under thats tough Wiggins has a size advantage and Wiggins is every bit as quick as Cooper outside the hall thats a three and its good thats going to be hard for Josh gray to cover hes just not fast enough to stay with PJ Hall hes got to play off in case Hall drives around Applause it PJ Hall has scored all seven of Clemsons points a steel by shein Wiggins thinking about it and hit it a onepoint game it appears based on the start of this game that were going to have some points scored that was our educated guest coming Applause in heres gray with position strong finish with a left in and thats going to be a problem for PJ Hall so this is a really interesting matchup on both ends of the Court gray is just so big and so strong if they can get him that ball and thats close to the basket its going to be hard Hall too strong last bucket by grce sto a seven nothing Clemson Music Applause run jacobe right on the floor one in black Music shefin what a great rebound by sheflin he left his area went right in front of gray and grabbed that ball heres Gerard bumps and a foul a physical start and entertaining start in PJ Hall doing PJ Hall things this shot from downtown and its a one possession game early tail the tape early were talking quad one record Stan but hey it means something and especially when it comes to selection Sunday well now of course the net rankings quad one all that its not set in stone until after the seasons over but what this tells you is these are two really good teams we talked about the threepoint shooting theyre both excellent threepoint shooting teams Clemson has started out one for four South Carolina has knocked down both of their threepoint attempts what could be a quad one Victory now could be a different quadrant coming up later in the season coming up Saturday December 16th the college basketball quadruple header that starts at noon Eastern are two featured games Vermont and Virginia Tech at 4 followed by nor Eastern and Virginia at 6 both right here on the ACC Network and also on the app onepoint game Gamecock basketball both teams showcasing their depth early in the game Roy I mean they honestly go 8 n 10 Deep wouldnt you say absolutely Mack a control finish and a bump and a foul and thats a problem for Clemson because Mack is a guy when he sets that screen he can roll the basket he can pop out and that time he just left and BOS Lia didnt realize that he had left and Clemson actually talked about that he didnt really set a screen he just slipped out of there and hes I mean he can catch it inside he is so skilled offensively BJ Matt checking in for the Tigers RJ Godfrey Ian sheflin Gets a breather one more free throw for BJ Mack the Whopper transfer played well against Clemson in previous meetings with the Terriers hes got three points so far tonight some guys come up from that level and they dont it takes them a while to adjust not Mack Mack has played very very well one of two at the stripe laa from the Netherlands claims the Applause Music rebound Dylan Hunter on the floor good look to light up double teams up in Roy he made that one a lot harder than it had to be you got to catch that one and go right up but it doesnt matter because he got two now PJ Halls primary backup you get scoring from him thats a bonus for Brad Brownell well hes in there to guard and rebound sty missed everything the ball did not hit the Applause rim Gerard has it talk about threepoint shooting study at Vanderbilt made 74 threes last year and 78 the year before yeah two seasons ago St led the SEC in that department Dylan Hunter sty the rebound neither one of these teams is a great offensive rebounding Music Applause team outside to ma Friendly Fire almost cost the Tigers a rebound Gerard has yet to get involved in the scoring column what a pass fre throws coming and Clemson a chance to gain its first Applause lead now Gerard is a guy hes noted for his scoring but he can really pass the ball and this is just a situation where Lea gets inside and gets in front of Mack and I think Mack just underestimated him and if youre Lamont Paris you do not want BJ Mack committing a foul against boss boss Li coming up Sunday afternoon a womens basketball double header here on acc and two coost Florida G Coast thats up first at noon Eastern then Kentucky and Louisville top 20 Cardinals back in Action both also available on the ESPN now foul was CAU on Mack L it back to the stripe Clemson with its first lead and its at A Mir point you made the point on Gerard think about it he played at Syracuse under Jim beheim with the beheim brothers chances already had to learn how to pass the basketball knowing how well they shot back not only they were good Shooters but their dad was the coach on the bench telling him to pass the ball it all adds up8 minutes in Johnson for three and he connects Gamecocks back in front and Mei Johnson off to a fantastic start once again thats a tough match up for Li hes got eight the transfer from Ohio State LA for Lia in traffic the triple pump B Mack outstanding d again lighted did not catch that one cleanly but a good job by Mack on the floor for Carolina Colin Murray boils thats a good sign if youre a fan of the Garden in Black one of the top high school prospects in the country from Columbia up and in and thats one of the reasons why well hes 67 and Dylan Hunter is a couple inches smaller than that and so thats a nice job to find that mismatch PJ Hall set to check back in for Clemson Godfrey with position and against the Freshman short Murray Bo just did a great job holding his ground cuz godfried he can really score on the inside Murray Bos expected to start for South Carolina at the beginning part of the Season suffered from a terrible case of mono lost 20 pounds and really just getting his feet underneath them its only played in one game before tonight hes expected to have a big role this evening go laa not really his specialty has yet to attempt the three this year off the double team a steel by Johnson ahead blocked at the rack and it was clean on Murray Bo Hunter Applause theyre going to have to get some oxygen out here for laa he had he made that second free throw he to come out of the game PJ Hall has been sitting over there for a while and laa is really sucking win still waiting for the Under 12 media timeout by the way Davis off the high ball screen over to Johnson and another three well clearly you cannot give him as much room as he has had tonight you risk him driving to the Bas but youd much rather risk the two than the threes that he is just burying Clemson calls a timeout Mei Johnson already with 11 three more here and the Gamecock leading Clemson by seven on the road deep runs in the NCA tournaments hes actually pretty good friends with Brad brenell Clemsons head coach now in year 14 here in tigertown and the two got to know each other recruiting the Midwest back in the early 2000s and it was Lamont that sent bratex back in the middle of the summer and said coach we need to get get together and play some golf again they couldnt find the right time to do it but Im told by both head coaches Dan at some point in the near future they want to get it out maybe uh go to the links and and play 18 well not in the near future but some point in the future lets go maybe May or June Gerard up and in he forced it up and thatll stop an 8 nothing run for Carolina that is one of the most underrated aspects of Joe Gerards game he is a really good postup guy but somehow Clemson has to find a way to stop Mei Johnson hes made all four of his shots three of them threes hes got a couple of assists inside the Freshman Murray Bo AC Florida high school graduate in Columbia his first significant minutes of the season and already four points and so far in this game South Carolina doing about whatever they want on the offensive end heres Gerard five quick on the board for 11 in white and hes saying he was fouled Gerard can really put points up on the board quickly stey the back door cut travel really good help defense that time by Clemson study was open but the defense collapsed degree of difficulty on this shot Dan well this is a tough shot but Joe gerardi keeps that pivot foot and as I said hes got some skills down in the post and he showed you right there somewhat of a lost start for a 62 guard to be able to back you down to the post even if the defender is is taller uhoh toy Wiggins no PJ Hall yes twopoint game now Wiggins is a guy who can shoot the three they encourage him to shoot to three that one was a little bit wide of the mark nice rebound by Applause Hall miles sty step back triple and Gerard the rebound that was really good defense by shefflin shefflin on the other end the spin and the Finish tied to 23 what a great response by Clemson a nine to2 run Johnson shefin clears nearly lost his balance how did he keep his pivot CP chefin does so many things little things on a basketball court s rebounds his last game out at pit on Sunday Dan well 14 the game before that hter Murray poils the rebound this game has lived up to its billing so far and a foul now what on who well a stoppage in play it goes against Clemson its getting loud in Little John tied at 23 650 remaining in first half its time to shake up the season and get something a little different de Rick Bagby went to Jimmy Vs basketball camp back in 1983 which just happened to be the year survive in advance in the national championship we like to give Rick Bagby a quick shout out here so the camp obviously didnt take he didnt make it as a basketball he did not TV producer and for that were thankful great picture a basketball cards got to be worth some money one day heres jacobe right out of the timeout Hunter skies for the rebound and here comes Clemson Gerard lefthanded attempt no better defense by Cooper that time Dan does it feel like to you these two teams have kind of settled in a little bit of a rhythm at least defensively now but defensively I would say yes offensively theyre still theyre not struggling a little bit but they havent neither team has found a rhythm except Mei Johnson what a pass missed the chippy got Frey Off the Music Mark BJ Mack attacking in finishing W PJ Hall just he he wasnt in good defensive position and he was trying to avoid a foul so nice job by Mack to attack I see what you did there Gamecocks by two Ma has five heres gy back to the basket no boy hes had two Point Blank Range opportunities in the last two possessions sty thought about it and was bottled up by Godfrey ripped away by Hall well yes I think theyve settled in defensively feels that way 173rd meeting between between these two Gamecock won in Columbia last year was 60 58 in a last second bucket by Chico Carter Hunter noson ice cold from three so far well Hunter is 0 for five shooting 0 for two from three but South Carolina 11 of their 23 points have come from Mei Johnson heres right bumped and stripped no foul call 14 to shoot Music you know BJ Mack is a guy who can shoot the three and PJ Halls worried that hes going to shoot the three so he runs out hes in poor defensive position and Hall just goes excuse me Mack just goes right by him PJ Hall just one personal foul so far thats something to watch tonight but you dont want to get two in that particular situation youd like to get into the half if youre PJ Hall with just the one shot clock under five right against Dylan Hunter off the pump bake each team during this last few minutes has taken tough shots and its hard to shoot a high percentage when youre taking tough ones sheflin who has five rebounds back to work and a LD on the basket on this end of the Court thats a shot that sheflin usually makes and that was an open shot were talking about taking tough shots that was a good one Clark off the screen haul the rebound been stuck at 2523 for the last two minutes sheflin against Mack Big Man game Mack won that battle I dont think sheins teammates helped him very much much when the ball is inside and youre drawing that much attention your teammates have to find open spots sheins a good passer hell find you Cooper outside to Music ma the price of admission right here its worth it watching these two outside to Davis thats a Music three Davis is long and athletic and hes not one of the best threepoint Shooters but hes now 5 for 12 on the season and thats nothing to sneeze at Gamecocks five of 11 from behind the threepoint Arc so far tonight Gerard well Gerard he disgusted with that one that one was down and came out and that thats one of Gerards best moves that step back there from Beyond the threepoint Applause Arc back against sheelin he walked and he did no bucket game Cops turn it over Clemson basketball when we come back but how about Zachary Davis stand from downtown in this sequence its a great pass by Mack you see hes got three guys around him Davis is wide open South Carolina doing it from three low ink Easter theyll continue talking college football have the latest around the conference right here on accn and the ESPN back at Little John kis Sam Dan bonoy Philpot South Carolina defensively Dan so far has done an outstanding job against a team averaging what close to 80 points per game this year we talked before the game about threepoint shooting and I think thats really been one of the big stories here in the first half South Carolina 5 for 11 Clemson two for eight and remember they both come in shooting well over shooting 40 or better tigers have missed seven straight havent scored a point in the last 5 minutes and an offensive foul thatll be called on Godfrey so his first well Godfreys trying to set a screen to get Gerard open and godfried moves in you see he throws that hip out there and he also Gerard tripped over him as well so Godfrey was in the middle of that mixup and not in a good way clean game so far in terms of turnovers Gamecocks back to work with a fivepoint lead Cooper brilliant skip pass thats another three Davis could not finish hson really needs a basket high low Godfrey no his third Point Blank Miss of the half I mean hes hes had three that are right there and theyre theyre not uncontested but you get your big guy the ball there you expect him to score and in a game like this in particular you cant miss those types of opportunities Clark wasnt looking for the shot heres Johnson he hit a different gear it was hard to stay in front for Dylan Hunter thats his first personal again Johnson has knocked down those three threepoint shots so he just gives you the little twitch and you think hes going to rise up for the three and you try to attack him and hes got the skill to go right by SP 90 seconds remaining in our first half pair of undefeated teams going Toe to Toe Mack draws a double team Cooper off the fake outside to Clark Josh Beetle and bounce pass was picked off beautifully by Johnson thats the wrong pass he should have passed the ball to PJ Hall but he took one too many dribbles and then threw it away and a Timeout on the floor called by Lamont Paris well take one with him back in 30 seconds here in Clemson 2823 less than a minute to go and our first half at Little John Dan boner Roy Philpot score tells the story in the sense that South Carolina has put the clamps down the same brth Clemson has missed a couple of opportunities Dan you would think more times than not they would connect on but now almost seven minutes a sevenminute scoring drought for the Tigers here and one thing that Ill have to tell you theres not really a lot wrong with the Clemson defense either South Carolina scores well over 70 points a game and its only 28 at this point Johnson against Chase Hunter Cooper defended by Gerard beautiful spinoff glass 30 to 23 thats a tough matchup we talked about Cooper and his skills another off offensive foul thats Hall thats number two I think its Gerard setting the screen and it was but again thats twice now that Clemson has turned it over on offensive to foul setting illegal screens so the wheels have sort of come off here for the Tigers in the last 8 minutes shot clock is off Carolina can now play for the final possession here of the half an impressive showing on the road round two of the ACC SEC challenge if you Applause will Max rejected by Godfrey hell get it back swatted again tigers with time Beetle Stripped by Johnson and thatll do it for our first 20 minutes the Tigers go nearly eight of those minutes Gamecock let it halime in every game this year theyre a perfect seven and0 and in search of another resume building win Under seconde head coach Lamont Paris m against shein big man basketball and Mack again takes advantage inside and Joe Gerard cannot afford to drop down and help out because Mei Johnson has shot the ball so well from Applause three Ma has seven Tigers back to work thats where they need to go study thinking about the double team outside for three and a big start for the second half for Chanty Wiggins but did you notice what Wiggins did he didnt stand he scooted down a little bit to get a wideopen three both teams shooting over 40 from three on the season not tonight neither teams turned it over much clean game on that front hall the block from behind and PJ Hall when hes playing on defense against Clark when hes matched up against Steven Clark hes leaving Clark and helping out in the the middle you see Clark number four in the corner Hall just paying no attention to him gets a block second rejection for Hall shot clock under 10 Johnson was scorching hot in the first half block number three for Hall theyve got a five on four and Cooper skies for the rebound if youre Clemson youll take that shot every time tigers Three of 10 from Deep South Carolina 5 of 14 and Hall says not tonight thats his third block shot in the second half weve yet to play two minutes but again Hall is leaving Clark you see there Clark is even in your picture and thats who Hall is guarding Clark comes into the picture now and he sees Hall leave hes got to get himself in a position where they can find him Johnson for three deep shot and he bury ITN has 14 that was a long long shot and Chase Hunter hes I mean theres very few people youd defend out there mentioned Chase Hunter blocked by Clark Out of Bounds 17 on the shot clock Hunter now on the evening is hes hes Ed for six in field goals he hadnt scored a point yet and talk about a deep three I mean Chase Hunter was not even in a stance because he didnt think it was time to be in a stance now Johnson shooting over 40 now for the season from threepoint range and Dan the lead back to nine and Wiggins will shoot two again you have a situation where one of the Clemson players gets double teamed and PJ Hall that time didnt cut to the basket so Clemson really not doing a very good job off the ball finding open spots foul was called on Clark thats his second Wiggins three of six of the line this season coming up Saturday December 16th the college basketball quadruple header that starts at noon Eastern our two featured matchups the catamounts of Vermont against Virginia Tech at 4 Eastern then up next North Eastern in Charlottesville against the Wahoos next Saturday here on acc Network also in the ESPN the Clemson Tigers theyve got to dig in on the defensive end particularly against Mei Johnson hes defended by Chase Hunter the match up to watch for both sides Turn Around by Mack poked out to Cooper well I thought he was going to pull the trigger on that one oh he just watched Johnson hit one from that distance moments ago sty Clark and a chance for three and thats exactly what we were talking about that time Clark when he sees PJ Hall leave he cuts into the middle of the lane and they throw P they throw Clark the ball and PJ Hall cant recover again Hall steps in the Middle Lane not even looking at Clark and Clark does a great job getting position drawing the foul second personal on PJ hall now Clark he does not score much for South Carolina but he scored more than a thousand points when he was at the Citadel splashes home that free throw Gamecocks now Dan with her largest lead at 10 and Clark comes in averaging three points a game and hes already got seven and he goes out of the game that was a good nice job by Hall you know PJ Hall left him and blocked a couple shots and he finally made Clemson pay for it 3828 Hall defended by The Freshman hell take advantage Strong finish at the rack and with Clemsons offensive struggles thats your guy inside you need to get him the ball and you need to play through PJ hall Hall has 11 tiger show a Zone they play as theyre Play In the Zone and I think thats a concession that theyre having a hard time guarding Murray Bo shot clock at five Johnson knows it short on the Applause three theyre fortunate that one didnt going to the pit but shefflin made that pass blind Hunter somehow Coral it and now finally finishes 3832 lets see if Clemson sticks with the Zone sometimes you play as Zone because that your opponent is moving so well and it slows him down back was stripped he was fouled going up well veteran officiating crew Ron KR made that call on the far side sheelin picks up the personal Clemson was trying to push out in the zone a little bit and they found Mack in the middle and while Mack is noted for his ability to shoot the three hes very effective on the interior sounds like a 90 sitcom back in the Applause middle how quality has he been shush the crowd after making the free throw as well BJ M the wafford transfer hes got eight points and five boards but you love rivalry games South Carolina has been very impressive so far in a very tough atmosphere but Clemsons problems today have been much more on the offensive end than the defensive end they have to figure out a way to score consistently and I think the way they do it is to have PJ Hall handle the ball heres Hunter attacking and he will shoot two when we come back PJ hall 11 points to spin on Murray Bo and the lead at seven for Carolina but here you see study guarding Wiggins and the ball is going to go inside to PJ Hall and take a look at number 10 study watch what he does he tries to go down and hes trying to help out against Hall and Wiggins instead of standing outside hes going to gradually move down to a position where Hall can find him and study cant get back to him and thats exactly what you need to do play through PJ Hall Wiggins did a nice job not being a spectator there he became a participant and as a result he gets a three Chase Hunter at the stripe hes got two points tonight just one of seven from the floor 87 at the line this season its the latest in the history of this rivalry these two teams have both come in undefeated Hunter one for two and now again Clemsons got to dig in on the defensive end another back to the manto man Johnson with a step the ball movement study wide open for three and thats why you go to the Zone because the ball movement has been so good for South Carolina particularly in this second half and again study is an outstanding threepoint shooter just great player movement and ball movement first points of the night for the transfer from Vanderbilt my study lead back to nine PJ Hall to shefin rejected at the rack by Murray Bo what a Lo and on the other end a foul called South Carolina will shoot two thatll go on shefin Roy and we just showed you that replay with PJ Hall having the ball inside and godfried excuse me Wiggins going to an area where Hall could find him that time Joe Gerard did not Gerards man right went down to help out against Hall and Gerard drifted out to half court and because Gerard drifts out to half court the only option is shefin and what a great recovery by C Murray Bo you can see why theyre so enthusiastic about him he is a very skilled young man its expected to start at the four at the start of the Season we mentioned he battled mono early just came back the last game against George Washington and now Mei Johnson has 16 points tonight and he has been the difference for Carolina well and here now its an 11point game Clemson simply cant get anything going on the offensive end and South Carolinas grinding it out largest lead for the gcox off the cut Beetle no out of control and Davis help Corral that one at The Rim its been a tough night for Beetle his stats in the first half included two turnovers in a very brief stint and as you say that time just completely out of Applause control Johnson picked up by Hunter outside to Davis in and out its a relatively small lineup out there for South Carolina you got to find Hall in the low post six minutes into our second half Gerard will back him down Hunter picked up by Johnson the turnaround is there nice cut by Hunter because theres Joe Gerard playing in the low post again that time instead of shooting it he passed Applause it lead back to nine jacobe Wright against Gerard was Applause stripped inside to Wiggins nice J will that one in well nice job taking advantage of the mismatch they got the ball down the court quickly after the turnover and Wiggins was matched up against jacobe Wright and Wiggins is limping a little bit of course you always limp on the defensive end you recover on offense its amazing how that works Johnson an opening Tapped Out Back to the Tigers all right Chase Hunter finding a way to get involved offensively Dan well it has been a struggle for him and this is a situation where hes just got some room in the lane and hes able to hit that turnaround jump shot but again thats another contested shot the South Carolina Defenders have done a great job giving Clemson nothing easy have you been surprised by what South Carolina has done defensively we knew they could score coming in no not really theyve done a nice job pressuring the ball theyve got good quickness and size at just about every position and its been a tough matchup for Clemson its funny you say that because you looked at them watched them during shoot around the basic implication was they passed the eye test inside that was Godfrey they look like a basketball team theyre just any question about that great size sty a deep three and a foul committed by D us over the back really good defense by Clemson and they like we keep saying if youre going to come back youve got to do you got to start on the defensive end but you have to score on this end and Clemson has scored a couple of baskets here that changes the whole complexion of the game the Tigers on a 60 run over the last minute and a half Hunter for three Beetle was sandwiched between two Gamecocks its poked out last Touch by Carolina thats thats a break for Clemson because Hunter he had an open shot but he just isnt shooting the ball well and Im not sure that in that situation you take the ball without PJ Hall you take that shot without PJ Hall handling the ball you want every possession the ball going inside to 24 Gerard with the three he thought it should have been for it he looked right at us the a little bit of a win and a nod W hes got to be careful the next time he does that hell get called for a flop one possession game in Little John and a steal Gerards calling for a screen from Hall here it comes the step back and this place was about to come unglued if that shot fell but thats exactly what they were looking for and thats a good opportunity Hall banged offensive yeah he lowered that shoulder its starting to get loud and little John Joe Gerard the transfer from Syracuse finds the bottom of the net we got a onep possession game in tiger toown with two undefeated Rivals going toe to Music toe minutes or so the game is a lot easier when the ball goes in the basket and the ball has gone in the basket and one of the things that theyve done is theyve thrown the ball to PJ Hall theyve used screens by PJ Hall Joe Gerard has hit a couple of baskets and I think Joe Gerard is having a conversation there with the officials they told him dont you dare fall down like that again last year that would have been called a flop because it was a point of emphasis its not this year the officials have been told it has to be really egregious and I guess the guys decided it wasnt Gerard has 10 shein will feed the post and a foul inside that limited Godfrey for a moment well now were in a key point in the game here for Clemson theyve cut the lead to two but PJ Hall has gone out of the game and Clemson is now gone with a relatively small lineup third foul on Clark approaching 11 to play Godfrey inside and were tied at 44 they didnt come to help out against godfried and he is a big strong guy an 11 nothing Run for the Tigers third time weve been tied tonight Applause boy Johnson thought about it he wants it back five to shoot Cooper drains a three wow that was another deep three and hes their best percentage threepoint shooter 48 coming in Dan to your point Gamecocks have led throughout Clemson only had a brief Advantage for 24 seconds shein with a fade Applause away ma tapped out to Johnson that was a long shot with a long rebound thats a hard one to Corral Corner three by right now and a foul called against Clemson thats going to go on Godfrey and he cant believe it wow he was backing his way into Steven Clark and knocked Clark down so I mean sometimes you would not call that a foul if Clark doesnt fall down but when you when theres contact and it creates a significant advantage thats a foul and Godfrey didnt need to do that this ball goes off Godfrey you can see hes leaning in leaning in then just pushes him down so PJ Hall back in the game now just a little breather halfway home in the second its a foul on chefin Mack was not allowed to move the way in which he wanted to shefin just picked up his Music third and Brad Brownell is asking Ron GR sure if that wasnt a flagrant foul for an elbow he took a shot right in the nose in this sequence well he goes right into him and thats going to be interesting think about this youre standing and you you you put your arms down at your side and raise your arms so your hands are to 90 degree angle to your elbows out in front and you hold the basketball there and then you go out to the end of that basketball you draw a circle around you you know the front the basketball is the front your backside is the back thats your cylinder goes all the way to the from the floor to the ceiling and thats your cylinder and the defensive player cannot get in that cylinder and make contact and if theres any contact then thats a foul on the defender now the offensive player is not allowed to swing his elbow even in that situation so the question now is that contact by Ma does that rise to the level of excessive Andor unnecessary to believe g a flagrant one foul that is a very tough call for the officials the defensive foul was called first theyre now looking at the secondary sequence after that it was a bang bang play either way and its just its just a common foul on sheflin so theres no flagrant foul there see thats a tough one for the officials because the guy gets in that cylinder youve got to call the foul right away because the offensive player is going to try to defend himself and this is the situation yes theres contact there but if you notice the elbow was going from down to up so it was a vertical swing of the elbow not a horizontal swing of the elbow and usually with that vertical elbow it is not going to be a flagrant foul in that situation go back to ma against shefflin the turn around in and out sheflin the rebound grown man basketball Applause inside Beetle Clemson has the that time he used a nice PJ Hall screen very close to the basket Beatles got some quickness so theyre going to try him on Mei Johnson last lead by the Tigers at 1413 and Clark crawls the foul inside well shefflin does a nice job here he hands off gets himself stopped theres not a lot of contact there but then Beetle actually uses Clark and Hall battling inside as a screen and has a wide open Lane to the basket then PJ Hall just picked up his third does Brad Brown now will have to take him out now I dont think Brad Brown will has to take him out now hes going to PJ Hall in that situation he goes out no hes not chefin is coming out PJ Hall does not need to attack Clark that way that far outside CL has shown he can shoot the three but you just get out you get in a good defensive stance you dont try to get right up on him and pressure him and allow him to drive by so Mistake by PJ Hall results in a foul Steven Clark has doubled more than doubled his scoring output on the season tonight now with eight points and five rebounds as we said three points a game coming in Gamecocks back in front what a game Beetle feeling confident too strong with a layup he expected somebody to come and try to block the shot thats a situation just take it to the basket he made that a lot harder than it had to be and he missed a wide open layup shot clock under 10 Cooper against beetle no look dish to Clark lays it up and in and again Clark takes advantage of the fact that PJ Hall goes to the ball hes got 10 points now 109 career games at the Citadel over four years and Brad brenells going to call a timeout really good response by South Carolina after being hit by that 110 run threepoint game 812 to go in Little John and perhaps stand some friendly banter this week on the text lines between 55 and 24 no doubt back to live action threepoint game out of the timeout Wiggins drains a three and were tied again wow that was obviously a play and Wiggins theyre confident is in his ability to shoot the three even though his percentage isnt particularly High and and he looks confident shooting the thing as well at four on the season coming into tonight has two so far this evening and heres Cooper outside to Johnson thats been his spot not this time thats a great rebound by gford Godfrey Hunter the rebound the pumping Wiggins again yes wow PJ who Clark went down and remains on the hardwood I think he turned his ankle he and Chase Hunter got tangled up chy wiggin stand with the careerhigh 15 points tonight the Tigers have needed every one of them well this is after the out of bounds play hes ready to catch and shoot there you go not sure what this young mans doing after the game but it looks like hes going to have a good time and his team somehow someway Dan boner back in front of South Carolina in part because of a career Night by chy Wiggins on a night when PJ Hall Chase Hunter and Joe Gerard are both scoring below all three scoring below their season averages Chanty Wiggins has stepped up big time and the Clemson Tigers they were two for eight shooting three in the first half theyre four for seven here in the second half we talked about the importance of the threepoint shot weve sure seen it in the last few minutes Clark appears to be okay hes currently on the South Carolina bench Johnson out of the timeout is wide open and the rebound claimed by Murray bo back to Johnson another look this time makes him pay tied at 54 you just cannot give him that many open opportunities that is another great response by South Carolina Johnson has 19 five of nine from Deep see theyre playing way off godfried helping out against B on the inside heres Wiggins double team jumper good defense by the Gamecocks and I know theyre helping out against PJ Hall but I think PJ Hall he has to at least touch the ball every time down Swipe by gy he doesnt see Johnson coming heres Gerard outside to Wiggins who was not ready and the pass sailed right by his head Gerard told him where to go coming up the court and Wiggins didnt do it this is a great offensive rebound Murray Bo just gets in and he knocks down PJ Hall thats why he was able to get that rebound and Chase Hunter is not anywhere near close enough to Mei Applause Johnson Applause M to Cooper against Gerard shot clock down to six the double team 42 seconds on the shot clock itll stay with South Carolina thats a break for South Carolina because Cooper I dont know what he was doing but he got himself down there in the midst of four white shirts not able to take a look at that one heres PJ Mack against Applause shefin and a foul on the floor against the Tigers itll be shein theyre they may look at this to see whether or not the foul occurred before the shot clock expired this a big call either way shein number four for the Tigers just picked up his fourth foul the question is is now not whether he got it off but whether the foul occurred before the expiration of the shot clock well Mack and sheelin have been going at each other all night Applause tonight that initial look makes me think it was a little closer than I originally anticipated and Dan you made the point its not when the shot goes up its when the foul was committed when the foul occurs twoot com its a two shot foul so the officials have decided that that foul occurred before the EXP expiration of the shot clock and look up on top the top at the top of your screen thats the official clock and sheflin is battling inside and it looks like it looks like that foul Im not theyre talking about it being a one andone I think because I if the foul occurred before I think the foul occurred before the shot if its a shooting foul I it occurred after the clock expired game cops are in the bonus 17 foul called against one and one okay thats the right call back two a four at the line make it three of five and that is a really tough break for the Clemson Tigers but you got to tip your hat to ma he just hung in there Cooper got him in trouble in the first place getting surrounded down there they got the inbounds pass to Mack and he just mused his way into getting that foul BJ ma started 69 games at wer average over 16 points and five boards per game last year two for two at the line but but as you said maybe the biggest part of that whole thing is the fourth foul on shefflin has been held in check tonight for the most part until now Clemson back in front by Applause one Murray boils for three shapin the rebound now mck is down you got to push Gerard wants it sheelin has it and J it home inside the Davis and the response I that they just did a great job moving the ball with all that crowd noise they had a mismatch with Gerard against Mack but they didnt ever get there didnt need to sheflin to Wiggins they got to get the ball to the other side so PJ Hall can get involved heres Chase Hunter shock lock down to seven Hall gets a touch Hall driving and a blocking foul called on Applause Carolina Ian sheet making things happen for the Tigers after a quiet start five quick points and the Tigers lead their Rivals by one EAS followed by number 18 Louisville against Kentucky in another rivalry match up both games also on the ESPN Dan boner Roy Philpot onepoint game rivalry matchup here in the paleto state at Little John Coliseum in the second half has been a different story so far for the Tigers stand 6 1 Ive already scored 36 points after only 23 in the first half we talked about the fact that this is a good offensive team theyve been very good offensively in the second half shaplin looking at Hall knock down to six Hall double team jump hook no well that I mean Hall is going to make that shot more times than not but its been very difficult South Carolina defensively is doing a great job preventing PJ Hall from getting the ball early in the clock keep in mind chefin has four fouls Johnson hit another gear and the pass picked off by Applause Hall Here Comes Hunter up and in its only Hunter third field goal of the night and that was a big one in transition Hunter has seven the lead at three ties Clemsons Applause Music largest Mack between the legs shock clck under Music five foul inside was it Wiggins or shefin lets see Wiggins I mean the battle inside has been ferocious here in this second half and heres Murray Bo again who just does a great job getting position and Wiggins if Wiggins just stands there then he doesnt get the foul but Wiggins moves into him and moves him out of the way I mean he had him blocked out under the basket he didnt need to foul him first free throw in the career of Murray boils he splashes it home coming up tonight at the conclusion of our game the nothing but net crew will break everything down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of all the mens games look ahead to the best games coming up on the schedule in this coming week thats coverage you can only find in one place right here on acc Network and the ESPN now one for two for Murray Bo Music big possession for Clemson boy Murr Bos really going against PJ Hall Hunter to sheet against Mack Wiggins for three hul the rebound Paul will shoot two that is Big Time rebound right there by PJ Hall Tigers now in the bonus Murray Bo just picked up his second foul Murray Bo has been very impressive particularly on the defensive end hes been going up against PJ Hall and has made it very difficult to throw the ball in there to it PJ hall 11 points eight rebounds tonight make it 12 and he got there because of a great job rebounding the ball he just goes straight up and thats exactly what you have to do when Murray Bo gets him pushing him with the body but thats just great job positioning himself and then not going over the back by PJ Hall reigning ACC player of the week one of two at the line it one of three shein chases down the rebound how many good things does sheflin do hes got eight boards tonight Dan out of their motion offense shot clock at five Hunter for three and he buried Music it Murray boils inside against Hunter hell shoot two and the foul is against hunter that ball sort of slides out of PJ Hall hands but gret it great job by sheflin to come across the lane quickly and Chase Hunter he struggled all night long thats what you call a big time screen and he knocks down that three off the dribble Murray Bo one of three at the line and if you look up the phrase blue guy in the dictionary in sheins face would be right there its what he does he just does a little bit of everything he seems to sense what his team needs in any given situation and he produces it over for two tigers have their largest lead and then turn it over off the rebound attempt well CJ see Chase Hunter went after that ball when theres no reason for him to shefflin had it and so it was over the back Hunter going over sheins back and theyre laughing about it Clemson Trail tonight excuse me Dan by as many as 11 points they now lead it by six every time Clemson has made a run at him South Carolina has responded PJ Hall comes out of the game Dylan Hunter comes in its in reaction to a smaller lineup thats in the game now for South Carolina me Johnson in traffic I think shefin got a piece of that the put back is there the lead back to four and a timeout called by Lamont Paris 30se second timeout will step aside and Clemson back in 30 seconds ourselves after this with eBay authenticity guarantee its checked by experts every Stitch tag and Logan fourpoint lead for number 24 Clemson trying to improve to8 and0 and continuing this fast start best start for the Tigers since 2008 now during that time out The League cut to four whats Brad brell telling his team here well Brad brell is trying to react hes got to figure out who theyve got in the game first of all he took PJ Hall out because of the smaller lineup and I think the big thing hes telling them guys were doing a pretty good job defend defending the first shot but South Carolina has gotten some offensive rebounds and LaMont Paris second season in Columbia and so what theyre going to try to do its Clemsons ball and so what you want to do is you want to get the ball up the court you dont want to go quickly but you want to take a good shot you dont want to wait until the end of the 30second shot clock necessarily I think if PJ Hall is in the game then the object is to get PJ Hall involved at least early in the shot clock and if youre South Carolina are you willing to play this possession out or do you yes absolutely okay not ready to turn it into a foul Fest wiggin sheflin Gerard Hunter and PJ Hall back on the floor so you know they talked about what they want to do on the offensive end and I think it involves getting the ball to PJ Hall early not necessarily for him to shoot but you get the ball to Hall and you play off of him but then defensively they were talking about the fact you know once we stop him we got to get the ball Wiggins has to go the 5sec violation and a costly turnover and Brad Brown now is telling him call timeout tigers have one remaining and a 30 second timeout as well so two overall Hunter comes back in haul to the bench you know sometimes it gets down to just the very basic things you got to get the ball in bounds something as simple as that but its not very simple right then now BJ Mack is back in the game and so Hall is going to come back in so no time went off the clock there Hall forced to stay on the Applause court game Cops get it back BJ Mack is wide open shefin the rebound that was a big Miss and shefin bowed over the Applause back mil study just picked up his first personal and shefflin has not been to the line a lot hes 10 for 12 though so hes a pretty good free throw shooter but its a one andone opportunity in sheflin came the top ranked high school basketball program in the state of Georgia over at Grayson he was teammates with chony Wiggins big free throws hes got nine points and nine boards so far miss the free Music throw under a minute to Applause go Johnson chin rebound number 10 got to keep the ball moving here and Gerard chws up about five seconds before finally getting fouled and were still its still a one and one thats only team foul number nine and Gerard is an excellent free throw shooter but we just saw an excellent free throw shooter missed the front end Gerard tonight 10 points hes made both of his free throw attempts if theres you know I dont care what the percentages are I Im very comfortable with having if Im Brad Brown out with having Joe Gerard at the line theres a confidence level that comes with playing in 120 career games before this season lead back to six right inside no sheelin clears Gerard lost the handle sty Applause no and a foul called against the Tigers fouls against Gerard you know Gerard had the ball down in there and he was looking for a foul and in that situation all you got to do if your Joe Gerard is hang on to the thing hes got the ball and I I dont think he was foued they slapped it away from Applause him one more for sty boy South Carolinas hurt themselves from the free throw line here down the stretch nine of 14 at the line in the second half to your point well now here here you have the situation again if study makes this one then Clemsons got to get the ball in bounds and in this situation the last time they werent able to do it course you got to get the rebound if he misses friendly bounce gamec 11 of 17 at the stripe tonight shot lock is off sheet pushed from behind by Mei Johnson well after all thats happened the Tigers Trail by as many as 11 led by as many Min is six and now back to the line for sheflin whos in search of another double double well their offense came alive in the second half remember they had 23 points at Music halftime and of course that was that was foul number 10 so hes got two and hes had his third straight double figure rebound in game hes now got 10 points double double for Ian sheflin he found a way tonight wasnt always pretty with the four personals game cops running out of Applause time and a timeout called by Lamont Paris 11 points 11 boards a pretty good night at the office and I really think a nice job defensively it was for the most part it was Ian chefin matched up against BJ Mack and Mack youre not going to hold him down completely ma scored pretty well but I thought Ian shefflin played really really well on both ends of the Court largest lead of the game for Clemson 22 seconds to go and again I think the key to the whole thing we said it at at the end of the first half that one of the reasons that Clemson has been so good so far this year has been their ability to produce on the off offensive end and you South Carolina gets a lot of credit for it but in the first half Clemson did not produce offensively in the second half they have outscored South Carolina 46 32 significant tigers on the verge of improving to Music 80 solidly in the top 25 after the two Road WIS last week at Pittsburgh and Alabama and a different story at home here tonight even president Jim Clem for the Tigers getting involved in the stands Applause tonight Johnsons got to go M another rebound by Guess Who of course sheflin got the rebound sty had a chance at it but wasnt able to hang on all smiles for PJ Hall Joe Gerard Ian shein Roy this is a very impressive win against a good South Carolina team the Gamecocks were up by 11 and Clemson battled back but again they got their offense in gear and they got it in gear from strange places Ian shefin Chanty Wiggins Joe Gerard made a couple big free throws a huge three by Chase Hunter who had a subpar offensive night for the most part Ian sheffet in his last three basketball games has secured 43 rebounds missed the free throw there Davis the rebound and just get out of the way now dont foul anybody Johnson launching and connecting on one more three and a quick timeout for Lamont Paris and the lead down to five with 71 seconds to go Applause now its not over just yet Johnson has done everything he can with 24 points tonight but you mentioned the second half in an offensive Onslaught with Wigan sheflin and Gerard and Hunter making big shots when Clemson needed it the most we thought it would be a good game my friend its turned out to be that and then some well we certainly have not been disappointed Applause wait what a show Mei Johnson has put on mention the 24 points he Applause scored his two games coming in to this one he averaged 26 and a Applause half whats the strategy now for both sides with 71 to go youre just trying to bleed clock I assume if youre Clemson yes you are but youre trying to get the ball inbounds Music first that was a problem earlier just moments ago the 5sec call theyll get it to PJ Hall quickly fouled by study and thats a really good play by Clemson Hall with his size and strength he can get down there and basically post up and have the ball come to him that was a good move by Hall and again theyre in the double bonus so its a two shot foul well its interesting too you mentioned the comeback weve talked about it PJ Hall has been a factor but just 12 points tonight he came in averaging over 21 I thought South Carolina defended against him very very well which is one of the reasons why Wiggins has 15 points and sheflin has is in double figures this is a Clemson team that has a lot of options and if you cut one off then somebody else is going to Music produce a lot of these fans behind us in the Clemson student section remember the football score from two and a half weeks ago the basketball rivalry doesnt take on quite the same meaning and feeling his football but for the team that wins it its pretty special now you just get out of the way oh my Heavens that is the last thing you want to do you just get out of the way second foul on Hunter thatll put Johnson back at the line only 32 seconds to go well its most unlikely that South Carolina can come back with 32 seconds and down seven but you know being at the free thr line I mean if you dont follow the clock Applause expired Johnson 25 points Gamecocks led by seven at halftime before the Tigers started to mount their comeback and that comeback officially complete 72 67 Clemson over South Carolina
