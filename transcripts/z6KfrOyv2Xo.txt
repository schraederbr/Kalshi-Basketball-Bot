really grow this program looking for a fifth Road win they havent done that in 13 years and John shy at ACC Tournament champion a season ago wanted some more intensity from his Duke team it didnt feel like they played with it against North Carolina he liked their defensive intensity Wednesday and an 18point went over another Dame BC started with the ball but did not keep it for long an early turnover for the Eagles todays officiating crew on the call Tony Henderson Tony Iza and Trey sty you cannot turn the ball over in this building early if youre Boston College and I like the set that Earl Grant went to early middle pick and roll Philip psky in drop coverage try to take advantage of the switch Jeremy roach a three Quinter on the opening possession for Duke one of the areas that this Duke team is so good at at home is shooting the three and they have been unbelievable this season season outside the arc new starting five for BC Mason matsons second start of the year and he scores over Kyle filipowski Prince elig Bay available but not starting with an ankle injury so matsons in there claudell Harris back in the starting lineup after four Off the Bench Jaden Zachary Devon mlon and the big man Quinton post is a Al ECC player number 12 roach proor McCain the standout guards for Duke with Mark Mitchell and Kyle filipowski as that threepointers Off the Mark by McCain but a BC foul will keep the ball here its against Jaden Zachary the Eagles Junior point guard John Shys got to love the ball movement in that possession everyone gets a touch and one of the most challenging things on the offensive end for Duke is to keep Mark Mitchell off the free throw line and off the offensive glass hes so good off the bounce and getting to the boards that ball was knocked Away by Zachary so no back court a deflection and walked across cross the line by roach with seven to shoot the senior Jeremy roach H his first threepointer that one off the mark and deflected rebound down to Quint and post to do everything big for BC number 12 for Boston College he will match up with the seventh order Philip hsky right here JN sh told us theyre going to start the game with Mitchell on post right now it is Philip Housey on it two sevenfooters going to work great skip pass by Poston mson drills it hes got the first five in his second start of the year when you can score early in this building you can set your defense you dont want to play be playing in transition against Duke now filipowski will take it into post and miss one right at The Rim an early Miss shot in one has been a stretch of struggles for Kyle filipowski comes to double mlon who finds Harris tremendous vision and a three wont go for claudell Harris Jr leazy can shoot from out there and he Applause will youve got to locate Shooters you cant Sprint to the paint and then try to find them its too late just two for nine Wednesday that is an encouraging early sign the all ACC Philip pasy theres Mark Mitchell on Cameron post or Quinton post excuse me they work it in two post again its Mitchell filipowski comes to double another good find Zachary misses a three Madson has the offensive rebound Harris set up Harris no good from deep and a rebound for Mitchell DC getting good looks early but not hitting as Mitchell goes charging into Manson and the B is a block against Mason Manson his first watch filipowski right here in transition late to find him and the sevenfooter can definitely stroke it out there hes a 3 5 threepoint shooter hell set up Proctor here off the inbound and Mitchell got shoved by mton you said it just a moment ago you have to keep Mark Mitchell off the offensive glass Notre de did not do that Wednesday in BC struggling here hes a problem because the space around him because theres so many good Shooters allows him and Defenders to play him with a cushion and then you got to try to go and check him before he gets to the glass hes an issue and close just picked up a foul so every BC starter but Harris has a foul in the first 307 watch post right here pushing through the Jared McCain screen so you cant do that you cant pick up a cheap one early McCain will drive it right through maton Cher McCain The Freshman from Sacramento is on the board on the Scout first is defend him on the three and then he has the ability off the bounce what a breakout last month and a half its been for McCain another Miss three for BC theyre one for five as post is Off the Mark well the two times post has gone to the block Duke has brought the double so C so Quinton post bringing his game outside filipowski scores right through him an early five for him and a seven nothing Blue double run its a BC team that has been very good good shooting this season 36 from three in the league their offensive numbers are way way up from a season ago their most efficient offense in six years everything goes through post thats a tough shot though with filipowski smothering him good job to close that space on the drive M again welcome to Cameron indor Stadium Kevin Brown Debbie Antonelli a 125 lead for Duke over Boston College if youre just joining us a 9 nothing Blue double run is snaap Mason Matson in his second start of the year has all seven points for BC its a Duke team coming off at 18point win over Notre Dame in this building Wednesday and shooting it well Kyle filipowski could not hit there but the offensive rebound stolen by McCain who misses a three Mixel is there to throw it right back in a Relentless start on the offensive glass for Duke which has rebounded four of its six misses heres Devin mlon and madsons first basket that he doesnt score for BC he sets up Blue Devil six for 12 to start Bows got five all starters but Proctor have scored for this Duke team which is a game and a half behind North Carolina in the ACC Jeremy roach Off the Mark and Quinton post has the rebound for BC BCs got to get ball reversal here Duke is playing switching mantoman defense and you got to get the right matchups and take advantage like that right there post inside getting caught with roach on his backside and he buries him in a rim free throws for Quint post when we return to Durham an early five point lead for the hometown Music Devils for Mitchell inside too easy for the Blue Devils two points at the rim and then Mitchell we talked about his motor his ability to stay on the glass McCain gets the tip and deflection three offensive rebounds already for Mark Mitchell for the Blue Devils he scored two points hes got five rebounds total with those three offensive he also has two assists you asked John sh about him before the game he said he needs to do everything with energy so far he has done everything with energy youre not going to guard him on the threepoint line and youre going to give him a cushion and he takes that cushion and uses it as leverage to get to the glass hes got the most Relentless motor of any blue devil on the floor this free throw by Quinton post as we return with an 80 shooter missing the first of two DCs leading scorer rebounder shop Locker their second best free throw shooter and amidst the Cameron crazies goes 0 for two but post is a special player most improved in the league a year ago hell be an all ACC player this season with seven double and doubles 21 and 12 in their onepoint loss to Florida State earlier in the week Earl Grant can put him anywhere on the floor offensively and he can be a factor hes defending Ryan young right now and with that one foul Duke trying to go right after him to see if he can pick up a second smart idea didnt work as Caleb Foster freshman Off the Bench lost it out of bounds it will be BC ball you know BCs teams under Earl Grant are gritty they are tough theyre coming into this environment and you have to stay with Duke earlyy you cant turn it over they turned it over on the first possession they got to clean up the offensive boards but right now you look at that score and you go where in a twopossession game thats where it has to stay through the half havent turned it over since the first possession Armani mightys on the floor for post and feed is in mcglockton much improved player in the league Mighty got a left hand on it and mcglockton is fouled Boston College giv Duke a taste of its own medicine on the offensive glass jayen Blakes who just came off the bench picks up the foul so when post goes to the bench their athleticism on their front line switches a little bit and it will change the way ear Grant will defend on the on the other end of the floor B paski getting a breather for Duke right now its Foster Blakes and young Off the Bench for the Blue Devils who went a little bit deeper in the win over Notre Dame on Wednesday bson had the look early that ones deep from three and grabbed by Mitchell rebound number six and then Mitchell throws it right to Matson you got two towboys wiping the floor and they vacate the premises just in time for a Madson stuff Ill tell you whos thrilled about Matson start is his brother Gabe at Utah Hes a great player at Utah for Craig Smith Masons got nine well ahead of his season average again just his second start of the year with Prince alib Bay hampered by an ankle injury oh wow McCain had it go off the glass back to himself got a look in the lane but Dukes the has to touch it BC will retake Music possession I mean I was almost ready to say he was giving himself an assist and the basket can you do that can you get that on the same possession the world will never know now was not a long breather for Philip pasy by the way he and Proctor return along with Shawn Stewart explosive 69 freshman and Kowski gets a hand on that pass from Chaz Kelly its a stop by proor at the other end if Philip palski can move his feet like that and that switching manto man that gives Duke another way of scheming on this end of the floor that was a tremendous job to keep BC in front I go right back to M Matson hes had the hot hand for Boston College its Kellys three instead rebounded by mcglockton who draws another foul John Stewart picks up his first and free throws for BC when we return on the Kyle pH need to know brought to by the USPS ground Advantage Quinton post Kyle filipowski all ACCC caliber players they can score they can rebound they can also pass only Richmonds Neil Quinn among seven Footers averages more assists per game its a little anomaly to see sevenfooters that are really good passers however through the double or the skip both players capable of seeing the whole floor and as a post player when youre 7 ft tall its not just throwing over the top of defenses its understanding space and understanding Personnel both these guys have a great handle on their respective systems Philip Pas sophomore and possible lottery pick surprise return to school whose numbers are up from a year ago but of late his play has been a little up and down last five games two for 17 from three 42 s from the field 14 turnovers and blockton goes one for two better start for philas today every year is different right you got Derek Lively the shop blocker that could take up some defensive matchups and now Philip Houses got a little bit of a different role on the defensive end and this is where I think hes excellent is in the short Row in the middle of the floor because you cant bring any help to that you cant tag from the weak side who are you going to come off of Shooters theres too many good Shooters around the threepoint line could have added to the assist number you saw there but Sean Stewart fumbled it out of bounds see that would be a coachs assist meaning when John sh goes back and watch his film hes giving him credit for that Kowski shot lock M Lockton was here in traffic with a couple of eagles to knock it away thats an old Dean Smith thing you talk about can you talk about Dean Smith on the dke well find out if security comes to a score you out shortly if I have to go solo I will M glockton fou inside theres a reach by Jeremy roach thats his second foul and in here how could I get Dean Smiths name in before I got coach Ks name I apologize coachy I know youre listening 15000 on that this is a beautiful place right Kevin your first time Impressions its special it it seems special on TV you cant quite qualify aeal is until youre here and its whats outside the building too as post tried to get a timeout and he did get one for BC with 1110 to go post double team will come back to beautiful Cameron indor stadium and Coach K courton A half a minute oh yeah hot honey pizza and wings from P one of the officials here there he is theres Bucky Waters five clear head coach here 69 to 73 theres always one or usually more Duke Legends in the building when you come to Cameron indor Stadium theres Bucky taking in the game The Stadium named for Eddie Cameron basketball and football coach and AD here at D really five decades pull up three rounded out for Prince of League Bay Boston College is 148 from Deep proor not the hesitation drives it on post thats smart because when you push and you run the floor hard youre automatically creating mismatches at the very beginning of your possession and thats what Proctor recognized post cant guard him off the bounce its too tough of a challenge four points for the sophomore Captain lead back to six for Duke which is Led nearly the whole way in the lane Harris draws the contact and cannot get the bounce free throws coming from clell Harris junor but its another huge day of college basketball here on ESPN college game day was at one of the other cathedrals of the sport the fog earlier this morning and Kansas will host Baylor at Allen Fieldhouse in a big 12 Sonic Blockbuster 6 Eastern tonight right here on ESPN and the ESPN app welcome to the Big 12 where Kansas a week ago plays Houston at home wins that game decisively two days has to go to Manhattan lose his an ot to Kansas State and now Kansas Baylor which has really been the Rivalry in the Big 12 the last few years it has and Baylors won three in a row after losing to TCU in that triple overtime game a couple of weeks ago fre throws good for Harris a fourpoint Duke lead a little switch of Direction by roach playing with a two fouls and stroke it a jump shot good job rejecting the screen and getting yourself into space Jeremy roach definitely one of the smartest players on the floor for Duke in Reading defense first fouryear starter here since Kyle Singler 13 years ago Bay and have nothing to do with Philip housei and may have travel to now filipowski gets switched onto the threepoint shooter Harris off the mark one for nine now for BC from De filipowski has space inside back BCs just got to get back sooner I mean theyre getting beat in transition and its not just a layup in transition its the matchups because theyre not sprinting to find them the right matchup early Dukes early offense has been excellent post has still yet to score Zachary couldnt take Stewart Duke has been very good on the ball these last few possessions Zachary again in the midrange Jaden Zachary has his first Applause points over shooting at 53 right now 10 for 19 frer could leave it inside to Philipi you got to see all options and look at Jeremy roach throws it right to the Target hand he looks to the weak side first thats what Im talking about early off defense excellent for Duke BCs got a match up Music sooner roach will take a seat of 14 of was 22 in the paint will go right there you cant take a shot face on Mark Mitchell at the threepoint line you mean the guy was four for 29 yes kyp know your personnel if I could have bet I was ready to throw it down a 20 you were going to give me a kyp there Music there C Foster picks up his first foul for du thats six on the Blue Devils does this building mess with your head though more than others when it comes to know your personnel oh absolutely you cant hear yourself think uh youve got to understand at the beginning of the game you might have to script a couple of plays offensively and if it works you got to stay with it cuz its harder to communicate any changes tweaks anything different Zachary back from Harris Zachary thats a spot he hit a few possessions ago and he drills it again really good acceleration that time by BC through their sets right you draw two to the ball you Skip and reverse then duks a half up pass late in closing out Eagles are hanging around here they turned it over on the opening possession only once since Bowski Feats proor whos going from Deep Im not that set by John fire we havent seen it when the game slows down you got three incredibly gifted offensive players in that action three threes for Duke among the best threepoint shooting teams in the country another good long skip pass theres mlock not even close on a threepoint try are these good looks for BC and they one for 10 from three not when you just went side to side Swing Swing and score going in the post holds up well with a one foul the post is a little slow so Mason Maxon and no rush to get the ball to the timeline Zachary with the switch on Mitchell Zachary again midrange assassin Jaden Zachary the last six for BC keeping him in the game how about Zachary hes a pass first point guard but hes looking to be a threat here in the first half Junior having a career year of 12 points four a third assist per game Eagles are still lingering here in this first half Philip pasy is to a three for eight now in the first half Co did a really good job of coring that ball screen and then recovering back to Philip howski harrs looking for the back cut with mson Mitchell cut it off instead its m they got the match up again M Lockton on McCain and John shy takes a Music timeout Boston College finding good matchups to get within three program with all sorts of story to history well give you a slice of BC history and we come Music back looking like a snack 49 points against Georgetown long overdue Jersey retirement for John Austin who passed away four years ago his jersey will be retired one week from today the first AllAmerican ever at BC and he was coached by the great Bob Koozie for the Eagles how about that thats cool Bob crzy you know its about time it seems like he gets in the Rapters yeah if hes in the if hes in the Raptors who can be in the Raptors the alltime career scoring leader of BC Ro Grant in his third year program had their most conference wins in a dozen years last year they were 9 and 11 in the league theyre 4 seven right now the narrative would feel so different if they had managed to beat Florida State they lose by one they cant get a good shot off at the buzzer they were down 162 in the game earlier in the week outplayed them really for the final 34 minutes filipowski setting up TJ power The Freshman who misses a three and then Philipi crashing into the cheerleaders could not keep it in bounds one of the things that John shs teams have always been so good at at is their at they after timeout right here look at Mighty stand up Philip palski and force him to become a passer thats exactly what you want to do the appropriately named sophomore big for BC quit post is also appropriately named takes a seat Boston College four for its last five only hit one one of 10 from three theyre eight of 11 from Two and Harris will miss a jump shot here rebound down to Jared McCain whos an outstanding guard rebounder already got five today to go with four points and McCain post Fades and scores well he rebounds he quickly gets them into their transition game if the nation didnt know about him they learned a week ago at 23 and 11 of Carolina Zachary short rebound chased down by Proctor and here comes Duke on the run again Proctor pulls up and mlon one hands it Bon Matson is Zachary running the floor Zachary sees Harris and Harris drains the second three for Boston College that is a brilliant play by Jaden Zachary a 62 junor who leads the team and assist hav been many transition opportunities for BC now steel he leads him in Steels to he poked it away from Mitchell Harris just hit Harris hits again and Boston College has the lead their second leading scorer claudell Harris Jr back in the lineup after four straight Off the Bench and the first lead since the opening moments of the game with this line up on the floor right here Main has got to look to score power here is McCain hes looking to pass immediately Mitchell against mighty mighty holds up again building a wall inside a little used big man Mighty has been all over the Duke bigs as Matson had it deflected out of bounds its going to be a full line change here for just about four new players for John sh well you definitely want Ro back on the floor now because he can dictate tempo for Duke he is the player I think Shy trusts the most and then Philip psky as your leading scorer they almost had only four on the floor there but kanaine figured before new guys that must be coming out he stays in right now bodying mlon in the post Zachary another a great fight for Harris this time no good oh James Z really control the last few minutes for Boston Applause Music College phasi almost had McCain in the back door he saves it to Roach its a 145 Boston College run right now and a foul is called on Mighty fighting with Philipi his first foul but its BC on top the pass first point guard has had to do a little scoring here to keep his team in it and help build the lead by one Zachary with six points and a couple of assists to go along with it BC with the lead early coming up the Jeep halftime report from Lawrence Kansas Rees Jay and Sith number one Yukon will remain number one destroying Georgetown and DC and how about South Carolina ranked 15th of the country up big on Vanderbilt staying hot the SEC all that and more live from lawence well the only only ACC team to never win at C indor Stadium Boston College eagles they are 0 and 13 and not only that 12 of the 13 losses have been by double digits they lost by one here a few years ago but the average margin of defeat for BC at Duke 174 points per game theyre up by one right now in Earl grs team on a 60 run and a 145 run after that they allowed just two Duke field goals to have in the last 604 theyre going to battle they are going to be competitive on every possession thats Earl Grant thats who he is and thats what he puts on the floor theres a much better at by dude off the blob the Baseline out of bounds BL joh Stewart 24 per game scorer as the basket over post Blue Devils are right back on top going a little floppy action right here trying to get Matson free Jeremy roach is doing a good job of defending him Matson had nearly not hasnt scored a while Zachary and of the shot clot Zachary got it on the rim long rebound down to Applause Foster freshman Foster with a freshman McCain a freshman Stewart the sophomore filipowski and the senior roach filipowski thought about a shot and then nearly threw it into crazies what a save by roads ended up in the hands of McCain who couldnt convert phip psky knocks down the post pass and Stewart has back to back buckets Im surprised po tried to make that pass because hes very capable of bringing the ball up the floor and initiating offense for BC qu po get to score it a tough start for for BCs leading score and best player M lton way off the mark from three post was on his rear end for a second quick five on for Duke and a rainbow from Foster makes BC pay seven straight for Duke theres mton inside phip palowski good answer thats his game thats mlts game now I know he hit a couple of Threes against Florida State but hes got to build his offense inside out good pass Philipi Foster almost had another McCain is there for the rebound first stands him up a post is the last to touch it when you move the ball that well youre constantly putting the defense in rotation Duke when they move the ball and they go side to side they have a much better opportunity their percentage of scoring will go up plus its harder to box him out on the glass the great point is not just about getting the first basket its about getting the offensive rebound as philipos shot was air mailed there thats what they did in 212 Second Chance points on Wednesday post and a blocking foul is the second on Shan stew Music but BC hold your breath that post doesnt pick up his second foul in the final minute of the half hey tomorrow 2 Eastern one of the great matchups of the year in womens basketball number 11 Yukon an undefeated number one South Carolina Sonic Blockbuster in Columbia with the Gamecock the only undefeated team in division one trying to stay that way you got the great page Beckers for Yukon going against by committee the best offensive team in the country for Dawn Staley theyre undefeated theyre number one and they are anticipated they go all the way to the final four this year right now theyre the overall number one seed in womens college basketball and theyve earned it quickly how does Yukon beat him well they got to move the ball and they got to be able to knock down shots youre not going to be able to score much in the paint youre going to have to knock down some threes and Camila cardoso their 67 Center for South Carolina with the team right now so that opens up the middle of the floor for those driving Lanes jumper is good hes got seven whats been a balanced scoring half for Applause dke L nles has had the lead despite not having attempted a free throw in this first half the blocked it inside touch pass post kosi comes out of nowhere to Swan it now with a shot clock on Foster will put a halt to the proceedings the other thing about this building fatigue theres a wear down effect Quenton post looks tired he should have dumped that Duke can hold for the last one with roach calling for the McCain screen he isues it he shoots it and it might have been tipped there by claudell Harris Jr well good and bad news if youre BC the bad news are down four the up there D Im looking for BC to go back door Im looking for them to get into the paint and try to get some points inside and at The Rim continue to get to the free throw line first half stats brought to by Target Boston College three for 14 from three duke four for 16 two of the better threepoint shooting teams in the ACC have been met with Fierce resistance and Duke starts with the ball and half number two Jared McCain at a 67 rebound first half he finds Jeremy r and Jeremy roach misses a three make it four for 17 now from theep third straight game where Duke has struggled to shoot the three ason Matson finds himself with space Jumper in out Deon mlon was there post as well and the rebound for out by tyres proor three players was seven for Duke M K was six b n that is a great slice of the floor by Proctor because what he does is he goes behind all the traffic in the middle and finds a wideopen threepoint shooter in transition as John sh said to us I have three lead guards on the court at almost any time one of those lead guards just set up another Quint post no made field goals two points and a half gives it back to kle Harris Jr who had eight Matson leads away with nine and BC just couldnt get a shot off in time throwing the ball around too late in The Possession watch Proctors eyes right here and he gets right behind brushes off all that traffic in the middle puts it right in the pocket to McCain It is Well executed in Applause transition S four from Sydney Australia Proctor fifth best assist to turnover Mark in the ACC Le toke at 37 assists per game that was his first today Mitchell with a right hand and the largest lead for Duke courtesy of the first five points of the half total miscommunication by BC and a decisive take to the rim these are the moments where so often in this building a close game becomes something other for the visitors a blockton on the in line and the threads are starting to slowly unravel for Boston College now Quinton post does not look himself watch right here m communication are we switching are we staying and Mitchell make some pay posts got to come alive right here he averages 16 and eight richell Duke has scored off all five Boston College turnovers Mark Mitchell with six seven rebounds with two assists and the road rows are continuing for Quint post was two and four right now hes got the switch with proor hes got a huge height advantage in the post filipowski is behind him now but glockton misses from three theres nothing going on good there for DC oh its the wrong Personnel in the corner which allows Philip Housey to help that far its not a threepoint shooter out there so with his second foul on while post rolls down on the Duke switches and the guards and he needs some help Duke needs some help you can bring it from a nonshooter and thats what filipowski read so well in that Music possession all five dke starters between six and nine points proor couldnt connected post has the Applause rebound DC team its won two of its last three at Notre Dame home against Syracuse the onepoint loss to Florida State thats a much needed shot the stop a 7 nothing run from Harris and I talked about Duke punishing the switches so does BC you duke has been switching one through five all game 39 threepoint shooter Harris has three of DCs four tonight filipowski pretty soft contact by mlon hes called for the blocking foul and a threepoint opportunity for Kyle filipowski when they run that twoman game on the naked side you got a tag from the weak side and mlon is just late getting there when filipowski catches it that deep forget it hes going to score or hes going to make the right read watch right here twom man game on the naked side and then is he in the arc he might have been in the restricted area ml is going to check out after his third foul Prince El Bay replaces him yeah hes hes in the arc and thats a good strong powerful take by Music filipowski just two for nine for eight points on Wednesday phow is at nine as he misses Dukes first free throw of the game hes really been struggling from the free throw line he has not sh free throw as well in a couple of games that means you just got got to get in the gym and shoot him maybe you should go with Jared McCain he gets a lot of shots up in this building hes here at 530 in the morning and hell be in here after the game when everyones gone making shots Zachary post water on mitell Zachary still couldnt finish here comes Duke on the push out its roach he knew he missed it he followed it up and he keeps alive his own Miss on the off EXs and Boards McCain out the post these see very slow to start the half they get a look for post and Philipi commits his first foul we had this conversation with John CH today about filipowski and about fouls and as the second half wears on he has one hes got to stay aggressive now he can go to the glass he can be a little bit more aggressive in switches he can take maybe a little bit more of a risk you dont want to pick up a not a smart thing right and those have been some of his fouls of late fory hes committed some fouls nowhere near the play nowhere near the basket I said that wrong you dont want to pick up a dumb foul yeah well not as smart is just a wordy euphemism for post goes two for two all four of his points at the line Duke has shot one free throw five for 21 from three but still has the lead had been great on the offensive glass inside Mitchell and hell go to the line for two I love the Twan game with roach and filipowski they read it so well Duke out of the locker room with the lead Kevin Durant dein Booker and former Duke star Grayson Allen the Suns taking out Steph Curry the Warriors at Chase Center 830 Eastern on ABC NBA cat starts it off at 8 Eastern good to see Jason Tatum in the Cameron crazies today usually you know whos going to be going to the NBA after the season if youre Duke and whos going to be in games like that probably safe to assume Kyle filipowski will leave especially with some of the players coming in for Duke next but John sh told us before the game its a weird year because he doesnt really know who else is going there are a few players that depending on the final month plus of the Year could very well improve their stock be an NBA pick could come back to Durham for another year Im sure its a tough choice for a lot of these guys um Duke provides every resource you could possibly have the nil is certainly changed the landscape the transer portal has changed everything and then they got Cooper flag coming in here next year like everybody can cant wait for that yeah already assumed as the number one pick of the 2025 draft Cooper flag is going to highlight another excellent recruiting class for Duke next season as Harris misses the floater for BC lead is nine for Duke at the under 16 of the second half Boston Collinson a couple of short leads in the first half Philip psky tracked it down and throws it to post L Manson on the run up only Bay sets up Harris roach when flying by the shot fake and then Harris had his shot touch the top of the backboard it must have hit the clock because you can hit the top of the backboard and if it comes back in play its its good still in that was a great look to possibly cut it to six as well from the man whos been BCs only threepoint threat today P post hasnt even taken a shot for BC yet in the half Eagles set one field goal in the last six and 12 minutes Road set up by McCain youre not supposed to help off the strong side corner and when you do thats what happens third assist for McCain nine points e rebounds no turnover theres post with a great F but its AIG B who is now four for 29 from three McCain phip pasy charging in nearly had the offensive rebound and hes a little slow to get back into the play numbers for BC which takes advantage with finally a field goal for post took about 2540 for Quint post hes 16 12 Point per game score to make his first field goal well shoot around to today we knew John sh was keying on that matchup trying to keep post from getting hot Zachary try to body Philipi that ball was knocked out of the cylinder all kinds of hands in there itll be a goal Music 10 filipowski to me looks like hes playing with a little bit more comfortability right hes playing at his Pace he reads and you see the balls going into the cylinder it gets knocked out by post what have you made of his last five games I think its all about matchups right I mean when youre going against Bott or PJ Hall those are two physical dominant low poost demanding of the basketball kind of players and and Quinton post is not that hes more a guy that plays in space for a sevenfooter off the mats and jumper for BC back with in 10 Philip psky gets drilled Over The Back by post second foul on post and filipowski continuing to win his matchups today that has not been the case of late against some terrific bigs a week ago filipowski didnt score the ball very well had a lot of late points for Duke and the lost to UNC but Bott really dominated him physically 25 and 10 in a ninepoint North Carolina win he go back a little bit further for filipowski Duke struggled against Clemson in a onepoint win here see Brandon Hunt atfield of Louisville Blake Henson of pit whos a little bit of a better shooter have had big games here so Duke has struggled with some big men of late but not the case this afternoon pH pasy guarding AIG bang right now and Prince AIG bang hits a tough jump see thats the matchup in the play right there that I think Philip Pas can be more aggressive with with one foul first points for League Bay 7 minutes into this half Duke is stretched to fourpoint halftime lead 28 Mitchell oh Mark Mitchell with his M three of the year I mean he better make it because Philip psky had a guard on him in the post thats not the option I would have selected if I was Jeremy Rach po throws it off the underside of the basket bounces right to Jaz Kelly and filipowski has his first rebound heres Mitchell stepping into Zachary and he got the roll oh Grants going to put a stop to these Music Applause proceedings largest lead for Duke is up to 13 I mean it is pumping in here right now the option is filipowski on the BL or Mitchell and Mitchell running the floor here what a games are often won by Duke and lost by opponents here in the first 5 minutes after halftime that may well be the case today well you know that John shires going to make adjustments and theyre going to come out and ramp up their level defensively and thats exactly whats happened here and they get BC sped up they get him second guessing hesitating turning it over and Duke Team Speed is too tough when you turn it over youre not going to catch them theyre going to score its like free two points finally got in the foul line a couple of times they have 15 assists today on 24 made baskets thats a very nice 63 assist rate Mark Mitchell with 10 of his 12 in the second half and Duke with its largest lead of the game well I expect Earl Grant to change his defense and look to pick up full court but how about John shy picking up full Court off the timeout Ryans a few more seconds off The Possession for BC he was shooting just 39 Alig Bay Ryan Youngs Off the Bench Alig Bay flops it too deep I mean its a great set its the shot they want got to put it down Bowski and McCain on the bench young is in proor returns Ryan young a fifth year player ring at the body of post who bodies him good picks up the block yeah good d by post but I love the way Ryan young is attacking Post in the inside in the post post Will Roll he wants it against young double team comes with Mitchell look out to Kelly M A good shooter offensive rebound Alig Bay just short armed it but he got fouled and Prince Alig will have two shots that will send us to to the Under 12 timeout with Duke leading by 13 great basketball tradition in history here at Duke in the past in the present more to come well talk about that when we return to

duped by a dozen BL Devils have led by as many as 13 another good find by post Zachary misses a three and BC is 4 for 20 threepoint range thats been really their strength offensively especially in conference games this year theyve been very good from Deep thats Kowski with his second three I mean they just go two man side and there are multiple guards that can make that exchange and that action with Kyle filipowski and if you put him in the slot its really hard to tag from the weak side this time the glockton has no interest in shooting to three Zachary will take it Zachary will miss it hes Ed for three from out there and its Stewart inside he got held by mlon who just came back in the game and now picks up his fourth Music Applause Music foul we almost had another highlight from Sha Stewart who had one of the highlights of the Year Wednesday night first the rejection on one end and then follow the Freshman 94 ft to get this delivery from Caleb Foster theres a reason there are a couple of reasons but theres one main reason that Sean Stewart excites these fans so much he can get up in fact he broke Z Williamsons program record for standing vertical jump broken by a half inch 36 in if youre wondering is the number its incredible sh Stewart standing vertical one of multiple McDonalds allamericans on this team for John shy he had two the last three number one recruiting classes this years Freshman Class number two next years coming in number one with Cooper flag stewards on the ball right now is is filipowski theyve double post very quickly Zachary inside Jaden Zachary has eight Zacharys just played his game hes been able to score in the first half he had three buckets hes very opportunistic as a point guard being a threat on the top of the floor Fox keep running the same stuff Kevin got a good look for Philipi just couldnt finish theres chess Kelly for BC PO with one field goal only filipowski comes out to try to take it away but thats the aggression that Im talking about right make a play you have one foul be aggressive take a risk John shy said we need need to help Kyle filipowski yes hes not playing well we need to help him put him in better positions do you feel like hes been able to do that defensively today I do switching one through five and I think hes done a nice job of keeping his assignment in front of him hes helped hes doubled hes read the defense and then on the offense right now theyre featuring him in the twoman game until DC figures out a way to stop it Dukes been able to score on either side of the floor hes able to close there on K but post is there for the uncontested putback eight points two field goals now for Quint Post BC is going to make a late charge in this game it needs to start right about now Foster filipowski extra pass PO for three and thats how as a sevenfooter your assist gets close the three game you put it right in the pocket its his third today right on the money post there a triple team there Proctor with a steal Proctor with a break Proctor with a couple of steps and Foster couldnt finish but McCain is there to set up Philip cant have too many empty possessions right now for your VC they really execute here move the ball post was too slow on that last possession and the double came from the weak side theres a three for chass Kelly just a 27 shooter from out there only the fifth and 22 tries for Boston College team which has shot it 40 three or better seven times this year Stewart no rebound to Harris you see how many DC jerseys were in paint right there and then you get the turnover there are four BC jerseys on that pocket pass ready to defend got to spray it outside well Kyle Philip pasy has stared to exert his presence a little bit more on this game first half for filipowski not quite as clean it looks a bit better here in the second as duke expands its lead be around him when hes talking about raising money for Pediatric cancer and if you can make a donation please do so and Lorraine will be there for the sweet 16 residential watch I would like to sit next to her for that yeah thats really the draw no offense to our friend dick we want to be next to right you know what coach coach V coach vital Im telling you right now we know that youre struggling to speak but your voice is being heard you should know that were ready for you to come back I cant wait these Duke Blue Devils a 14point lead with 728 to go that pass deflected out of bounds by Claud Al Harris Jr BCs only turned it over seven times today but Duke has scored off the first six Boston College turnovers and right now they have the ball off of the seventh turnover Kapowski leads away with 164 Blue Devils and double figures a foul by Harris against roach our featured match up tonight Prime Time the fog Baylor and Kansas number 13 number four at a big 12 Sonic Blockbuster and shelman J bis on the call second straight week Kansas has a ranked Big 12 opponent at home last week they destroyed Houston one of the best offensive performances youll ever see against a k Samson team and they will try to take down Scott TRW Baylor Bears today you got a favorite Kansas player of all time Kevin Perry Ellis was there about 800 years so I think hed be mine what about you I like Danny Manning Im going to give Danny Manning a shout out 1988 National Applause Champion you want to say whats being said in our headset right now shouts shouts for Will Chamberlain from an unnamed voice of the production cre threepointer no from Harris wil was just a couple of years before my time I have to be honest about that and yes I know YouTube Applause exists DK McCain by the way is on double double watch and hes got five assist to filipowski in the post shimmy pass extra feed aain shot it is all pretty except for the Finish Kan just looks a little bit short on his shots today post getting a break right now for BC which a struggle to find offense Harrison Matson Leading The Way with 11 each heres a drive by Harris here is Matson missed a clean look from three mton keeps it alive and feeds Manson again got filipowski in the air a late whistle little be just the second foul against Kyle filipowski Kyle phow second team third feels like the last few games for Duke the foul number has been as important as anything for Philip Hy and Quint post has not been able to draw too many fouls against Dukes big man post has been it appears a little bit worn down by the atmosphere by the physicality of Duke yeah I thought he was fatigued in the first half and you know its a lot of pressure to come in here and knowing that your team had never won here before Shire will take his second time out it will be a 30 second timeout right back or a few points to make with his officiating crew to set the tone going into the locker room boy we wonder where John shy leared that I learned it from the the best Coach K this is Coach K court whether that has to do with the outcome or not Duke has played with a renewed enthusiasm here in the second half theyve gotten to the line seven times theyve stretched a fourpoint halftime lead to 14 theyre going to go to 18 and five overall 9 and three in the lead they didnt shoot any free throws in the first half and I think thats the point that coach shy was making Mitchell over dribbles right into Kelly heres mlon cutting inside filipowski dein mcglockton with nine points and the lead down to it do it I like that timeout by John Shire to refocus his guys right youre not playing the scoreboard you got to tighten up all five starters with at least nine McCains the only one not in double figures he Feats proor and the rebound over Mitchell over Mighty came down to Kelly BC just keeps chipping away right here danons miss mightys in there to contest it and its out of bounds off of Dukes Jeremy roach 20 to shoot for Boston College BCs trying to speed up the game a little bit Kevin trying to push a little bit more in transition its hard to press Duke because when you open up the floor with all their athleticism in the back court and they see driving Lanes and Lanes to the basket its hard to keep him in front and their backside scoring is outstanding against pressure close his eye for 2 minute 23 second break and they get him oh just pushed off filipowski that is an easy call against post his third foul little frustration Maybe by Music post clearly two hands on filipowski in the Applause chest has Caleb Foster on the floor now the dror Mitchell has hit a three and post is basically say go ahead try it again a sag off him but roach gets in the lane and hes got 14 the roach scores and he points at McCain says I see you over there in the corner next time he gets in the pain hell have that option mton from Matson M locktons the third Eagle in double figures those are the plays mlon needs to make driving using his athleticism using his length its a BC team that is undeterred by big leads they really fight to the final whistle for o Grant 131 change defensively he gets it inside to Mitchell tight roping the Baseline and he draws the fourth foul on post just because its a big deficit doesnt mean its over BC has come back from 10 or more down five times this year the largest comeback in ACC play period was Boston College Over Georgia Tech down 16 couple of weeks ago so there is time yet for Earl Grant group but needs to pretty much be stop and score for a while here you can make a case for every ACC game except for Syracuse and Clemson which were 10 and 12o losses theyve been in every game its in one or two or three possession games at the end even in home against UNC they lost by 10 but they were right in that game most of the game at home again the Florida State game earlier in the week they down 162 out of the shoot they never took the lead but they lost by one had a chance to get up a shot but J Zachary could not get a clean look at the end of the game got to score here though mlon another Miss three back tap by post right into the hands of foster had an Old Coach that told me one time there might be a reason why youre open I had every coach tell me that well they didnt say that to me yeah thats what I was thinking oh L of contact there roach just lost the ball no call Kelly with a three in transition or its called a long two for the time being might be looked at at the break but its a long two point jumper the lead is 12 how about the fight in BC right here speeding up the game trying to change the look out of a 1 31 make Duke hesitate a little bit see if you can rebound out of this McCains got post McCain takes post he blows by him and becomes a fifth Blue Devil in double figures McCain family loving their sons continued development in this outstanding freshman season Matson strong Drive hes got 15 hes had a good half his start of the game he knocked down a couple of buckets early did Matson way above the season average only his second start of the year I suspect it will not be his last hes just too shy of a season High still have yet to hit the under four here mlon againsts Philipi left short mlon Taps it to Applause himself close in all kinds of trouble here Mitchells draped all over a Mitchells called for the foul its just the fourth on Duke so itll be BC ball down 12 with 206 to play see if post to the Eagles have one final surge left this was indeed a two by Kelly the lead a dozen for the Music Devils on the road Armando bout was phenomenal in that Duke game one of his 78 career double doubles 25 and 10 I believe he has a switch and I think hes turned it on right now as we get in February heading to for the ACC tournament into the postseason RJ Davis has had a phenomenal year but youve heard Hubert Davis say we need them both to score 20 complimentary play around both of those guys has been outstanding too with Harrison Ingram so two minutes to play Duke by 12 and a steal for roach pickpocketing Zachary Foster will take it right into the body of Harris and those two end up entangled in the front row well we just saw Duke UNC Mets basketball last weekend Duke UNC women will play tomorrow afternoon on acc Network after number 12 Notre Dame in Florida State beginning at noon Easter both games on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN for the deepest league in womens basketball this season nine teams seated according to Charlie gream not on the bubble or our first four in none of that stuff the this league has been outstanding and Carolina has lost three in a row coming in here this will be tough Duke has North Carolina then at Virginia Tech nor Notre day at Syracuse NC State those are all ranked teams outside of North Carolina who fell out of the rankings this week every night we say as a fight in the ACC at Mens Basketball maybe even more true on the Rob side this year 9 seconds to play Zachary and he gets the friendly bouns Gage zackly with 10 the time ticking away for Boston College came in here searching for its first win at ceron indor stadium and it appears will still be searching for that win the next time the Eagles come to town soon to drop to 0 and 14 all time 3 and 29 all the time against Duke Applause period Mitchell line drives it in there you go four for 29 coming into the game and the officials will stop Applause play take a look at this I wonder if they were taking a look at if it was a three or two but I think thats what theyre looking at but clearly a three look Mark Mitchell has been working on his three for a long time thats the next evolution in his game to be able to shoot it and shoot it with confidence he started out the game on the offensive glass scheming defensively and watch his form right here hes got to work on some mechanics and change some old habits so that he gets some muscle memory and the ability to selfcorrect thats what all great Shooters have its not you shooting in the driveway yet but well see if he can get there you got to work on it every day by the way John sh told us he needs to score for us hes got 17 today Duke is about to be 28 and three when he scores 10 points or more he has to be a threat offensively Harris is fouled this is a different Duke team than last year you know Lively protect in the rim and being able to score on drop backs put um Rim runs drop offs put backs those kind of scoring opportunities filipowski had a great counter and this year hes hes got more of a Target theyre playing four guards theyre playing four out and Mitchell has to be able to be a threat because hes playing that four spot and thats who people like to double off Music of theyre going to be tested the next couple of weeks to gets a 9 and three in the ACC and it is a pretty tricky stretch for them the W of the way just two days from now good wake farest team comes to town then three Road games Mar DAV has played very well in the league Miami wake again before Louisville here at home and Virginia will come to town theyll go to NC State Carolina will come here down the stretch I really like Wake Forest and Ive been saying that all year you know first its Fon Reed that becomes eligible then is deari Monsanto to add to the mix when he got healthy and the back court for Steve Forbes and the way they can score offensively yeah their NCAA tournament good wake farest they just dont have the quality wins at this point the net is good the metrics are good but jelan AR has them just out of the field theyre going to have a lot of chance I mean those two Duke games will be quad One games for week the other team I like too is Clemson what a huge win in Chapel Hill and Brad Brownell has a great group around PJ Hall and Ian shein Joe Gerard lighting it up outside the ark he was terrific today in his old stopping grounds in the Clemson win at the Dome over Syracuse so 15point Duke lead Blue Devils get to 80 Harris is step back no and Duke can bleed the clock off another rebound from a Jeremy roach has it this was all about balance for Duke five players in double figures for the Blue Devils Boston College remains winless all time at Cameron Duke by 15 in home
