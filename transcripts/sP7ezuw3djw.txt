fifth year in college hoops is third with the Gators Todd golden his first year head coach challenged him and said last year you didnt go to the tournament thats not how you want your legacy to end and a new Legacy begins here for the 37 year old head coach of the Gators who has hired eight months ago today on March 18th Castleton takes the tip and its won by Florida State as Cameron corn the freshman at 6 10 part of this youthful and relatively inexperienced Florida State Squad Music yeah tip out of bounds off the hands of the sophomore will Richard and it stays with the Seminole 17 on the shot clock on the games opening possession the officials today Lee Cassell Doug shouse and Doug sermons here at Tallahassee Music but for FSU to begin the year they launched to Stetson by nine to UCF by 14 and then on Monday well by seven points against Troy Caleb Mills about a 13footer sends it wide to the right and here come the Gators with their first possession Applause Mike out in mantoman this is going to be key here how they defend this guy right here with the ball Colin Castleman we talked about it last two games 30 points and 10 rebounds and he played outside there as kawasi Reeves went to the basket went up and got fouled on that attempt right here nice little high low action a little grub screen and again this is a concern for Florida State and Leonard Hamilton a theme for them theyre shorthanded uh really seven uh scholarship guys really has been the theme for them the last couple of weeks so they can ill afford to get into foul trouble early in this game anybody whos followed Florida State basketball over Leonard Hamiltons 21 Seasons but especially the last decade for the head coach who missed out on the tournament last year for the first time since the 1516 season knows a statement of what he does his play guys in short bursts nobody really plays more than 30 minutes but that hasnt been the case this year because of injury because of suspension Mills into the lane stuck against Felder Music Applause Music Applause eight to shoot for their leading returning scorer and a fade away outside the lane no good soaring rebound pulled down by Richard Mike on that offensive possession by Florida State not much ball movement they ran a couple of high screen and rolls with uh Mills but again in that situation you really want the ball to swing a little bit see if you can get Florida spread out puts it up Castleton finishes with the left hand nobody boxed him out and an easy stick back we talked about it thats a guy youve got to put a body on double double the last two games for Colin Castleton thats a big time rebound a quick look and its Darren Green in the Junior from Charlotte North Carolina their leading scorer on the year at 16 points a game hes also playing about 36 minutes a game Applause Hawk as we go throughout this game fatigue being a factor for the Seminoles Castleton had it halfway down man youre absolutely right you just cant remember the last time a team coached by Leonard Hamilton as we take a look at some good ball movement there guys playing more than 30 35 minutes thats been a staple of his his devil from the corner Second Chance opportunity its Fletcher Music second season at Florida State after playing nine games his freshman year at the University of Kentucky Applause two and one a surprising loss for them Monday night against Florida Atlantic University 7674 and a Common Thread among the early season upsets no matter the league is you look at the threepoint total and Florida allowed 13 threes including at 18 306 run by the owls of FAU and when we spoke with coach Golden today this afternoon at shoot around that was one of the things understanding The Scouting Report uh they cannot give up these straight line drives like they did there and wide open looks Mills to drive the reverse slay in the Knowles with the early advantage three minutes and change gone by in Tallahassee Music Castleton and a jump ball and it belongs to the Gators Applause hey Mike this is good offense right here Caleb Mills is a guy they have to get going when we spoke with Coach Hamilton about him he said look hes adjusting to whether or not being a point guard and also learning when to score he says look we need his offense and certainly this is a good start for him tonight odd shot there from Reeves still had about 13 on the shot clock put up a contested three heres Cleveland just inside the arc thats a long two for the sophomore averaging eight again bought him out here early uh before shoot around started working on that jumper right there beautiful pullup and Lofton gets a clear path to the Lane the grad transfer from Saint Bonaventure Mills goes right back at Lofton and has the response for FSU Music Applause it is a promising start for a Seminole Squad in search of its first Victory Leonard Hamiltons not going to love the foul there on Caleb Mills but hes got four of ten for Florida State in search of its first win up early over Florida date as they have the lead against Florida its something that Leonard Hamilton and staff talk about they need his offense a great start for him right here not settling for jumpers driving the ball through the basket and thats what you want from Caleb Mills a guy that is one of their better scores a great start for Florida State second season with FSU he played two at Houston and averaged 13 a game last year to lead the team that went 1714 but 10 and 10 in the ACC and missing out on the NCAA tournament Applause on this series Florida state has won seven of the last eight but they lost on the road last year in Gainesville this match up their dates back to 1951 Applause all right Richard with the pass and its tipped up and in Jason jatobo the 611 Center Fresh Off the Bench gets two points yeah thats great work on the offensive glass it was a beautiful dish Cleveland hit by jatobo and the foul on the big man is first well Mike this is all set up though by dribble Drive excellent pass right here now that should have been a bucket uh but jotobo on the offensive blast we talked about his size Music uh he is a large but also great set of hands and quick feet hes an imposing presence and he wears those glasses because his season last year was cut short and I should say last season it was this year on January 26th he was hit in the eye has had three surgeries and were told in the spring at one point had to be laying down for about 20 hours a day to relieve pressure on his eye so a long path to get back onto the floor for jatoba hes an imposing figure 611 300 pounds hes matched up right now with nahim McLeod which is great for Florida State to have him back after he missed their game on Monday but the Seminoles the way they recruit in the post even at full health would not have a body the same size as YouTuber yeah its really hard to explain and so youre in person and see how large he is but again right here sliding his feet very mobile uh at his size Jalen Worley draws two Defenders and gets called for the offensive foul with a lowered shoulder into the lane sending fudge to the floor this is great team defense right here realizing youre big is it matched up against the guard step over and out that team defense right there and yeah lower the shoulder again thats this great help defense of that time by Florida now its Worley on the defensive picking up 94 feet against Byron Jones Music Applause fudge goes high low jatobo left block and hes hit on the way up thats a mismatched problem for Florida State theyve got to find a way to either deny or stop the pass entirely well right there there thats set up because they switched on the ball screen and now you have a guard uh trying to guard him and youre just not thats a mismatch thats an understatement excellent recognition by Florida though recognizing that Florida state is switching on ball screens and theyre going to be able to get some high low action with some postups with their bigs when the Florida state guard switched first free throw of the year right there for jatobo who plays about eight minutes a game against Colin College Bell Music was on nahim McLeod got hurt against UCF a week ago today his return was in question but watching him in warmups and practice this afternoon he looks to be full go with the right ankle healed Music Applause other than the loss for Florida on Monday their winds have been relatively comfortable by 36 against Stony Brook and four days later a 10point victory against Kennesaw State Music Music green sneaks into the lane just missed on the floater Applause Florida State continues to switch onto ball screens its definitely a mismatch in the post and try right in front of the FSU board secured by Fletcher Music Applause Mills tried to cross it over fudge poked it away reclaimed by Worley shot clock is at 12 Applause Fletcher Fades and gets back iron but what Florida is doing right now theyre doing a good job on the defensive glass theyre not allowing Florida State any second chance opportunity fudge the LSU transfer Mills gets a hand on it loose ball Florida state with numbers Mills steps through leaves it short and its followed up by Fletcher on the Run Applause oh my God the pressure defense the scoring in transition pictures of what Florida state has wanted to do this season has not been able to as they get closer to full strength Gators just three of 11 from the floor to begin the night and Mills off balance was looking for McLeod and throws it away Music well the one thing that Florida state is doing theyre not settling up for jumpers on the other end in this last really three four minute stretch Florida has settled for some jumpers uh if youre coach Golden you probably want your guys and as Castleman comes back into the game gets your big some paint touches we talked about their size Advantage if it comes off a dribble Drive kick yeah thats fine for three but try to get your big some touches is Castleton as you mentioned comes back in for Florida The Freshman from Dayton Ohio Tom house the threat from Deep hes on to the floor for the Seminoles a lot of traffic there in the lane and Trey Bonham first year of transfer from VMI draws the foul Hes listed at six feet you be the judge huh well you always get a few extra hits thats right so I think I might have in few books been six five six four Id say Im more on the 63 side but certainly you like the idea right there though not settling for a jumper try to get them all that time into the paint off the bounce I dont know for four at the line first make of the year right there Music but the key deaths in BMI he averaged 11 points a game over two seasons started off 29 for them last year for two and its a threepoint game Seminoles play around the cloud on the interior he comes up to set a screen Music Cleveland sees space threepointer no good Music from the corner that three altered by Caleb Mills the Seminoles with the lead they are setting the pace here in the first half turning defense into offense loose ball Caleb Mills foreign Fletchers there to clean it up Gary Williams and then Leonard Hamilton who does not have his team at full strength right now without the 611 Baba Miller whos suspended by the NCAA Big Man Jalen Gainey theyre all in three for the first time in 20 years still very optimistic about the way his team has practice and the way that they brought energy every day and I hope folks Watson got home pop that little note the youngest looking coach in the Leonard Hamilton I mean the guy recruited me back in the early 90s and he looks the same hes definitely found the Fountain of Youth I need to know his Secrets but obviously uh one of the best in the business there are some Secrets he wont divulge including where he finds seven Footers year after year on the pass inside for Castleton he is whistled for the offensive foul the first on the Florida big man who comes in averaging 25 points nine rebounds and one of the things that gets mentioned every time you hear Todd golden talked about his analytics right how he has a very analytics heavy approach well I got a good chuckle out of talking to him today because we were talking about Castleton how he convinced Castleton to return for this year and he goes you know hes off to a pretty good start hes ranked fourth in Ken Palm today well I can tell you right now analytics and everything else he is a very good player and obviously he Raves about what he brings to the table and you know you look at his timeline uh really fortunate that he was able to come back many thought he would just go to the NBA I think the shoulder surgery really uh hurt that but also he was excited when we talked to him about playing for coach Golden hes got some unfinished business here at Florida Gators On The Run led by CJ Felder the former Boston College Eagle Applause perimeter bottom had to go halfway down and that time of foul is called on Felder under the basket so two straight possessions where the Gators get called for fouls on offense and thats a great blockout by Caleb bills giving up a lot of size to CJ Felder and that time you got your guard there and killer bills blocking out its a pretty good look by Florida beautiful skip Court bass uh by Lofton thats a wide open look just unable to get it to go Applause house the freshman in control gives it up to Mills the Redshirt Junior Music Applause whistle here and a Class B technical foul going on bottom so the play is allowed to finish there the officiated mechanics have changed this year last year it was a flop warning if a second warning was issued it would be the technical foul they said the heck with that were trying to get rid of flopping its a Class B technical foul one free throw ball goes back to the point of interruption and if theres a play continuing like that they let the action finish before blowing the whistle yeah now that one right there Im not sure again from that angle it just looked like he lost his footing I like the rule though again uh flapping theres no I think place for it and basketball that one though from that angle right there Bannock that angle right there uh looked like now again right here you can see what the refs scene normally theres a head Bob back that one right there hes just trying to slide his feet that one uh I would say thats a tough break for Florida dont think that was a flop in that situation might have just been a case of momentum on The Retreat on the defensive shuffle house with the deflection fights for it Felder wins that battle hello and theres a quota to that as well the class B technical foul does not count as a personal for the player whom its given to five on the shot clock for the Gators bottom in the corner sneaks his way under the basket kicks opposite wing and the threepointer goes long for Google on the offensive board kugel oh nothing short of the rim Florida State by six Music shares mismatch underneath a turn and a finish for Corey the freshman at number three belongs to the alltime leading scorer in Florida State Hoops as well Bob Sura who played here 9195 Baseline Drive close range missed again Castleton get get control it stays Florida Ball but the Gators cannot finish at Point Blank Range at the moment yeah thats a couple of missed opportunities and right here screen and roll offense beautiful play by Cleveland now you dont want your big normally to put it down though thats a nice recover soft hands and then a little jump up and the offense right now is rolling but I think the key for Florida State right now and the reason why they have this lead defensively theyre contesting shots and then theyre doing a good job on the defensive glass and that has led to it over for 10 skid for Florida four different players touch the ball in that possession and the cloud erased it off the backboard Music straight to the cup of Cleveland timeout Florida 43 to go in the first half and Florida State with defense turning into offense leads by 10 speed inside the Tucker Center in Tallahassee as Florida state has taken a 10 point lead over Florida Matthew Cleveland after a nahim McLeod block coming down the floor and laying it all out yeah and everything you can see for Florida State at the basket all started with their defense as you reference uh theyre playing excellent defense and then theyre getting out in transition pushing the pace and theyre getting some high percentage shots butcher picks up against Lofton transfer point guard for Florida Music Castleton drew two lofted the pass to the corner and Richard stepped out of bounds well although they got a turnover they read my mind I was thinking they have to get Castleton a touch run your offense through him you can see what Florida States doing now theyre collapsing down doubling or shading guys to him run your offense do Castleton and then youll go from there but credit Florida State and then also doing what they need to do against Castleton because with his size and his skill you cant just play him straight up one on one McLeod missed it but its tipped off from Felder it stays FSU ball 20 on the shot clock and a frustrating beginning to the night for the Gators coming off their first loss of the season and some of these uh 50 50 balls have gone to Florida State and then the missed opportunities theyve missed at least four or five layups Applause Chandler Jackson and his college debut will be going to the freethrow line for FSU as the roster gets deeper and stronger in game number four of the year shorthanded this year hes not selling things short you there you see Baba Miller whos on the bench hes out for the first 16 games because of an NCAA suspension both the big man nahim McLeod and Chandler Jackson return today this is the career debut for Jackson and Jayla Gainey the transfer from Brown is out for the year unfortunately for FSU with a preseason injury and now here is Jackson at the line the Freshman out of Memphis who is Mr basketball in the state of Tennessee last year look at his right hand hes a righthanded shooter hes got that all taped up its still able to shoot all right with that yeah and you know speaking with Coach Hamilton this afternoon and we asked them when was the last time youve only played Seven guys really call him six and a half in the game and he said shook his head never in his coaching career and its probably been one of the most difficult two years for him because of all the entries of that Florida state has had and guys being out and youre talking about a lot of Hoops with his first year as a head coach at Oklahoma State all the way back in 1986 Applause lead wow is the largest lead of the season for Florida State they are not led by double digits in any of the first three games and its how theyre doing it though Mike Florida State as were going to take a look at Cleveland getting to of the basket Music and the paint uh for Florida State thats beautiful body control by Cleveland Florida only has six points uh in the paint uh thats the key to this game right now Florida State not settling for jumpers and theyve been able to get the ball uh close to the basket green Walks With It 707 Gators ball as they have shot in abysmal three of 20 from the field to start Florida State limiting Castleton to just three field goal tries of which hes made one and credit Florida State thats something they were working on look Leonard Hamilton did not want to change up of their style of play but theyve been conscious of shading guys towards Castleton and making it difficult for him to touch the ball look at that they swarm in on him at that time it ends up with a foul that goes against the Freshman Jackson but the game plan there is evident when he turns to shoot they collapse on yeah and thats again not a double but you see guys with their eyes on them now that time though I would say thats a guy that uh draws a lot of attention rightfully so we talked about the monster games that he has had the last two backtoback 30point games and doubledigit rebounds he has just been a matchup nightmare Applause Music so castletons now up to three points in their last game 30 and 12 to go along with five blocks along with hitting his first career threepointer and hes the first player at Florida since Anthony Roberson with backtoback 30point games since 2005 and theres another stat I was youre doing a little digging about uh joki Noah and he put up 37 at one point against Gonzaga 3711 so hes in some pretty good uh company of some Florida greats and just remarkable what hes been able to do early on in this season the numbers that he has put up Applause and as Todd golden mentioned rig number four among players in Ken Palm today behind Drew Timmy Zach Edie and Jalen Wilson pretty good company for Castleton to start the year contested jumper Cleveland misses it and its tipped off of Florida Applause I wanted to check that too because we talked with Todd gold and I said whats your media diet like on a given basis and he said well Im Im definitely on on Ken Palm for sure Im sure theres some Bart torvik mixed in there as well and certainly he said too much social media but fear not that we may be in the waning days of Twitter which might be a net positive for all of our Mental Health well I can tell you one thing right now that they need to do and coach Golden and staff are trying to figure out uh keeping Florida State out of the paint Applause Gators On The Run theyve got numbers Music they are without a field goal in the last nine minutes oh for their last 12 one make today for Castleton whos bothered at every step he takes and the three is good for Reeves a much needed bucket for Florida thats what they need to do play through Castleton if theyre going to collapse four or five guys down on him somebodys going to be open to shoot a three unselfish play by your star player Corin was wide open for a three there Cleveland gets double team fights through it and the foul is on Reeves his first Applause still offensively right here again he draws look at that one two three guys check it out dont force the shot up uh thats how their offense I think needs to be in this game uh in particular the way that Florida state is shading players to him make it eat for yourself if they double somebodys going to be cutting or open on the perimeter for some looks now you may be looking at kawasi Reeves his purple hair and wondering well whats exactly the deal there with the numbers on the back were told 999 are angel numbers they have meaning to some and according to the definitive source for Angel Number research cosmopolitancom that was just the first thing that came up on Google that indicates that closure is on its way well I can tell you right now hes front runner for all hair team uh we got uh some pictures of all the hairstyles that he has worn recently and thats just a little bit too much for me to explain it so Im not even gonna Im just going to end that conversation Im confused right now but certainly hes going to be a key player for Florida Music Castleton draws the defenders in it leads to an open look for Richard he misses Knowles by 10 under five and a half to go in the first half Malcolm its been a good number of these Florida State possessions where theyve come down the floor pushed it into the paint and then gotten it back outside Kayla Mills Castleton sagging off and makes him pay Richard bullies his way to the basket well thats a good answer uh by Richard that time uh one of the few times theyve been able to get the ball close and get a high percentage shot in the last really four to five minutes much needed bucket for Florida Applause Music Applause foreign guard against point guard jumper Too Short there for Worley Music Applause Music in the pass too high for Richard transfer from Belmont has to go off the fingertips and out of bounds well its been a frustrating first half were Castleton and again you can see the strategy for Florida State theyre going to make somebody else besides him score for Florida and another debut now for Florida State as well as Deontay green The Freshman out of Asheville North Carolina coming up to the top of the key here see that big brace on his right leg a torn ACL in his high school career hes cleared to play and Kayla Mills is clear for takeoff as well 13point Florida State Advantage with four minutes left in the first half and Mike Florida continues to flatten out on ball screens theyre not hedging The Bigs of Florida and theyre allowing the guards of Florida State to come off clean again that time kale of love right into his shot no help from the big two Defenders on jatobo and a emphatic finish by Purge right over the top and a tactical foul falls in the conclusion of the play Applause and I think it was more what he said after the Duncan uh golden not happy at all thats a really difficult time youre trying to get back into this game and thats his first person emotions running high in Tallahassee 3120 something bad it certainly wasnt his last name perhaps some words of a nonpacifist nature there as he threw it down over the top of the Seminoles defense and Deontay green yeah I think obviously we didnt see any words once he came down I think it was potentially something he said while he was coming down and then the steer down I think thats really what set off the rep unfortunate situation because again more right now youre trying to gain some momentum before you close out the ham youre trailing by double digits you get a dunk uh certainly theyll now shifts back towards Florida State where theyre going to get a technical free throw Music a lot of credit due to the Florida State Defense which has held the Gators to just 25 from the floor and Darren Green goes to the free throw line for Florida State he led the Knowles Monday against Troy 24 points for the first year transfer from UCF and he said the biggest difference coming here from playing in Orlando has just been the speed of the game and thats the style which Florida State plays hes at UCF a lot more set plays here we want to get a steal get out and run yeah and its been a huge pickup for Leonard Hamilton and staff uh his shooting ability I think thats the key thing that he brings his ability to stretch the deed we talked about it last two games over 60 percent from the threepoint line has been huge hes 39 from three for his career hes looking to get free here against Richard and he gets called for a foul the old announcer Jinx were singing his praises and then he picks up an offensive foul I think though the other key stat in this first half thus far Florida state only four threes attempted uh so theyve done a nice job uh getting the ball into the paint on the other end Florida oh they got to figure out offensively uh how theyre going to get some shots uh in the paint and not settle for jumpers Music right Music foreign Music Applause s for the Gators when Castleton is not on the floor more of a scoring threat in the post than jatobo comes down to just three seconds on the shot clock and a foul under the basket much to the disbelief of those on defense yeah thats a bailout right there excellent defensive possession by Florida State no need to foul in that situation lets see yeah I got him with the body certainly did not look like Monahan was going to have a good angle to make that shot even if he got it off it was going to be a difficult reverse layup Applause McLeod at 74 even if he doesnt jump he probably is still able to alter or block that shot and there were other guys there as well too on the other side to contest that reverse so again one of the few mistakes that they have made in this last really uh 10 minute stretch Florida State Defense will be otherwise theyve been solid playing Team defense is back onto the floor he and jatobo so this presents a mismatch in favor of Florida with the two big men out there and I like this move uh by coach Golden look Florida state has not taken a lot of Threes as we just referenced try to give yourself a size advantage and then gets two big guys in the paint and try to force Florida State to shoot the ball from the perimeter biggest player on the floor right now for FSU is Cam corn the freshman at 6 10 and significantly less experienced than his fellow bigs out there Cleveland Indian traffic Applause bottom right side of the lane he cant finish one and done on The Possession two and a half to play in the first half the lead is 11 and now make it 14 on Darren Greens fading triple at shoot around this afternoon Florida was working on transition defense thats something that coach Golden talked about in particular of finding green thats a breakdown in The Scouting Report and its a shot that has to be made when the deficit is double digits for the Gators to get back into it uh this right here knowing the scouting report this guy we talked about it last uh two games over 60 percent from the three white line you must find him in transition excellent patience and offense by Florida state that time and their secondary break 204 in the first and the Freshman cam Corin at the line who was recruited to Florida State by Leonard Hamiltons top assistant Stan Jones widely known as the architect of this defense and coren said Stan Jones recruited him through his trainer in Texas by the name of Brian Jones who Stan Jones recruited back when Jones was a player wanted him to come play for the staff at Miami and he chose to go to Alcorn State instead which was a surprise to Jones and many around the college basketball World a top 20 player who chose to go the HBCU rep and youre seeing that Trend a lot more now but certainly they are high on this young man though and what he brings to the table for this Florida State team and going back to that depth issue that we talked about that was lacking early in the season happy to him and the rotation Music Applause shot clock at 10 locked in with the speed Advantage there against Corin and finds jatobo for the put in beautiful fine by Lofton that time cant run it any better one of the better guards in college basketball huge pickup for Florida and a much needed bucket all set up by his court awareness FSU takes the time out theyll have the ball seven left in the first Music welcome to Subways biggest refresh yet that dropped in 12 new sub for their all new Subway series menu this is exciting Tony oh youve never seen stats like this before Chuck the new monster is juicy steak and crispy bacon dang but what about the new boss meatballs comforted marinara coupled with fresh mozzarella it looks so good it makes me hangry did you say green and pepperoni too pepperoni now Im hangry the new Subway Series the offense starts with Kyle Lofton for Florida as they Trail by 14 against Florida State he gets on the move and slips it right through for jatobo for two yeah and last season uh he was ninth in the NCAA close to Six assists per game uh the transfer from Saint Bonaventure and thats a huge pickup for this Florida team and he was one of the better four Generals in college Cleveland stymied by Castleton Greene works his way to the edge Fades away and the net thats a beautiful jumper that one right there contested thats just a good offensive player shooting over a contestant uh and Defender thats in pretty good position that barely clipped the rim on the corner tried from Reeves its a good look and drops it in he is on a chair right now a dozen for Terry green all set up Caleb Mills that is a beautiful transition offense thats another Gators turnover theres seven to the first half Castleton secures it hes up to six first half points and one possession left here for the Seminoles Malcolm weve got ourselves a sizable Advantage for the team that has not won a game this year how surprised are you right now well when healthy uh this is the Florida State team that I think most expected of coming into this season and certainly it has not been that way the first three games but theyve come out locked in defensively 32 that Florida State put up went through the basket in the first 20 minutes a team that is without a win on the year at home today feeling good in a sunshine state Showdown with a 4326 lead over the Gators at the half if Florida States going to run three guys at him somebody needs to dive to the hoop on a cut or Shooters should be open on the perimeter Castleton trying to become the first Florida player ever to have three straight games of 30 points or more six at the half Hannahs 17point deficit for the two and one Gators who made the two and a half hour trip here to Tallahassee and the first half begins with a foul on the junior Trayvon well lets see the adjustment by Florida on ball screens in that first half The Bigs were not hedging or stopping the ball right now they need to do that and try to keep these Florida State guards out of the paint Mills stymied there outside for Cleveland who had a nice first half he pulls up and sends it wide but in the first 20 minutes Matthew Cleveland 10 points more than he had in the last two games combined open look bottom hits it from three Applause coaches talk about that first five minutes of the second half and you can see right now Florida coming out with some energy coach Golden uh certainly was talking to them and I think they need to come out and match the energy that Florida state had in that first half no communication that time on the screen and Florida bench loving it yeah Lofton to drive in the kick Elton three Defenders it sinks to just one he turns and over the left shoulder hits front iron filner had it ripped away by Cleveland numbers for Florida State and out of bounds off of Fletcher Applause hockey go back to the last possession when Bonham hit that three I think its a microcosm of what the Florida state staff was telling us earlier today we might have guys who have a couple years of college basketball experience but not necessarily in the system on that screen there it was Caleb Mills whos in his second year here and cam Corin whos in his first the communication didnt happen and thats why the three got an open look there yeah and Leonard Hamilton really emphasized that this afternoon and shoot around where typically he has guys on his roster that have been in his system up for at least three or four years to go along with some of these new guys and young players coming in and the mix is just not there with this group Applause the lead 14 on the step back locked in every part of the rim a missed second try but the third opportunity drops for Felder thats great work on the offensive Glass by CJ Felder a takeaway at midcourt and an uncontested layin Kyle Lofton for two its a 10point game what a start here in the first two minutes the Gators have chipped away seven points off the Florida state lead Music Val on bottom his second well in that first half Florida state only had five turnovers Florida comes out in the second half picking up full court trying to force some turnovers and I think that goes back to the depth again Florida state is well documented uh they dont have much depth with the guys out Jordan now trying to see if they can fatigue other Florida State basketball Applause Fletcher kept it alive loose ball goes to bottom hes met at the rim by Mills whos whistled for his second foul its like that with their defense uh Florida with the chance to cut this thing to stingled digits uh really quick and you know Mike we talked about it uh it was Florida State in that first half defensively uh that set the tone and was able to get that big lead now the tides have reversed and Florida is the more aggressive team in the team creating opportunities with their off with their defense they have given the Seminoles a taste of their own medicine up and making it 94 feet of difficulty to get the ball to the opposing goal two free throws and an eightpoint game a shock to the system with the opening second half statement by the Gators Music Applause Music Applause well he is the guy that coach Hamilton and staff talked about they need his leadership thats his great body control against a very solid CJ Phil Felder and one situation and a much needed bucket uh to stop this run by Florida Mills the Elder Statesman for Leonard Hamiltons Club earned his undergraduate degree in July of this year and now working toward a graduate certificate in athletic coaching the second member of his family he said to graduate from college Applause Lofton the transfer from St Bonaventure at the point lobs high for Castleton who keeps it high and away from the defense thats a beautiful ass and heads up play by Castleton slipping right down there before that Florida State D can get there pass was pinpoint perfect pass and he kept it high and finished Castleton now with eight points five boards the games leading scorer remains Kayla Mills with a does it and Leonard Hamilton not liking the trend line of the opening three minutes calls it timeout Music Gators have used that same formula to get themselves back in this game along with a dose of their best player Colin Castleton well the energy changed the start the second half for Florida right here youre going to take a look at a nice backdoor uh cut that time by Castleton the point was passed was on point I think the big number uh in this game turnovers Florida State and their last game against Troy a game which they lost 19 turnovers uh Joy had 17 points off of those turnovers thats something they cannot do but credit Floridas defense from picking up Bills going to work against Castleton who Alters that shot comes down with it and starts the break for the Gators Music Applause and a fight for it and in there Richard the whistle Music well Floridas missed a lot of layups in this game right here though yeah looks like Castle Nevada Got Away got a little bit of hand right there we have the luxury of having replayed but a nice play and I like that he kept possession but offensively for Florida Mike theyve missed a lot of layups uh end this game put backs in the drive to the basket Gators still only shooting 32 percent a chance to bolster that percentage as Castleton with contact gets the bucket and the foul he is dangerous at all three levels thats a 611 guy this is the reason why I think hell play for a paycheck at the next level 611 shift Little Euro and finish thats a guard move right there by a guy that goes 611 she to see why he is one of the better players not just than the SEC but in college thats a big time move by Colin castling you and I will never be 611 we will never if you ever did in your life dont you win I did once the most relatable thing about Colin Castleton is he said his average score in a round of golf is a hundred Music and he scores on the put back from the left block this was a 17point game at the half and in four minutes the Gators have taken 12 points away from those 17 Corey couldnt Corral him and it goes back to the Gators oh this was the concern right here we talked about uh Castleton DoubleDouble the last two games uh he is just going to work on the offensive glass Applause you almost have to face guard him make sure he doesnt get the rebound but you must put a body on him the shot makes his way into an open look knocks it down 4643 Applause Music as shocking as the first 20 minutes were these first four and a half of the second half might be even more so the efficiency with which the Gators have played they have the chance to tie the game on this possession foreign Applause again if youre not there on the catch spin moves and then hes got soft uh hands and hes able to finish with the left or right and he is taking over this game early in the second half a 100 run not ended as Fletcher missed everything on that try Applause foreign getting to play off the ball a little bit with bottom handling the responsibilities three Defenders crashed down on Castleton its tipped Away by Cleveland and a 100 run for Florida along with six Florida State turnovers because he can change again hes taken over in the second half on his way to uh what looks like another double double Elite skill that time in transition but this is where he does most of his damage Elite footwork and finish uh he is just a matchup nightmare and weve talked about him coming off backtoback 30 plus games and hes had double digit rebounds in both those games 17 boards for Castleton Music the last three minutes ten unanswered points by the Gators foul goes against Corin his first and I think the biggest change Mike in his second half turnovers uh Florida State really has not handled this full court pressure by Florida and then theyve been able uh to get out off those turnovers Florida so then back rims it over the top of Corin first half FSU turned it over five times in the first five minutes of this half theyve turned it over six and make it seven on the offensive foul on Fletcher and that continues to be the area of concern for Leonard Hamilton Ryan Ford and state turnovers again its hard to win games when you turn the ball over it talks about their last game they had 19 turnovers gave up 17 points off of those turnovers Music Applause Music Music Applause eight on the shot clock bottom sneaks down into the short corner and floats it home and Florida has taken the lead 4746 degree of difficulty off the chart that is a contested floater on the Baseline tough shot Music Cleveland got stuck green curling heaving and missing Applause Castleton that does deflected and that done ties the largest lead of the game for the Gators now at 4946 after Florida State led by as many as 19 in the first half and a similar reciprocation at the other end as Corey Duncan well one of the few easy opportunities for Florida State and the second half but back to my earlier point in the first half almost 50 50 balls were going to Florida State so that counts its a foul and a goaltend so Castleton adds two to his tally Music Applause Music and its not a smart play right here again Im not sure this one was going in you have to foul yeah Im not sure that was going to go in and thats just giving him two three points chance for it and one opportunity Applause momentum shifted all towards Florida now to start throughout the second half free throw good for Castleton who with the timeout at the next dead ball Under 12 minutes goes to sit here and get a breather strategic rest there from Todd golden brought with him an experienced staff Carlin Hartman who coached for five years under lawn Krueger at Oklahoma Corey McRae whos been in the SEC for the last eight years and Kevin hovdy whos been with him for seven including two at San Francisco Applause well hes excited about what he can do with this program and uh one of the Bright Young Minds certainly I think the key was getting Colin Castleton to come back for that final year and hes got some other pieces around him jitombo with the rejection from behind its Richard running the floor catches it in stride and scores Sensational comeback effort 5448 the largest lead of the night as the Seminoles are desperately in search of answers and any hope has been slowly bouncing away in the second half Music still 12 minutes to decide things tonight and this Sunshine stage Showdown follows the guy who followed the guy and thats what Todd golden is in Gainesville yeah and hes excited he said look you know obviously uh upgrade facilities its a Jordan brand School uh certainly youre going to warm weather uh hes excited about the direction and what he can do with this program but hes fully aware of what the expectation is and some great coaches that have done it before him and speaking of great ones that long Kruger picture certainly gives me some bad memories played that team and the elite eight with a chance to go to the final four and came up short but certainly Land Cruiser one of the better coaches to ever do it Applause I went on to Illinois and UNLV in Oklahoma his final stop as a head coach now retired Im Mike cousins along with the former Boston College guard Malcolm Huckabee it was all Florida state in the first half and its been all Florida here in the second oh just send it to Bristol right now Alex fudge with a hammer SportsCenter Top Ten its not even a question my goodness elbow and Head Above the Rim its a play that can leave you speechless and this game has had some nice finishes but that one was an aerial attack Applause fudge swings to the near side from the corner Richard denied by McLeod sevenfooter back out onto the floor for the Seminoles hes not been out there much tonight only eight minutes Applause the two to shoot Corner three everythings coming up Gators Applause while everythings coming easy now the ball movement but it all started with their defense and then theyre just getting high percentage shots uh in the second half and the energy has shifted Mills puts it up and in that ends a 10nothing run but 24 of the last 28 points scored in this game belong to Florida a remarkable stretch over the last seven minutes where they saw a deficit werent bothered by it and have turned it into a nine point lead Applause still anybodys game here Midway through the second half but the Gators have to be feeling a lot better about their chances at the moment house with a freshman out of Dayton Ohio and hes called for a technical foul what did he do well get that figured out in a moment but lets look at this dunk again from fudge from outside the lane over the seven footer behem McCloud Sports Center top ten its not even close give that man the trophy right there Alex fudge taking off and showing off the Hops my goodness uh Elite athleticism Music veteran official Doug sermons coming over to the table for the explanation it was profanity spare you what he actually said give me that blank is what he said I can say were on cable but I wont well theres I dont want this to be my last game I like working with it yeah Im gonna leave that one alone you know if youre a Florida State in that situation obviously uh youre trailing the last thing you can do is to change the momentum quiet the crowd and thats exactly what you uh have done no need for it certainly its something that Leonard Hamilton will address with his team when he goes back and looks at this film little things like that uh just kill the momentum maybe they should just say it in Latin and that way nobody will be able to pick up on it oh offensive foul Applause and thats on Castleton thats his second both of his fouls have been offensive just trying to fight for position yeah and that yeah again hes trying to get position hes got a guard on him theres really no need for him to swing his arms use your legs throw him straight up but when you get him out like that and in particular you make contact Applause bad turnover right there Florida State comes in Owen three first time since the 2000 2001 season theyve started off with three consecutive losses Owen four its been a while 1959 1960 was the last time they started out winless in their last four games which was 25 years before the shot clock Turner over on one end turnover on the other its back to FSU down 6152 Applause Music well if Im Florida State Im trying to put Castleton and screen and roll situations cannot settle for jumpers if youre Florida State the wildly errant shot there from Fletcher team points eight boards for Colin Castleton trying to make it three straight 30point games nobody has ever done that in a Florida uniform and thats on Castleton broke the pressure they denied the guards he just brought it up like a point and started the offense for Florida Music ball ticks Cleveland started it down the floor he cant finish the break theres contact but no whistle and now the Gators come the other way and the play ends with a foul on Mills his third 802 left in the second half well missed opportunity you get a steal well thats one that needs to be a two uh for Florida State great recovery and thats two plays Now by Alex fudge of the dunk and then that time to chase down block to break up what looked like was going to be an easy uncontested layup for Florida State the kid in the montverde sweatshirt is only used to seeing montverd play that way Powerhouse High School in the Orlando area Applause Music theres a whistle and what exactly is the car Applause looked like something was wrong with the shot clock perhaps 7 55 second half and a sports center top 10 play from Alex fudge perhaps number one tonight yeah Im giving him number one out of this world my goodness Alex fudge the heat on Florida State without an experienced point guard and thats led to a huge differential in the amount of points they scored off Eternal yeah I mean 14 points off of turnovers in the second half thats the story uh of the second half thats when things changed 22 points off of turnovers for the game but uh make no mistake about it everything shifted uh when the second half started credit Florida they pressured them and then forced turnovers and and created offense with their defense I was gonna stop right out of the timeout Music green on the Baseline driving kick to the corner three is short for Fletcher off of dribble Drive kick out but that was not their strength in the first half thats not how they were scoring they were scoring with great defense and then getting out in transition and getting paint touches off the bounce uh conversely on the other side uh credit Florida in particular Castleton hes had a big second half Florida in the first half shot just 28 from the floor they turned it around in the second shooting 56 percent here in these first 13 minutes Applause Richard with three on the shot clock belongs to Mills Applause he dumps it inside Fletcher doesnt want to go to work against Castleton hes lying drive and its Cleveland for two and something that may not will not show up end of the game fletzer not settling for that three he was open uh realize thats not a good shot lets be a little bit more patient basket is no good an offensive foul Applause third on Colin Castleton all offensive and this Cleveland Drive is set up uh by Fletcher not settling 43 now had an ability to shoot it but decided to be patient and then Cleveland uh finally getting the ball into the paint excellent offense that time by Florida State Lofton into the game as Bonham gets arrested the point and Lofton matches up against Mills have green seminoles leading scorer gives it up gets it back he didnt have to shoot it as quickly as he did there were 13 seconds on the shot clock Lofton trying to get everybody to clear out Castleton goes to work one on two and scores through the double team how if youre late on the double thats tough to match up with him one on one footwork and then spin move back to the Baseline three guys on him didnt make a difference he was able to get to the bucket and score he has been amazing today sir at the other end its 6356 touchdown on the extra point the lead for Florida Castleton up to 21 points in pursuit of a third 30 points game in a row well in the first half Florida State uh they were doubling almost before Castleton has a ball round and out on the drive from Jones FSU ball all right now theyre stunting again theyre there just a little late and thats a lot of contact Castle is still getting it to go and then uhkella Mills right here this is beautiful body control and finish with the left back and forth the seven point deficit for uh Florida State but the pressure contain uh remains uh by Florida theyre picking up full and that has been problematic in this game uh for the turnovers for Florida State Music green and Cleveland lead the Seminoles each with 12 Greene hasnt scored in the second half under five minutes to go its Mills on Castleton oh thats a tough task and I like that offense by Florida State put Castleton in screen and rolls hes flattening out hes not hedging that gives your guards the best ability to relieve pressure and it gets to the basket open Lane locked in with the left hand on the right side Applause open look green doesnt need much space just missed it and a foul under the basket that goes against Applause Florida State well this right here again Castleton hes just flattening out on the screens hes not hatching thats a tough shot even if he misses the big for Florida State hes in position to rebound that I think that sometimes is your best offense for Florida State uh Castleton hes not again hes not hedging hes not trapping put him in a high ball screen and then let your guards go to work from there I was the eighth foul against the Seminoles it puts Castleton on the line for a 11 Music as U7 and point game Applause he has been impressive uh in this second half showed off handle and transition Elite footwork around the basket Ive been impressed through some of the passes that hes made out of the double and triple cheese of that Florida state has thrown at him Castleton had six points at halftime and 16 here in the second half the cloud goes up to the skies to get it couldnt keep his balance along the Baseline Lofton might have gotten away where they carry Castleton through the lane just off to the right and its McLeod who snares it Applause green testing how much room he might have there to work against Richard with a hesitation dribble and Mills thats foul number four on McLeod the officials have been keeping a very close eye on offensive fouls especially on the screens against Biggs 355 to go with a state in search of its first win of the Year Florida trying to go to three and one and get their first win here since December 5th of 2012 my cousins Malcolm Huck could be with you its been the biggest change in the second half as Florida was down huge 4326 at the break a couple of things I think the threepoint shooting obviously in that first half Florida struggled one to 12 8 in the second half uh they havent been taking that many uh theyve made two but the points off of turnovers thats been the biggest thing for Florida their defense has created offense and then Colin Castleton uh he has been great in the second half when theyve not doubled hes made them pay casualton the big man for Florida with 22 points eight rebounds and in the second half the Gators have outscored the Seminoles 4015 foul is on nahi McLeod thats his Fifth and the Seven Footers day is done Music so McLeod goes to the bench for the final time today as he finishes scoreless Music Leonard Hamilton in conversation at the scorers table with Doug shouse as cam Corin comes in important to know it as well that with the suspension of Baba Miller whos not eligible to return until January 11th and the season ending injury to Jalen Gainey the big men that have played tonight were in line to be the third and fourth on the depth chart at forward and center and Leonard Hamilton centrally said look nobodys going to cry for us but its been difficult for him uh the rotations just arent there because uh injuries and obviously with the suspension uh theyre not at full strength and in particular with their front door guys and a game like tonight against one of the best one of the better front Court players in college youre going to struggle Mills denied by Castleton three and a half to go Applause Music whistle under the basket and its Corin picks up his second as he Tangled with Castleton so Castleton back to the freethrow line where hes four of six tonight looking at 22 points Thats The Power of having a transformative player like him who scored six in the first half and Todd golden appealed to castletons Legacy to say you missed the NCAA tournament last year you dont want your career to end that way do you and as Castleton rehab the torn labrum and his left shoulder all throughout the summer he said he really bonded with golden and was convinced that you only get one chance to go to the pros and really try and impress wasnt going to be able to do it without being at full strength and thats what brought him back for a fifth season impressive bigs Ive seen Applause angler uh the ability to rebound and then right here uh he can bring the ball up like a point guard just really impressive of what hes able to do on the court because by nine Music time off the clock Loft into the rim followed by fudge looking for a second roof shattering dunk of the night Music and Cleveland at the freethrow line scores that ends with six nothing floor to run still a nine point game 222 to go certainly though the time and favor of Florida they can run some clock so Florida State certainly is going to have to string together multiple stops and its double bonus thrusted away already 10 team fouls against FSU just passes up a wide open look dishes to Castleton it belongs to the Seminoles with a second shy of two minutes left in the game Applause the largest lead of the night for Florida state was 19 points and that dwindled away at the start of the second half at one point Florida scoring 24 of 28 points in the game a good look like that its from Cleveland hes got that got the Gators feeling confident that theyll be winners here for the first time in almost a decade Applause thats off of Florida thats great hustle that time uh by Caleb Mills getting on the floor and coming up with a possession for Florida State certainly though time is a running out but this is just a great individual effort uh by Mills getting on the floor Jalen Worley with the left hand and a timeout taken by Florida State they made it a seven point game but if it isnt turnovers its gonna have to be fouling for FSU given how much time Florida can take off the clock here well I think minute 25 you dont have to start falling right now certainly you got to pick up see if you can force another turnover and if youre Florida obviously the last thing you can do end this situation is turn the ball over run the clock or make them follow you and then take it down as deep as you can but you mentioned the large lead of that Florida state had one area that theyre going to have to fix whether or not they have injuries or people out is the turnovers its very difficult to win games when you give up that many points off of turnovers Music Applause the most impressive part about what Florida did to erase the deficit was that they got rid of it all in about five minutes because the last time that Florida state held the lead was with 15 minutes to play in the second half since then its been all Gators but a win they go to three and one a loss would drop four to stay tall and four Applause Jones a skilled ball handler got lost as he left his speed and had no destination for the ball minutes ago seven point game urgency High Mills launches his three is no good and he bumps there wasnt looking to foul based on his reaction all right itll be two free throws here 46 seconds as those assembled inside the Tucker Center see a defeat imminent for their Knowles and start to head for the exits yeah yeah and in that situation Mills has no really option but to foul Florida with a chance to run the clock all the way down yeah you dont foul theres 15 seconds left in the game absolutely Applause Music Myron Jones who had only scored four points in the first three games second year Gator after spending his first three at Florida State theyre after a regression away from his averages last year he returns to what he was playing under Pat Chambers in State College where at his best the average 15 a game and theyre going to need his offense uh but uh back to what I think both coaches are going to look at when they look back at this film still some time 46 seconds left but that size of the lead that Florida state had if they eliminate the turnovers uh Phoebe obviously this score looks a lot different and I think the lack of having a point guard hurts them Mills really more of a combo guard hes a more of a scoring guard but he is going to have to I believe be the guy to step up and be the point guard and leader of this Florida State team I think thats really whats hurting them on the other side I cant say enough about Colin Castleton uh he is just a really under control understands the game didnt force things in that first half when he was basically getting guarded by four or five guys that time passed it out but then when he realized his team needed him to take over he game over and really Florida state had no answer for him assuming the Florida Victory here as well its a missed opportunity for the ACC which as a league had won only 71 percent of its games here in the first couple weeks of the season and they were two and four against Power Conference teams when this game got underway that changed as Virginia picked up a huge win over a top 10 team in Baylor in the Continental Tire Main Event and earlier today Virginia Tech had a twopoint win over Penn State as well 5169 man watch out for a team like Virginia EA Clark hard to believe hes still a playing for that Virginia Squad foul on a threepoint try three free throws coming here for Caleb Mills as importantly for Florida State it stops the clock and close golden ready to go through the roof right there he is screaming uh the whole possession to not foul and certainly that is not what you want to do in that situation give up three certainly stop the clock Applause Music Applause easier things at the end of games 389 seconds left still some time for Florida State to try to pull off the miracle but its going to have to start with them getting some turnovers all three for Mills the sub brings in another ball handler for the Gators Myron Jones spells Alex fudge Music Florida State right here I think you got time to go for one trap and try to get a steal Jones didnt like the look takes the time out point game at what point in the season Malcolm do you feel like a coach knows what hes got so to say its probably not the four game Mark of the year right no absolutely not for Florida State uh its just been difficult for them to field the team with scholarship players to practice remember he only had seven scholarship players for those first three games so thats really tough for him uh to manage and I think with Florida Squad a new coach new system uh you have some new guys coming in uh transfer guys that played in a different completely different system I would say probably December maybe some teams even January before you really understand uh what you have in your team what rotations strengths and weaknesses of your team sends Kyle Lofton to the freethrow line and Lofton The Graduate transfer from Saint Bonaventure they can keep him out there on the floor all they want because he doesnt get tired last four seasons he played an average of 38 minutes a game the most in the country now he wont have to play 38 minutes a game with the Gators but it was he funny he heard from Todd golden who said sometimes its better to be lucky than good when it came to loftons recruitment because they were recruiting another player on the Saint Bonaventure roster in the portal and when that other player talked to Coach golden he said well is it right if my buddy Kyle comes with me too he said sure why not so it all happened pretty quickly call was Monday they were down in Gainesville on Thursday and as it is in our era of the transfer portal there was another player the Gators were recruiting they said hey we need you to make a choice and Lofton was all in it happened in about a week Seminoles still have the pressure here against Castleton whos got 24 short of 30 but to be ashamed of with that effort with averaging 25 coming into this game so the average wont take a dent and his status Applause just had coach Todd golden well keep him at worst among the top 10 players when Ken Palm updates tomorrow hear what the data says that guy is one of the best players in college basketball work Elite but I think back to your point on Lofton I think hes key for this Florida team he was one of the lead assist guys in college basketball last year at St Bonaventure ninth in the NCAA close to Six assists per game and you have a floor General like him on the court certainly makes it a lot easier for you to run your offense to go along with one of the best bigs in college and tshirts can certainly be a lot more in his rotation now making the move from Olean New York down to Gainesville Florida gonna see the Sun a lot more Music 7467 tipped out of bounds still with the Gators Music well on the other side it looks like Florida state is a 166 seconds left no coach likes to take anything positive from A Loss certainly they were looking for their first win of the season but there were some positive signs in that first half for Florida State but the turnovers again I sound like a broken record thats something they got to figure out hopefully uh assume theyll start getting some of these guys back into their rotation healthy again uh to practice but Florida state looks like theyre still going to be inserts of their first win of the season well launch drops them to Owen four the last time that happened in Tallahassee the 1959 1960 season and theyll get a chance for win number one come Monday when they welcome the Mercer Bears here for a 6 30 tip and then after that its off to Orlando for Thanksgiving play where theyll start against Siena hopefully not invoking Saints in search of help and their quest for win number one Gators are up to three and one quite a way for Todd golden to pick up his first road Victory as the head coach of the Gators on enemy territory here in Tallahassee 7667 the final tale of two halves first half dominant performance by Florida State and the second half really within the first five minutes uh Colin Castleton
