freshman the Washington DC Gatorade player of the year last year and he has come in and just bur right on the scene for Harvard so far in really the first truly tight game the Crimson had played this season he showed a great deal of poise for a true freshman so Harvard is 40 Boston College 3 and0 and first opportunity inside Justice AO at the rim no good he was in foul trouble last night for the Crimson the senior from Nigeria at Boston College on offense for the first time same starting lineup for o Grant with Claude L Harris Jr Zachary and Harris knocks down the Applause triple oh good start for Boston College and claudell Harris the transfer from Charleston Southern who was the all big South Second team last year the conferences second leading scorer Louis Lesman threo specialist tries it and missed ajabo is inside thats going to be a good matchup with him and post and Ajo has his first two points that should feel good for Ao no points eight rebounds he fouled out in the game in ammer last night and a couple of really experienced post players in post and AO doing battle down low at 61 averaging 7 and A2 points so far this year good take by Devin mlon for his first two Boston College playing with a lot of speed here in the early going good drive by m glockton heres Mack and he gets the assign with Jaden Zachary against him defensively this is one of those games where the task for Zachary is much less about offense versus what it is defensively against number two here is PJ thats off the mark and quick post as his first rebound Boston College coming out with some defensive intensity using that speed on defense as well remember this Harvard team had to play 45 minutes worth of basketball less than 24 hours ago Im very curious to see what their stamina is like this evening Quinton post first three try is off the line its not completely foreign to the Crimson to have to go back to back they do it in the ivy league a lot Friday Saturday in conference play though its not as prevalent as it was at one point in the past when it was all that the ivy league did in the regular season that game last night Eric physical grinding you can see a lot of tired players out there by about 930 last night Jaden Zachary off the mark from three theres Tommy Amaker in his 17th season at the helm of Harvard what a program he has built 262 wins for NCA tournaments in consecutive Seasons from 2012 to 2015 which snap the 66y year NCA tournament drought for the Crimson back from the free throw line he gets his first points did a great job rolling off the screen he had Zachary all over him and you see his quickness right there you just give him a little bit of a crease and hes going to attack the basket Alik Mack 218 points per game so far as 20 in three consecutive games not only is Harvard going back to back remember they also played Tuesday against nor Eastern at home so just a busy week all together theres Po and Quinton with his first two really impressed with his foot speed for somebody whos 7 feet tall and he did a nice job staying patient even after he lost the basketball staying with the play post really came on well and that game against Richmond as we talked about ojabo nearly lost the handle on it kept it alive but ha for a Applause Music Applause travel heres Earl Grant on the other side for Boston College was pretty happy with the way his team responded and said you know we just kind of got back to the game plan it wasnt anything crazy we just committed to what we set out to do early in the game and really did a nice job working their way back and Richmond can be a tricky team to play against with all those back door actions they like to run and maybe it just took a little bit to get used to that EV mton inside was stopped Harvard blocks a ton of shots they block seven shots per contest so far this year thats seventh best nationally Eagles create a lot of turnovers and then a foul is called on Malik mat its the pass in the paint right there and Prince was right there to knock that ball away and disrupt things Harvards really had difficulty getting the ball in the paint except for that one shot to aabo Applause hit League Bay finds Jaden Zachary OST on a hand off for Harris but travel a shade under 16 to go here in the first half in early 74 starts for Boston Music College after to their first 40 start since the 20134 campaign didnt bring a ton back they graduated a bunch of players Chris Lam who was with them last year now playing for St Johns and Rick patino and then maybe most notably Evan Nelson out for the season he suffered an Achilles injury during Harvards Canadian tour in August but when you have freshman like Malik Mack who needs returners and youve had Chandler PJ as the Eagles steal it away step up as well a sophomore Zachary out front Jaden Zachary with two on the assist from Harris Boston College getting in the passing Lanes knocking that ball away and Zachary on the run out good start for BC 94 lead here 4 and 1 half in lesmond whos returning from missing most of last season due to injury aara inside tough take couldnt find it and another rebound for post I think the length and the speed of this Boston College team really giving Harvard fits right now as theyre looking much more out of sync on offense than they did last night Zachary right to the basket good kick to the corner Harris little short that time and ma gets the rebound off the tip from Applause lesmond yeah youre right about Chandler PJ a real Revelation this year for Harvard and Tommy Amer told us as a block from mton from behind that it was really on that Canadian tour that they saw the jump that theres the potential for for Chandler PJ and then he proved it down at rice last week with a careerhigh 23 points he had a great game last night against UMass he played 42 minutes and had 15 points and five of eight shooting throw and 11 rebounds as well and heres a big reason why the Crimson remained undefeated last evening back slipping through kept his dribble tried a little handoff for justice aipo its knocked out of bounds stays here with Harvard T to shoot for the Music Crimson Crimson already have turned the ball over four times headed to go over their oh mack is fouled and knocks down the three going to say headed to go over their average but the heck with that theres a great shot by mat off the inbound play and thats what hes capable of doing he is a quick release he was the inbound play just a little give and go and it get fouled and a shot at a fourpoint play nice pass there by the big man AO its the body after from Zachary that gets called to the fouls the first foul on BC and on Zachary so Mack can make it a fourpoint play at the line see if this Sparks Harvard as well as he left it a little short their offense looked a little flat in the early going but can be a momentum play gemson averaging nearly nine made threes a game so far this year theyve been very good shooting the ball from the outside oh skip pass inside Harris has been a big factor today and his foul they cleared post out that time and that opened up some room in the paint Harris went in and Harris has uh come on nicely for this Boston College team MJ as some Callum and 11 points over the last two games and uh hes been a nice find for this Eagle Squad as we have a little bit of a discussion about the situation whether were going to have a shooting foul or not it looks like it is indeed a shooting foul yeah weve been told that its his middle name which starts with an m and then the fact hes a junior hes been known as MJ since he was young most of the players when youre just around the team and in the locker room he goes by Music MJ Donald hand in the game for the first time for BC along with Armani Mighty and then on that last sequence Thomas batist the second first year from Washington into the game for Harvard Boston College this year nearly 82 from the foul line and thats something that can carry them a long way in close games and theyve already played in a couple of those this season Ed it out against Richmond came from behind to beat the Citadel lesmond for three thats in and out and a foul on the rebound try against Mighty Lesman is in the corner and you can see Mighty displacing Ajo right there got the hip in his be behind and displaced him thats why we have a foul call and Harvard still has the basketball again Zachary against Mack as the match up to to watch today idy came over to help skips over bati for three is good Thomas bati who also came out of that Washington Catholic League he went to Gonzaga ma who played at St Johns but they both played on the same a team so theres a lot of familiarity there for two First Years coming in from Washington and Harvard doing a good job finding other options and Mac has to give up the ball and getting creative to get him the ball and then a foul called away from the ball on M so thats two quick ones in a row on Armani Mighty Zachary all over back in a tough skip pass but had the jump to get that but he was left wide open and hit that shot hes only a 27 threepoint shooter but a big shot other people are going to have to step up for Harvard the way Zacharys playing defense against back tonight Harvard is got from 104 to 1010 here 94 I should say to 1010 heres Max straight on three ball thats off and Donald H comes in for the rebound ured freshman back healthy this year after his injury in the second game of the season just 37 seconds into his appearance against Detroit Mercy last November post found it inside really good move from post had to fight through some contact against Luca Ace neski down low and able to battle right through that he has such soft hands receiving the pass post does and a foul called away from the ball on the screen before the lesmond 3 that was Ace nesu you just mentioned who picked up the foul ball goes in the post neski had him locked up but just look at that first step toward the basket and thats a very experien player going against a freshman down low and you you can see where that experience that strength really paid off for Quinton post Zachary inside for post going against Ace neski and he got it off the window so six early here for Quenton last two possessions Boston College realizing what might be a mismatch not messing around getting to the ball to post and letting him go right to work denim Ws in there for the first time for Harvard well see if Harvard goes a little bit deeper today after playing of course into overtime yesterday Max no good there and Prince Al League Bay has the rebound Chaz Kelly in the game for Boston Applause College they like this match up with post right now with ajabo out of the game and post to Fall Away jumper and Tommy amers got to use the timeout I think hes going to have to get AO back into the game as post went off there for six points in a short spurt and a six nothing run gives Boston College an early sixpoint lead at TMobile get four new iPhone 15 on us and four lines of unlimited for 25 bucks a line what do you think of the jacket you look like a marshmallow 1610 Boston College the lead it was six points in a row all of them from Quint post after Harvard had tied the game 1010 and Justice aipo is back in the game here and Boston College really did a good job of exploiting that match up with post with Ajo off the floor and Boston College because of post outscoring Harvard in the paint by a 102 margin right now and youre right aabo going to have to stay out there but the good news is he played less than 20 minutes for Harvard last night since he was in Fall trouble yeah hes kind of the only one right yeah heres woic five to shoot for the Crimson taking away El Le bay prince out front coming off his first double double against Richmond and a leak Bay with his first two showing off his speed and his athleticism right there as Harvard had difficulty getting into the offense he took advantage of it six turnover for the Crimson in Boston College with six points off turnovers in the early going wji was a little tentative heading to the basket with the shot clock running down at Le League Bay just swiped that ball right away and a fine slam dunk down at the other end I feel like Eric this is the start Boston College needed against a potentially tired Harvard team you know get them on the ropes early and see if theyre able to fight back but have to be happy the way they started compared to the way they started on Wednesday well thats the big thing right I mean youre right about the Harvard point but just a better start to begin with free ball Corner Pocket good chm aara the sophomore its coming off an 87 rebound night last night in ammer and good ball movement that time by Harvard knock power wide open and little bit short to answer kin mton back in for a league pay Tommy amers done a fine job in 17 years at Harvard last two seasons 500 Seasons but you have to remember in 2020 2021 Harvard and the rest of the ivy league didnt play at all and they also only have four years for their athletes theres no such thing as grad transfers or extra years or anything like that so it makes it very difficult that may be part of the reason why Harvards been down a little bit by their standards really good take there by oara yeah Tommys really humble about it when you talk to him but the impact that Harvard had in the early 2000s him building the program and then going to the tournament that stretch from 12 to 15 really a catalyst for changing the ivy league and you look at where the ivy league is right now and some of the results so far even just early this season it is remarkable how good this league has the potential to be as AO inside has four points he came back in and all of a sudden Harvards offense has started the flow nicely again they found him down low as he beat post along the Baseline so after an 8 nothing Boston College run a 7 nothing Harvard run in the last minute to answer its a onepoint game once again halfway through the first half ason Madson on the drive got three Defenders on him hand slips through and his floater was short AO that time I dont think he got a piece of it but he certainly disrupted the shot and that is what he does inside such a crucial piece for Harvard and a three ball is good and the Crimson take the lead shees aakara and Earl Grant now will return the timeout oara a couple of threepointers and Harvard maybe they shook off some of the tightness or the stiffness from that game last night all of a sudden they get going on offense and started it it started here with aabo he got behind post and was able to attack the basket nice pass and then theres oar wide open Boston College slow to close out and all of the sudden the Harvard Crimson come roaring back into this game to take the twopoint lead the thing thats been interesting about this first half so far is both teams have gone on their runs a little bit but theyve been really quick runs PC at what 6 nothing in a minute Harvards 10 nothing and 92 seconds you see the numbers for Harvard where they are this year compared to the last couple of years offensively and defensively last year they were pretty good but obviously offensively they had trouble finding some consistent scoring well that certainly has changed this year with M coming into the fold PJ emerging and you still have the old veteran in ajabo relatively speaking in the paint so they have some nice pieces here that theyve been able to put together and you know it seems like their offense is certainly trending in the right direction here in the early going a locked in off the feed from Zachary its blocked thats what ajabo does we told you the Crimson blocked seven game so far this year and AO affects another shot at The Rim matched up on Quinton post backs him down turns left got to get it Applause out boic got a screen kick for PJ three ball good again Chandler PJ the sophomore and Harvard is on a 13 nothing run theyve hit five shots in a row several little three pointers because theyve driven the lane and then kicked the ball out last three threepointers have been just like that aara got his hand in lets look at the Block first at the other end here comes Justice oero from behind able to not foul and knock it away and a good pass there by Denim wji and PJ wide open Boston College collapsed down on the paint and left PJ wide open on the right side PJ has that ability to knock down the three when hes able to get his feet set Harvard shooting 53 in the early going they made five in a row Zachary to end the Run blocked again aara that time now back on possession ajabo with the double team Zachary got a piece of it AO still on it turnaround shut no and Mason mson finds the rebound great job by post staying on his feet just using his natural height and length to affect that shot good help from Zachary that glocked it inside got through a double team and a good assist from Quint post great pass by the big man and really a tough take by the Boston College player that time and M Lockton goes right to the bucket and post is really doing a good job with his passing early in the season averaging three assists the game so far and a good find there theres a great job staying in a foul trouble generally too lesmond for three falling away no AO steals the rebound from post and then its Knock Out of Bounds they got the foul first on the rebound on wiic coming in on the second effort so BC ball when we come back it was a 13 nothing run for Harvard doing it on both ends of the floor over the past two years Jersey Mikes fun no word if theyre hopping the plane with BC to Kansas City on Monday as Zachary knocks down the three BC now two of seven from threepoint range nice play coming out of that timeout stem the tide for the Eagles Zacharys not taking nearly as many threes this year as he has in the past now some of that is hes really kind of the one true point guard hes Shay a little bit short from three had a pretty good possession percentage when hes Tak taken it throughout his career hes turned over there as PJ got in the Applause LED oara against post mton got a hand in and its knocked out of bounds off Carver Boston College hits their second threepointer a pass out of the double team left Zachary wide open Harvard Tred to trael on the sidelines brought the Eagles back to even 23 a piece butell Harris pull up jumper thats off the mark and another rebound for PJ thats three in the early going sorry Eric just one offensive rebound so far as Madson pulls it down need for post Quinton going to work its kind of the first time time that BC had sort of beaten the defense down in the last little bit it was a decent look but post couldnt finish BC just two of its last 10 from the floor lesmond there short from three that looked like a tired shot maybe somebody whose legs are a little bit heavy is hes a far better shooter than what he demonstrated right there and thats something to keep an eye on with Harvard they kind of found their energy about four or five minutes into this game Zachary second efforts there but how long can they carry it given the back to back meanwhile Zachary thr it from outside and then attacking the rim right there well we talked about it Jadens most important task today if your Boston College is shutting down Malik Knack but hes finding his points here in the early going and the Eagles have a lead again 517 to go and this first half from kti Forum heres Mack against Zachary eight to shoot for Harvard switch comes on aabo for to shoot kicks to the corner a wide open three but its off the mark from oara who got lost in the shuffle but couldnt knock it down a glockton tries a three ball thats Off the Mark Boston College now two of eight from threepoint range I think those were both threes that if youre the defense youre okay with the opponent taking as Matan on the drive is fouled all of a sudden the Eagles have responded here with the seven nothing run and theres Zachary such a crucial piece defensively Earl Grant talks about how you know everybodys going to talk about Quinton post and his scoring output and potential all ACC type player but Zacharys really the glue that holds everything together with this group hes quite a versatile player isnt he as you saw that stat on the bottom when he scores 15 or more points and hes been helping post out on that offensive end here in the early going really impressed with the speed too both on defense and how he runs the floor into the offense look like Quinton post have been bleeding which is why he was forced to come out well Grant talking with two of his leaders as M knocks down the free throw 15 of 18 from the line coming in see post heading to the end of the bench there and its worth noting with post going out Ace veski comes back in and ajabo gets a break here so Tommy Amaker matches up almost like hockey there getting the last change its actually a really smart way to do it you see their best big mans going to go out Im going to give my guy some rest when he needs it and you know thats what happens when you have a veteran coach like that theres those little things within the game those little tricks that theyre able to go to not that its a trick but those little Applause tactics Zachary sneaks in tough floater a league Bay finds an offensive rebound cycl go around for Harris on the drive nice slip move oh what a move from MJ Applause Harris butti now inside the first year against the league Bay lost the handle on it m glockton finds it but his back was on the line out of bounds so Harvard will get possession with 403 remaining here in the first what a Nifty little move by quad L Harris getting to the bucket a scorer score and the Eagles are P up Music two Applause Music Alik mat kicks it over to PJ inside left hand no and Alik Bay has the rebound M glockton did a nice job flying over right there to disrupt that shot Zachary gets in the lane Zachary the bucket and the foul tough take in side from Jaden Zachary nine early points in the game and he just got match his second foul over the past two years Jersey Mikes fundraiser for feeding America three to go in the first half and well weve seen some pretty significant swings but theyve kind of happened in short windows where it hasnt necessarily felt like these massive kind of runs up and down but even right now Harvard has not hit a shot here in more than 5 minutes from the floor all of a sudden and they havent hit any of their last eight shots that theyve taken and part of that because Malik Mack just hasnt been able to get things going seven points now hes in foul trouble with two fouls and Bs for Harvard will need to step up as Zachary hits the and one so 30 25 the BC lead 10 points for Jaden Zachary this is one of those scores with Mac its not like youre going to completely shut him down but they have certainly taken him out of rhythm Harvards had to go some other ways done some with some decent success though Chandler P knocks it down he is five feels like a punch counter punch kind of a game Eric where both teams are going to have their runs but how do you respond to Applause it well a or rather big your pardon that was Oar that time found a cutting PJ he saw the double team and PJ as we mentioned to sophomore he didnt do a whole lot last year but hes averaging 13 points a game he had 15 last night at UMass and he turned into a fine for this Harvard club and really filled in a void that they had you know given their injury situation and not having Evan Nelson this season after he was hurt uh during their tour of Canada this summer The comparison that Tommy Amer used with us this week he said not so much in terms of a player but just in terms of the potential jump as a sophomore and what they saw in the off season was Wesley Saunders who was part of all of those NCA tournament teams in the early 2010s as Tommy am said arguably one of the most decorated players in the history of Harvard basketball but they saw a similar jump from freshman to sofor and he said he was hoping again not that hes going to achieve what Saunders achieved necessarily not putting that on him but just in terms of what they saw in the Improvement freshman the sophomore year in the off seon Elite Bay inside a leag bay was blocked another shot affected at The Rim thats five block shots for Harvard aara right down com have and the foul a burst of speed through the lane and aara has a chance to give the Crimson the lead back well theres a block right there and Crimson get out do some running akara gets the ball and he saw that Lane right down the right side of the paint and for a man who is 68 225 he had a pretty nice turn of foot to attack the basket and get himself to the foul line Devin mton called for the foul oh all of a sudden from 0 of eight to three in a row from the floor from the Crimson who now lead with 229 to go here in the first half 11 points for Rara Boston College having old difficulty moving the ball around the perimeter but and Zachary drives and thats kind of been the best offense that the Eagles have had its been poster Zachary driving to the basket or getting the ball down low but not moving the ball a whole lot around the outside onepoint lead again for BC that pass knocked or wasnt knocked it was just straight out of bounds Eagles possession under two to go in the first half eight turnovers now for the Crimson Boston College do good job hanging on the ball just three turnovers Earl Grant still in that walking boot kys injury that hes been dealing with all through the off season and early part of the Year post for three that was short Quinton is 0 for two from behind the ark tonight Applause Music loic slips through finds oara been a huge piece here lately got caught up and possession will give it to Boston College Chaz Kelly forces the held ball on the drive mlon had the initial defense but heres Kelly just racing right in to help out and the ball sticking just like that he latched onto it it wasnt going to let go until there was a whistle that gets Boston College an extra possession here as we head down the stretch of the first Applause Music half that goes down as another turnover of course so thats nine for Harvard his first Music half DC with the smaller lineup out there besides post post off a little slip spin move kicks it Zachary was open Zachary drives in that was affector to the rim just tough to get it up over Ajo and the Crimson down one lesmond steps into a three and got it Louie lesmond with his first threepointer of the half and Harvard takes a twopoint lead give lesmond the step he has such a quick release and he did that on the shuffle going from right to left but here is a beautiful shot first couple he took were short but nailed that one a leag b answer no good and its down to lesmond just about a second difference between The Possession and the timer here at the end of the first the Crimson can hold on for a final look have to give the Harvard Crimson a lot of credit long night last night as we mentioned the slow start here but they come fighting back and should have the lead to end this half youc led by as much as 18 to 10 remember and there a foul called away from the ball so Boston College will get a chance here remember Wednesday against Richmond the Eagles were down seven and hand hit a three at the buzzer to cut it to four going into the halftime break and give BC a little momentum on AO yeah he stuck the leg out on the screen officials were all over that that was his first foul so 59 remaining adson gets it into Zachary Jaden pull up three ball at the horn a little short followed by a league Bay then another follow oh boy that would have counted from Madson so the Eagles ended up getting three tries at it but its the Crimson with the 35 Take the Lead as we go to the second half 40 Harvard 30 Boston College first opportunity P inside right hand gets the roll tough shot cutting into the lane able to float it over post and PJ getting things going offensively oh seven points now for Chandler PJ inside a league Bay a little short but immediately realized it and then was blocked after getting his own rebound League Bay just stuck under there going one on Three totally surrounded pick ball on Zachary here the numbers out of the first half tonight Harvard 45 from the floor you Earl Grant mentioned it a few too many threepointers for his liking and that kind of was able to get through perhaps the turnover numbers back pass ajabo inside got around quick post Applause aabo has been a huge Factor when hes been in the game six points now but its like what Tommy amiker told us hes just an anchor on the back line then hes a focal point of the offense as well and he was so patient going to the basket there letting the defender fly right over him he sat down able to hit the layup give Harvard credit up six back end of a tough back to back no little effect so far a league bag hes stripped pay was there defensively and oara on the run and the foul goes against Boston College well heres Harvard again you see the strip that time and look how all the Crimson start running quickly up the floor Flor looking to attack thats something that Tommy amers teams generally do and you know just a good sense of basketball IQ aara kicks to the corner heres Mack on the drive left hand and a foul on mlon and thats two in a row on Devin mlon so thats now three ma hit the deck hard Lockton came in to challenge the shot Here Comes Mac and mlon got like clocked him right in the head sending him hard to the court so for now mlon will stay out there with three Applause fouls ha now has 10 points its been kind of a quiet 10 points Eric three of six shooting three of four from the foul line and some of thats owed to Boston Colleges defense with Zachary on him but still quietly able to find 11 points and three rebounds five assists doing a lot of things well for such a young player yeah even as a first year its about limiting its not about stopping when it comes to him and thats turned over and thats a couple in a row here for Boston College to begin this second half and lesmond for three in and out after the Crimson had already scored the first six of this second Applause Music half Zachary gives it back for Quinton Music post Applause post falling away is blocked Eagles trying to play a twoman game between Zachary and post and Harvard did a great job defending and again Boston College not moving the ball around all that well in that Applause possession is that match up against Zachary all over Applause Mack Mack falling away oh what an effort Malik Mack and Harvard has its largest lead of the game at 10 what Poise by Matt to hang in there to go oneonone to have the confidence to do that Harris to answer big one from Claude L Harris junior he has nine Eagles needed Applause that Boston College you got to try to string some stops together both Harvards playing with a great deal of confidence theyve amped up their defensive pressure you can see the the Crimson are quite comfortable right now aabo kicks it for lesbian three ball thats off so Louis lesmond kind of a surprising one for seven from behind the arc right now hes somebody Harvard counts on for that outside presence that threepoint shooting specialist h on the drive he got it and the foul well see if this becomes one of those where Quinton post tries to just take over offensively he has 10 well Boston College goes to their big man when they need him the most and post just on a little Drive able to lay it in heres that play again by Mack he faked inside steep back off balance jumper from about 19 ft and again that quick release and that confidence that he has got the free throw so 11 points for Quinton post post apparently was cut when he had to go to the bench in the first half and receive a little bit of attention you can see it right over the eyebrow not quite sure when that happened but it doesnt seem any the worse for where so Eagles answer back with six in a row after Harvard scored the first eight points of this second half so 4339 crimson and a foul against mlon and that is four fouls on Devin mlon and three of them in the first 3 minutes and 45 seconds of this second half Earl Grant has to go to the bench a glockton will for a while now as well and thats a key piece of that Boston College lineup to have sitting there for 10 or so minutes well see how long coach Grant takes him out could be longer Eagles will go a little bit smaller here with mlon out Donald Han coming into the game heres aabo and he takes advantage of the matchup but missed at The Rim its a pretty good look there with the size advantage against the league Bay Zachary slips in Zachary kicks to the corner Harris for three thats too strong but a leag bay follows it up leak Bay able just to use that long shot as a pass or as good as one and here come the Eagles as the pendulum once again Eric is swung in the other direction like nothing ever happened an 80 run to start the half for Harvard an 80 run for BC thats thrown away Donald H picks it up and the Eagles out on the run Harris step back free ball got it its an 11 nothing run it matches Harriss BC high with 12 what a response and a foul underneath goes against a leag bay well quite the beginning to half number Applause well what a turnaround and again a short window there for Boston College and a good find by League Bay yeah League Bay turning nothing into something there and then Here Comes claudell Harris hitting the big three that gave the Boston College Eagles the lead back they were two of 11 Eric from threepoint range in the first half already two of three in the second wow AO was up in the air for a long while couldnt find possession tries to go back up and post affects him at The Rim Applause post on the drive and a whistle comes well see if that pass that foul came before the shot as Quinton post on the drive second foul goes against Chandler P see the Brain Trust for Boston College talking things over 12 points now for Quint post two free throws extends it to a 13 nothing Boston College run so Harvards had a 13 nothing run in this game BCs had a 13 nothing run in this game okay whats next I Music am has just been swings both ways agbo nice footwork and its eight points for justice aabo the ongoing battle down low between post and ajabo continuing in a nice reverse pivot move by the Harvard big man to stem the tie foul goes against Boston College an offensive foul on the screen Applause that is already the fifth foul by the way on PC in this second half so thats worth noting as we get closer to the end here fou goes on Prince alue Applause Bay heres Mack on the drive thats blocked so two blocks on the last three possessions for Quint post tough match up there for Maas post is stepped right up and the hole closed toward the basket bachir oh boy rejected by aimo ajabo having a good bounceback game after being held scoreless last night in ammer eight points five rebounds already and he just comes from about 6 feet away to block that one a double team Harvard already nine blocks so far this game they have done a great job disrupting Boston College his offense post got the three that time they pop post out what a luxury to have such an athletic versatile big man where you can do that and know he can knock down a threepointer some degree of regularity oara inside on the drive chisam Oar has had a nice night 13 points answers the post three 4947 the lead for Boston College heres po slipping inside finds a league Bay his three ball thats too strong post good read on the rebound Zacharys got a chance finds Donald hand on the drive kicks out Harris passes the three his long two is good some of the best ball movement weve seen all night long from Boston College they worked it around made an extra pass or two and found the best shot and Zachary able to hit that the best yeah this is the best weve seen claudell Harris play so far you know hes a scorer when he averages 17 and2 points a game the Big South last year as the timeout comes here from Tommy Emer but Harris really doing a good job tonight hes up to 14 points in the game a twopoint Boston College lead the Eagles starting to move the ball around on the offensive end finding MJ for the Music Triple Music lets take a look at the two leading scorers in this game Quinton post for Boston College and chokara for Harvard both have been really good and kind of stat stuffer games for both of them post well on his way to yet another another double doubled and oaris had a good game from Beyond The Arc as well two of three from threepoint range he was only one of Six coming into todays game Elijah strong is in there for the first time for Boston College and Harvard with good pressure creates the turnover off the inbounds out of the timeout Harvard amped up the pressure came right at Boston College full out press Eagles werent quite ready for Applause Music Applause Music it there is closing in on Applause Wii ax trying to get away find zakara right at the end of the timer is Off the Mark that ball sat loose underneath batist is blocked by Applause post and then a TA ball will give possession to Harvard we had a lot happened in that sequence thank you part Boston College nice block there by post and then the loose ball ensued Zachary trying to use his leg like a pool cushion or something the jump ball ends up ensuing that was all after a shot that barely nicked the front of the rim 12 to go in the second half post on the drive against stara Quinton all the way to the bucket look take oh post realized it was not aabo out there was akara thats a little more of a side Advantage for post and he took advantage woic nice find to batist thought about falling away against strong instead gets it to Applause Mack Harvards worked the shot clock a little bit deeper here the last few possessions woic pull up from the elbow just scraped the rim and is out of bounds with 1125 to go in the second half qu post up to 18 points tonight and his team leads by Applause four greatness is a field half which has been I mean even though weve had these runs with some missed shots its been a pretty good offensive game of basketball so far Eagles heard 50 7 of 14 in the second half Harvard 6 of 14 MJ Harris has been a big reason why post has as well tough angle shot not there bounces around a couple of times before it comes down to b Applause m Lo par on the drive against post slipped inside and he got it oh my what an effort from cheesum Aura well theres a high degree of difficulty on on this one Eric he drives in maybe traveled threw it up and it happened to go in like there might have been an extra step in there sometimes you need a little bit of luck I mean I know theres Euro steps and then theres Euro steps but at any rate Harvard comes up with a big basket right out of the timeout its a wet spot on the floor there cleaning off before for OAR who is a came in as a 63 free throw shooter its one for one so far today Crimson just five out of six from the foul line Boston College only six of eight so neither team getting to the line all that much good contingent of Boston college students here in this late afternoon early evening game Eric including some minions behind us thats right were happy the minions and grew are here here hakara makes the free throw they got our backs literally tonight that is exactly true Zachary on the drive stops turn around jumper off the Mark Strong comes in for the rebound and his fell so how about elij just who did not play the last two games The Freshman from Charlotte North Carolina getting some really crucial minutes here with mton out with four fouls crash the boards ball happened to go right between two Crimson Defenders strong gets himself to the foul line you know there opportunities like this which usually helped earn more playing time strong getting his shot and hits the first first career point for Elijah strong who really bet on himself coming out of high school Myers Park High School in North Carolina he was originally decommitted after a coach left wford where he was originally committed decided to reopen things and ends up at Boston College Eagles coaches were in the house when they saw him win the most outstanding player of the North Carolina state championship Applause game 5452 Boston College the Eagles though its been close in this second half have held the lead most of the way since that 13 nothing run answering Harvards 8 nothing run to begin the half post backing down aabo comes back right hand post no strong got a piece in the rebound Finds Its way to post again and Zary for three is no good strong again really working hard inside can only get a piece that time trying to do those little things that earn more playing time rebound defend well the offense the rest of it will come if you start to do those things when you do get the play hakara yes went high off the window new season High 20 points for chesa Makara and were tied at 54 with 933 to go in the second half aara showing off some physical ability some toughness fighting that double team getting the shot up over post adson comes around three ball too strong strong got an offensive rebound he was too strong on the Finish but post there on a second effort strong all over the place here couple of minutes hes been out there crashing the boards and post came in to help out its another double double for post his third of the Year seventh of his career Mack got stripped got it back tend to shoot for Harvard PJ on the drive in the post nowhere to go post does such a good job and I think I mentioned this earlier his natural length disrupting shots and not folling being able to stay out there quite a bit post inside on the drive is stripped out of bounds it stays here no foul called just clean out of bounds against Harvard well we were talking about post in his defense comes right up see keeps his hands up stays on his tippy toes so that hes not going to get called for a foul it wasnt even tempted to bring the arm down and try to swat the ball away he puts his arms up he probably close to about 8 and 1 half or 9 ft tall and he does a great job using that to his Advantage very smart player in that Applause regard the most improved player in the ACC last year the re ball quit post short you know hes managed to put up the points hes put up today 20 points despite one of four from behind the yard Mack was fouled down at the other end on the rebounding action and that is now the seventh foul against Boston College so Harvard will shoot the rest of the way with 832 to go Harvard was a 71 foul shooting team coming into this game six of seven did a good job in that win against Hass last night Earl Grant gets up to speak to the folks on his bench and the first free throw is good from ma who has been good from the foul line its now five of six from the line today Tommy Amer really has just used an eightman rotation for the last or second game in a row has not gone deep down his bench at all but he it seems like hes really settled into the eight people he trusts at this point this is what hes going to run with overtime last night at the Mullen Center and in a tie game late today and PTI Forum quite a daily double for Harvard to beat UMass and PC and backto back nights and they beat nor Eastern remember on Tuesday okay a tri Crimson trying to win the bean pop plus chance for Three Corner Pocket strong no Elijah strong getting a lot of run here in this second half mton on the bench with the four fouls Grant had to go a little deeper inside aabo double team is there nearly lost the handle and the pass ends up getting stripped in Zachary has it mson out front and a good find from Jaden Zachary good job by the eagles attacking the basket off the turnover able to beat Harvard down the court and first points of the game for Mason menson running the floor fourth assist for Jaden Zachary Eagles lead is once again two hakara somehow kept his footing found lesmond Zachary a Ken creates a takeaway itll stay here with 724 to go in the second good find by Zachary and the Eagles have the lead back this time of year theres one workshop on everything he can to keep Harvard in this game 20 points and hes done a wonderful job of driving to the basket just like that good heart takes he can take a little bit of contact as well heres another one where he took on post maybe got away with a little extra step in there and found a little Good Fortune putting it up but 20 points8 out of 14 shooting and hes had a fine game considering that back he has 15 points and thats a good night for most people that well below his average it does does feel like the Eagles have done a decent job of holding ma in check it just speaks to the level of player hes been as a first year got a chance now gave it off with post there AO at the end of the timer no good and post finds the rebound Quinton post 20 points and thats now 15 rebounds and once again back to work on the offensive Edge as Kellys in there for Boston College his jump through short Lou lesan the rebound Eagles have now missed P of their last 12 shots and Harvard hasnt scored in about 3 minutes this is kind of the first time both teams as post comes in and blocks a shot what a day hes had defending the basket a bunch of blocks mixed in as well for Quinton post officially credited with four of them now Kelly on the drive sliped all the way through Kelly able just to get right down the lane able to hit the basket there and its a four point lead you just keep waiting to see with the next pendulum shift is that going to become the knockout punch anyway the point I was going to say before as weve had a lot of one team going on a drought not really both at the same time heres Mack gets through underneath Harris Mas jump for no but gets the rebound andler PJ works it inside akara falling away thats off The Mark aabo with the rebound he goes up and Miss still bouncing around and its out for Mack 13 to shoot Mack is open triple good Malik Mack Bullseye from Beyond The Ark and Harvard snaps a one for eight drought from the floor and brings it back to a onepoint game I think I counted three offensive rebounds in that situation theres the first one off the back rim post just couldnt get to it so aabo forced up a tough shot ball gets batted around again Ajo kicks it out now and Mack thats a good shot for him and then heres Chaz Kelly right before that the drive right around his man very smooth to the basket oh its so important in nonconference play to get these opportunities to compete in a close game late Harvard had their first last night getting the victory at UMass at overtime Boston College has been in a couple of Grinders here two in a row on the road at the Citadel home for Richmond and now once again and maybe the tightest of them all against Harvard 545 to go in the second Harvard off to a 40 start for the first time since 2013 Boston College trying to move to 40 for the first time since 2007 with a win tonight out of the timeout Tommy Emer says his defense drop back sometimes youll see a press and now a bit of a Zone look from from the Crimson first time weve seen this all day from Harvard inside for a league Bay comes through a league Bay tough take no AO once again was the man of the middle making life difficult for a league Bay I figured Harvard might have a change up in there after they called the timeout off the M basket go to his Zone look they didnt do it last night against UMass at all trying to throw something different at the Eagles right now Zachary T to shoot Corner three Chaz Kelly that was off and Ajo with the Applause rebound ninth rebound for justice aabo Cycles around Chandler P aabo against post got rid of it oara no rebound still loose it rolls around and Zachary finds it arver having trouble finishing around the basket the last couple of minutes and then Kelly got tripped up important minutes here for Chaz Kelly with 442 to go in the second Kelly came into this game averaging about 7 and 12 minutes per contest spells Harris a little bit Harris will come back in for Kelly right now after the foul there on oara which is his third some frustration from him on the bump coach Grant having to go to to Kelly and a few others today strong another one to follow trouble with mlon and just the nature of this game trying to find combinations that work back cut Madson what a pass from post great cut by and thats good decisive cut post a fine passer for a big man lesmond pull up jumper got it post was closing so lesmond with the step back and he has five back to a onepoint Applause game Harris comes around Mack his jumper is good claudell Harris from the elbow has 16 back to a threepoint lead Austin College effectively using screens and moving the ball the last two possessions back with a handoff AAL effected Again by post but its turned over to P but no one was back and Madson finds it a fast ball to Harris three B is a little short but post follows it up and missed oh my got the offensive rebound though and now a little reset here oh its quite a sequence Eric wow Zachary comes around four to shoot for BC Jaden got striped but fouled Zachary going to the line when we come back the 304 to go in the ball game and BC holding on to a threepoint Music lead Dad were going to be late then kind of just things go a little nuts there for a minute well the problem Harvard had there was the pass was a little short and it was nearly into the back court in that sequence and then hit a Miss threepointer but theres post unable to tip it in and eventually we end up with Zachary at the foul line and sort of in 10 or 15 seconds an example of how this game has gone swinging wildly back and forth this is such a great example of a Jaden Zachary game he came to play offensively in the first half on BC needed him those two free throws were her first two points of the second down but you look at what hes done defensively against Malik Mack holding him down as much as possible butti for three that fall BS off rebound down to a league b Zachary and post both have been out there more than 30 minutes theyve tried to work the two person twoman combination youre right Zachary very fine lock down Defender and harbard here is Harris first for three and then a whistle and a foul on the floor with post going for the rebound got the size advantage and he draws the foul he got inside twoo and thats why he had the advantage of the foul shot goes up its no good and look right there hes got that inside advantage and thats what officials look for zakar is behind him reaching over him the Eagles not quite yet in the bonus this is just 16 Music Applause fouls comes around to Zachary hes going to let some time come off post withh a siiz chance here against the first year Madson with seven to shoot Mason drives inside bounce pass got deflected manages to find Harris follow a three its good 19 points for Claude L Harris Mack on the drive on the other end big pass out to lesmond three ball good a huge answer from Lou lesmond that may be the biggest shot of the game to this point for Harvard it felt like this game was teetering on the break an eightpoint lead for Boston College and lesmond hits that ball hits that three from the right side able to bring the Crimson right back into this Harvard was just one of six from behind The Arc in the second half heres post finds Mason Madson on the drive slips inside pull up jumper no rebound it was a league Bay who steps on the timeline going for it possession back the other way with 90 seconds left well there big three by Zachary not the best of passes uses the dribble to find some space knocks that one down about how that how about this difficult pass and lesmond when he gets his feet set he gets that pass he can catch and shoot as quick as anybody in the ivy league Tommy Amer told us this week if lesmond could be healthy after missing most of last year he has a real chance to be an X Factor there was a drive by akara couldnt finish finish Harvard went quick on that sequence after theyve been forced to take a little bit more time as the second half went on and the Eagles are on possession 110 remaining a 6964 lead nadson that hit off of a league Bas still found mton and were inside a minute to go five to shoot for BC Zachary drives right hand got it 16 for Jaden mat quickly down the other end bobbled and never quite had the look Harvard was looking for a foul but I think he just lost the handle on that and its out of bounds to BC with 45 seconds left finger roll layup right there by Zachary whos feels like between he and post they put the Eagles right on their backs now was the play Tommy Amer was looking for a foul out yeah subsequently maybe there was contact at the leg but Ma in the process just looked like he was kind of bobbling the ball and then forced to commit the Applause foul Eagles hit their foul shots they stand pretty good chance of putting this one away at this point of the game and nine of 12 for the game from the charity stripe and as we mentioned earlier almost 82 for the season as Boston College continues to playing close games like this hitting those foul shots are critical Tommy Amer ought to be very proud to this point of what his team has done coming off an overtime win two hours away last night short rotation theyve come in here and they have really battled hard against foston College oh Jaden Zachary has stepped up big here late Applause 12 first half points just five here in the second but theyve all come in this last 2 minutes and maybe the layup that seals it and perhaps the free throws that ice it 18 points for Zachary Harvards got to go quick here obviously find the best shot just go for it Eagles good pressure defense here without fouling ma trying to find something Chandler PJ skip pass off Prince the league base secures it and lesmond commits the valve oh give Boston College a lot of credit too they have done a nice job since that under four media timeout to take this game over and PJ just floated that pass to the corner in a league Bay much too quick to have that one go right over him as he NAB that hits to the foul line DC fans here should be feeling pretty good remember this first beginning of the second half Harvard scored the first eight points of half number two lesmond three ball late off the mark But glockton finds the rebound and that will just about do it a league Bay is spoted Applause probably could have just dribbled out the clock at that point but sure looks like his teammates hes feeling good wanted to put a exclamation point on this Victory well BC outscores Harvard 4021 after the 80 start Mack cant finish in the end and Boston College has a 9point win and their first 4 and0 start since 2007 say
