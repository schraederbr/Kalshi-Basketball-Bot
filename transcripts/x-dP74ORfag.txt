hes one that can shoot the ball from the threepoint line but really doing a lot of damage inside as well Virginia comes in 8 and six theyre one and two in the ACC and Cal got off to a six And1 start and then they had an 18point lead at Missouri and have not recovered since blowing that lead theyve lost six out of the last seven trying to get it going again and its three to get it started for Javon blackshire Jr yeah thats a great start for Cal what theyre going to do if they can make a couple threes early it can really start loosening up some other options as Applause well Virginia coming off a tough loss to Louisville at home this past Saturday Virginia the team has been here since Sunday theyve been in the Bay Area as they play Stanford on Saturday as it rolls in for the Freshman from Seattle Jacob Kofi on the first possession Virginia was really physical with sakovich doing it again hes going to to be strong with his Cuts really be strong with the basketball here is out top is tane Murray the the Kiwi the product New Zealand has the assignment of watching St yakovich shot clock winding down on Cal M Soko turn around on the Baseline the rebound Elijah Saunders for Virginia I like that theyre getting the ball inside trying to have diversity of their game right now Virginia is awfully physical so getting the ball in early like that will be important and Kofi rattles it in and Virginia takes the lead the start for him the Golden Bears their AES heel at this point has been their defense and first coming possession hasnt changed theyve struggled recently defensively and the numbers have not been pretty as Gus petritis the offensive rebound M Soko missed Point Blank Range and then a whistle and its high up and it belongs to Virginia the offensive rebounds right there Ron Sanchez he talked to him earlier today he talked about the physicality of cow and the ability to rebound the basketball they end up getting possession right now after an offensive board big strong physical cow team Virginia thats going to match that every way on the defensive end and the tempo is for Virginia will want to control it here tonight leading score for the Cavaliers Isaac Applause mcne Elijah Saunders cut to the basket and Saunders missed inside and Reus petritis saves it for Cal here come the Golden Bears DJ Campbell missing a transition three the long rebound Tracked Down by Isaac mcney for Virginia I anticipate Cal really trying to get out on Long rebounds and steals trying to push Tempo Virginia is really really good in the half court defensively so anytime Cal can break them down transition offensive rebounds things like that I think were going to see that rattles out for the Freshman Jacob Kofi was last years Washington Gatorade Player of the Year Javon blackshire the Miss in the rebound Andrew roie for Virginia after to hit in their first shot callus missed their last five and a defense for Virginia thats one of the tops in the country 11th in the country in fewest points allowed and 44th in defensive field goal percentage and the leaner Andrew roie makes it 63 Virginia great job getting to the paint were going to a theme were going to talk about tonight is Virginias off ball screening they do a great job making plays for each other and one of the ways they make plays for each other is setting screens for each other a lot of good stot screens right there they get the ball to six feet those are good Applause shots Joon black Shir the pull up three and Elijah Saunders the rebound for the Cavaliers theyre limiting Cal to one shot and Applause out ball movement Isaac mcne fre nine straight for Virginia well he is lethal from long distance almost 45 from the threepoint line those are good shots Cal cannot get in the routine of just shooting threepoint shots without finding ways of getting the ball to the paint they have to get to the interior of the defense but theres a reason why Virginia is one of the best in the country they know try how to keep it outre St yakovich the up and under that one spins out and the rebound Elijah Saunders for Applause Virginia kanane Murray out of the double team broken up by DJ Campbell and it belongs to Virginia but the Cavaliers getting it going early 9 to interim head coach and guiding this Virginia team and what did you make of that news Jared when Tony Bennett decided to step down and step away from coaching well his press conference was was legendary you know to be honest a lot of people watched it and rewatched it and he was saying the things that a lot of people uh are thinking and a foul going for the alleyoop to Blake Buchanan and its on Lee Dort of Cal you know hes hes honestly just selfaware he he knows the game has changed a ton uh things have changed with the U the portal things have changed with nil uh and he didnt feel like he was equipped and he didnt think he was doing whats right for him or the or the program and handed it off to coach Sanchez who was just a fantastic person and also a fantastic coach uh the culture that has been built at Virginia will carry on right now and uh hes going to do a heck of a job there Ron Sanchez for 10 years he worked with Tony Bennett he was with him not just at Virginia but also at Washington State when Tony Bennett took over for his dad and elevated that program well you talk about Tony Bennett the kind of person he is when Ron Sanchez the head coach and chooses to come back to work with him really says a lot and after Cal jumped out to a 3 nothing lead has been all Virginia and the Cavaliers after Blake Buchanan hit a couple of free throws the sophomore from cordelane Idaho and here he is attacking the basket and the jump hook rattles out for Buchanan Lee Dort the Vanderbilt transfer the rebound for cal cal has been scoreless for over 5 minutes now and since they hit their first shot they have not tallied another field goal and theres a shot clock issue and thats why they have stopped play as Jenna Renault working with Greg Nixon Earl Walton are officiating through the clock the game clock as well as the shot clock were frozen and thats why theyve stopped play to try to get it synced up at the table across the way from us but 113 Virginia with the lead and for Cal look they have to deal with the travel its going to be an issue ongoing All Season J when theyre playing in the ACC but they travel able to not only make the point of timeout but to reinforce uh what was said the timeout and see after the the run here by Virginia and they kind of write the sh what do you what do you think they need to do offensively you have to find ways to get inside I mean it sure would help to make a couple threes thats thats a cure everything thats why youre sitting next to me because he just shot a three exactly exactly Jeremiah Wilkinson the outstanding freshman averaging 12 and 1 half points a game and that ends the 11 nothing Virginia run well all year hes been such a spark plug off the bench and so its not a surprise for him to hit one uh really a big shot in the arm he is the top scorer among freshman in college basketball that have not start of the game this year as a three spins out and a foul going for the rebound on this three right here really good screen pretty deep right there about an NBA threepoint shot and again instant offense coming off the bench for a head coach thats an nice feeling Wilkinson has been in double digits nine of the last 10 games for Cal after none of the first four and hes averaging 16 and a half a game over the last 10 now we saw the screen right there by Dort and I think to be able to get to the interior of this defense there needs to be more really hard tough screens to be able to get to the interior the runner by DJ Campell the native of Hampton Virginia well they both look theres a comfort level the last couple possessions they didnt have the first four minutes Applause a quick little spurt by Cal to cut Virginias lead to three Andrew roie missing on the Baseline and the loose ball Lee Dort on the floor secures it for Applause Cal on the perimeter I think there might be a quickness advantage to Cal but a size Advantage for Virginia so its going to be interesting to see which of those can kind of win out here is to yakovich doubled Elijah Wilkinson steps into a three fouled on a three by Day Day ases and three shots for Wilkinson and I swear Jared its almost like an epidemic fouling on threepoint Shooters this year has been an alltime high across the country and so many of them its not always fouling the arm or fouling the upper body a lot of time its its getting into their space the threepoint shooter has to have a space to land from where they took off and so you run into them maybe got him there but then on the land you know the the shooter has to have the ability to come down a lot of the things you mentioned throughout the year thats what Ive seen is people challenging aggressively through their body I had a game recently four times in that game a threepoint shooter was fouled and thats got to drive coaches NS oh drives coaches absolutely crazy cuz it is a theme thats talked about you want to challenge up high make sure you land to the side of the shooter and then you get back in and box out but Virginias defense has been so good so far which we expect you really dont want to put somebody on the line give three points that they dont really have to earn as much so an eight nothing run for Cal after Virginia on an 11 nothing run and were noted at 11 TJ power the transfer from duke checks in for Virginia and an illegal screen offensive foul Jacob Kofi of Virginia teams have been very very physical with their screening holding Cutters a little bit and thats going to be the first one weve seen where its called um if the officials decide to call it tight I think the whole game will have a little bit different e and flow to it pull up jumper and Jeremiah Wilkinson on a heater right now hes got eight and its a 10 nothing run for Cal the whole flection but game changed when he came in the confidence of the Golden Bears everything really changed obviously with his shots going in now hes caught with his hand in the cookie jar got a little excited got a little excited first fou and Wilkinson 1311 Cal on a 10 nothing run up a deuce six to the last seven they were up 18 in a game at Missouri and kind of fell apart in the second second half Missouri played great they shot 85 for the floor in the second half of that game came back and won it and C is still trying to I think recover from that and Jared you know with teams it can be tough and mentally fragile trying to respond after losing such a big lead and in a tough game and they played great in that game at Missouri well momentum happens within a game you know the start of this game you the first time out Virginias on a run now we have a momentum shifting back towards C its the same thing in a season you one game uh one shot can really tilt things and keep things going for a while so this game right here for both teams I think can be used as an opportunity to maybe get some positive Mojo going and Virginia at eight and six four of their six losses have come to teams that are in the top 25 nice cut to the basket but Andre sto yakovich blocks the shot of Isaac mcne Javon blacker darts up the floor Jeremiah Wilkinson missing the three Jacob Kofi rebounds for Virginia you know stovic we talked about he is a scorer hes a shooter but thats a big time block right there hes a great hes doing a nice job passing the basketball but thats a highflying block shot thats a complete player hes averaging over one block shot a game as Kofi goes inside and there is Andre St yakovich clearing the rebound three on four will slow it up Kofi really got in good position right there and just needed to gather himself just a Split Second more that would have turned into an easy deuce on the drive and jovon blackshire when crashing into the St Here Comes Virginia back the other way Kanan Murray spots up free Virginias not known as a fast playing team when black share fell down didnt get back into play in time take advantage of it opportunistic really good shot by Murray smart transition offense thereis points for Murray the senior from Auckland New Zealand Spencer Mahoney in the game for Cal here is Andre St yakovich on the drive left it short and here comes Virginia they have numbers coming back the other way Jacob Kofi cant handle the pass running the floor and a turnover by the Cavaliers those last two drives by Cal I think theres going to be a lot of people saying well thats a foul you have cow players falling to the ground Virginia is so good at sliding their feet but more importantly showing their hands and if you show your hands officials do not want to call it so C needs to do one of two things get a little bit more on balance or else just be stronger with the basketball uh because Virginia I guarantee you theyre not going to theyre not going to make it easy on you know Tony Bennett defenses what makes them so tough to play against well inside the threepoint line it is just its hard to move its hard to cut um the rotations uh are all buttoned up its simple and they just coach the fundamental so good thats I mean that right there is a prime example Cal gets the multiple sides are not get able to get to the inside of the uh threepoint line and as they put it on the ground watch those hands hands are out maybe a little bit of sales job right there but you move your feet keep your hands out youre going to get the benefit from the officials a lot of the time and the second foul in Wilkinson leads Cal with eight points Applause inside 10 to shoot Blake Buchanan and the rebound B Soko for Cal you know one of the things you saw right there shot goes up all five guys are getting back on defense and thats one of the Hallmarks of the Virginia Defense is theyre going to be back in transition theyre going to set up their five on five Applause defense shot clock inside 10 here is Wilkinson trying to create and the Freshman from his wallet and the kick out jobon black here missing a three and the rebound tracked out by kanane Murray for Virginia yeah that was going to be a highlight assist right there if that shot would have gone in that would that had the guys at Sports Center in the SC top 10 waiting to clip that Applause one and a three from the wing and the stroke for isan Sharma The Freshman from Milton Ontario Canada and Virginia up by Applause four one thing you see with Virginia a lot of their baskets are assisted uh theyre setting screens theyre sharing the basketball another assisted basket right there out of the double Applause team Joon blackshire up a and blackshire has it go in and out and the rebound batted around and Josh Ro Ola Joseph a firstes 20 for Applause Cal keeping the ball out of the paint weve talked about it you saw the double team in the post right there it makes it really hard to get to the paint Moko and one love it get to the paint offensive rebounds they have to find a way to get that ball great Drive they didnt make the shot which is okay get the ball up on the rim sooko is extremely aggressive us his wide body gathers himself strong finish this in the goodye cotton bow classic surprising that a lot of the top seeds are out it is I think theres uh you know its a little bit different you get you to seeing the basketball bracket and theres four one seeds four tws four threes uh you know in the football playoff with only 12 teams its really theyre all top three seeds if you equate it to the basketball side of things onepoint lead for Virginia Cavaliers holding cow to just 25 for the floor Virginia three of six from three for both teams scoring has been difficult an offensive rebound Blake Buchanan pulls it out for the Cavaliers Kanan Murray and he crashes into Joshua Ola Joseph and the charge called against Virginia a rare charge in college basketball excellent call see Kane Murray going down the lane right here you have to have your feet set early before the offensive move player goes into his offensive movement and well outside the restricted area no question love the idea of giving up the body for the team see if they can take that momentum to the offensive end Joshua ol Jo getting inside and good defense by TJ power and slowing it up for Virginia is tane Applause Murray shot clock down to 10 off a screen Andrew roie missing a three and DJ Campbell the rebound here com comes Applause Cal trying to get in transition smart re is petritis the Flo in C takes the lead it is hard seding when youre playing against the Virginia set defense for 40 minutes weve seen offensive rebounds to their benefit weve now seen transition them using that to their benefit are there things you can do to try to speed them up and get them out of their Tempo its really hard Virginia has done this for so long theyre so good at controlling tempo know Cal is a fast playing Team high scoring team Cal averages 81 possessions a game to Virginia 67 a foul and Blake Canon to the line and I think most of the time uh Virginia is going to be the norm that that the possessions are going to go down towards 67 as opposed to up to 81 two shots for Blake Buchanan cordelan Idaho former Mr basketball and Gatorade Player of the Year in Idaho and hes three for three from the line despite coming in it tonight at 46 from the stri and hes a guy that we were talking to Ron Sanchez earlier hes talking about Buchanan saying this kid starting to really come on and figure it out has great length I think going to give him some really good minutes and the rebounding piece for them will be huge Applause and hes now four for four from the line in Virginia goes up one and the Freshman Jacob Kofi returns for Blake Buchanan Buchanan being a West Coast guy Elijah Saunders and Kofi have a lot of friends and family here its not often that they get out to the West Coast as Kofi just picked up his second foul yeah the West Coast uh players in the CC they love coming West let family see them they had a lot of friends and family stopped by the hotel this morning Virginia is generally very very good at not fouling they got a little bit aggressive right there um kind of a silly foul one you dont normally see from Virginia they commit the 13th fewest fouls per game in the country at under 14 total and the discipline is just off the charts because when you watch them youre also going to say this is a very very physical team so when youre physical and not fouling you know thats thats why its so hard to get the ball inside great discipline great coaching Reus petritis beats the shot clock couple in a row for him he may be the next spark for Cal right now hes hes known as the energy guy now if he can do it offensively now hell be a spark on both ends of the floor to the basket Andrew roie and its challenged by Monty Soko rips down the rebound and thats what his presence provides inside for Cal no Applause question this was a little bit of a secondary break right now but it wasnt against the set defense that has to be their recipe right now makes misses whatever try and get a little bit Up Tempo try and score before the defensive set really nice playmaking by Andre stovich Third three for Cal as DJ Campbell with five and the khed is four fade away in the Baseline rles out but the put back inside Blake Buchanan hes making his presence felt especially on the offensive boards hes got six after being scoreless in two of Virginias last three games and a foul thats on Andrew Roy and that puts Cal into the bonus free throws coming up for Andre St yakovich tight one late in the first half so the new ACC map as this was the 2023 version of the ACC with all those teams right there over in the Eastern side of the country welcome aboard SMU in the two Bay Area Schools K and Stanford to round out the 18 teams in the 2024 edition of the Atlantic Coast Conference that map makes you feel a little lonely over here oh Im used to feeling lonely believe me yes the first time I saw that logo on this floor I had to kind of stare at it for a few minutes going Is that Applause real first point for Andre St yakovich by the way yeah something that doesnt happen often getting into the bonus in the first half M so theres four minutes left can Cal continue to get to the free throw line and draw fouls be aggressive now is the time for Cal to really be aggressive offensively Cs match their largest lead and St oich sixth in the country in scoring at 199 a game and now with his first two points Virginia paying a lot of attention to him Cal has the ball and a foul off the ball on Cal and its on DJ Campbell mcne is drawing the same kind of attention that Andre stovic draws you know they understand what kind of shooter is theyre staying attached to those screens fighting through they draw the foul there but I dont think youre going to see any change in the game plan the adjustment at needs to make Jared he was a guy that was a little bit down the list as far as the skym report goes last year when he played for you and was somewhat have been unknown coming into this year in terms of production as Elijah Saunders with his first points of the night varries a three but the adjustment he has to make to being that number one guy when an opponent goes over a scy report how challenging is that well it is challenging that he has been Stellar I mean hes top 16 in the country in scoring and leading the the team in so many stats obviously tonight uh the scoring hasnt been there in the first half but it is a big adjustment but he has a demeanor for it hes very even Keel very steady and I think being a big time scorer like that I think thats an important mental aspect tough shot Christian Tucker the transfer from UTSA with the shot clock expiring love it forcing the ball downhill to the basket and driving in the layup Andrew roie for Virginia Applause Cs late on the rotation right there theres got to be some weak side help coming and that has been an issue for them the last few games the rotations defensively yeah talk to coach madon thats one thing he talked about is trying to stay out of rotations so how do you do that you know be a little bit better at guarding the basketball oneonone you know how youre going to youre going to do things with ball screams you got to be careful so theyre trying to stay Applause out theres Andre getting beat and they a great job seiling in the post right there so the weak side cant come over but it really does come down how do you stay out of rotations you sit down you guard the basketball and depending on who youre guarding maybe creating a little bit more space backing up a little bit um you know being physical on the ball may be a tough way to go about Applause it Virginia looking for their first true Road win this year theyre one and six away from Charlottesville that only win was a neutral sight win against Villanova and a game in Baltimore is a foul inside that will get Elijah Saunders to the line its on Joshua Ola Joseph you know one stat that I think is going to be really important for this game Virginia in their losses theyve turned the basketball over about 15 times a game in their wins its about nine turnovers a game and right now theyre at three so if they continue to Value the basketball thats a good sign for them and the other thing that does it keeps Cal out of transition one more for Elijah Saunders Taha Power number two South Carolina highlight our next ESPN 2 featured womens basketball matchup as South Carolina hosting Texas AM Thursday 5 Eastern on ESPN 2 number two South Carolina and Texas a out 2827 Virginia and Saunders after being held scoreless for the majority of this half now with five quick points Applause boy they being physical with stovic right now now they cleared out for him and the offensive rebound of the glass Joshua Ola Joseph fouled on a putback thats six offensive rebounds for Cal and thats we talked about it thats one of the focuses for Virginia trying to keep a long athletic aggressive uh team off the offensive boards heres kovic again hes creating not just one person defending him but a second person to miss shot and old Joseph hes had multiple took a charge on the other end his effort plays really are spark right now missed the game last Wednesday at Pittsburgh was dealing with an illness and then came back and didnt play great was still lingering with the effects of the illness in their loss to Clemson on Saturday and now Joshua Ola Joseph who started a lot of games this year for Cal coming off the bench in this one and one more for Ola Joseph A 74 foul shooter played a couple of years in Minnesota transferring here to Cal started 43 games over the two years for the Golden Gophers and Spins out in the rebound Elijah saers lost it out of bounds and will stay at this end in a cow ball take advantage of those situations now I continue to think that theyre going to be extremely aggressive on the offensive boards theyve already had success with seven offensive rebounds this is just unfortunate it was a pretty good box out get a little bit sloppy a little bit lazy it can happen at midnight East Coast time thats what youre tributing it to nice pass to yovich to Lee Dort for the slam Applause so yovic is again its his points arent up toh what he normally does but his assists have been there block shots really playing a complete game right now and a foul on Joshua Ola Joseph his second josua and its team foul number seven and the bonus for Virginia sto yakovich not only drawing one person draws a second Defender leaves a pass wide open at the rim for the dunk its a one and one for Elijah Saunders played two years at San Diego States and its interesting how a hand ended up at Virginia is when he went into the portal he wasnt really considering Virginia and then he had a phone call with Ron Sanchez who at the time was an assistant for Tony Bennett and they really connected and thats what sold him on Virginia was the place for me I I love that story and I you know in todays day and age a lot of times its not about the relationships into the people but I think when the decisions are made when its about development and when its about people it usually has a really good ending another assist by kovic a great step in right there Joshua Ola Joseph four threes for Cal here in the first half Elijah Saunders from deep and the rebound Tracked Down Lee Dort then stumbled but got rid of it before he fell over you know you know the last play the cool part about it scovic made a great pass he was so excited when the shot went in thats how you build culture thats how you build winning teams hes got three assists here in the first half and hes setting up his teammates when he knows Virginia is paying so much attention to him shot clock down to five St yakovich spinning in the lane tough fall away you know a lot of times you build confidence with a free throw or layup you know sakovic right now I think his assists have helped him get into the Flow game helped him build some confidence thats a tough shot right there largest lead for Cal Andrew roie on the drive using the window and thatll take us to halftime and a bucket for Virginia and Cal by three at the break hunting for his shot but looking to set up his teammates which now Virginias got to adjust to for sure and and the reality is Cal knows theres going to be nothing easy and I think theyve embraced the idea that everythings going to be a hard stream great great stream right there soich gets inside little shot fake and one what a great way to start the half but they understand theres not going to be something easy in the half court like that often and so theyre going to have to find ways to get to the free throw line get to the offensive boards see the tail end of that screen right there and then a little shot fake the Finish gets him to the free throw line Second foul ontain Murray and Cal has their largest lead here 11 seconds into the second Applause half I do think for Virginia finding a way to get mcne a couple of clean looks only three points in the first half he is such a lethal shooter they have to find ways to get him looks pass deflected by Reedus petritis jovon blackshire a step back three and a foul on the three tan Murray will send black Shir to the line for three well weve already talked about it once today and a team thats as disciplined as Virginia this has to uh Drive coach Sanchez just crazy right there and its the same thing its not its not some egregious foul up top but you cannot get into a space and when he lands he cannot step on your foot thats twice now if he makes well if he makes the next two thats five points in this game that are avoidable plays two more shots blackshire 81 from the line he had 15 points in their loss at Clemson on Saturday after hed gone 0 for 12 from the floor in the previous two games and hes vital to what Cal does as his veteran point guard who the gr transfer from Grand Canyon but he goes just one for three from the line is not happy about you mentioning his Stellar percentage right there you jinxed him oh its my fault absolutely now that youre sitting on this side of it do you really believe that oh AB absolutely oh if its me is that what youre saying I get it foul on Virginia and its on Jacob Kofi his third but a good start to the second half for Cal and Ron Sanchez not liking the start from Virginia here in the second half well against Virginia its easy to get lulled into lets play against their half court lets just keep fighting fighting you have to throw some punches and thats whats happened theyve had an aggressive play to get the ball inside they tried to score in transition they tried to get another transition basket right there and got fouled I love how theyre attacking and not just settling Reus petritis moving in petrius left it short rebound tipped out to DJ Campbell there is clearly an emphasis for Cal to get paint touches they got two or three that possession offensive rebound number two on this possession the hustle plays from Cal DJ Campbell a wild shot but then theres M Soko for Cal the regret by Soko and the gr transfer from Michigan State and Cal is up by nine well that is the key right there an offensive possession a couple offensive rebounds flying around everywhere multiple paint touches and then the Finish inside six straight for Cal to start the second half and the ball fumbled Away by Blake Buchanan who recovers Elijah Saunders and the rebound Monty Applause Soko seven rebounds for Soko tonight Andre still yakovich spinning in the lane really good theres a comfort level to the count offense right now something we didnt really see in the first half timeout Virginia as Cal an eight nothing run to start the second half Cals found a rhythm well see if Virginia has it answer first two and a half minutes Cal taking the fight to Virginia offensive rebound Soko imposing his will aggressive right there and then sakovich hes tired of me talk about his block shots rebounds and assists taking the ball in transition he is now the leading scorer in the game as well all of a sudden hes gotten into the ACT offensively and Cal at eight nothing run to start the second half 112 back to the first half and Cal has their largest lead of the game and lets see if Virginia with Ron Sanchez the interim head coach of the Cavaliers has dialed up here and the leaner and might sooko blocks the shot out of bounds to the Cavaliers 16 to shoot wow Rim protection right there great elevation timing it almost got to the top of the arc right there got it just in time foul on jumper a clean look short Isaac mcne has just three points tonight leading scorer for Virginia on the season so far this half where are the shots coming from from Cal I think they have one miss three they have four free throw attempts at least and they have three or four shots within two feet of the basket thats a recipe for winning tough fallway Reus petritis good defense from Elijah Saunders thats more indictive of the shots we saw in the first half really good defense showing their hands shooting from about 10 ft a little bit off balance nice pass and M Soko meeting Blake Buchanan at The Rim out of bounds stays with Virginia but what a block from Soko wow the Eraser backto back possessions protecting the rim wow this looked like a dunk all the way late effort big big time block third block for mty Soko who has really been controlling the paints at both ends of the floor absolutely the rebounding has been Stellar Rim protection is just such a big part of good defense and the roll Andrew Roy first points for Virginia since halftime so yakovich bringing the ball up the court right now might be a creative way to try and get him a basket set a rear screen for him DJ Campbell pass deflected a steel Virginia has a threeonone if they hurry mcney Soko another block coming over the top wow we are officially at this point sending messages I mean three in a row Virginia has to be thinking twice now taking the ball to the rim I mean the last two there was no way anybody thought he was going to be in the play up up up Applause grad transfer from Michigan State the native of Molly M Soko who was a key player for Tom ISO the last couple of years Elijah Saunders missing inside there is M Soko pulling it down and you have to wonder on that shot missed shot from three feet if the Soko effect isnt in full force right there backing his way in Andre de yakovich will shoot free throws and CS taking it two for jinia to start the second half free throws for Andre St yakovich ninepoint lead Cal searching for the first ACC win any questions how did you become the Capital One Banker thats everybody else was wondering too but you were part of a great team here at Cal you played your freshman year and a team that went to the Sweet 16 and you were a big part of that team going to the Sweet 16 beating Duke ending their three repeat attempt it was Bobby Hurleys last college game Grant was on that Duke team you had 13 points off the bench in one of the big upsets of the tournament and youre part of that 1993 group it was a heck of a heck of a group really talented group a lot of adversity throughout the year uh and a heck of a run uh getting into the NCA tournament and then obviously a magical run to get to the Sweet 16 and upsetting uh two bunch of great great guys a lot of them have had tremendous success after college professionally and in just the real world as well what do you remember about that Duke game besides you shot it just about every time you got it yeah I mean you if it felt like leather I was shooting it uh but it went well actually what I remember is Bobby Hurley went he was unbelievable I mean I I bet he had 20 points the first 10 minutes of the game uh we tried everybody on him he I think he ended up close to 40 points and so he did not go down without a a heck of a fight but he was tremendous that game and the stat line for Jason kid in that game 11 points 14 assists as isan Sharma hits his second three of the night he also had eight rebounds and four steals its uh thats why he was Jason kid he could literally do it all eightpoint Cali Jeremiah Wilkinson theres Monty Soko again powering his way back up and will get to the line Bo right now Virginia does not have an answer for the presence of M Soko well its just the entire mindset of Cal right now whatever was said at halftime by Mark Madson worked and so repeat that next half time I suppose but Soko is just so tough on the board little pump fake gets to the free throw line this is a great great way to score against this Virginia Defense at the free throw line they cant guard you and the roll home court advantage mon Soko takes advantage of it hes got six along with nine rebounds and up by n and its also I should point out its interesting because you have a connection I dont know if youre aware of the connection to Mark Matson in terms of his media guide from Stanford and he was quoted at saying who his favorite player was and it was somebody by the name of Jared H it Ill tell you what theres uh you know theres very few things that really ever got me excited uh that was pretty cool you know that uh he enjoyed watching me play and I can tell you for sure that I love absolutely loved watching him play and the reality is I mean we both loved the game we loved putting it all out there and he had a little more success than I did he was a little better dancer than I am but hey cant have it all youre giving him the edge in dancing hell yeah just ask my family its a sad sad day Applause heres Javon blackshire moving in Joshua Ola Joseph down the lane and he rattles it in and the largest lead of the night for California you know the energy is just is just catching on to everyone everybodys playing with a little bit more peping their step theyre getting downhill pretty impressive good look at a three and Isaac mcne comes up empty and Andre St yakovich the rebound maybe theyre just motivated by a former calra in the building because the pack 10 Player of the Year from 2010 Jerome randles here I was going to say exactly stay at this end and a cow ball DJ six college basketball games for you Saturday on ESPN and all starts with these two Cooper flag and number four Duke hosting Notre Dame at Cameron indor thats at noon Eastern then number three Iowa State at Texas Tech from lck great day of Hoops on ESPN coming up Saturday of course also available on the app as well you know the problem for Virginia right now is theyre not really built for quick explosive runs you know so if this lead gets much more its going to be really hard for them to you know to outscore Cal by 15 points or so in the second half and so really in a danger zone for them DJ Campbell and again cal getting inside I mean thats the difference between first half and second half first half it was just so hard to get to the interior of the Virginia Defense in the second half theyve been able to do it consistently C has out scored Virginia 165 since Applause halftime tane Murray and the rebound Joshua Ola Joseph and Cal controls so yovich is liming a little bit J Maya Wilkinson somehow scooped it up and in his first point in the second half and the Freshman has 10 eight straight for cal cal can score in so many ways thats what really makes them difficult to guard the roll and one impressive move by the red shirt freshman Anthony Robinson for virginia4 Music in the first half Cal was four of 11 with layups in the second half theyre much more efficient not only attack and rim getting closer but theyre finishing those as well Robinson a 50 foul shooter red shirt Music freshman and he gets the roll soft touch for the 1610 freshman and gets the old school threepoint play the layups have flipped you know five seven in the second half for Cal just and again its just a little bit more aggressive finish at The Rim momentum is definitely in their favor Cals been in this position before when theyve had big leads can they close out games the rebound Anthony Robinson Here Comes Virginia they blew an 18point lead at Missouri they had a 16point lead at pits when you dont mind early you dont want to you dont want to get too passive you dont want to say hey you cant shoot early in the shot clock but what you dont want to do is shoot bad shots early in the shot clock its going to be a tough shot make sure its later burn some of the Music clock five to shoot isan Sharma from deep and the long rebound Tracked Down Jeremiah Wilkinson for Cal and a foul first on isan Sharma 13point lead California and Virginia late night of the the West Music Coast Matty Soko doing his best to be the human eraser block after block after block you start with great anticipation the timing is unbelievable and then the athleticism has shocked everybody its been one after another then on the offensive end offensive rebounds four offensive rebounds nine overall he has imposed his will in a huge way and given Cal a spark to start this second half and it was sorely needed for this team is Soko the grad transfer from Michigan State part of some good teams for Tom ISO 59 starts over the last two years theyre for Michigan State graduated last spring with a degree in an environmental science and now working on his grad degree here at Cal but seven points nine rebounds three blocks and controlling the paint and a foul before the inbound and its a Virginia and that puts Cal into the bonus wow 12 minutes left from Bonus you know with Soko the other thing is it really does send a message that anytime youre driving down the paint right now its in the back of your mind that youre going to have to put a little bit more Arc a little bit more Fade Away on when youre when youre shooting the basketball but its in your mind that theres a shot blocker back there and that impacts everything one more for DJ Campbell played two years at Western Carolina hes dealing with a groin injury early this season for Cal has come back in the starting lineup and hes played well tonight for Mark Matson theres been really good balance uh for Cal on the offensive end and whats happened on there once they start uh having some efficiency on the offensive end the defensive end everybodys a little bit quicker thats a little bit too much of imposing his well third on Lee Dort for leveling Anthony Robinson and I wonder if theyre going to potentially take a look at this for a flagrant doesnt appear they will message sent and I guess you could maybe take a look at that as being excessive yeah it was a physical hard foul yeah theres probably a little little something extra there you know that it didnt get up near the head or anything like that so that thats part of the reason I think they didnt Day Day AES and the Aon pass TJ power throws it away no he has position you know its its its aggressive its aggressive maybe the I see the new Cal offensive coordinator over here Brian harson he took notice like some Blitz protection right there i like to see Lee Dort at 610 as a tight end saving it toward the basket but goes right to Virginia just the fourth Cal turnover tonight we were talking earlier Roxy about nice lob Andrew roie finding a cutting Jacob Kofi the two sport athletes with Tony Gonzalez so they may be thinking the football program may be thinking that you can have a two sport athlete here well you were telling me the story when you were playing for Kansas against Cal in the Maui Invitational when he knocked you out of bounds well Im just thankful Im here cuz I set a great screen at the elbow and I literally went literally 20 ft they picked me up out of bounds and uh it was a foul on him so I think I went to the free throw line but it was uh probably the last time you said it screen on Tony Gonzalez thats a fact thats a Music Applause fact its a great job rolling to the basket you know at the end of the day basketballs not overly complicated its a quality of your shot versus the quality of the other team shot in this half Cs quality of shot was much has been much greater than Virginias outside of that last shot we just saw and Virginia needs to get Isaac mcne going he had the ball stripped Andre St yakovich back the other way weaves his way to the bucket the high arker thats hard to teach right there thats thats instincts back the other way it spins out for Andrew roie and Lee Dort the rebound Applause and a foul will send Andre sto yakovich to the line with Cal the bonis when you were recruiting him to Stanford what did you see with his game that translated when you first saw him in high school you know his reputation was probably that he was a shooter and I always thought he was more than that hes hes an excellent at putting it on the ground and youve probably seen five times tonight where they thrown it to him or or let him back down into the post and turn him into a post player where he may shoot his face way that hes really good at or turn him into a passer as well so uh I always thought that um offensively he could do a little bit of everything and Ill mark my words right now that as time goes on people are going to talk about him as a really really good defensive player he has great length great instincts weve already seen him as a shot blocker so when you all these things Im talking about youre talking about a complete complete player of course his dad was a phenomenal shooter but it seems Andre Mor a complete player yeah I think PA would tell you he would shoot first shoot second shoot third and uh but when youre the best shooter in the gym thats a good proposition his teammates wanted him to do it his coaches wanted to do it so it was not I dont say that as a negative there is p yakovich former NBA champion longtime Sacramento King won a ring in Dallas and sitting with Zaza Puli is here tonight with him another foul in the perimeter on Virginia third on Andrew roie and were seeing some frustration now from Virginia and just the facial expressions and the body language from the Cavaliers no theres no question but I will say this as well um the frustration is there but their huddles are tight you know when coaches talking theyre looking them in the eye uh culture in the new era of college basketball is harder and harder to build and you can tell that Virginia has a really really strong culture this team has been thr a lot this year when Tony Bennett steps down in the middle of October and Ron Sanchez gets elevated and Elijah Saunders will get to the line and Ron Sanchez 5 years was the head coach Charlotte hes got experience certainly knows the Tony Bennett system having worked with Tony for 10 years so its not like theres that much of a jolt to the system in terms of the way things will operate around Virginia no and its you know when teams dont know their identity you may get a in a in losing streak or lose a couple games and you try and play really fast or you try and change your offense or you try and really revamp everything I dont think Virginia is going to do that they know who they are they know who theyre comfortable being uh and I think theyre really going to dig deep and just trying to do it better Elijah Saunders now six for six from the line approaching N9 minutes to go open look at a three Jeremiah Wilkinson comes up short and here comes Virginia and Andrew roie roie attacks roie flips it up and in as he was trying to draw contact but got the shot to go anyways 10 for roie yeah you know its its theyre still within Striking Distance they you know Virginia needs to go on a little run if theyre going to you know getting it to single digits I think would be a psychological barrier for both teams you know cal probably wouldnt be quite as good comfortable in Virginia I think give them a spark in transition here Ro again the shot fake gets the defender up in the air really good use of his body second foul in isan Sharma and St yakovich back to the line Cal now in the double bonus and thats 18 fouls on Virginia tonight keep in mind they commit less than 14 a game a in the second half I think theyve they theyve extended their defense Just a Touch trying to be a little bit more aggressive trying to create some turnovers but one of the results of that has been the increased number of Applause fouls remember when we said St yakovich wasnt scoring hes got 17 now and the lead for Cal is 15 and St yakovich hustling out the loose ball will stay at this end of Virginia ball so Im curious to see if Cal stays in the zone out of bounds under here or if they go man Virginias kind of found out a secret weapon against this zone of throwing it to the weak side Wing um looks like theyre going Cs going back man which I which I Music like Jacob Kofi and a foul on the drive its on MAR Soko his first should just sit at the rim and wait to go block a shot no reason to try and guard out to 20 fet the Kopi is a capable shooter for sure here he is backing in and the Freshman trying to create some space and Andre St yakovich pulls it down and a travel on Andre sto yakovich just the sixth Cal turnover tonight thats the right call they get a little bumping and these guys right now they understand youre get bumped and hit on every single play so got to feel that pivot foot find a way not to slide it Miss diakovic tonight 17 points three assists and a 15point lead for Cal and a clean look Isaac mcne is struggling tonight yeah and hes had a couple clean looks like that and it just they need him to knock those in especially when theyre clean looks just one for eight from the floor for mcneel Applause jovon blackshire Jr way short on a three and mon Soko saves it but here comes Applause Applause Virginia heres a three on the way and a stroke isan Sharma with three threes mark mson takes a timeout and the Cal lead is 12 with 707 to go Sharma giving Virginia spark trying to bring the Cavaliers Music back not just getting to 8 ft 10t 12T but getting to 2T 4T with the plays we saw as well as some offensive rebounds Applause Virginia led by as many as eight in the first half and then Ked a threepoint lead in the second half and it led by as many as 17 here tonight is Andre St yakovich finding a way again 19 for St yakovich yeah such a great Knack and a great feel once he got the first pass the first line of defense great body control open look at a three Jacob Kofi Nails it you just mentioned that good range really good Prospect hes going to be really good as time goes on Virginia has some some real talent you know power coming off the bench uh theyre going to be good as time goes on St yakovich had it poked away Andrew Roy racing up the floor the drop pass to the trailing Jacob Kofi doing it all doing it all transition thats that barrier we talked about 6 minutes left it breaks the 10point barrier need to look now does Cal remain aggressive and this has changed the mindset for Virginia when a team has blown big leads like Cal has does that creep in absolutely you know and and you try and fight it as much as you can but human nature is real uh this turnover right here leads to baskets thats really undefended so the past you can do everything you want you can talk about it you can learn in film session but the reality is if youve had some mistakes some some leads blown its in the back of your mind what I want to see right now is Cal continuing to attack the basket theyve had a lot of success with that and then if they can you dont want to get passive but what you dont want to do is shoot bad shots early in the shot clock one more for Andre St yakovich now nine for 10 from the line and makes the second and gives him 20 and for sakovich is eighth 20point game of the season Virginias made their last three from the floor trying to push their way back Applause in TP pull of Jumper and it falls off for TJ power and Monty Soko rebound number 10 really a good defensive possession and Im sitting here talking about offense the whole time you know if youre Cal I think the attitude and the message coming out of the the timeouts is win this thing on the defensive end get tough tough tough on the defensive end then you dont have to rely on anything offensively you do that you can rely on the offense Joshua Ola Joseph with the hammer throw Applause down Jacob Kofi getting inside hell get two free throws gold F straight line drives do not often happen against Virginia great ball movement a close out that wasnt had up I bet you cant find five possessions like that against Virginia all year where somebody takes it from the threepoint line direct line drive and finishes with a dunp but it all started because of the ball movement they got the ball inside reversed it pretty good offense Applause Music despite only six assists but are you seeing better ball movement from Cal tonight absolutely absolutely you know and theyre not a high assist team um but they do a good job from the free throw line they do a good job with offensive rebounds and transition uh but theres really a willingness to pass the basketball uh and at the end of the day like the last play may not have been an assist cuz he drove dribbled a couple times but its sharing the basketball Jeremiah Wilkinson lost it going up Elijah Saunders body Soko another block now Saunders missing from the corner DJ Campbell the rebound and a block first fou on Isaac mcne I tell you what Cal if they can hold on and finish this game should have a renewed sense of what they can be defensively partly because they have capable players but they can improve defensively from what theyve done all year but when you have a rim protector back there that can erase all of these shots it can allow you to make a mistake uh be a little bit more aggressive defensively uh they should leave this game with a lot of a lot of confidence one more for Campbell Saturday ACC Network basketball triple header Clemson hosting Florida State to start us off at two Eastern then North Carol line at NC State Square Off in Raleigh finally Virginia Tech is here at hos Pavilion youll be here in Berkeley for that one triple header of mens Hoops Saturday on acc Network Stanford over across the bay knocking off Virginia Tech Applause tonight nows knocking down their free throws executing on offense and the jump hook too strong from Blake Buchanan an offensive rebound though for Virginia Elijah Saunders takes it strong well get to the Applause line for Virginia if you can find ways to score the free throw line stop CL chip into the lead but at the end of the day I think Virginia is going to have to make a couple of good shots from the threepoint line as well Saunders six for six from the line third foul on joshu Ola Joseph one more for Saunders 10 points tonight for the Junior from Phoenix played sparingly at San Diego State as a freshman emerged last year put his name in the portal and he did look at Virginia coming out of high school and then on the bounce back goes to Applause Virginia its a common thing in college basketball with number of transfers a lot of times you end up somewhere that recruited you the first time and maybe finish second for whatever Applause reason I like this getting late shot clock now do something to attack DJ Campbell on a step back Elijah Saunders watches it trickle out of bounds Virginia ball its 339 to go and Cal up Bel it in Search and their first win in the ACC attack and theyve theyve done it and they have kept the pedal down this entire second half now do you think theyre wearing the throwback uniforms cuz youre here tonight W thats rude now those are I thought you said those those were actually before you played a cal just just a few years slightly before my time those uniforms to to honor the 1959 National Championship team for Cal which darl imhof was a great player on that team for the legendary Pete n few years before you played a cal just just slightly just slightly now that were like 30 years down the road can you just admit as Rory Williams tampered and got you to leave not a chance not a chance Andre St yakovich and then a foul in frustration and a one and one for Isaac mcne the First on sto yakovich the defense now is you know theyre going to key in on Andre theyre going to bring second secondary Defenders that was just a little bit of over over penetration there I did talk to coach Williams this this morning on the way up he said he was going to try and listen Im Im a little bit concerned with putting to sleep well it is right now after 100 am East Coast time which is well past his bedtime as you all know Im sure he has a golf game to get ready for tomorrow losing the handle was Jeremiah willson and a tie up it belongs to Virginia 241 to go look thats not an ideal possession however they got down to seven on the shot clock they burned 23 seconds its a whole lot better than that turnover occurring in the first seven seconds of the shot clock you you talking about a Roy Williams story earlier today about a trip to play Cal here at the bay area where you gave him back directions yeah loose ball hustling as Ola Joseph still eight on the shot Applause clock now a tough Challenge three and Jacob Kofi the rebound for Virginia Elijah Saunders kick to the corner in a three two strong from isan Sharma Virginia gets it back deep three from Andrew roie way short and out of bounds and a cowb with 71 seconds remaining really nice job the last two possessions offensively burned almost a minute of game time they scored one out of the two possessions but get two points burn a minute off the clock keep the lead in double digits doing what they have to do right now for Applause sure and they foul Soko immediately the fourth on Jacob Kofi and two shots for mty Soko who is a 6 4 foul shooter as M Soko though its his night hes three for three at the line Seven Points 11 rebounds and four block shots hes been a Difference Maker in this game consistently and one more for mty Soka Jeremiah wion Virginia will continue their weak stay here in the Bay Area theyll move over to the peninsula and theyll take on Stanford on Saturday afternoon give them time to regroup you know and theyll do theyll do a great job of making a game plan figuring out what they can improve upon youre not going to change everything in a couple days but thats going to be something that they need to focus on theyll have ch of trying to stop one of the top scorers and rebounders in the country in Maxim Reno is Andrew RO with the bucket time out Ron Sanchez timeout Virginia 101 to go back in 30 cal 0 and three in the ACC and 61 seconds away from getting their first win in their new conference still have to make some plays here down the stretch but the travel is going to be an issue for them and its coming off that East Coast trip had a few days to regroup and it seems they were energized tonight yeah you know they were a little bit I dont know what maybe passive in the first half but that was that was solved in the second half super aggressive super efficient this last minute now if you make free throws the games going to be over um you know obviously you cant turn the basketball over I dont think Virginias going to let him milk the clock 30 seconds theyre going to foul him early here but just knock in with confidence your free throws finish the game and prep for the next one Cal will host Virginia Tech here on Saturday before theyll have to go back to the east coast again next week Cal breaks the press and DJ Campbell gets it across and now look to run some clock Applause and they foul St yakovich the second on mcne two shots for Andre sto yakovich and he was without a point for about the first 15 minutes of this game and now hes got 22 he uh struggled a little bit early getting into the paint and you know not only getting by his guy but Virginia did a nice job swarming other players to him uh a little bit late here same kind of thing had a little bit of trouble going by the second guy but once he got in the group confence really built you know its not all just a you know threepoint shooting kind of thing hes really become a heck of player getting to the basket getting to the free throw line scoring around the rim little fadeaways fun to watch and it also seemed that other players getting involved offensively whether it was Wilkinson whether it was Campbell Ola Joseph it opened things up for sto yakovich tonight well in the other Y St how about hes in double digits on the free throw line I think thats 13 free throws he shot most of which in the second half which you know beyond everything else it really just shows his mindset of being aggressive first foul in Anthony Robinson sending Joshua Ola Joseph to the line and thats a place that St yakovich gets to he averages almost seven free throws attempted a game and thats something C A team has been doing consistently this year they get to the line theyve done a really you know they theyre a good threepoint shooting team about 35 36 from the threepoint line which is good but they really have a nice balance of of getting to the free throw line scoring the ball around the rim and then and then having the balance of threepoint shots as well the offense has not been a problem for them its been the other end of the floor where they have struggled but their defense has been better tonight what have you notice defensively I tell you what I mean the the energ well Soko is a shot blocker I think really really changes everything defensive rebounding has been good now its not a strength of Virginia going to the offensive boards but I I just like the mindset its been physical physical being consistent I think they go to the locker room right now with a renewed sense of optimism that they can figure out the defensive side of things so after a six and one start then Cal after blowing an 18point lead to Der lost six out of seven but now they get their first a CC win against Virginia with a terrific second half effort thats a shot clock violation and theres 4 seconds to go and the ball belongs to Virginia the Cal will go to 8 s overall 1 and three in the ACC Virginia also one and three in the league 8 s for the Cavaliers but this was a night
