to get this game underway Duke coming in 16 two Wake Forest at 15 and four and here we go as wake wins the opening tip and run away part of the key is going to be controlling and dictating the style of the game early particularly for Wake this cannot be a track me as much as they may want to run theyve really got to make it a your turn my turn game long one coming the threepointer off the back Iron by Johnson Tyler Johnson whos 7 for 31 now and thats something to keep an eye as we look at the Duke starting five k nipple another guy as he nearly lost and does lose it in the end as HTH picked him hes a guy looking for a bounceback performance and it was a whistle before that wave that off as they turn it over good for Hunter Salis to see one go down though you didnt get the shot to fall but you actually create rhythm with the shot that didnt count I know when the whistle blows you take that shot when it goes in it does affect your next shot sure theres numbers to prove it right stepped on the line flag with it out beyond the threepoint Applause line on the drive James will kick it and the corner shot will not fall Proctor couldnt hit the triple flag with the rebound and a little turnaround left it short Spillers had it knocked out of his hand no whistle kiple will fire and Miss around and out theyre going to get a fourth try at it maybe a tie up and they have the possession arrow on this end batch tied up on the play the sevenfooter for Duke watching Tyler Johnson and Mala watch kind of Quasi get into it I mean Im the smaller guy so Ive also Ive always been on that side of it but sometimes you just got to know when to back away Tyler thats not one youre going to win but I like the fight early so Duke to put it in from the Baseline Duke has been a far better shooting team at least from threepoint distance at 38 one of the many things they do well and a whistle off the ball here well I think the the great balance as you see in in the opening couple possessions when shots go up youre chasing so often because of the balance and the spacing that Duke has on the offensive end so the offensive rebounding opportunities are there for Duke when the shots go up Tron Spillers with the foul hes in that starting lineup along with hildr and Johnson Salis and Reed and Duke quickly getting on the Applause board W for is picked to finish third in the ACC behind Duke and North Carolina and another whistle away from the ball thatll go on Proctor of the Duke Blue Devils number one and look at Steve Forbes year number five at the helm for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons not feeling very well they got the entry downstairs for Reed and the Stu the bwatt just got lost C man see ball simple principles they still apply at this level that purposefully didnt say anything about the Cooper flag jumper because part of my prep was trying not to talk too much about Cooper flag good luck good luck on that right with the season the Freshman is putting together takes it through the foul line picked away HTH with the theft and the hard no point guard nice feed and the block by malawat got up to that backboard and with two hands deflected it heres flag from the corner cant drop it in a good job by kiple to keep it alive but theyre going to turn it over on the trle just a a good fine start I mean part of it is set the screen right if you actually make physical contact as a screener you tend to be the guy that gets open theres a reason why Steph Curry is one of the best screeners in the NBA he gets open finally knew that dayward jumping in the lane thats a tough shot the defense which has been absolutely spectacular for Duke this season another stop flag up top canle off the F wants to drive have it inside theyre going to let him play a little bit apparently thats putting it rightly Johnson on the Baseline Reed will launch a long one and leave that short he is now three for 17 from threepoint line I do think that letting them letting them play may look like it helps Wake Forest at times but what its going to do is create an up and down style and pce on this game that will overtime favor Duke spers reaching and will commit the foul trayon Spillers with the personal 1658 to go just getting started and number two on Applause Spillers number two Jude Harris Applause well we welcome you here to Winston Salem North Carolina and certainly Wake Forest is hoping they can follow that Playbook that Vandy just showed everybody nationally as the Duke Blue Devils number two in the country undefeated in the ACC and a threepointer On Target by KH kiple the 67 freshman to give Duke the 52 lead Dave OBrien alongside John Chrisman great to have you with us and what we believe is the big biggest game in the ACC so far this season yeah so far this is definitely one of the bigger games in the ACC and you have to think this is the biggest opportunity for Wake to get a signature win here at home 10 and0 at home they beat this Duke team well not this Duke team but a different Duke team last year here at home storm the courts in fact the last two times they have met here here its been a Wake Forest upset Victory the nipple with it high on the wing averaging 13 points a game coming off a rough one against Boston College and which he did not score Cooper flag will lose that one going down into the nether regions under the basket yeah look theyre really letting it go and while it looks like yeah good for weight let it Let It Go no this is getting up and down the floor and over time that absolutely favors Duke the Duke team that can create and maintain sustained Rhythm throughout the course of the game a little Pace will help Duke Harris with a threepoint attempt Duke Harris and again keep an eye on that today because W Forest Only Hits 28 from 3 land overall they missed five consecutive shots James on the entry cant finish batts going up trying to keep that alive and draws the foul 1545 to go here in the first half and Duke by Applause three just it with everything else about him right its the discipline that is applied everywhere Im just most impressed by the maturity in this sense he is incredibly mature in terms of his feel and instincts in the game thats whats whats most remarkable the skill set yeah its obvious hes a great player but its all again things you dont see that make him great 19 points eight rebounds a game some of his very best games have been against his highest ranked opponents shot lock down to seven P nipple off the fake out Airborne flag open for a triple cant nail that and we comes away with a rebound we force does one six consecutive games Duke has won 12 in a row but wake without a point in over 3 minutes just wrote something down in the break and just said attack gaps in space and watch the we defense converge and thats exactly what Dukes been able to do theyve gotten really good what I refer to as clappable misses good looks that they just didnt get to fall you can build upon those those create Rhythm they create a Chase from the defense so continue to get those good looks Ws got to be careful getting two guys on the basketball with length and and strong passers for Duke man to watch for the demon diens certainly number 23 Hunter Salis had 29 against them last year in the Victory on this floor and he stormed the court shot clock down to five knocked away Proctor up against Salis oneonone went for the bank and came up empty loose ball back to Proctor and the second effort now for Duke piple the Freshman flag scoring 22 a game in their five Road victories shot clock again to three as kiple launches way way downt and no hes been cold lately yeah good start defensively for Wake as I said you got to be cautious of bringing two guys to the basketball because of the weapons around the perimeter but a good base defense to start try to make Duke Bor thats a good start that good Reed the sevenfooter on the back down banging and a travel bwart sticking right with it joh G year number three for Duke his team leading the nation in average Victory margin beating opponents by 22 points per game look theyre great on offense and theyre great on defense usually what happens is you blow people Applause out maybe you wanted more analysis than that but thatll go the other way at an offensive so really for both team six minutes in a pretty choppy start with a total of seven points I would have thought letting them play a little bit more allows both teams to get up and down the floor a bit more feel the game out I I would say the choppy start is the best possible thing for Wake for us who only has two points on the board right now that five for Duke could easily be 15 here the Foster on the 65 sophomore bat just picked up his first foul and right now a game with no rhythm on either side Harris back for Hil hes coming off 20 against North Carolina and a big win on this floor this week oh great great instincts there by flag unable to keep it in play but knocked it out I mean Cooper Flags instincts you know you you cant have a camera on him the whole game but I think youd be a fun watch because what youre watching is the eyes hes seeing things happen behind him in front of him hes anticipating and again those are the things you dont see that make him great CP can weve going to get you in some production Here Comes Hilder a long one that clangs away and again no points in over 5 minutes for Wake Forest I dont think I have that much pull yet OB were working on it were working on it great to have you here of course the Hall of Famer dick byal was going to be here for this game and had a mishap at home but hes recovering very quickly and the legend will be back court side soon enough Here Comes flag on the drive with the left hand just so hard to defend because you have to take the shot away H fast on the other end to answer yeah wake fans are saying its about time St cre wake has to be careful the quick shot is good cuz its a made basket but if you get into an up and down contest it quickly goes the other way the watch loses the dribble proor hit the deck hes slow to get up shot clock down to seven Gillis will attack and another foul on the deck before the shot here we go a little Cooper cam here I mean just you watch this guy play with such a simple Grace and Poise you forget at times hes the best player on the floor and in a way like a mob boss hes just kind of manipulating all the things around him what you fit what you miss is the simple ball fake as he catches what it does is it gets Fon Reed the big to hold it opens up the left and he drives right there for a layup its just good stuff could very well be the best player in the country right now Ill say he is heres Harris to kick it out Salis has been very quiet so far coming in averaging 19 points a game First Team all ACC last year and on the Cherry West shooting guard watch list he can explode for 30 any night five to get off a shot now Johnson Harris with a shot clock down to one and flag converging batted it away 05 on the shot clock I tell you what has a cumulative effect is you know length for sure but the fact that Dukes already gone to eight guys the eight guys already in this game they can wear you down in a variety of ways and and the biggest piece to me as as a guy who played this game is length wears you out length can close gaps that you thought were open and while my legs are tired and I cant close the gap physically their length doesnt for so to be able to go 8 10 Deep and really not lose a step goodness just time for a tip here turn and shoot and could not get that one to go and picked off by Proctor Gillis did he get away with something there the crowd thought he did Under 12 here in the first half very low scoring first half to this point proor with some contact popped it up there and a lot of iron but it dropped anyway good job by way getting the defense set the zone at least disrupts the Rhythm in the game Duke had to take 5 10 seconds just to figure out how to attack Tyler Johnson looking bit of penetration Harris wants to drive it off the window and that was up against black Ill take it but I wouldnt commit to getting that every single time down floor Foster calls a play here for number two Duke Auburn still number one and a big match up with Tennessee coming up tonight the kick and a sweet shot there by Gillis Gillis has grown a lot he came from a program where they ran a lot of stuff they fed the ball inside I think hes had to adjust to the way this Duke team plays spaces the floor a lot of read and react good communication hes grown a lot of the last few weeks wake for is held to six points to this point and a turnover on the Harris pass on put a couple things down that I said for wake you got to dictate the way the game play you got to dictate the game you got to force Duke to constantly find it theyve done that so far by switching defenses theyve got to continue to do that by slowing down at times and a foul every down thats not a bad thing flag of the foul line dishing that one and a whistle Ted Valentine hopping in he doesnt just mosy and no ever races are hops in D by the 611 freshman took the hit 1024 to go in the first half and filed by JW Carris who picks up number two its always humbling when there are still officials officiating that officiated you and college like 20 some years ago they look like that he still looks good Val looks great look great tremendous shape as the Freshman from Manasses Virginia knocks into first one you dont see a letup from duke when they go to the bench it just looks a little different I think it just adds to how tough it is to not only play but to prepare for a team like this know weve had some shots of the student section it was packed in here and that section 2 hours before the opening tip but theyve been forced to sit on their hands a little bit the last three three or four minutes Frederickson giving it off for Reed up on the high post heres Salis will he start to get going offensively certainly trying with that midrange but he cant connect he is 0 for two shooting at the early going James off the flag yes thats two its an interesting lineup that John Shys got where it puts Cooper flag a situation where hes really got to be the two guard I mean look on the floor in terms of Shooters and scores hes basically playing the two they go to a pin down he just curls and shoots over the top well you said the first you know eight or nine minutes there was no rhythm but now Duke has found theirs and theyre on a seven nothing right heres hildr cant connect around and out and a whistle and yet they have not wake for us to hit a three yet they remain over for four wake at 15 and for seven one of the conference and won six in a row theyre 100 at home right now Joe lonardi says theyre a bubble team probably a bubble team this would be significant I I think what hurt them was the high expectations coming into the nonconference season and in some way underd delivering I had them at at Texas AM they need to score 50 points so so finding offense was a challenge but every year is going to be a unique challenge where you come in wanting to play a certain way but you have to adapt and adjust to your personnel and the realities you deal with thats what Steve forb said hes had to do HTH on the drive tonight P nipple sticking right with him Dukes defense continues to be superb Wicks got six points you think you have a line you take it but they converge so quickly and and then theyre able to contest I love the fact that we allow the wall up you see more plays at The Rim well that favors a team like that has a length like Duke wi for is three for 14 Frederickson he can help stepping back beyond the three nothing shot clock down to one heres the heave and that wont go and a rebound back to the Duke Blue Devils here they come building on a 10point Advantage out to Mid court and a save by Gillis Gillis open straight on and another foul here with 848 to go in the opening half here winst to Salem just watched Duke locked in defensively now a big piece of this is communication really when you communicate I Im talk with really guys on the backside you communicate you understand you got to hold your ground you force the toughest shot possible its not about stopping every shot opportunity its about forcing the ones that they dont want to take that wears you out too kle just picked up his first Isaiah Evans ready to come back for Duke here in a moment Rickson denied canle right on him they do get it downstairs for the B but the seven footer misses it it missed five in a Applause Music Applause row proor double up on him and hell take a hit Ted Valentine correct on this one a shot to the face of tyres brocker that was good surge in terms of the push offensively led by Cooper flag he pushes it up they mooved the basketball a little bit there was no stop reset thats what you have to continue to do dont allow a reset if youre Duke if your weight force force them to stop force them to reset look at the bench figure out what they want to do but yeah this is its going to be a contest physically to get out of here tonight officially counts as tonight right getting there Proctor will lay that one off the iron rebound Tapped Out High Evans comes away with it piple trying to get around hildr and he gets him with the body first and 801 left John here in the first half and that is going to be three fouls on Cameron hildr the point guard and this is significant so part of it is guys get tired they get a step behind the play but theyre also chasing the play because of the spacing and the balance on the floor you bring Evans in thats another guy you have to be aware of presence of Mind Scouting Report what do I do dont leave him right so you space even further when you get in a scramble situation youre chasing the playle shooting too excellent foul shooter 89 mentioned he did not score in the victory at Boston College he was 0 for five from the field but they always seem to have a guy like a Tyrese Proctor step up he got 20 in that game really it could be anybody it could be Evans it could be Proctor it could be kiple I mean Mason Gillis could give you 10 15 points on any given night just grabbed that rebound and threw it away Johnson over the top and a slam by Salis and they need a shot of Life desperately the key with that the transition opportunity you get an easy one it allows to get your defense set I was wondering if theyd get back in zone after that kle on the move and willll draw the foul about 7 and 1 half to go season Im just looking at the little numbers and you just wonder at what point we have a new number one Duke knocking on the door think so knocking loud on the door to nipple inside Deni and a good shut down there by wake they need a lot of those Tyler Johnson on the Run youd like to see him get involved in a big way today yeah and its like directly indirectly where you just got to get into the paint just watch the defense move you know create a Chase thats probably not the one but it goes in why not and a hit is well hell go to the line looking for a threepoint play the heck do I know hes the guy that can get where he wants to go on the floor thats the reason why Steve forb said look you know come Christmas he realizes I really got to play this guy he really hadnt gotten him as polished as he wanted him to be hes going to have to learn on the Fly because he needs a guy that can break you down off the bounce get into the paint watch the defense converge and start to read and and make the right plays making the right play is going to be the key proor with his second personal Tyler Johnson 64 sophomore out of Brooklyn the Louisville Transfer who has worked his way into the starting lap round and out so no threepoint play there and defensively for Wake now this is the difference in W fors this year they believe theyve become an elite defensive team John shy was talking about the scouting report on them this week he agrees I think sometimes its out of necessity when youre not able to score the ball the way you wanted to when youre not able to play with a pace that you wanted to play youve got to be a good defensive team if you want to compete at a high level flag headed ripped away now a loose ball and another tie up Evans hit the deck and Reed thought that Wake Forest had a timeout there was about to call a timeout but thats not the case 640 to go possession arrow will keep it on this end and Duke by seven and wake for is finally getting the 10 points that took forever yeah it it took forever to the point where I think it makes the game choppy and sloppy it limits the rhythm of the game which limits Dukes ability to really find and establish themselves in the game part of the reason Duke has 17 is because wake only has 10 Salis Salis wants badly to get it off shot clock down to 11 long one coming and off the back Iron by Frederickson the threes just wont fall for Wake for and that means for the entire season its also heavily contested by Cooper flag who got out there theyre going to call offensive on Cooper flag this one goes against Duke and theyre getting very physical with him yeah I think that would be my my challenge is like well youre allowing physicality but not that yet probably I dont know sell it you get it its a foul 620 to go thats number one on flag who has the presence of mind to attack him off the bounce and can you get the match up you like to be able to attack him off the Applause bounce Johnson steps back for a triple cant nail that Reed with a big rebound straight up and one hell be headed to the line Captain Reed to third the 7 foot senior suddenly a six nothing run for Wake Forest that was all set up by good ball screen action and it was Eon Reed holding the screen possibly holding it a little too long I saw John shy calling for a foul but because of the fact that he held the screen it left malawat on the backside Eon Reed just rolled in he had defensive rebounding position when the shot went up sometimes as a guard if you read it right you see that if you get a shot up your guys are in position to rebound because of the good action around the perimeter its not really a bad look watch off to the bench with two and Reed at the line Applause 70 and so life here for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons they have pulled it within four James with a bounce for flag flag slitting in Banks it in and hell be headed to the line oer flag looking for a threepoint play the patience the Poise the ball fak head fakes P fakes ball F whatever its going to be he gets you off balance and part of the off balance is the backside the Baseline Defender right youre going to roll here and you stay on the opposite side flag is patient enough to make sure defense vacates he also is a great passer so you cant fully commit to the basketball thats actually pretty good defense outside of the foul because it forced a tough angle layup you can live with that even if he makes it you just dont need the foul like talking with Ted Valentine here and I think the point is a lot of physical play and theres been a lot of holding early on but Ted hearing him out as the veteran official he is and so CER flag wait Ted was hearing him out he did actually could listen very may have been hearing Ted out and there he was with a threepoint play so flag is four for seven the rest of the DU team three for 12 what a bad spot to be if youre covering Cooper flag top of the key where the paint starts to open up you just you cant win that battle just hope he misses D nine Reed looking to operate out of the double and stolen away by Duke they take it away from the Applause sevenfooter 2013 the number two team in the country up seven heres canip the launch but strong his last couple of games have been Rocky for him had a 25point game against Miami before that I think hes got to find the shot he likes not not the one he gets Harris leaning in and a tough Drive will draw the foul The Freshman been playing pretty solid minutes by 17 a game he draws the personal on cion James theres a lot going on here man this is this has been a battle the challenge for that is look Fon Reeds going to have to play more minutes than any of the Duke bigs are so 40 minutes of this physicality it it could be really it could be a grind for Wake FS yeah re not a big score only about eight points a game but an active screen yes and hes been good there and can block a shot good rebounder Harris with a misfire so under five to go tonight Tennessee and Auburn its a clash in the absolutely brutal SEC on a big day of college basketball on ESPN flag looking to go around the back got free James will fire it up and swish it in from threepoint Lup you have no idea how simple he made a complicated thing look right all the pressure on the ball first off hes playing point guard right now all the pressure on the ball simple ball f hes able to make that skip pass and see how James gets to Rhythm three Johnson knocked away gunga with the deflection flag getting it downstairs on the break then he crashes the glass it comes free and its off awake Forest just cant say enough I mean just hes looking right at tyres Proctor gives him a simple ball fake makes the skip pass to the corner I mean again he makes the simple thing or the complicated simple I Things You Dont See Is What Makes You great we talk a lot about the things you see but his feel and instincts to terms of manipulating the game his threepointer wont drop and wake with it sailing 2314 Salis had a massive dunk a few minutes ago hes going to draw a foul by James really smart I think quick shots for Wake are probably not the best thing but when you have the presence of mind to get the clock stopped and get a foul end up at the free throw line smart play hter Applause Salis on the cap pinear on the hip and like a like a pound of chew in the back pocket yes and just mulling people down just making them look silly hes a big baseball guy hes dying to get to Dodger Stadium we were talking about Major League ballparks hes been to last year in April he went to Fenway and it was like 35° he had the time of his life hed never been there before I said go go someplace warm now youve done Fenway Park which is unbelievable now go out west and do Dodger Stadium the fact that he played Four Sports in high school in Iowa they play right baseball in the summer yeah because of the weather never really thought of that ran track football basketball talk about a ship that is sale four sport guys well there are some four Sports guys theyre just not that good not very good in any of it really yeah shot clock down to 10 piples open from the corner and got a great look for the three that had Rhythm right if you watch his feet into that shot you got to get shot ready shot ready is not just your eyeballs and hands right its your feet you watch his feet into that shot the feet determine whether the shots going to go in as much as anything else man if he starts to shoot it again and that seems to be only a matter of time look out heres Johnson as we approach the 3 minute mark he saw an opening there Kip will shut it down shot clock to three off the back iron that wont dropped by Harris Gillis on the run in for two those are the ones you have to eliminate thats why theres a timeout if youre with you believe hell be back I heard Jimmy Dykes talk about that today during that great win for VY and how much of play exactly of course he is up for player of the year hes been Sensational and healthy getting it down for Reed out of the double Harris Harris wants the Baseline nicely done not much room to work against Duke but when you have it youve got to capitalize good execution out of a timeout too that makes coaches feel good about the job theyre doing well its not been a scoring Fest not by a long shot but Duke up 2817 and a travel here on konle as he dragged the foot talk about K canle finding a rhythm as a shooter and its really the feet you watch the feet there it is I mean thats good Rhythm stepping into the shot shot ready means youre preparing for the shot before you get the basketball theres a reason why those goes in they become high percentage shots from Applause three Harris back for sales kipple on him Reed nice pass but theyre going to wave that off and a foul underneath with 204 to go theyre getting ready for a big time slam dunk its going to be two on Cooper Applause flag hes there I mean hes just right there to take it away I would let it go like as much as we let go you know you let that go you let that go definitely so his second foul nine points for him also turned it over five times itll be readed to the line turns it over but you understand hes got the ball more than anybody else so I can live with some of his turnovers and hes also shown the ability to grow Applause from and Reed will sink that our feature ESPN 2 big Monday its womens basketball number two South Carolina in Knoxville to take on number 17 Tennessee at 700 eastern Don Staleys team coming off a big win against LSU LSU talking about how what its like to go up against 10 all Americans he muddy Mo Problems you still have to figure out those challenges so under two to go in the first half dus done a pretty darn good job of keeping his crowd at Bay they struggled to adjust to the Zone I mean you can see just run 15 20 seconds of trying to figure out what were doing offense FL with a turn around oh what a great pass underneath for guno maybe just get flaged the ball inside the paint sooner seems to Applause work Johnson back for Salis whos really yet to cook in this one Harris and blocked away gangba got a piece of that and a whistle now Ted Valentine blowing the whistled 123 left in a half get so much attention but I go back to the Poise whats he reading well hes reading where the defender came from and hes reading whether any Defender took that block away and the answer is no so he makes the right pass and you get an easy layup yeah he makes the game when he plays it right he makes the game look simple and the reality is it is a simple game haris at the line after the GBA foul his second haris has played with good energy he has we talked about having hope and a degree of fearlessness Harris has kind of embodied the fearlessness were talking about and he can score 17 against NC State apologize for the broadcaster Jinx came a little love missed two free throws 38 into Corner Gillis rebound tapped around by Duke Harris got their first on the drive and hes hit and fouled foul will go on Caleb Foster I mean look you want to look for B you want to look for confidence you want to look for guys that going to get excited going to get excited for one another I think the key to me is Cameron hildr he hes off the floor hes got three fouls you cant really impact the game from the bench other than being a leader so he needs to be that leader on the bench right now getting everybody up off their feet to your point wake with one made field goal in about 6 minutes with their point guard on on the bench for long Applause sip the 64 Englishman out of Worthing England wake the only School in the ACC this season have two different players score 30 in a game hild had 31 against Miami and Salis 30 against Applause Stanford so back to a 10point game with a minute to go before the break Applause flag downstairs back out kiple yes nothing but net that was just great execution s a little Baseline screen to get Cooper flag the ball and then immediately kick out for another in Rhythm three for kiple Salis with a pull up from three they just cant hit those threepoint shots Wake Forest has been Dreadful all season from threepoint line and theyre over nine Applause today FL gives up the dribble GLE stepping in the lane banks in two and shy wants a timeout with 105 to go how about the pick and roll when you kind of in so many ways invert everything most teams prepar and say heres how were going to cover the ball screen well its a fiveman set the ball screen for a point guard what do you do when Cooper Flags receiving the ball screen and can pass over the top Salis will drive this one and slam it into closing seconds of the first half Duke with an opportunity with a heave and this one wont go and we are at the break wake only them the right shots is the best way to help a shooter find Rhythm got one in the corner just didnt have good Rhythm he missed pretty badly and then he got good looks he got him to go duke did turn it over 10 times in the first half leading 3522 Cooper flag five of them yep bottled up proor trying to get free out of the double and theyre going to keep it on this end Duke will retain possession opening seconds here in Winston Salem Duke trying to make it 13 consecutive wins they are 8 and0 in the ACC with the first time since 0708 bullets to get it in and Applause does Ripper flag in the corner the jumper coming from James but that didnt touch anything Wake Forest started the ball game today missing a lot of shots theyre trying to get this big crowd involved the students are dying to be involved hildr playing with three fouls now and a whistle and a foul Milo watchs the 72 freshman from South Music Sudan and well pick up number three may maybe starting to called a little tighter to start the second half I think the key for Wake is going to be get your starting group established in this game they really were never able to do it with Cameron hildra three fouls Salis with a pull up got it that midrange game is so nasty does a good job of creating space and in a way weve almost been convinced thats a bad shot maybe its a bad shot for some but but not for hotter Sals Salis coming in at 19 points a game thats the same as Cooper flag kept that foot on the dish downstairs and a whistle and a foul on the de said Ted Valentine he passed up a good look I felt like he passed up a good look to get a better one but this is just nice stuff I mean creates just enough space to get that 15 16 17 footer which again we we listen to people its a bad shot whatever it went in it was a good look Reed is second foul canle cant drain that one still like Duke playing through Cooper flag at the top he was able to pick apart the defense the ball fak on the passes to the paint on the Roll opens up pass out to a guy like Canon James in the corner Tyler Johnson from the elbow no Leon batted around Duke comes away Tyrese Proctor 66 Jr off the flag with a jumper well short and Wake Forest will let that one roll out of play like does the airbar taunt or Cooper flag really have the same impact like if I shoot an airball it hurts a little when I hear right cuz I dont really do anything else that well I just dont think he sweat sweats it as much Im not sure he sweats at all I dont think he Applause does heres hrth trying to be a factor in the second half at a long sit in the first half in foul trouble ralis up and oh got in a three hter Sal kind of gets his game going with the midrange I overuse the term Rhythm but also feel like I dont say it enough I mean he creates a rhythm off the bounce and then he looks for that next shot shoots it with confidence that was their first made three Proctor with an answer on the other end he tried anyway but came up empty heres James to launch that missed ugly see if Salis gets Another Touch here hes asking for the ball hild with with a bounce feet in the Slam by Spillers like you said this this crowd is asking for something to get excited about they got it great start to the second half for Wake Forest good defense Hunter Salis gets it going they dominated but theyve controlled the start of the second half I also want to make the point dick fight to theres so many of us out there that thank you because you created the industry we get to be a part of you did it with sincerity you actually care about the the product we put out there and you love the game here here and the biggest heart youre going to find anywhere oh we love him so much its the closest wake has been since he was 1713 and Salis lost the handle on it came off his hand out it went so they turn it over if youre wake you cant have empty possessions right now youve got energy in the building you have to build upon it you got to keep this into the game probably a going to win the game but it sure helps can nipple off the fake steps back got it back somehow flag with it proor and a whistle off the ball for 1621 to go whats happening over there like its a complete opposite side of of the play and and if thats Applause HRI is going to be number four on Hill look at that any Edge you can catch trying to keep flaged Bay but you know youre watching the action on one side and you got bodies flying all over the place on on kind of some opposite side action and hildr picks up his fourth I mean that thats where you just have to know you cant do something silly lets keep an eye hilds on your left side hes going to fight over its on hild took down a sevenfooter with the hook flag and He will draw the foul rer flag on the Move Flag by the way has scored about 9 minutes from to tail end of the first half to this but Steve Forbes has lost his point guard again so they started to get it going offensively started to get the crowd involved and bang theres number four hes on the bench again talk about how effective he was against Carolina and look I I said to Steve Forbes I felt for Steve Forbes down the stretch they really could have won that game by 10 almost gave it away cam HR was great and they really havent had him much at all here in in this contest so Applause far is he a boxer or a uh a basketball doing a lot of bleeding over there thats for sure round It Out by flag who just scored his first points in quite a while first points 3629 Duke with flag so much goes through him as an initiator that the scoring eventually comes but its once hes able to read how the games being played Johnson back for Salis Johnson again the open three rebound right to Applause Proctor so Wake Forest one for 11 beyond the threepoint line bror making a move inside no one picked the up or shut him down he gets his own miss that one batted around and it will be way Force ball and 1534 to go in this contest they use them I mean maybe keeping them away from the post is more of a mover around the perimeter just getting them back into the rhythm of game play our Sonic Blockbuster tonight this is a pretty good one to warm you up with too Reed trying to power his way inside and a foul 1521 to go in the contest Duke has own the glass in this one they have out rebounded way Force 30 17 Duke the tallest team in the country and for Proctor his third foul theres height but theres just general length they just cover so much ground and you watch rebounds theyre in for every rebound because of their Music length Harris with a spin to the Baseline tonight Salis out High shot clock down to seven Salis way downt that Miss Applause badley so Duke looking to build on a 3629 Advantage they were up 13 and half Foster to flag The Freshman back for foster two really good defensive teams toe to toe blackag wants it leaning in left it short but they really buckle down on him spers did a good job of gapping and really forcing to drive Johnson will pick up the foul you I I think Cooper flag if hes going to play in that triple threat hes got to show the willingness to shoot the shot he can certainly make that shot but you have to get a defense to commit to the basketball commit to contesting the shot theyve been sagging off him a little bit I mean look at the space youre just gapping if youre Spillers good physicality you force a bad angle and theres nothing there I dont think Cooper flag is getting taken out if he pulls that through you know hes trying not to settle but hes also got to take what theyre willing to give you already been named the ACC rookie the week seven times I think he no longer qualifies for that award you know just want it again 3621 31 So within five Way Forest alaat looking for a guard here gets it off here for canle and he lost it on the dribble and they reaching a foul too was that fight thats what we talked about theres execution and playmaking on one end from the Duke standpoint and then theres just a simple fight a battle for Wake Forest theyve been physical defensively they theyve struggled to really find consistency on the offensive end but the fights there so theyre staying in this game theyve only turned it over seven times heres Harris to launch we got a good look Music too Duke will without a field goal this half so they have been really chilly since the break Proctor heres Foster trying to end that and he cant rebound came right back at him straight on that wont drop Duke is 0 for 10 this Applause half Johnson getting it off for Harris he knocks it down from threepoint L got that feeling remember I mention clappable misses in the first half the last Harris shot he felt good about it he had good body language in and after that miss the next shot that was going up he shot with confidence and it went in its a 12 to one run here for Wake proor good look no the misses keep on coming and a foul here against Duke 1259 to go and Wake Forest making a big run yeah Job shot on the bench going to bring three new in I hes got got to find the right lineup right find the rotation that can give you a little energy some made shots not a bad idea to maybe put Cooper flag in a different situation or position on the floor offensively maybe look Baseline he makes great plays out of the post course a double it creat the double itself is an advantage because of Cooper flags ability to pass out of it m watchs fourth foul so without a point he will and Wake Forest with an opportunity to take the lead here will a three do it Trayvon Spillers has put wake in front of number two Duke 3736 on the drive hipple he gets knocked to the deck the follow that wont go W showing serious fight over the top and the slam for Spillers and this place is Going Bonkers we asked for it partner we got it Duke has lost to weake the last two two times theyve played in this building its a 17 to one run flag got it and thatll quiet the crowd temporarily as he hits a three tied at 39 how about wake really starting this with good defense and now theyre playing with confidence the attack offensively theyre getting good looks wake has shifted this entire game Duke is rattled and kipple just threw it away 1133 left and going crazy cuz the last few minutes have been fun maybe not for Duke well frankly whether Dicks on his feet or in his seat hes going crazy hes going crazy look at this end of the first half a hot team and one for 14 Duke since the start of this second half but give wake a lot of credit defensively like the block by Reed that helped launch that fast break in the dun I I think you really got to get creative with where Cooper flag is offensively shift the defense by moving him on the floor Johnson off the fake drives it and a foul a Cy move by the youngster he sophomore from Brooklyn thatll be seon James third foul so fouls on both sides starting to become become a factor with 11 minutes to go Johnson will shoot its consistent with how the games being played he turn it into a fight the stoppages because of fouls that favors Wake Forest cuz whats going to happen here Mr make wakes getting back theyre getting set so the more wake can make Duke play against the set defense the more Advantage they have Johnson second C4 hold us today when the season started you know back in November I wanted to play fast I realized that wasnt a good way for us to go I had to slow us down so a game like this where it is right now is how they want to play FL too strong Salis out of the pack with it hes knocked to the deck in a foul as Mason Gillis couldnt put on the brakes and Florida and our Saturday Prime Time Rivals week coming your way tonight at 830 countdown crew will get it underway we C the night with LeBron and the Lakers taking on Steph and the Warriors 1056 left and wake shooting one and one you can control the game if you make free throws Sal great foul shooter but missed a couple of big ones against North Carolina that didnt cost them a win in the end this week but some tense moments flag they come in and try and converge on him and a fou by Johnson as he reached in fouls can be disruptive too we can talk about different ways to disrupt the game maybe switching defenses you know changing your ball screen coverage which I think is is a you got to be really careful with against Duke sometimes the fouls they become so annoying and they disrupt your your whole Rhythm Music James one and done there Johnson wants to push it every time down the floor and thats going to roll in he had some serious spin on that baby that didnt look like it had a chance to even get up let alone go in not a chance and now hes got a smile on his face and wake has their biggest lead today against Duke out it goes as they throw it away flag is at problems with turnovers today its been rattled and and a lot of its coming from the outside in I I really do think that youve got to get creative maybe put flag in a different position allow him to see the floor from a different perspective and maybe plays from the Block they did it a couple times against the Zone where they brought him along the Baseline and he was able to kick back out for open threes everything theyre doing right now is Cooper flag from the top of the key in Duke has a long run of games where by this point in the contest its over theyve just been steamrolling people now theyre down by four with 10 minutes to go on the road Johnson with a crossover bounce speed Harris Got got it tough shot I mean look I said it right Tyler Johnson is the guy that can get places and getting someplace makes the defense rotate it opens up cutting Lanes driving Lanes passing Lanes it gets the defense to shift to the basketball all done by the guy that can get where he wants to Applause go this escalated quickly all off the bouns I mean good sit down right hand his eyes are up and Harris I I said earlier Harris is probably hes the toughest guy on the floor right now typically thats hild hes on the bench with four fouls Harris has been great in that sense care how much hes scored Miss shots ba shots doesnt matter its the fight youre looking for thats what got you back in this game thats what kept Duke from going on an immediate run to start the second half and closing the door on any sort of comeback its been the fight and this crowd loves every bit of it oh they get louder and louder go back a year right go back a year its its about fighting long enough to give yourselves a chance late and next thing you know theres storm in the court this crowd wants hope that that can happen again and right now they have it right now joardy says that W Forest is on the outside looking in for an NCAA tournament bid long way to go to selection Sunday but boy if you pick off off a team like Duke they realize its a home game but Dukes a big favorite proor with a triple com boy he got a great look but cant connect he he did but wake made the decision were going to allow that shot but were not going to allow Cooper flag to pick us apart you realize Duke is 1 for 17 in the second half shooting the basketball do now Harris taking on kiple with the step back I think the house would have come off did he hit that Applause one Proctor penetrating and takes a hit draws the foul 855 to Applause go Nick has just made everything choppy for Duke on the offensive end I think some of its been physicality the other part of it has been theyve been able to get their defense set and you make some shots you get your defense set you see the basketball youre a better defensive team one for 17 and four turnovers D trying to pull it together get it on the Baseline going in strong and the ey by Reed he shut him down Big Time block Salis looking for the save and he stepped on the line itll go back over to dke and that thats one of those unique opportunities in a game where that could have been a dunk for canle that really would have changed the the feeling of this game it goes the other way and Salas loses it great opportunity there for wake you almost have to recognize the opportunity you have it at least get yourself a good look at the rib its a great no call too was a good no call God bless the wall up black will he heat up in these last eight minutes looking for help gives up the dribble Proctor open again in and out this time and another whistle on the Baseline with 813 to play Duke is getting some goodlooking shots theyre just not hitting him well theyre getting goodlook shots because theyre committing to to Cooper flag wake is not letting Cooper flag pick them apart in a way theyre committing two to him early enough to force him to give it up as opposed to making a playmaking type of play that makes sense to somebody out there Johnsons third foul flag will fire this one and knock it down tough spot I I mean thats just an ISO spot on the floor his passing ability forces Defenders to stay on their man and that rise up and shot I think thats been there from three and hes probably got to take it two with a 12 game winning streak on the line look at the length of this Zone good 745 to go heres Salis way too strong this went for the save there on the Baseline and it will be Duke Applause ball so 4541 our score down the stretch we come and a Dandy developing in Winston Applause Music sailor and theyre trying to pull it off again leading by four with about 7 and a half to go clearly a lot of success here at home 10 and0 at home they they won the last one against Duke it took him about a half a basketball to find the the conviction and fearlessness to just let loose I think wake is since let loose and theyve dictated the way the second halfs been played two of 20 from the floor for Duke yeah just one for 12 from threepoint L and the second half for the Blue Devils pipple wants to get closer and drops in two they have the ability to do that youre not going to get as much help on kiple so if he has the advantage youve got to take it time Cooper FL away playing Applause decoy Harris will turn on fire and a lot of iron but a drop down its interesting to see Duke have to go Zone I mean usually you do something like that out of necessity good passing to get the ball inside touch every piece of the rim and you get a bucket to go but man when you start to get it rolling those things it starts to go your way thats the way its been for wake in the second Harris had a really good one 14 points hes played a heady game canle off the fake shot clock down to six now five and switched in by Gillis in way a bail out not a great possession for Duke offensively Gillis gets that to go allows Duke to get their defense set but weits been good picking apart the Zone he has eight one point game six minutes to Applause go proor poked it away now the shot clock coming into play down the five Johnson will launch it that clangs away opening the door for the Blue Devils to retake the lead on this possession Cooper flag spinning going in strong off the window for two thats exactly what Steve Forbes was concerned with them getting into a quick ball screen action forcing a switch he got the match up he liked against Tyler Johnson then game over or at least possession flag with 17 and Duke up by Applause one Harris again will turn cant hit the shot rebound comes out High and a foul that was with nine on the shot clock talk about making things look easy this is kind of the this is NBA right here you you you just go to a ball screen early you get the switch you know whats coming you get the match up you like it gives you the advantage and and Cooper flag makes a good Poise decision finishes at The Rim Fon Reed to third picked up foul number three to send Proctor to the line another good foul shooter for the Blue Devils at 80 and a junior from Sydney Australia will have another Applause one hrth comes in Harris goes out Harris has been great for him but down the stretch you tend to play the guys you trust the most and H has earned that senior certainly has and he was so good at the line down the stretch against North Carolina one point Victory this week hes 10 for 12 so you want him in the game with the ball late yeah they shouldnt have mattered as much but they Applause did Salis pretty quiet the last five or six minutes H shot off by Proctor got the pass free and the shot wont go for Salis Duke by two and the ball Applause here new devils are 50 on the road in the ACC trying to keep that run alive too so much on the line here today Cooper flag penetrates and stuffs it with two hands so now its Duke on a 122 run John shy is really scripting them into the right action that he wants to get Cooper flag the looks he needs ild got a look no and dke comes away again on top 5147 duks done a better job of using a little movement to get Cooper flagged the ball in more of an ISO situation hasnt worked as well when he has it initiated and then just trying to make a play off the bounce but but here you got match up you want working on Spillers got around him and Spillers will pick up the foul was with eight on the shot clock under four minutes left a lowscoring gritty game in the as anybody else particularly if you have the right game plan and you execute Wake Forest has done that in a second their energy brought them back into this game they made just enough plays to get the crowd into it they fed off of it since now Duke down the stretch its been Cooper flag and thats likely how its going to be the more they can create movement even if its fake offense right a little camouflage action to get the defense moving then get Cooper flag the ball in space got to think wakes going to have to defend him late looking for his 20th point and gets that coming up next weve got number seven Houston and number 12 Kansas and then later on this evening the number one team of the country Auburn taking on Tennessee Houston we talk about a fight here go play Houston count your bruises 21 for Cooper flag who has 12 of Dukes 18 second half points so when theyre in trouble they look to number two still think if youre wake you have to have Poise here down the stretch dont be overly aggressive make the right play Johnson nearly gave it away shot clock to 10 Salis with a bounce feed down for Spillers doubled up hell Spin and miss and flag there to grab the rebound think going be calculated impatient on the offensive end now part of that is they want to see what theyre up against they going to walk up against the Zone see manto man now they understand what theyre going to get into Applause Music now the Freshman will take some time lost his footing will he lose the ball its spins freee and thats what happens GTH now playing with four fouls under three minutes he penetrates stripped and foul on the play good good job by Wake Forest stay at home on that defensive possession you dont have to commit to the basketball but you have to show and close gaps they did just that Cooper flag just lost his footing and lost the ball and Cameron hildr hasnt really been able to do much or have a big impact on this game but he just sat there Pro went aggressively and now has the opportunity to make free throws gunpo with the foul to put HTH at the line is very reliable Duke hoping to come out of here 9 and0 in the ACC that was Hs first two points of this half he didnt play much at all in the first half 5349 Applause Duke W trying to get the crowd back in it they were a big factor there for about seven or eight minutes when they surged into the lead tend Applause tooot bu in some trouble did get it free Proctor nearly gave it up now hell fire it got it from threepoint land thats a killer if your wake farest you did almost everything right hes got taken out of the play a little bit too much of a gamble towards half court Proctor ends up wide open one guy had to cover two remember when Duke was one for 19 in this for their last theyve become deadly and a lot of thats been you know Cooper flag getting to the rim makings and thats what theyre going to rely on here down the stretch and its not just that you rely on his ability to make the play you rely on his ability to make the right decision a Monday the Huddle crew will reveal this seasons ACC football schedule theyll break down each team and look at Key weeks and Pacific matchups coverage of this 2hour special begins at 900 Eastern on acc Network and the ESPN app the yellow shirts coming down whats that mean Obie and this is the reason why we flash back to last year and the crowd after the big upset and on the Music court so for safy reasons John sh with some players injured there and Wake Forest makes sure that does not happen again its the right thing to do if you dont want to do away with it then you have to make sure you have to make it less dangerous approaching two minutes to go tried to dump it downstairs for Reed and Duke commits the foul 206 to go that was good action too I mean Reed set a good screen butter Sal coming off with a little flare and he made the right read its kind of slipped to the basket Patrick Uno has been playing quite a lot with Malik Brown out with the knee injury going to be missing for several weeks he picked up his fourth foul you just realize how important Lakes defense is on the offensive end and there there are some teams that they get better defensively when they score they need to see the basketball theyre in a way dictating the way the games played wake is doing that from the defensive end and theyve held one of the great offenses in the country to 56 points to this point Reed making one of two so a sixpoint game one point we came out of a timeout said Dukes two of 20 from the field right and it wasnt that long they changed that oh a strip Johnson picks him clean to hand off for Spillers and he cant connect wow wake miss the golden opportunity after the turnover me you look at the length right you know youre going against Cooper flag you cant really take it up Spillers rushes the shot because of the length two trying to eek out a huge Road win in the ACC here Applause Music today tror back for flag shot clock down to two he fires in cant hit it rebound tipped out High it is offw forest with a minute 16 to go that that hurts if youre awake you did everything right you forced a tough shot still feel like flag is settling a little bit too much I mean really not getting inside of the threepoint line of course in that case the shot clock was about to expire in that case yes talk about the entire possession where is Applause he so he will take some time here to develop a play for John shy flag gets rid of it heres Gillis around it out he figh for the rebound and the foul will go against the Duke Blue Devils Applause again and thats going to be number five on gunbu so he has filed out youve got gunba you got malawat got flag fon reads had to deal with every single one of them you cant give that kid enough credit kid man like he has had to fight through all of it opportunity and a couple free throws with the clock Music stop so this will be two shots and Wake Forest with a minute two to play in their home building trailing by six and I know to a degree Steve Forbes is a little frustrated he does want to play faster but the best thing you can do as a coach is coach the team you have right and its all about what gives my team the best percentage chance of winning games and its going to start on the defensive end it may be to slow it down switch defenses from time to time and be disruptive that way theyve done that tonight holding Duke to 56 points here with a minute two left is pretty remarkable telling read 70 at the line hes sevenfooter from Richmond Virginia trying to get them within Applause four Wake Forest with a streak of their own theyve won six consecutive games in conference play theyre seven and one in the ACC Duke is 8 no and Reed second on the money two the thing about after Reed is is often particularly against a team like Duke bigs are a step behind the play he is not pressure from the demon dakk flag does get it in in for Proctor flag gets it across Dillis from the corner got it he swishes it in the threepointer on the money now a lot of guys may not want to shoot that shot good for Mason Gillis its the best one youre going to get Johnson trying to rifle that pass inside Spillers connect and a timeout W forest with 437 to go and back to a fivepoint game and the problem for Duke there is is they got a great look and they got it to go but they didnt immediately just get back and get set they allowed some quick action and penetration to create an opportunity for a quick score for Wake Forest now timeout fivepoint game 437 left thats plenty of time AC Gillis with a big one there so Houston Kansas is on ESPN news its starting there and well follow this one on ESPN 437 on the clock were talking about Mason Gillis hes a grad and between Duke and Purdue hes played in 150 plus college games and had the steadiness to take that shot just absolutely draining hes hes won a lot of those games too I mean I you argue that Purdue is a more successful program over the last four years than even Duke I mean so he understands what it takes to win great Poise he also is one of those guys that doesnt have to be the star that thats the roster creation we talked about with John shy said what do you most proud of is is probably that you know its not just coaching the team its the team you assemble Malik Brown we havent talked about him to get him back thats a game changer in terms of Defense an elite Defender so Duke to put it in Applause 5954 flag double up and he reach and foul him with 414 to go and thats another unique Advantage you have with Cooper flag I mean quite often you inbound the ball there its a bad spot short corner its going to be a double Cooper flags able to see over the top be strong with it and hes the guy you want shooting free throws down the stretch anyway youre talking about roster construction ESPN recruiting expert Paul bardi worked a Powerhouse game yeah yesterday a prep game talking about you know looking ahead for Duke and they will have National High School Player of the Year Cameron Boozer 69 out of Columbus High School in Florida the son of the former Duke great Carlos Boozer first one a championship in 2001 for Coach Kate twin brother Kaden the point guard will also be going to do they got a good thing going where you do you fill it up with great young talent and then you surround those guys with old winners or guys like seion James who will do whatever it takes to win at a high level because he hasnt really yet experienced it regardless of whether he deserves it or not the blood on the leg of Cooper flag here so they will attend to that thats the kind of game its been it was rough and tumble particularly in the first half and the officials were letting the guys play no doubt about that and that was certainly how it was to start the game I feel like the second half they started to call it a little tighter early which I think is brilliant from an officiating standpoint where you establish the way the rest of the Hats going to be called and then you let the guys play I think both teams have Applause adjusted is really all you can ask for I think its been consistent across the board we saw cam hild earlier like like he bleeded in five spots look like he had gone about 12 rounds yeah so itll be flag at the line 81 foul Applause shooter and again coming up big when it matters for the Duke Blue Devils you saw it earlier in the season he wanted the opportunity to be the guy I think where hes grown the most is hes understood now the responsibility of being the guy and hes lived up to it missed the second sixpoint game Johnson hild shredding the D going in strong lost the basketball and out it goes 324 and it was tipped by wait Forest so 324 to go duke ball he just lost it I mean sometimes you look for contact before the rim and that seems to be what he was doing in for flag they quickly double got out of that nicely James to fill some time and a foul with 237 you go back to Cooper flag getting the ball there hes obviously not going to be covered by a guard so hes likely going to be able to get open and then hes able to pass over the top to seon James who was on the other side out of the floor Salis with his first foul and Khan can nipple at the line the Freshman from Milwaukee makes Applause 89 andle the number 19 in the 2024 ES being top 100 class and made one wakes made only one field goal in the last 6 minutes iss another one on the dunk by Hunter Salis 164 again its Gillis to put it Applause in flag cutting knocked Away by hwith itll be Duke ball probably going to be easier for Duke to get the basketball in now that theyre set bad spot to be throwing it in is the advantage of having Cooper flag I mean just getting it in you need size Harris is going to be on flag right in front of the Wake bench and a timeout so Duke takes one with 162 on the clock leading 6156 not a bad one to talk about now given where youre inbounding the basketball I mean you you almost had this point have to get something set up just to get the ball in bounds you understand youre going to get fouled right away I like the drive by Hunter Salish too that that was purposeful it was meaningful its probably been there more than he realizes didnt really will his way to the basket going to go back to what this Wake Forest team did to start the second half though we talk about Duke coming out the second half and just blowing the doors off teams they were not able to do it because this we team fought they didnt have a lot going in the first half they struggled to score but defensively they really bought in they locked down playing without Cam hildr Harris was terrific kind of set the tone for how the whole second half was going to be played Duke has never really been able to find it offensively but theyve been able to make enough plays to have the lead they have W forest was down as many as 13 coming out of the break and and youre absolutely right they didnt Fold It Up in fact they roared from behind to grab the lead on a 234 run were giving away again and 13 felt like 23 in your typical game I mean neither team really was lightting it up on the offensive end so 13 points felt like a pretty significant deficit but they just chipped away and again it started with what they did defensively again you may have an idea coming into a season again nil portal all these things theyre theyre just changing in the game that you have to adapt to as a coach so you assemble a team thinking youre going to play a certain way but when the games get played youve got to figure out how to manipulate wins and Steve Forbes has done just that now one of the keys on these plays from that particular part in the floor is you know giving enough room youre saying the bench isnt going to give up some space I dont think so sure would Ted Valentine made sure he had a little bit more Gillis trying to get it in play still looking still looking and flag with a catch and finally they Converge on him and hwood commits the foul 3 seconds came off the clock there so 6156 and Duke to shoot just want to remind people though that usually the outlet guy which is your last option that you throw the ball up to and trust him to go get its not the guy you wanted shoot shoot your free throws thats an advantage you have with with flag on the floor he has fouled out he had a tough afternoon here did not play all that much in the end he sat a huge part of the first half in file trouble so when you look back on this if Wake fores cant rally and pull one out thats going to be a big factor in why they didnt win the game its a big factor but but you still have to look at Harris and say like does Harris do what he did in terms of the physicality in the fight if has a better game and is on the floor for the the typical minutes he play yeah Harris played 27 minutes 14 points for him thats a guy who was averaging 6 points game coming in its really its always the intangible things when youre playing a superior team and its okay to say that dke is a superior team to arguably almost anybody in the country so flag back to the line and sinks number one to make it 6256 hell have another with 132 seconds and think in that Duke huddle youre talking about is you know we get the ball in bounds make free throws were not fouling guys we got to be cautious not to foul make him change directions slow him down as best as possible youre going to pick up a little bit here 34 Applause Court flag with 24 7 rebounds and six Applause assists Harris gave it up he lost it and thats the game Duke will win this one against Wake Forest on the road and that is 13 team consecutive wins for the number two team in the country Duke wins at 6356 think of here Duke yeah there theres some things to be frustrated about
