they beat Arkansas came back the other night with as good an effort as Hubert Daviss thirdd team has put on the calendar this year and Carolinas got it to start the ball game and here is the freshman kodo and a whistle and foul off the ball itll be on Jaylen Worley itll be his first and the First on Florida State and Coach you see immediately Florida State we know they want to switch everything one through five so when you switch off against Armando Bott that puts your guard in a tough position real tough to get down inside hes a tremendous rebounder thats what he does best gets in there hes got a mismatch and hes got a bucket hey wait a minute you forecasting stuff already you justed this you cant be better at this job than I am early lucky guess Florida State plays without Cam Corin today by the way second ball game that the 610 sophomore from Texas has been on the bench for Leonard Hamilton with a toe injury so instead Deontay green is out there to start the ball game for the simal in the front Court WD Deonte green 14 to9 his first start a great defensive stand by Carolina on this possession Worley forces it up with a clock running down Watkins the offensive rebound and the stick back for the no and the same thing happened here mismatch offensive rebound yeah when you switch out you got those bars down its hard to get on that glass but they they they CAU off to a great start here early two buckets for him getting involved early Worley this is Deonte green with jir Watkins who Cory spoke of and the dangerous Darren Green Jr all away to and Ryan the long rebound Carolina goes with the three guard lineup today Kau Davis and here is the noted a transfer cormack Ryan whistle for the travel they call that travel every time and and I still am not sure it is but you know my day was great till I came out here and saw the three reps yeah I was really happy because you werent coaching and then I realized Im not coaching so its okay I think they also had a sense of relief Court when they saw the bay was over here with us this is true yeah turnover by Ryan on the drive great crew we have on hand Roger s Tony Henderson Justin pfield here today yep big game three ball green and Davis clears for the Tar Hill Carolina had great success in transition the other night against one of the nations best defensive teams in Tennessee Davis a deep three one and done the tarel see the attention that Florida States giving amondo Bott win the shot goes up trying to keep him off the glass Watkins rattled out on the triple quick look Davis on the drive bounces through through Ryan tees one Applause up hes a streaky guy when he gets going he makes them all when he misses a couple he struggles sometimes angram defending green and the short jumper bounced away good looks both ways here in the first two and 12 minutes heres Harrison Ingram the Sanford transfer who has been terrific for Carolina Davis pushed it up with the right hand RJ Davis is Carolinas leading score sixth best in the ACC he just looks so comfortable this year he knows exactly what hes going to do and uh another veteran coach youve known RJ Davis of course since his time playing for the New York renss when he was a teammate with Jonathan kaminga hes always been a score and thats what weve seen a lot from him as a plate for North Carolina yeah and he knows now last year was kind of back and forth they didnt know what they were who was going to score himmer love now hes the guy thats going to score yeah hes the guy 27 points per game over his last three games and he has been spectacular and you know when B when the big guys get off to a good start they work much harder why is that why is that youve had some pretty good big guys coach I think you might have to educate us on why that is yeah here is Watkins against cormack Ryan and now green with four to shoot kick out three ball thats Baba Miller the sophomore from mayorca in Spain and Baba can absolutely do that but one of the things that when youre Florida State and you score it allows you to set up that pressure and they want to be able to pressure North Carolina 94 ft as much as possible last pass Bott the turn and now heres Deontay green Watkins firing through traffic draws the contact and scores the basket terrific move jir Watkins this for early and then deflects the ball into the bench Florida state looks completely different than they looked in the Georgia game even though they got the lead in the Georgia game they look a different team tonight its just college basketball great coach they played at home in that game but theres a lot of guys from the Florida State roster that are feel right at home here in the dean E Smith Center including this gentleman Le which moves from right down the road at the gas House Gastonia North Carolina but six members of the Florida State program Hill from the state of North Carolina and they brought uh Cameron Fletcher on the floor and theres a three ball by Davis hes got five thats his 18th three of the year so wholesale change for Florida State Chandler Jackson wearing zero Jaylen gainy 33 Cameron Fletcher the UK transfer at 21 on the floor out here in the middle as you see Watkins to work oh and gainy I think got a hand on that Im not sure if that was a pass or a shot that got directed in coach Im a guard youre a guard its always a pass they gave it to gaining his first field goal of the Year Ingrams three is short were tied at nine this games got a lot of tempo too here at least early right it absolutely does but when you play against North Carolina its always going to be tempo as simply can you get back set that transition defense and stopped him from scoring easy Jackson mused down B blocked it from behind heres RJ in transition hes so comfortable this year hes just coming down and looking for a shot hes not thinking about the other guy or this guy and hes taking a shot early end in play for Carolina now Fletcher kany at 18 ft here is kdo 10 assists no turnovers the other night against the ball Falls left corner triple Ryan and Leonard Hamilton has been in this building enough to know you got to try and avoid these we return in defense and the offense North Carolina off the block shot from Armando Bott getting the ball into the hot hand L official grer of the Atlantic Coast Conference and of course Wednesday night is here in North Carolina beat number 10 Tennessee to92 part of the ACC SEC challenge presented by Continental Tire tar Hills were 46 from the floor and hit 12 threes gentlemen and scoring a lot of points and then playing getting some stops in the last three minutes when Tennessee was trying to make a run coach well Tennessee made a nice run at the end I mean they really did uh but this team Carolina can shoot the ball this is a and they caught inside is gets them some of those open shots camon Fletcher with Chandler Jackson we get our first look at Josh nickelberry off the Florida state bench he joins jie and Watkins on the floor for Leonard Hamilton Jaylen Washington has replaced Bott and Jaylen Withers has also come on to the floor for the first time for Hubert Daviss Club eight to shoot Watkins a three seven for jir Watkins for and hes gotten off to a great start the sunshine MVP last week for Florida State ACC coplayer of the week alongside the gentlemen with the basketball in his hand RJ Davis both these guys playing very well to start this game and coming off a great week Jay Watkins was productive the other night 8 minutes seven points three rebounds against Tennessee bounce pass for Washington with the right hands 14 of 15 for the floor this year coach I mean theyre play both teams are playing high level and to start a game this is a high level game which for this time of the year is nice to see first conference game coach how do you feel about these December conference game you like seeing never liked them never would tried everything I could to not playing even when we won the games I didnt like them thats thats how bad heres Ryan a three and the rebound for Ingram Caroline up four Harrison Ingram boy good post defense that time gain and Watkins both there for the N we talk about the early conference start this is 32 years removed from when Florida State came into this building and won their first ever ACC game yep against the North Carolina Tar Hills in 1991 December 15th 9991 yep were days away from the anniversary of Sam Cassel huh was it wine and cheese or was it cheese and wine which wine and cheese it was wine and cheese you sure and Chandler Jackson has hit his fourth three of the year thats back to back triples by The nulls Who take a twopoint Edge 186 these NOS playing like those NOS from 32 years ago to start this game a team averaging just less than 8 threes has got half that number here in the first almost 8 minutes Cory and a turnover force on an entry pass for 17 turnovers a game thats Florida State style and were talking about their playing their style of play much more as it looks nickelberry out of the corner the rebound inside thats Fletcher head blocked by Music Washington Davis for Ingram standing three Withers the rebound Ryan tried to fire it there Washington turned it over Florida State Cory you mentioned they also lead the league in steals too 10 steals a game and thats one of the things you know youre going to deal with when you play against a Leonard Hamilton coach team theyre going to pressure you theyre going to be in passing Lane theyre going to make it difficult for you to run your offense you got to have guys that can make individual plays to beat them you know what you look at this the timeout you know sometimes you wonder about timeouts 149 and look at it now yeah and theres Withers fouled gaining committing the foul first on jayen gainy second on Florida State brings us to a break they talk about defense travels well clearly for the simino so does their shooting jir Watkins stepping up and knocking down a three feeling good about things here in Chapel Hill Chandler Jackson doing the same giving the NOS a twopoint lead to coach you mentioned he had the early timeout with about 14 and a half to go he called that timeout people say why do you call the timeout you were talking about it because it its worked for Florida State it works you know John woodens the greatest coach I ever know but he said the coach that takes the first timeout is going to lose the game and he never took the first time out and Dean Smith never took the first timeout and Roy didnt they you know they wanted their team to play out of it but it works and it certainly worked this time cuz its 92 since that time out hey coach when you think about that does that change for you when youre on the road versus when youre at home I dont think so I think you got to that was a a bad stretch and you know I think that was the the right time out they dont always work but when it works its its pretty effective obviously pretty good yeah far to they keyed it up from the perimeter hit three threes two up for Watkins one for Jackson now Leonard Hamilton gone back to his original starters on the floor with the exception of nickelberry whos still in the game in Carolina forces a turnover here it trembles on the floor for the first time along with Paxton woic for Coach Daviss Applause Music team back for RJ Davis against Baba Miller my goodness skip for woi trying to beat whle off the dribble bot the backside rebound and were going to go foul oh theyre going to score it I need to look at that one theyre going to score the basket theyll score it now but during the timeout theyll go over and check to see if that was the right call on that thats one of the new rules this year in NCAA basketball as you see wji driving bacock gets the offensive rebound as he goes up oh he and in the net and in the net b gets heres another turnover with roic to Davis little scoop and score once again transition defense always important when youre playing against North Carolina theyre the one team that consistently runs off of makes and misses one things for certain you got to get back in set your defense green by the way the nos leading score is scoreless here in the first nearly 10 minutes Worley on the drive nice move Jaylen warley the Junior from Philadelphia averages less than seven an aggressive move by warley getting into the painted area and being able to finish him thats where we talk about the advantage sies wise if fla State their guards go 65 across the board we know coach ham doesnt nor me play small guard sumers just somebody sitting to my right who did it for 47 years heres Baba Miller off the long rebound and heels get the Basket in transition five for the sophomore from Spain Cory whos only got one double figure game this year for Florida State the NOS are back in front but a lot a lot of prise for Baba Miller and this you see his skill this is a young man whos Clos to 7 ft tall but has the ability to handle the basketball weve seen him knock down a threepoint field goal already but to be able to get in passing lanes and turn defense into offense thats the Florida to State way fifth lead change already in this first half Jim we talked about this morning one thing Leonard Hamilton didnt have last year he had has now his dep he can make all these Subs well hes hes been had guys hurt for two years almost three and he he needs 10 guy its what he plays thats how he plays Pau w a lefthanded three he aimed it rebound for Fletcher heres Florida State again attacking NOS not showing any mental scars of the lost to Georgia the other night here early yeah having a short memory is important in this game and theyve absolutely shown that here today no hangover Watkins from the parking lot and Bot able to save it for w now let me tell you what that is thats a rebound that that is no that is a guy who likes those rebounding numbers bot gets over there and stays in bounds to save that get the rebound in comparison to just letting it go out of bound hes getting the rebound hes already at the top of the list hes at number one yeah and you know whats so best the best thing about that hes at number one and he did it in four years which means I dont have to put the aich beside it thats right like Im doing a lot of these records that are being broken today Armando Carolina turns it over with Ingram botts already got six rebounds by the way playing today in his 140th career game in Chapel Hill and I dont mind that at all love the fact that he loves this University that much to where hes stuck around for now a fifth season to be here all right we get a timeout Florida state had a hard time getting the ball in bounds we get a break in Chapel Hill Carolina had 61 points with seven threes on Wednesday night in the first half 21 points just two threes One belongs to Ryan the other belongs to RJ Davis here in this first half Florida state with a twopoint lead had to burn the timeout when they struggled to get the ball in bounds but easily that time the Deontay green Chandler Jackson who was part of that run they gave him the leite out of that first time outs come back on the floor now for Coach Hamilton coach and West both coach Hamilton talked to us earlier today about the fact that this Carolina team a season ago didnt shoot well oh Fletcher but they made fre against them tremble on the ground yeah I tell you the game in the in the block shots and the well thats where Carolina goes I mean they run a lot on anything but when they get that theyre theyre getting a bucket at the other end and they feed off of that energy getting out into transition especially off of a strong block shot by amondo Bott on that possession Watkins B slapped it away momentarily 12 to shoot heres Fletcher against Ingram nice job by is loose Harrison Ingram and thats Elliot Kad you dont even see it but he made a heck not only got the ball but he got it out most guys are diving and stopping he gets it out those two guys could do and Ingram are truly the difference makers for this North Carolina team from what they had in the past a foul on Carolina and well get a break here M Cory transition chances but you see Ingram with the great hands as coach mentioned Kad getting on the floor getting it back to Ingram these two guys have been difference makers for the heels early this Music season well you see weve had a score change in Chapel Hill 2322 North Carolina up one not three great to be record Alexander and Jim bam weve also had a seminal moment here because coach baham got that right the goal tending that was called has now been taken away it was such an easy call and Roger acts like you know its the only call I ever got right I mean that was that was an easy call come on Roger comes over and you and Roger have a little repar so to speak Cory what do we go through there he said that he was happy once he saw the officials that he was not coaching yeah Im not sure the officials were happy to see him over here line well anyway when he goes home hell see that on his TV and hell hell text me I guarantee you Worley and Florida State down one heres the mismatch again with bacock and Jaylen strong to the basket Ingram in there fighting look at the scrap here on the floor Bott grabbed it and got the timeout called according to Tony Henderson so Carolina going to get the ball up one Hubert Davis is Wednesday night we got a double header on the mens card for you on acc Network Steve Forbes and wake foris welcome ruers to the Joel Coliseum at 600 and then the basketball version of the paleto cup Cory remember South Carolina won a tight game early last year in Columbia against Clemson Tigers who play at pit tomorrow welcome the Gamecock 800 Eastern Wednesday night on acc Network and the ESPN at ACC off to a terrific start nonconference wise like a winning percentage of 72 biggest win in the ACC the inaugural ACC SEC challenge at Alabama Brad Brownell and the Clon Tigers going to on the road to Alabama and getting a win and a little kid named Joe Gerard made a few bucks down the stretch have you met that guy before coach no I Ive seen him someplace hes pretty good heres Davis five to shoot for Carolina heres Ingram now working on Fletcher long two off the rim Bop tap follow no good heres Florida State now chance to take the lead Applause again tremble with Davis cormack Ryan Ingram and Bott now and well the professional that you are I know you mentioned the fact that Elliot cell picked up his second foul and thats something thats been different for this Carolina team the offense has not run as smoothly without Theo on the floor two to shoot heres Darren Green Jr airball I would say that that could have been a 5sec count but Im not sure that these guys can count that high so Im not sure Im just not sure okay got it maybe hey coach theres been so much love between you and the officials with you over on this side theyre coming over talking to you and every time out thats cuz they got me so mad the last few years that theyre trying they feel bad feel sorry for me either that they know the holidays are coming and that kind of thing by the way Carolinas done a terrific job on Darren Green early they really have heres Ryan now for bot up inside against traffic tremble interior passing and Bot foul good passing good movement this team shares the ball they move it around they find somebody SE Trumble attacking the paint drops it off but thats a nice pass by Ingram along the Baseline really looking away passing with that left Ed and you dont get an assist yeah heres Bott first to two his free throw shooting is really improved and its good five now for Amando dont forget weve got you covered for tonights ACC football championship in Charlotte between Louisville and Florida State ACC huddle Kelsey Rigs and the crew get you started at 600 Command Center coverage on acc Network during the game at 1130 ACC huddle on Championship Night from Charlotte caps a busy busy day in the Queen City here on ACDC Network in the ESP and now I never understood you get a great pass guy gets fouled should be an assist should get an assist now if they make one of the free throws you feel like it should be an assist for the guy that makes that pass yeah absolutely my numbers would have been way up coach if make that I dont remember you passing theres Watkins knocking down another first half three hes got 13 beams falling right in line oh yes Florida state is tied it at 25 now all the way on the drive too strong here come the nulls trying to create an advantage and Bott slow to return to the break because think he took a hand of the eye somewhere Miller last Touch by the no so here is the rerack a moment ago Cory amondo Bott getting a little thrown off balance on that one by Watkins and Watkins steps back and knocks down to three thats one WD we might see you a sports center later on and you know of course thats my young fellow when we start talking too B so Im not going to say much about it thats what happens when you get the big switch down to the small and get into those situations theyre going to happen yeah thats what should happen again when you got when you got a guard that can make plays against off the bound when you switch a five out there on them you really should go at those guys and theyre check amondo out looks as though he may have taken a shot on that last possession on the offensive end of the floor yeah Doug Halverson is the longtime Carolina trainer having a look at Armando and is a coach you just dont you dont want to come out you want him in the game so coach when youve got a player especially your star player that gets hurt and he comes out the game and sits down do you even go check on him or do what how do you handle that yeah I mean yeah I mean I if hes hurt a little bit and you got to know your players some guys just pretend like theyre hurt you just keep the trainer back and the guy hell be all right some guys get hurt then we get them out we talk to him and you know its a trainer decision not a coaching decision when when youre ready come back Pon looks to be okay now trying to litigate for the return Carolina up two after RJ Davis got a couple at the line and theres the drive and answer for Baba Miller seven first half points from filler and a little back court pressure here nickel Barry in the back court against RJ Davis but you see Baba Miller going 94 ft for that layup seven Footers arent used to guarding guys that can handle the basketball and make plays for themselves off of a rebound Ryan on the drive hallway oh tap home Washington just his second Miss of the Year from the floor by the way for Jaylen Washington Zen High got stripped up it on the back and then we get Jackson through traffic and Roger a is a trip and the foul will be ticketed its on Washington thats thats one of those calls that you know you look at that one I just dont think so well I know why you dont think so because he tripped over his teammates but that time Jackson tripping over Deontay green and the worst thing ever created for an official is the Mega jumbotrons that they have here in Chapel Hill because everyone in the Carolina blue gets an opportunity to see that and in live action Florida State and Carolina tied at 27 we go inside 4 minutes to play leading score for the NOS has been very quiet in this first half thats Darren Green Jr from Charlotte heres Jackson B Block it Zaden High the Freshman on the floor long three from Miller Missed badly and were going to get a foul called on Florida State and thatll get us to a timeout tied at 27 in Chapel Hill changing research that saves lives you can join the fight by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research and WD one of the things of course whenever I walk into this building I normally see this mountain of a man I walk over to him and say hey little fella how we doing today and that little fell happens to be 7 one and my guy Eric Montrose I want you to know that we are all praying for you in this fight and I know you will win yep every step of the way who love you big grits huh yes hey little fella he turns around looks at me he knows who it is yeah yep were all pulling for double O Carolina out of the timeout now during that break Deontay green picked up his second he stays on the floor though for Coach Hamilton here as we go inside three and a half to play and look who else is back on the floor coach number two in white they needed him they havent scored P attacks oh nicely off the window and in he can score when he makes his mind up hes a pass first but he can score a little bit like Jimmy black was here a long time ago that was that long ago way to guess I though that was 40 years ago that was that was a long time ago oh 21 Jimmy black you can go somebody more 82 National Champion yeah yeah we talking 40 years ago that was definitely a while ago WD follow away three green on the board for Florida State see you talked him right into that shot BS by one first points for Darren Green Jr only two seconds on the shot clock GRE recognizing that gets up a almost a rush look but when you shoot as well as he does youll take those opportunities heres bot rolling on beon gra theyre going to call offensive foul first on arando bot its the fourth on Carolina you dip the shoulder they call doesnt matter whether he head position or not thats thats what he is you see bot driving that shoulder that right shoulder po mention and a little nomination for the Academy Award as well another one of the numbers is significant in WD of course Im getting my lesson over here as soon as we get our stat sheets coach points out the fact that Florida State has yet to shoot a free throw in this game and he looks of course also at the points off turnovers which are all in favor of North Carolina turnovers are the only reason its different six easy points theres Baba Miller on a turnover for Florida State dont forget tomorrow night our ACC huddle selection Day special its a twohour show breakdown and Analysis of the accs Bold bound teams and their matchups Kelsey Riggs with EJ Manuel Eric mlan Eddie royland starts at 6 Eastern on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN hardest working person in the industry Kelsey rigs is everywhere coach be Im going to get to go hang out with Kelsey R yeah be good to work with somebody with Talent foul on Bott and Applause green and thatll be the second on Bott you know when you dont come to Syracuse I cant be nice to you all the time green gets around comes up with the steal and Bai gets a foul on this one oh theres theres the foul the left arm push and again its not going to be a popular call here but its the right call as bam does push off with that left go a onepoint lead for Florida State 100 seconds to go in the first half by the way coach green to three hes hes got it now Daron green Jr fifth best threepoint shooter in the ACC averaging 145 a game has got six in a row for the no WD this young man is 28 per game for a career yep when you got a guy that walks on the Flor you know hes going to make three threes in that game throughout his entire career thats a special player Kau all the way through through Davis has been quiet for the Tar Heels Ryan launches too quick too quick rebound pulled away heres Watkins now against Ingram into traffic for Watkins you see Florida States got five more threes in just three more attempts than Carolina does from behind the line in this opening frame shots theres green to two L for gain and therell be a foul at The Rim on Washington same play as early in the game when he not he hes got it in the basket this time he got fou but when you think about a a great shooter like Darren Green coming off and having that look for Washington hes thinking thats going to be a shot hes not even thinking that thats going to be aive so hes just out of position on that one trying to stop gy from getting the easy dunp first free throw of the year for Jaylen gaining is good grew up in Greensboro North Carolina originally at Brown twotime ivy league defensive player of the year but a year ago September was lost for the season with an ACL injury a bad injury and played for the first time in his Florida State Career the other night against Georgia lons got guys healthy hes much better than last year 80 run by the NES the lead is six largest of the day for Florida State Davis Runner fell off the front of the rim and Florida State can hold for one if they choose here I think Jaylen Worley and the NOS are going to do just that Cory they absolutely are jayen Ws grown up as a point guard but you see this group for Florida State on the floor this is an experienced group and they have not come in scared hes building it off Davis has the assignment on him 5 Seconds Worley trying to get to the rim scoop and it fell off tap follow no good horn sounds Florida State going to take a Sixpoint lead to the locker room Carolina hit just one of their last eight and had a drought of better than 3 minutes to close this opening 20 minutes and when you look at it b i I say B four years Ive known him since he was in the seventh grade I called him B when I first started doing never my sister never told me his names Bon I said B and killed us I should have been nicer I should have said his name right but anyway he has what six points early whats he have now six correct and now Deontay Greens got his first point and Florida States got their biggest lead at eight and its too easy the struggle for North Carolina has been defending Florida State coach talk about the wide open threepoint field goals and then when you get an easy basket like that to start the second half H Davis cant be happy about that and kind of the Run continues its 10 now just the first for the no heres Darren Green who had the threes late in a half Ryan ahead for Ingram have a soft to that rolls off car heels are ice cold from the floor Cory but part of the reason why they went ice cold is because ellot kadoo picked up that second foul then deot got his second foul and all of a sudden two of your better offensive players are sitting r h y kep alive here Watkin green thats Darren green Jr he and Deontay no relation three ball from Baba Miller is good hes got double figures for the second time this year and hes looked extremely comfortable in this building comes in averaging 68 points per game but hes been a different player here folks this is a player they thought he was and hasnt been but when you look at Carolina right now Ingram is not a big time inside player and they have three guards out there two little guards two little guards and you think about Florida State off of the first possession coming out of the halftime you get an easy layup and then all of a sudden things are working well for you baba Miller steps up knocks down another three threepointer he actually made the first threepoint field goal for the semal here this afternoon and hes playing with a tremendous amount of confidence heres Harrison Ingram at 63 Carolina in the first half was just five for six this is what college best go is today youre great one night and you can turn around and just struggle and you cant its some of its portal four new guys but its its basically most teams are new Leonards got guys he didnt have healthy last year and you know Huberts got four new guys and it takes time ninepoint lead Carolinas first point to the second half on the free throws by Ingram the runner there a wild Miss from Watkins and here is dve for Ingram that was a lot of context on that shot RJ Davis throws it to the bench I think he thought cormack Ryan was on that side of the floor hell turn if the floor was spaced properly cormack Ryan would have been on that side of the floor theres no reason for two guys to be overloaded on this side you keep one shooter in each Corner especially when you got a big like vott to man the middle and you tell the guard with the ball look who youre throwing to if he have looked over there he wouldnt have seen anybody over there see Im trying to take up for the guard no no that one you cant I love I love guards how about Miller the little Runner and he got the bounce a dozen for Baba Miller coach mentioned it this is the guy that Leonard Hamilton told us Baba Miller was were seeing that here this afternoon havent seen it much this season thus far but hes very comfortable in his first time playing in Dem RJ Davis a three bounds away and he doesnt make baskets they are having big trouble storm yep 11point deficit bounce pass heres warley an open three and green out front Deonte Green in Florida State now and worked it to a 14point Advantage coach when we came on air we talked about the size Advantage F on the three hell get three free throws on Jaylen warley thats just a foul that will kill you as a coach they cant score and youre going to put a really good foul shooter on the foul line this canot do that we came on air talking about the size advantage of the Florida State guards as you see jayen warley stepping out and picking up that foul yeah foul all the way I mean you just dont you dont take that angle and you just dont foul the guy there theyre struggling to score and youre giving them three points you cant you know just especially on the road thats the accs best free throw shooter cormack Ryan Ive seen him make a about out of 90 out of 91 trust me oh your first ever announcers Jinx who did that me said he was the leading I said he was the lead but you said hes made 90 of them yeah but and he miss the next one how me missed thats on you youre the one that jinxed him Im going to go to court on that one the main guy here with all the experience third free throw is good so Ryan got two of the three hes got five but its still a 12point Florida State lead regardless of whether bayam or I the building needs to come alive for one thing its that one help probably a little surprised at the turn of events from the other night too Cory Im sure they are when you score 61 points in the first half of a game and you turn around and you get 29 the next half Im sure that many of the fans here are in Shock see that look at Angry thatll do it they hadent seen a 360 in the lane like that since Phil Ford Phil Ford of course in the building today coach beam he texted me to tell you that he still owes you one hes remembering 1975 oh yeah yeah you cant blame me I was only an assistant coach three ball Fletcher answers for the NOS C on Fletchers fifth three of the year as his first basket of the day and a huge response WD you know very well that cam Fletcher was fla States most consistent player a season too before he entered that ACL he had a double double 16 and 10 the last time he played in this building and a foul inside is going to be on gainy itll be his second its the third on Florida State so Harrison Ingram lights up the crowd and then Florida State finds a way to get an answer sure do a kick to Fletcher and a three NOS in front by 13 Florida State its 4835 with Cory Alexander Wester and the Hall of Famer of course Jim beheim with us now at ACC Network and ESPN all right every once in a while we do a thing around here called tail of the tape so this is what were going to do so Cory Alexander no season as a head coach none 47 for be NCAA titles I want to know who did the research on this coach beheim actually recruited my players so what do you mean zero Seasons as a head coach final fours two hall of fames for bam we still waiting on yours first Franklin Howard his point guard played for me what are we talking about here I got to call research on this k for Ingram who missed the three last Touch by Florida State it will stay with Carolina that sounds like my my wife did no she wouldnt put together something that favorable to me so it would have to be let me tell you what were not going to do were not going to talk about my favorite ban were not going to do that the problem is shes everybodys favorite beim thats the problem hi Julie hope all is well let me just say this shes battling with Buddy as my favorite beim but still at time they want to look at the shot clock here as it relates to the ball going out of bounds and missed by Ingram so well pause for that let me just say Im glad we produced The Tale of the tape I I I knew about that for a couple days I was delighted to see it happen and its wrong why are you glad about wrong production I have three seasons as a head coach all right who who who hang on Sumer Sumer basb coach coach listen coach listen listen coach is and you of all people understand the grind that isass summer basketball I had a guy that a eight points a game for me in the summer league in inil was aage 42 so theyre going back here to check on Ingram three and see if that hit the rim it doesnt look like it hit the rim its going to be a shot let me tell you what let me tell you this that making that call for Roger SS is Big because he does not like to touch his hair once it is done I know see see I made sure to let him know you do not like touching the hair once weve got the once the Paul Mitchells in we dont touch it Roger SS makes more trips to the scoring to our table than any other left in the country oh loves to come over here these guys are really good refs all three guys are good look hes checking on Cory hey we we got an understanding you know Roger normally comes out he tells me what his pregame outfit was never socks but I know but I always know which Paul Mitchell or which sty in heres Ryan for Ingram blocked and a foul called on Jackson look at that one I I give that one a 90 chance to be a block first on Chandler Jackson sophomore from Memphis who by the way I thought despite a tough season really grew as a basketball player but he bails out Tom house nor car Ryan Carolina bringing the full court pressure now down 13 as you mentioned earlier and trying to get at and see if they can force some turnovers which they were able to do in that possession but Ingram unable to take care of that first well the thing on that play they caught a a new player house comes in the game and gets pressed and track thats something you always worry about as a coach and hes not in the game right now hes not cup of coffee for house hell sit down with Jackson and Florida States got the original starters back out there Ingram second one is good on the road you cannot let a team get your pressure and get two or three turnovers right now you cant that that opens up the whole game Pau on the floor original starters out there for Coach Davis and Applause Carolina Applause warley and this is what we talked about earlier weve seen warley trying to post the smaller guards toward North Carolina into traffic runs it up with a right hand they CAU the rebound did a really nice job hes over match but he did a nice job Mak him take a touch yeah stayed physical in that possession not allowing Wy to be able to get his feet in the paint aros got 11 rebounds only six points heres the catch on the Block against Green up strong hell get the foul on Deontay green which will be his third its five on Florida State now you got five team fouls already on Florida State none for Carolina bot will go to the line here so Bott will get two and he thats maybe the second post touch hes got this half isnt it he just is not getting the ball down there whether hes not open or whether they dont see him first free free throw is good dont forget double header for you of ACC Hoops on Wednesday night ruter visits Winston Salem to see the Demon Deacons South Carolina Clemson at Little John 6 and 800 tip times on acc Network and the ESPN got to give a shout out to Steve Forbes and the W fors Demon Deacons also big win over Florida inaugural ACC SEC challenge which lived up to its billing 7 s time backourt pressure again Carolina to within 10 big small Miller leans and it fell off Music touch no basket for Florida State coach the Press is working here for Carolina you know you you have to do something you know whether it works or not is irrelevant you have to press and try to I mean they got a quick shot and missed it and so you get the ball back if you dont press they take 30 seconds and you dont get back in the game WD were talking to a man that I used to beg to press with how about this Davis guy almost got the n one but does draw the foul a couple of free throws for RJ Davis and its on Darren Green Jr itll be his first and six now in Florida State I go to Syracuse I go in and talk to my guy and say coach what you the Press is awesome why dont you press more we got seven guys and theyre going to get tired and theyre not going to be able to finish the game so we win thats the answer that I got all the time and and Hs in the situation which which I would do too this is where you press no momentum youre down a lot of points you got to make some things happen they may get a open jumper and miss it but you sp them up Speed the game up thats what youre trying to you may not even get a turnover but you may Speed the game up and have a chance to get back you cant get back in against Leonards team when youre 12 14 points down unless you do something to change the tempo game and and pro State doesnt really have a point guard either theyve got a lot of guys that can handle that but theyre not necessarily point guards out there hes really a shooting guard and the other guys are small forwards is on here coach this is a really good thing to do to press and Carolinas got some fouls to give so its not going to its not going to hurt him his M heres green Jr caught in the double team he dribbles away from it you have to throw it down the court no in the air caught by Jackson heres Miller ahead lob and a dunk Deontay green all seven of his points in the second half thats the other reason why you dont like pressing when they get by its two on one down 10 now with 14 to play Ryan a three ball they just they just cant make D they have to they have to two of 16 is Carolina from behind the line today and youre talking about a team that was smoking hot yep coming into this game scored 100 points First Tennessee Miller air ball one Ryan had it poked away terrific double team and Watkins will duck it down 15 for jir Watkins and just like that back to a 12point lead North Carolina has built some momentum with that pressure getting to the free throw line and scoring which allows him to set it up but when you turn the basketball over you dont have anybody to stop you in transition back to a 12point s old Advantage Ingram on the dribble Drive Ryan a three again that ones good Corman Bryans got two of Carolinas three threes today hes got eight Applause heres Darren Green tend to shoot aop trying to help on the switch three to shoot green launching from the front missed everything shot clock violation dead ball seals will make some substitutions withs back for Carolina you know you want to take time off but with 12 minutes to go its dangerous to take that time and not get the shot I like to do that a lot of people criticize that in coaching but I think you want youre saying that you were criticized well well just just by you no just by 20000 or so people some games Dr 30 that place always had 30 when you were on the sideline yeah but they didnt know I couldnt hear him so you know its sorry ninepoint lead for Florida State nickelberry on the floor Worleys back Jaylen Griffin and also Cameron Fletcher for Leonard Hamiltons team so four new faces heres Ryan teeing up another one and Withers tried to keep it alive but did to Fletcher NOS on the run and round knocked it away and its taken Davis and here is Trimble who will set it down lets just make it s now I watched Seth kmbl practice yesterday here they come roaring now down seven green a three ball heres Fletcher inside blocked by Music RS RJ Davis all the way to the basket the time my time coach its good timeout coming here 7 Run for the tar Hills to get to within five nickelberry W out front two strong basket Josh nickelberry first point big bucket by nickelberry another one the grad transfer to Florida State tremble all the way to the basket will draw the foul thats not a play that Seth tremble would have made a season Applause ago and now theyre in to end here Cory they absolutely are going both ends doing the job defensively Watkins getting out with the strong finish and on the other end of the floor RJ Davis not stopping for any defense and just the easy Music bu in terms of conference play in the AC see there are uh four other ball games uh Miami beat Notre Dame 62 to 49 today Cory the canes held the Irish is 29 from the floor in Charlottesville Isaac mcney 22 points hit 6 threes and it was 847 62 was the final against Syracuse thats usually what I lost to Lost down there when I went down there to about 20 Tony Ben just he has he can coach it he can coach the game and hes his team is better offensively this year too but Syracuse Were Young theyll bounce back tremble at the line and the developing story here you see Leonard Hamilton against the top 25 50 plus wins 57 NCAA record as an unranked team going in and beating ranked teams yeah added to that resume with to win over Colorado yep which is one of those wins the accs gotten in the last couple weeks it gets better as the year goes M sixpoint lead Trimble got one of two at the line its a sixpoint game better than 10 to go here in Chapel Hill Miller back out front heres nickelberry that is a deep three Off the Mark tapped around and in by Deontay green whos got nine but youve got the starting lineup out minus Kad on the floor which means Ingram is playing the four spot beon green has a size advantage over that one and he showed on that last possession getting that second chance point that was a big offensive rebound Eng just got no out of the way just got to get that rebound you forced the shot by the way a ball game also underway in Atlanta and theyve moved into the second half and Duke Trails Georgia Tech by nine jackets who beat Mississippi State the other night thats thats only a developing to worry for others because me sitting beside the basketball Almanac over here hes been telling me that score in every break my guy stays locked in on all basketball even when hes doing TV yeah Davis by the way missed the layup shock box was winding down on the Carolina possession he had to shoot it it is of note by the way a year ago home teams won 23ds of all the conference games that were played but 30 of conference games last year were five points or less but coach whats the difference when youre playing confence even if its in December whats the difference in playing the conference games in comparison to the nonconference you know I mean theres so much more at stake in your conference games that you just cant afford to get off to a bad start you know you just you just hate to do that you want to have your team ready and it takes all the nonconference games to get ready warley pushed it up rebound green and it bounced out for Ingram never a better example of that than we watched this Florida State team as bot should get an easy look and and mondo has secured his fourth double double of the year and the 72nd of his career thats nothing but acting right there you cant I I do not like to see Music that and Tony Henderson over having to conversation with DeAndre with Deontay green as Bott is able to finish and then as he walks off thats you you gave him an Academy Award earlier hes just got a second second nomination as the officials are going to go over and have a look at this just to make sure theres nothing extra crcular here now heres my question could there be a flop it has to be called on the floor correct I dont dont think that was a I wouldnt I wouldnt qualify that as a flop I think he gave a little fake at it but it its it was its close but for a flop it has to be called on the floor I believe for their for them to go over and determine that it was a flop I think I think they can go I think they can go cuz theyre talking to Florida State right now Deontay green by the way its his third foul um eighth team foul on Florida State Music thats no doubt a flop but I dont know I I wouldnt want that call yeah I I wouldnt want to call it either but I know that they do call the flops youre getting a a technical foul for those in college basketball today great officiating by our group Tony Henderson going over and having a conversation with Stan Jones but will be no extra on that so Bott at the free throw line with one to try to complete the threepoint play side note Armando only had one point Cory a year ago with eight rebounds in Carolinas win at Tallahassee he has averaged eight points and seven rebounds in his Tar Heel career against the Noles its been a tougher task for him than others when Le play theyve always had multiple big guys theyre not quite as big now as they have been but theyve always had multiple big guys to throw at him in WD I did that game and remember it very well and also sent the text afterwards what is wrong with you one point yeah fivepoint game had of nine to go and theres a foul on Washington on the perimeter bot came out by the way after the free third on Jaylen Washington just the second on Carolina here in the second half Florida state had commanded this league you see the career double doubles list Tim Duncan Ralph Samson Armando bot that is great company to be in however if he passes Tim on that as five years Ralph and Tim did it in four B by Miller three too strong those have gotten cold from behind the line theyve missed their last six threes Kad Davis shot fake skip back out front oh my goodness Ball moving for ingr off the iron and gainy touched it last fresh 20 for Carolina coach those are the type of plays we talked about earlier with the do of course he can take that three at the top of the key but he recognizes hes got a better shooter than Ingram in the corner hes going to pass has first point guard not that many of them anymore everybodys tell them to you got to score to be in the NBA so theyre not not too many guys like inam at 49 has missed all of his threes while theyre starting to key Carolina hes got 18 now this second three of the this and hu Davis going back to the pressure thats what got them back into the game and now theyre going to continue to try to speed Florida State up see if they can get to take a quick shot cut it down to two Jackson oh missed everything now the call that Davis tremble to an 80 run by the Tar Heels is locked it up at 56 and theres his fi by tremble oh he clutched he should have shot the first one he walk right into a three he gave up the drive and blocked out it will stay with Carolina with 18 to shoot the heels are rolling they got it back going here in front of a sea of Carolina blue and the faithful love it RJ Davis with the three and SE trle with the Applause two continues Tuesday night at 10 after the double header nothing but net breaks down the full day highlights analysis and more this young guy weve just brought on to the network out of the New York I think averaged like six points in his playing career now joins Luke hanock and Kelsea R but heres the thing hes not really a rookie in the early 8s he actually did radio sports festival the sports festival at Syracuse gu was play by play was whos that Mike too and you know who the star was on the womens team and the South team Kim Moi congrats to Kim Moi just getting her 700th win is that a leon barmore Louisiana Tech Kim Mony this the one holy cow that was the one she was a great player Ill tell you that right now with Luke hanock Kelsey 1000 following our basketball coverage nothing but net lot of pressure on on kelse and L this real we got going today pretty good I going to have to have a lot of caffeine to stay up that L Carolina trying to work it in bounds here tied at 56 the run is 251 since they Trail by 14 early in the second half and sometimes its just going to the Press they got maybe one or two turnovers but it changed the game and thats a great coaching move look Applause Music at thats what he does he wins games theres another one by Ingram Davis the turnover Bott RJ open and an offensive rebound and its and one Music WD 32 years ago the Florida state simol came into this building in their first ever ACC game and silenced this Dean Smith Center crowd the great Sam Cassel walked away and said I was expecting Rowdy we saw a wine and cheese Crow it there been no wine and cheese here in this second half as Ronda and Roy Look on and have watched a great comeback from the tar Hills here in the second half great coaching move I mean sometimes its just a simple thing but without the change you dont get back in this game Jim in some ways details game today Leonard Hamilton team sparked by early timeout Hubert Daviss team sparked by press absolutely coaching does matter without any question not probably as much as some of the refereeing but coaching does matter Ive got Freddy ker is over here keeping a tab right now its B four official zero and I love these reps theyre good theyre good R the timeline no no call there on Watkins no never going Jackson the runner knows now have got to have a bucket and they come up empty get the re hes going all the way thats what thats what he does he saw that right here just over half saw the whole thing and another turnover daring green Jr went down hes up and able to walk off here but Carolinas roared to a npoint lead and Ingram is inside gets the bucket and the foul and kadoo sees the lane like hes not a freshman the way he plays sometimes and then another mistake pressure leads to the run and Flor State got out of everything that they were doing down here because of the pressure and Im not sure North Carolina has a great pressing team but Florida State doesnt have a real point guard either Cory been nice working with you yeah thanks I guess Ill let go back to put Cory in clearly is done here theres another almost another one yep and now here is Watkins through the lane and they got a foul called on Florida State warley I think knocked tremble Down Under the basket but at practice yesterday Huber Davis told us he loves having at least two point guards on the floor and at times as bacock comes up with his fifth block shot of the game but at times throughout this run hes actually had three point guards on the floor youve got Kad youve got Davis and youve got tremble to the alternative as coach mentioned not a true traditional point guard on the floor for Florida State thats been the difference couple of notes Here tremble to the line first of two that was 10 on Florida State with 6 minutes to go Carolina hitting almost 77 as a team coming in theyre now 18 of 22 today was that did did he fouled both guys on that play We is Carolina getting four he pushed both guys nine for tremble off Hubert Daviss bench and and Pau almost stole that but its almost as though there are no openings for Florida State theyre having a problem getting the basketball in bounds and of course you know the old adct pressure can make diamonds or it can bust pipes and right now this ship is sinking for the seols right now they got the buckets out trying to get water out of the boat they cant find an open player to throw the basketball to Triple will come out I think Seth might have taken a bit of a fall underneath the basket down to our right Jim real quick here Carolinas just put four guys in the back court are they doing anything in particular to force the pressure no but again you got to understand Florida state does not have a point guard and thats its just they got a lot of big kind of big guys big forwards theyre a pressable team but the same thing happened on this court the other night to North Carolina Tennesse came back in the game almost right heres Miller backing down Pau turn and cant finish it the tap is good foul late call foul is going to be on kodo before the tap followed by Watkins so Elliot kadoo is going to draw his third most importantly for Carolina thats just his first of the second half he had two early in the ball game Miss time in that first half with two fouls had to sit down and thats when North Carolinas offense stalled significantly with could go on the bench Baba Miller by the Ways got his second double figure game of the of the year he had 11 early this season against Central Michigan softball from Spain misses Florida States first free throw of the second half for 549 to go when things go bad they go bad everything goes the under run and there are cookies available if this goes passing the rad some places give you bacon here they give you cookies to be chicken what happened they made a switch you never know the corporate dollar speaks Cory yeah this is facts here is Ryan tried to skip it back did through traffic to K they have no ey eating cookies or Fred chicken now anyway so were not going to tap in and Im hungry heres warley all the way through back for green and blocked by bacon I said six blocks or seven I dont know look at this Davis for Music Applause the 13 for amondo to go with 13 Applause rebounds 21 nothing run for Carolina and a timeout asked for by Leonard Hamilton this is what its so difficult when youre a coach you great job for what 28 30 minutes almost and then it just goes out the window and you work on coaching press and against press all the time coach I coached your last game here it was a big Monday Co Wier goes off with 39 he is crushing as you just mentioned 39 minutes of the game you got were awesome we made two bad plays at the end and they made a long three and you lose an overtime thats thats what happens especially on the road uh you know if youre home and you get that lead it usually doesnt go away but Jim were still early in this year you were talking about these conference games maybe they are too early but you still got to play them you also have to recover if youre Leonard Hamilton you had a big lead second half the other night against Georgia youve given that one back and you lose by two on a shot of the horn now youve given a big road lead back in the second no these are things at the end of the year when youre a bubble team which Ive been in that spot you dont you cant lose some games and you know the years we were always on the bubble we didnt we lost games but we didnt really lose those one or two that would get you out and when youre in the bubble you need a rose wins thats what the committee looks at everybody should know that but I dont know what they do but they look at that when theyre in the last stages who did you beat on the road yeah WD I have sat and talked with Coach beheim right time and time again and he tells me this team is going to get in this team is not going to get in this said we go over it and so then I will I will look at the selection show and see who all gets in and Im like coach told me that that is another one of his great expertises he can do that break that down as well as anyone thats cuz were on the bubble all the time I had to figure it out out of the Florida State timeout now down 13 Carolina 21 nothing run and the last four and change that got blocked the fleed away for go and theres a Florida State foul and Fletchers gone down and this is my goodness Cameron Fletchers down below the basket and grabbing the right knee that still has the brace around it oh my goodness yeah dont Fletcher is down so theyre out to tend to Cameron Fletcher and a young man who played just 10 games a year ago before an ACL injury ended his campaign unfortunately has gone down again here below the basket and just hey bar Barry heartbreaking scene and theyve waved Doug halberton North Carolinas basketball trainer down to Aid here Fletcher theyre going to tend to Cameron Fletcher and the young man from St Louis who transferred from Kentucky is still down we break from Chapel Hill were back in a moment moment ago your heart just sinks here Cory for Cameron Fletcher you absolutely do I mean of course go way back with this young man out of vashan high school in St Louis played for my guy Tony irons who and just spent a lot of time talking with him throughout the process of rehabing his ACL over the last year which he tore at Virginia and just seeing him clutch at that right knee well pray for for the best yep hope for the best with Cam that its not going to be anything long term but this is a tough young man and to see him react like that its heartbreaking for everybody yep F was on green by the way and that gets Kad at the line here at the other end guys fourth on Deontay green Elliot CAU just a 56 free throw shoter this is the Music first and hell H the back in seven now for Kad whos rebounded nicely after a tough first half for foul trouble he he really has but again and his impact on this game is not as scoring its getting everyone in the right place delivering the basketball and more importantly taking that pressure off RJ Davis to have to be a playmaker and being a allow him to just go be a score Deonte green on the drive Ryan hit with his first foul fourth on Carolina and thatll send Deontay Green from Asheville to the free throw line Cory this will be of no use to you and I but deontre Greens dad is a chef that free throw is good quick reminder to you well tile this together that ACC college basketball is presented by Foodline official grocery of the ACC yeah food line of P grocer of the ACC does not help our calls either green got one of the two knocked out of bounds by Florida State and WD is actually the three of us you and I have broken on our weight loss Journey coach beim coach beheim got upset at my favorite beim Julie the other day because she didnt tell him the scale was broken he thought he gained 8 pounds I was in I was in bad shape for two days back Ryan I think she actually fixed it that way calls that time out I might not be going home tonight either I might be going to your house Cory thats okay you come hang with me all right dont forget weve got coverage coming up from Charlotte the ACC championship game tonight at Bank of the ER Stadium boy Jeff Brown done a marvelous job in his first year at his Alma moer at Louisville and they meet Florida State number four the NOS playing for a chance at the CF youll get Command Center coverage at 800 after the ACC huddle gets you ready then post game which is always one of the great nights in our networkss coverage of the Atlantic Coast Conference live from inside Bank of the America Stadium follows the championship game tonight on acc Network and streaming on the ESPN app okay who do you like tonight Florida State Louisville I love the ACC which means that I got to go with the nose based upon the fact that I want to make sure that the ACC has representation in college football playoff yeah I want to make it difficult for the committee to to try to keep an undefeated team out if something happens in the other team good call this is a tough year yep they need the 12 teams tournament which we could have had probably like several years ago well save that for the next show yeah okay good put that on the list nil and portal portal absolutely time if you promise we get to roll through this again well cover all that coach heres Davis inside bot with a right hand Ingram went for the Finish got it back and then got it blocked again tough Rim work by Florida State on defense and the game that weve seen with the runs this game is not over especially when youve got a guy like Darren Green Jr who can shoot the basketball that well this is a 10point game 348 remaining is a lot of time in a college basketball game first basket for Florida State in almost 7 minutes from the floor they probably need to try to Trap full court a little bit because 10 points 3 minutes you got to do you got to do something and never underestimate having a fallen teammate no way and how that can Inspire this group we watched Cameron fer go down and his team huddle around them and Im sure in that huddle someone says we can get this one for you Cam and Darren Green stepping up knocking down a huge three right there to make this a 10point game seven to shoot and that ball got knocked away heres Worley with Davis trailing and Jaylen Worley sets it down two hand dunk off the turnover Carolina was in a shot clock situation and turned it over Worley finishes in Applause transition a 305 to go in an eightpoint game one more play away from getting back into this game just one more one stop and a bucket then you got to think about it bot heres Ingram and thatll be a foul on Worley and thats going to be his Applause fifth Jaylen Wy getting out into the passing Lane things we talked about early in this game Florida State at 102 steals per game leaves the ACC they score off of their defense they need that to be successful and a nice play by warley to be able to come up with that one and get two in transition so Jaylen Worley fouls out for the first time dont forget coming up on acc Network NC State at 42 how about Boston College who put the wood on Vanderbilt the other night Nashville John meter Perell Malcolm hucke standing by for our coverage there Boston College looking forward to seeing them Ill see them 8 days from now in New York in Brooklyn they go up against a guy that my man to the right hired on his wedding day they play St Johns when go back to thats another story we got to tell how great H we went on the road and got two all Americans so whats more important your wedding anniversary your honeymooner is getting two great players and you say coach patinos wife still holds that against you you correct shes almost forgiv me not quite one of two for Ingram the lead is nine heres Johnson and the NOS Watkins R played over the screen that time Carolina not switching now Jackson theres a hand check out in the mid Court a and thats going to be on RJ Davis itll be his first five now on Carolina so Florida State still two away from free throw but if youre Florida State you dont have to play to get threes if if North Carolina is going to give you that much pressure on the threepoint line take those easy buckets and then set up your pressure but Jim do you want to switch one through five like Carolina St at this game if youre well right now they got a trap they cant just play they got to score and then they got a trap theres no way to get back into it with true something n not not in a row shot clock at 10 for Jackson Jackson rmed out but thats why you want to attack the paint not only to be able to try to get easy looks inside the painted area but more importantly get free throws and set up your pressure now you see Florida State as coach mentioned they have an opportunity if you make that second free throw to be able to set up their pressure and see if they can force a quick shot or get a turnover from Carolina and as a coach youre always talking to the officials like theyre in the double bonus and we havent even got to the bonus and officials know that they know what the the total is they dont always admit it but they know it George teack up to 445 to go in Atlanta Chandler Jackson missed the first hit the second for his first free throw four points for the Memphis sophomore its an eightpoint game at 7163 heres the Florida state press you almost have to double team there because of the clock the score and the clock Davis looking for Bott on the bouns look at the triple team and taken away by Miller now Watkins Ryan couldnt pick it heres jir Watkins in transition hes got 17 and now Florida State to within six under two to play and Watkins trying to get his teammates up the floor to apply more pressure to the guards of North Carolina Ali kadoo with 145 to play Applause shot clocked at eight heres Ryan thought about the three kick back for Davis all Music alone 12 and a half and 23 in the game for RJ Davis hes the guy this Applause year on the drive theres Deontay green hes got 13 following the 14 and N he had the other night against Georgia Cory and now youre going to see FL State have to find a way to speed up North Carolina they cant just allow them to use this shot CL way this might help and youve got the number one and number two free throw shooters in the ACC handling the ball Ryan and Davis but theres the foul on Jackson but you wait forever to be able to make that foul you lose valuable seconds on the shot clock and once we talk about valuable this young man right here the reigning coac player of the week knocking down what could be a dagger three well you can see that he knows its his team and his shot to take theres no doubt about it and hes pretty good at doing that team makes those shots four straight games now of 20 plus for RJ Davis I talked to his dad at the hotel earlier today I always see him in our in our little spot getting our food I said young Fellas balling dad Rob says hey all of course yeah all right Dad never never sure I tell you this I had one players every game he played his father said my son is terrible I said well hes starting for us and were winning so I think hes better than terrible tell you rob you had 2000 points of Mercy her you you got a little license to say hes okay l in the rebound of a Miss now Cormac got to get away from pressure here with under a minute to go in Carolina up nine and a foul on Miller will send Davis back to the line two shots coming for RJ Davis this is a really good early season win to be down 14 points in Deb in the water and Hubert went to the full court pressure and that was the difference in the game and clearly and his kids picked up the pace the crowd picked up the noise and thats why you like these games at home so what do you think sitting over here a little different than sitting over there I won today I won today I didnt lose that Im not losing any game sitting over here and whether I win or not I dont thats okay I got enough absolutely won my man this has been great getting an opportunity to hang out with you for the last couple of days and being a part of your first television broadcast I know hopefully well get a chance to do this many more times I hope so I green a three out front he he makes some hard shots he really does hes got now 12 in the ball game six and each half and a ball not knocked out of bounds last Touch by Darren Green so it will stay with Carolina with 25 and A2 to go into an eightpoint game Boston College in NC State coming up from Chestnut Hill and Carolina going to have to take a time out here because Tar Heels were having a hard time finding a an entry pass boy RJ Davis coach 27 points three of nine from three hes got five assists to go with uh his effort 37 minutes I mean hes just a completely at ease confident player yeah even when he missed two three in a row it never phased him he just kept going and hes hes their guy this year and they really they need probably another guy to score uh Ingram hes in and out hes spotty and cadoo is not going to score so they they caught Davis one more 16 in the second half by the way for RJ Davis on the way to this 27 yeah almost 50 from the floor too Cory WD yeah Young fella has now 107 points in his last four games wow and and he may not be done because of course hes the alltime leading free throw percentage shooter in the history of the University of North Carolina so theyre going to do everything they can to get the basketball in his hands down the stretch foul this guy they theyre fine with that foul him because hes pretty much automatic at the free throw yeah heres Ryan by the way into the front Court Cormac out of a double team looking for an allen CAU now and that will do it State going to let it go North Carolina who trailed by as many as 14 early in the second half went on a 17 to nothing run it was a 341 run over 11 minute spans
