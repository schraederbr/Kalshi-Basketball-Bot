Bryant Bulldogs out of the America East They win the opening tip off and we are underway Bulldog Hookies without Ammani Hanssbury tonight Out with a daytoday injury Antonio Dorne drawing his first career starts Inside Sims the freshman bothered Long three Quincy Allen drills it Quincy Allen I think is Jamie and Christians best player 68 Hes been a couple different schools but can do a little bit of everything for this Bulldog team Mack without Hansberry How does that change things for Virginia Tech Its just a different look But of course Hans Hansbury is not as much of an inside presence as Dorne And I think the fans are going to like what they see out of Dorne Although he coughed it up right there Bryant loves to shoot the three to Balis showing no fear with the range there They have not shot it well this season so far only 25 but they are capable Low patient and a goalend thatll count Theres that size we were talking about One player under 68 on the floor right now for coach Christians Bulldogs And when we talked to him this morning you asked him back Is this by design And he said with a smile Yes Absolutely intentional Hes coached the last couple years uh in Italy at the at the very highest highest level in Europe and uh he believes in this size and this style of play where theyre going to push it on offense and then try to keep you from running by jamming the rebounders Well show that to you as the game goes on And Antonio Dornes going to be whistled for the foul The freshman sevenfooter Yeah actually it was the other way Other way My apologies Theres the head coach of the Hokes Mike Young the third longest tenur coach in the ACC at his current school Both of these coaches with ties to Emery and Henry right down Interstate 81 The Wasps Here is Abdales Bryant will switch a lot Well see if Virginia Tech can take advantage of that Like right here Dorne featured early Misses off the window Good high low look Dornes got to take his time and finish that You mentioned Bryant They love to take the threepoint shot Averaging just under 30 threes attempted per game If they take something other than a layup or a three itll be a surprise Heres the freshman Tobalis fellow freshman Sims Long three Allen one of the veterans not that time And look at Toby Lewal Not only can he jump he just pursues the ball Jaylen Bedford coming off that big game 21 points on Sunday His beat Charlotte 8476 of Dallas late in the shot clock misfires tied to Balis And heres Tim Rodovski off to a nice start in his collegiate career Harvey not there Rodski with five of Dallas and a foul against going against Tyler Johnson Yeah I didnt say that Abdales got in early foul trouble the last game against Charlotte And theres Tyler reaching in Sure enough he got him an arm Tim Clocky with the correct call Joined by Eric Lewis and Tony Chiaza Another great crew tonight Big time crew Tim Clockards done it forever And uh theres been a Clockardy calling in the ACC probably my entire life laughter His father John 10 seconds on the shot clock Sims the second too strong And there was Johnson Yeah Dallas Johnsons off to a great start too Averaging 10 and six Christian Gerak checked in for Dorne a couple of moments ago Hes featured He turns and hes unable to finish the up andunder move Nice challenge by Quincy Allen Leads team in rebounds blocks and steals Different roster but Bryant last year six blocks per game third most in the country Low scoring not a lot of points Opening four minutes For those just joining OUR TELECAST JAYLEN BFORD CHANGES THAT WITH THE DUNK Enough of that said Tford Hes 10 for 16 from behind the threepoint arc to start his Virginia Tech career There he shows the exclamation points Yeah among the best in the country Number three in the ACC number 15 in the NCAA from long range The UNLV transfer is blocked The length of Bryant shows at the rim Yeah that time Lenny Weber 68 210 from Germany and Rovski pretty touch under the baskets Is really good from Moscow Russia Just a freshman and hes really hes really a guard He doesnt look like a guard but he is a guard I saw him at 69 on the roster Assumed guard or excuse me I assumed he was a Ford Exactly Maybe a center of Dallas looks to create with five Step back contested Johnson into the hands of Allen in transition No look pass under the basket Ashley Sims the second extends Bryants lead Yeah you got you got to get back You got to communicate You got to know where everybodys at cuz Bryant is going to run the basketball Both these teams want to get up and down Step back of Dallas Johnson Second effort chance for a threepoint play Thats something thats improved a lot for this Virginia Tech team Offensive rebounds Hes also from the Commonwealth of Virginia Grew up in Newer Tyler Johnson chance to convert the threepoint play before the media timeout Fouled at the rim unable to do that as Allen has the board Yeah this team for Mike Young is doing two things a little more than usual Running the fast break and getting offensive rebounds Virginia Tech fourth in the ACC in offensive rebounds per game just under 15 and averaging almost 96 points a game 20th in the country 5 seconds to shoot The fifth year from the logo into the hands of Johnson Lau cheering castle guard doesnt like it They disagree And there you see Ammani Hanssberry What a start to his tech career 16 points eight rebounds a game two double doubles first two games But he is out tonight with a minor injury and his daytoday Yeah A really valuable piece and and kind of changes the you know the the style of this team a little bit though Theyll be a little bit more center centric if you will with Gerak and Dorne who got the start Green lost the handle Johnson low to the rack he goes and the foul line Yeah good decision And to the Wow is uh getting to the free throw line already 20 for 23 87 Another one of the places where he has really improved This all season was so good for him He was hes gotten stronger went through that NBA process came back and just understands the game at a higher level Hes not played basketball all that long as as you all know Monday nights ACC Network womens basketball matchup features the nations leading scoreer Hannah Hidalgo and number 24 Notre Dame as they host Central Michigan at 9 Eastern music Its also available on the allnew ESPN app And Notre Dame with not many players back from that really good team they had a year ago But Anna Halgo if youre going to start with one coming back thats a pretty good one Set the NCAA record with 16 steals in a game last week We were walking out of Castle got the notification and I thought it was a typo 16 steals It looked like a typo That was also with 44 points too cheering Bryants leading by one Glad to have you on your Wednesday night 7 minutes into this first half Heres Quincy Allen Multiple stops Connects with Gio Sanford Now Joe Green again Another possession late in the shot clock for Bryant Green Yes with one second to spare Really nice play by the freshman out of Baltimore And youre going to hear that a lot freshman Bryant has nine freshman since they went division one Its the most in a single season in program history One of the most inexperienced teams in America And theres a foul on Quincy Allen whos one of those Bulldogs with a lot of experience Colorado James Madison Chicago State and now Bryant Yeah he was exception and and as a freshman at Colorado he was on that NBA kind of draft board if you will Very talented young man out of Silver Spring Maryland There you see a lot of really good programs hes been part of It was interesting Dick Vital kind of went on a rant today about this kind of thing He said This is not what college is supposed to be about you know four schools in four years and that kind of thing But it sure does work out well for some young folks to get that opportunity cheering Bounce pass finds a Dallas off the ricochet This is where the Hokes have been good but Bryant did a good job of getting back The foul on Sanford That takes us to the under 12 media timeout Lowscoring first half from music Castle Bryant leads Virginia Tech 96 Back after these messages today Great crowd on a Wednesday morning for the press conference What a great way to to close as of Dallas to Dorne That time he turns and scores And the key was the post up He got his man deep Of course he had the size advantage which hes going to have most of the time Got a deep post up Made it an easy shot Weber catch and shoot three down for the transfer from the University of Toronto Yeah the the lefty right there That was a set play to get that switch Coach Christian told us this morning he can really shoot it Corner three on the other end Tyler Johnson drills it Three straight makes right here after starting the game combined Seven for 20 one for eight from three Things are heating up after the timeout though the freshman point guard Dalis inside pass turned over Hammond can create in transition Thatll stay here Theres the switch Didnt get back in time Dorne and Lenny Weber hits it Tyler Johnson from the corner Neo of Dallas What a start to his Tech career Averaging a little over 16 per game Hell try the step back three Short front iron Bulldogs coming in after that loss Valareerezo Theyve got an early lead Virginia and a foul against Antonio Dorne his first And we talked about how Jamie and Christian wants this team to shoot threes and layups and theyre shooting about 30 a game but theyre only shooting 25 And of course their goal is to be in the mid30s They think thats a winning number with the number that theyre going to shoot Weber off the switch Great box out Hammond Hokes around the perimeter Johnson the bounce pass Dorne with three defenders on him Goes to the strike I I tell you what now that was a great job by Bryant in transition They closed down on shoot and rotated all the way around until they got the penetration and Dorne goes to the free throw line But Bryant has been getting back and keeping Virginia Tech from getting those high percentage looks theyve been getting in the first four games These are ACC Networks featured mens basketball matchups Cameron Boozer and number five Duke host Howard University Sunday afternoon at 4 Eastern at Cameron Indoor Plus music sixth ranked Blue Ovil host

and a maybe closer than expected but a a really fun game to watch against Charlotte on Sunday And theres some big competition coming over Thanksgiving Yeah its a a big stretch for Virginia Tech where Mike Young is going to learn a lot about this basketball team Tobalis to the right block and the finish at the rim Jakai Robinson the senior in the Miami transfer What a nice play that was driving the baseline A lot of contact in them low Hammond from the corner and the rebound from Robinson One of the returners from last years Bryant team that made the NCAA tournaments Hammond Bedford leaves that right side Hookies continue to struggle shooting the basketball One for six from three one for five from the free throw line Meanwhile Bryant with backto back layups Is there anything specifically Bryants doing from a defensive standpoint Mac No I mean theyre switching which they expected but theyre just getting a hand up on the shots doing a good job of of fighting the post down low And Virginia Tech cant get anything going in transition And of course to get transition you got to get stops too Pasha Hammond with five Gerak tips it back in with the right hand freshman has really given Mike Young quality minutes early in this season Got off to a great start season opener against Charleston Southern Led the Hokes in scoring at halftime and no Ammani Hanssbury today for Virginia Tech to Balis catch and shoots off the mark from Roofski cheering a foul against its just baseline out of bounds off Gerak There you go 1614 Bryant leading Weve got much more from Castle Coliseum next Uh fundamentals over there sharing the basketball Remember coach Fern from Charlotte talked about how far ahead of the United States in some ways they were especially sharing the basketball Ben Hammond misses the one and one Hokes have struggled tonight at the free throw line One for six shooting 73 coming in ninth in the ACC Yeah after a big night against Charlotte But the Hookies are are in the bonus and theyve only fouled twice themselves Hammond steps in front of the pass The sophomore the finger roll off the mark Second chance Oh good job Good hustle by Bryant in transition And a looks like a technical foul has been assessed to the Bryant bench Yep In the middle of play Yeah And one of the assistants attempt foul has been assessed against the bench And theyre talking about right now thats uh seven fouls to two And Im sure that was what was being mentioned but if youre an assistant coach you dont need to be getting a technical foul Bedford 60 on the year Heres another look Yeah he was calling the travel right there Maybe a little bit too intensely His can retake the lead on this possession Nice job of breaking up that play Wow Thats a charge drawn by Jakai Robinson Robinson one of the few veterans here like you mentioned played on the team a year ago transfer from Miami Now thats textbook right there We talk about it all the time If you get the shoulder in the sternum theyre going to call a charge every time Mack if we were to throw a headset on coach Christian right now we could ask him what hes liked about the start to this game What would he say Oh I dont know The thing that the reason theyre ahead is theyre getting back in transition Theyve done okay on offense Not still still not what he wants Rodski hand in his face No problem Talked about him being on the bench just a minute ago but he aint going to be on the bench much If youre just joining our broadcast Bryant has led for over 11 minutes of this first half Hokey team thats averaging almost 96 points per game Hammond believe whistle away Had 3 seconds to call Yeah bad possession right there Ball getting knocked away Batted away Hookies with five on the shot clock They were still 30 feet from the basket Not good execution so far in the half court for Virginia Tech cheering Something theyre normally very good at Of course the first few games it hadnt mattered much because theyve been so good in transition And theres a foul on Bedford away from the ball No Hokei has more than one foul of Dallas and Jaden Shu checked in and you know Mike Young said after the game on Sunday he he views Chute still as a starter the minutes that he plays and M I dont think weve talked about enough just how consistent Chute has been off the bench instant offense for this team Yeah he really has and thats a big adjustment you know when youve been used to being a starter but uh shoots a veteran player and goodness gracious he is he or bet for I dont know which one is the best shooter but theyre both outstanding Nobodys outstanding for Virginia Tech tonight so far Abdales Nothing there in transition Dallas lost the handle The ball is contested Low is head even with the rim with the rebound Yeah LW is accurately named Wow of Dallas That time itll fall Think the Hookies can get a little something going Have shot the ball very poorly but right in this game First points of the day Its a onepoint game over 5 minutes until halftime The first ever meeting between Bryant and Virginia Tech Pokés are 8 and0 all time against current America East teams Most recent meeting Vermont two years ago in the right hand The finish is there for the freshman Ashley Sims What a really nice job backing Low down and he made contact Kept Toby from getting off the floor with that body Hooks have led for just 45 seconds OF THIS FIRST HALF LEW PUTTING THE WOW in La Wow The student section up in the end zone to Bales out of Worcester Massachusetts Odowski cheering spins off of shoot too strong off the glass again Bryant back in transition of DALLAS TO THE RIM YES with the left hand He just probes He probes the defense till he finds an opening All new ESPN app I Thats phenomenal as we welcome you back to Castle In between breaks were talking about doing a promo as shoot creates A TURNOVER AND A RIGHT HAND FLUSH TO GET CASTLE GUARD fired up Yeah finally some easy baskets Three times in a row Virginia Tech has finished at the rim and back in front A 6 run for the Hokes Offensive foul against the Bulldogs Rudowski shoot with good position Takes the charge Knocks it away The speed the awareness and the finish Shoot Known for his threepoint range This one was a little easier Just over three minutes until lap time Thrilled to have you on Wednesday night Evan Hughes Matt McCarthy the rest of our outstanding ACC network crew on hand Dorm missed the wild wide open sliding down the lane Now theyre late in the shot clock Abdales hesitates hangs in the air Dorne the sevenfooter a goalend Hes got the baskets Yeah And and I know he uh has struggled early in the game but this guys a really good player Fans are going to really enjoy him Competed for Germany in the 23 FIA U20 European Championships And the coach Young says brings a unique combination of size skill and toughness Pokes by five Rodski falls down He traveled the ninth turnover of the first half for the Bulldogs Good matchup right there Roofski against AD Dallas I wouldnt be surprised if they havent met somewhere before Leading scoreer for Virginia Tech in this first half Johnson and Dorne with five points each shoots open Yes good execution And another timeout by Jamie and Christian Virginia Tech 110 run Back after these messages Welcome back to Castle Coliseum Bryant has led for the majority of the first half but the Hokes have gotten hot on an 110 run Yeah a couple chances right at the basket but the screen right by Dorne for shoot on a set play in the half court Tech hadnt scored a lot five on five but they did that time with a wideopen look Bryant looking for its first points since the 514 mark and a foul against James Shu Yeah it uh I think all the games this season to be honest have been pretty physical and this one is no exception but Shu with his hand in the cookie jar right there got caught Matt quickly what has changed the last couple of minutes for Virginia Tech Well the defense has been good but offensively theyve gotten some easier looks Some in transition some off turnovers and then theyve executed a little bit better five on five than they were before Good post up by Dorne Help Good screen by Dorne Hes getting a little bit more comfortable out there Robinson A step back a foul against Virginia Tech cheering Its Dorne It is Dorne Yeah they they forced a bad shot but Dorne on the rebound was a little too aggressive Good job of contesting this shot Not a good shot And watch Dorne moves his man out of bounds Hes so big and strong Im not sure he realized he did it You know why I hesitated there for a minute partner talked about for the game Seeing the referees try and use seven on the hands there to go 77 Step back three Bryant could use it Wowski misses Watch out in transition A Dallas JOHNSON THE FLUSH A Dallas makes the right play the right read the right pass every time And Johnson running the floor Largest lead of the game for Virginia Tech cheering Little danger zone for Bryant They really need to get a good shot Its a 130 run Rodski one of the top players OH WHAT A BOUNCE PASS WIDE OPEN Keegan Harvey to the basket Yeah Rodski with a beautiful pick and roll right there His didnt communicate on the ball screen and they got the basket they needed shoots almost the same spot as his last make Same play Miscommunication on the switch He wasnt quite as wide open as the last time Rodovski a foul and free throws I dont think Coach Young loves that call He did not 17 Split the defenders Hes got two on him Dont see a lot there Did they call it on Gdak They did Yeah I was say Johnson missed him cheering You know Gerach and Dorne are both good players but neither one of them bring the athleticism and the uh versatility that Hanssberry does And the Hokes are still adjusting to play him without that athletic Hanssberry out there Sixpoint game with 45 seconds until halftime Gosski over a 90 free throw shooter Dont want to put him on the line Nearly a turnover A Dallas tries to feed Lel Baseline out of bounds As you like to say a Mike Young specialty Oh no the kick was outside So yeah baseline out of bounds Mike Young usually dials something up pretty good but uh well see what they do We got 20 on the shot clock Plenty of time to get it in and do something Now five on four Wheres the open man GOOD RECOVERY BY BRYANT LOW TAKEOFF I said good recovery I did not account for Toby Laow cheering The Miami transfer Robinson cheering working out of Dallas Sims blocked Lau on the offensive end Finishes the first half on the defensive end Thats both teams starting five on the floor to begin the second half Evan Hughes Mac McCarthy the rest of our outstanding ACC network crew Virginia Tech trying to move to 50 Bryant looking for its first power four win since 2022 at Syracuse Lau draws the whistle and goes to the line Yeah oneonone move against Quincy Allen Some contact Allen went down and then the Wild draws the foul Virginia Tech was not good from the free throw line in the first half or from three Two for eight from both of those distances There you see Low leading the team in free throw percentage You talked about that in the first half Go 20 for 23 coming into the to tonight And again I mean weve said it before but this is a guy who has not played a lot of basketball and hes hes learning so quickly His largest lead of the game is 10 Mack theres the lob inside Johnson got a piece of it Itll stay here You know give Bryant a lot of credit Didnt end the half they wanted but they did a lot of things in the first half that I know coach Christian will like Yeah they kept the the Hokes from running the fast break Hi His only scored four points in transition but they got 10 off turnovers and 22 in the paint Allen tough shot No problem Well hes a good looking player but we saw him early in the first half have some success and then he kind of disappeared of Dallas looking to create head up all the time hunting a teammate So good I mean I I we Ive got to find another word for probe because thats what he does to the defense He he goes up into the to the crevices of the defense and either creates a shot or creates help and finds a teammate During our halftime coverage Luke Hancock was asked to use one word about certain players in the ACC and he he did the hyphen Luca like to describe Neo Uh comparing him to Luca Donuch Yeah that thats thats fair A much skinnier version You think about coming into the year Abdollis received just one preseason vote for rookie of the year You think some voters might want to have their votes back on that match Yeah I think after that nationally televised game against Providence a lot of voters wanted that vote back Its going to be fun to see how that plays out down the stretch with Tamboozer and other great freshman Turnaround shot You bet Tim Roofski He he plays a lot like Abdales Good handler head up We saw him make some nice passes in the first half More of a two than a one Bryant forces the turnover Number six of the game Transition three Allen to Bedford Hokes can push BEDFORD BY HIMSELF IS REJECTED AND MET BY ALLEN A DALLAS FOULED on the second effort Good hustle Bedford was going to take it but a great block Quincy Allen Most blocks in the America East coming in Yeah and this is why hes long athletic gets the block but Hokes hustling down the floor Here comes Abdollis and hes going to go back to the free throw line I think theyre going to look at some contact after that It looked like Dorne ran into one of the bulldogs reviewing for a possible flag foul It looked unintentional but there was enough contact to knock the Bryant player to the floor Our crew Eric Lewis Tony Chiaza and Tim Clockardy Heres a look at it Here comes Dorne A little bit of a flip right there That could be a flagrant one It wasnt exactly a basketball play but it wasnt a lot of contact either And theyre discussing it We We havent had as many reviews of anything this season Of course the new rules do that with the uh coachs uh challenge if you will And there there are a lot of things you cant review during during the course of the game But it looks like this one it looks like this is going to be a flagrant one probably because he extends the arm After review after the comment file theres a legal contact by 77 White to the back of 99 which is a flagrant technical They would shoot two shots in the ball as well And Maxs going to get an explanation from one of our three refs Yeah day dead ball contact technical actually But yeah flagrant one is is basically what that is So not a legitimate play on the ball and certainly pushed from behind Thatll be a personal also Dorne takes a seat right there Not a ton of contact and it was a lot caused by momentum but when he extended the elbow they have to call that So Abdales will shoot his free throws first You know Mac while we have a moment you bring up the new rules this year Id love to get your thoughts because now timeouts are at stake when you elect a challenge How how would you utilize that as a coach because I know how precious timeouts are Yeah you only get the one and you you know c certain things at the end of the half at the end of the game are are going to be reviewed anyway So you have to be kind of careful where you use it Uh I saw a coach in the ACC the other day use it like in the first two minutes of the game He was going to he was going to try that thing out and see how it worked But if if you challenge it and then youre correct then you retain your timeout You think its a good thing for the game similarly what the NBAs done the last couple years Weve had a whole lot less reviews and and all of the huddles if you will uh that than weve had in the past So so far I give it an A There you see as Dorne goes to the bench that is his third personal And worth reminding Ammani Hanssberry is out tonight Could mean extended minutes for Christian Gerak Rodski pros the kick Three on the way is true for Keegan Harvey Yeah another one of those big guys who can shoot from long range The DGW transfer has some uh history with Jamie and Christian and coach Christian recruited him to George WASHINGTON AS ADA SPINS AND drills the shots Can just do a little bit of everything Number four in the ACC number 30 in the NCAA and assist seen him had the big scoring night against Providence 33 That looked like a walk Ill officiate while were talking You can do it all Youre doing the the promo reads HARVEY HAND IN HIS FACE HES FEELING IT BACK TO BACK TRADES YEAH and Gerach has to know that And I know they went over in the scouting report but you cannot give him that space Thats six quick points for Bryant Its a threepoint game This Bryant team coming off of a America East championship Coach Phil Martelli to VCU Coach Christian in his first year Lot of freshman and new faces Playing well in Blackburg of Dallas step back three on the other end Shorts Thats off the hand of Gerach Nick Bryant going the other way with a chance to tie Anything in particular he seen differently in the second half here from the Bulldogs No not really I you know I think its about the same but again the Hokes dont look quite as smooth in the half court Uh a little bit different look without Hansbury in there but there are some advantages to having Dorne and Gerach on the floor too but defensively thats hurt him a little bit here in the second half Sanford too strong did he step out He did or a Bulldog Yeah its a strange play a little bit It looked like the Wow got pushed out of bounds but thats not a fan Thats not a thing Shoot spins LOW WITH SPACE TOBY misses the flush A little extra mustard on that one Hammond Hookies have numbers WHAT A FIND GAK THE FRESHMAN Got numbers Hammond with the head up Gerak running the floor Couple of youngsters A sophomore and a freshman combining for Mike Young at a basket Sims turns Low on the defense Hokes in transition Hammond lw Gerak through contact You said the freshman Before we went to commercial break we thought Gurock was fouled It was then called an inadvertent whistle So the tip in counted but no foul Thats why theres no free throw coming out of commercial break Yeah but that was a foul on Gerdock and uh and he and Dorne uh you know accumulating fouls right now And Gak did a good job He recognized thats the guy thats made two threes then he ran out there and fouled him Thats Gak second Again Dorne who started at the five spot has three And Hansbury is out tonight A minor injury considered daytoday Good job by Gerach right there making Harvey give the ball up Borade feeds Allen Look at the ball pressure from Johnson Hand in his face Leaves it short Strong rebound from Sanford Second effort Allen to the free throw line cheering M What has Bryant done to kind of cut away chip away at this deficit Well the backtoback threes were the biggest thing Uh and then they got a couple stops on the other end but the backtoback threes by Harvey that that uh thatll cut into a lead in a hurry cheering Quincy Allen who leads this Bryant team in rebounds blocks and steals 83 on the year at the line How important is it to have a fifth year guy like Allen when youve got nine true freshman on the roster Yeah Yeah I mean youre putting together so many new people from so many different places and uh youve got Allen whos been a bunch of different places So hes used to all this Hes probably the calm in a storm Coach Young calling out a set play right here Hammond beautiful head fake draws the foul from Robinson Yeah and the Hokes got uh Bryant in foul trouble getting to the free throw line a little bit more in the first half but again its been a physical game and not a lot of fouls called by this veteran crew Lewis Chiasa and Clockardy I wish everybody could see Maxs reaction before the game We find out who the officials are Always a smile on his face laughter He goes way back with some of them They all have great things to say about your partner Yeah now they do Gak spins reverses Thats a goalend How about the freshman Gerac third goalend of the nights When youre so tall this is a huge basketball team folks Last year Duke was the tallest team in the country This team is just as big And goodness gracious Quincy Allen on the pass from Keegan Harvey What a dunk from Allen One of the plays of the night Did we mention that he was on the NBA draft board as a freshman He might be getting back on that board if he if hes not anymore His turning over What can Allen do again Harvey from the logo Allen Not that time Low quick outlets Three on two HAMMOND DROPS IT OFF FOR GAK Really good decision Could have gone a lot of different ways Nice job by the freshman running the floor What a night for Gerach Those two were teammates for two years in high school at Paul the Six Tech in transition again and just too far out of reach Hammond for Low An SC top 10 worthy moment for Quincy Allen Yeah back door you know back door dunk one thing Back door windmill dunk Thats another level And weve got every angle possible That one might be my favorite Great job from our crew Always giving us the best angles the best How good were those pictures If youre just joining us Virginia Techs largest lead has been 10 Step back three Radowski Low coming off a careerhigh in rebound Sunday with the board Hammond blow by dribble contact and a foul Yeah fifth foul for Bryant Just seven minutes into this second half and a baseline out of bounds opportunity for Mike Young Quickly what makes coach Young so good at these plays these sets I wish I knew we could have beaten him more times laughter Great answer Lets see what he draws up here Nice job defensively that time taking away Abdal on the dribble handoff True contact that time from Rodovski one of the top players for Bryant Its going to be his third personal Yeah that would be a big problem for Jamie and Christian if he gets one more and has to sit Right now hes in pretty good shape But Allen didnt get much of a blow right there Big first step So explosive And Rowski puts the body on him and rides him out of bounds The wall gets to go to the free throw line where weve talked about how good he has been this season Only two for four today but made his last two One thing Mike Young has always done is hes done a great job with player development Hes got a really good staff They put the extra time in All these players over getting shots working on their ball handling uh working on their stance Uh they they put in the time to get better on their own You only get a limited number of hours and uh they they try to get all they can out of these play players and look how look at the improvement in Low Look at the improvement in Tyler Johnson Ben Hammond and I tell you when were lucky enough to go to practice and shoot around Whos one of the first people there Toby Lew Here he is on the offensive end Low Are you kidding me UNBELIEVABLE HELLO SPORTS CENTER AGAIN TOBY LEW bumped the defender created space and on the other end a little quieter but a beautiful move by Roofski I think the producers in Bristol tonight might see a lot from this game What do you think partner A lot from this campus today And Bryant hanging around Hammond hesitates and draws Contact will shoot free throws Toby Low There you see dunks tonight How about that Thats not in the box score there Thats our crew behind the scenes Impressive Ben Hammond to the line The sophomore whos currently leading the ACC in assist to turnover ratio Yeah really doing a nice job Improved Played well down the stretch last year Robinson straight away with 10 You mentioned Dorne back for Gerdak Playing with three fouls is Dorne Long three from Allen Drains it right in front of his bench Tyler Johnson Tyler Johnson would thought he was there He could just shake his head Almost deep with a hand in his face Bryant averages just under 30 threes taken per game Taking 20 tonight Shoots step back on the other end and a foul believe thats on the floor against Bryant Dont know he and Dorne Dorne involved in the contact again Mike Young looking at Dorne So I dont know Now the trainer has well hes coming out to see Jakai Robinson and they may be looking at something else again Theyre huddling up Great to see Robinson ruling on the floor as a common foul reviewing for a possible upgrade And it looks like it is on Dorne then Gerak checking back in and theyre reviewing it to see if theres an upgrade from a common foul to the flagrant one And part of the reason that Dornes gotten in a little bit of foul trouble was earlier with a flagrant one Yep And he its hes a big physical guy He takes up a lot of space in there Well thats a basketball play right there isnt it Can we see that one more time Maybe a little different angle Okay theres the box out by Robinson Oh yeah again uh everything good until you extend that arm and the elbow in the back I think this is going to be another upgrade because of the extension of the arm And again right now its a a common foul Its his fourth personal right now Yeah that looks like an upgrade to me partner Lets see our crew Eric Lewis Tony Chiaza Tim Clocky and theyve been great about clarification Im sure theyll visit with us after they visit with the coaches After review the common file has been upgraded to a flag file for illegal contact to the back of the head Thats his second So he he will be ejected from the game So thatll be it for Antonio Dorne the very talented freshman And again know weve talked about it throughout but maybe youre just joining us His typically have Ammani Hanssbury starting He is out tonight So now Dorne his night done Christian Geraks been playing really well Hes got more minutes ahead of him Yeah And hes going to have to stay out of foul trouble too And its a challenge for him to get out and guard because everybody on Bryants team can and will shoot the threepoint shot And theres a lot of time left in this basketball game which is only a sevenpoint game And Robinson is going to the free throw line for two on the other end for Bryant Bryant comes into tonight the best free throw shooting team in the America East at 76 Theyre four for six this evening cheering Robinson yet to make a free throw this year has his first cheering 2021 to 2024 in the ACC at the University of Miami Lets take one more look And this is the best view right here There it is Extending the elbow into the back of the head No question about it And hell be sitting for the remainder of the game Its a fivepoint game Hooks 40 on the season Already shorthanded with the Monti Hanssbury out inside outside corner three No but a foul on the floor and the Bryant bench They are loving it Yeah Ben Hammond trying to block out on the back side Fans disagreeing Bedford and AD Dallas getting ready to check back in Christian Gerak
