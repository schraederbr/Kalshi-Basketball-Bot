team Goodman and Trey wurtz wurtz is uh coming off an impressive game as well and you know its going to be interesting to see Radford gave Notre Dame all they wanted on that first night and I pray six players in the game a really tight rotation I know hed like to expand that a little bit in this game hes dealing with some injuries but the Youngstown State theyll go deep theyll uh theyll play 10 11 guys Bob Lamar Simpson with the opening tip joined by Ted Valentine and Lee Cassell to officiate today here at Notre Dame foreign Notre Dame in the home whites Applause air ball three but a Johnny on the spot Adrian Nelson right place right time Sticks it in you know so many times an air ball benefits the offensive player you know defensive guys are a little reluctant to go up and grab it and it was we didnt get an assist on that shot Applause foreign Applause Music but he likes to go out and then work his way in get a mismatch here and another name exploits it nice job of finding that sometimes the team doesnt see it right away and and has trouble delivering it but Notre Dame got him the ball quickly Applause Music cohill wears number five Covington number 32 Rattan may use his brother played in the ACC at Florida State heres Nelson putting up the three penguins get the offensive rebound and all alone underneath and a great cut is Nelson well just the offensive rebound not being able to clean that up in a good spacing that time by Youngstown State allowed that back door and weve got an offensive foul coming against Notre Dame and JJ starling Applause veteran head coach of the Fighting Irish now in his 23rd season the alltime winningest coach here Applause he may be about five years younger than everybody else out on the floor for Notre Dame Applause off the front of the rim for kohill Irish look to run Starling a bump and a bucket so good in the open floor really has some great size of 64 Applause that ties the game you see starlings numbers against Radford he did hit a couple of Threes in that contest quick move by Green offensive foul and Nate laceski doing a little bit of everything yeah nice job jumping anticipating in that right hand drive that time it was an easy call to make and see you guys see if you push off with that left arm you duck the shoulder its going to be an easy call every time somehow we talked about Youngstown State scoring this by far is the best team theyve played up to this point and uh Notre Dame will throw a lot of different looks at them defensively Music Nate turns and misses the rebound belongs to Nelson Applause one way to attack is get down the floor and a nice drive to the hole by Covington first really opportunity theyve had in the open court now thats the way they want to play they want to get up and down in the more Notre Dame misses theyre going to be able to get out to the full open floor for top Mays with the basket and its 64 Youngstown three minutes in wurtz connects a threepointer boy talking to Mike Ray before the game hes a guy whose game is really improved over last year he theyre theyre looking for him to make a big jump in scoring and in every category back to the basket green foreign Applause the drive works Applause Great Space today everybody along the back line had their backs turned to the ball that time so there was no help no charge taken 96 in favor of the Irish what about words giving you a couple looks uh with the drive and then also the threepoint shot three out of the corner is good by Garrett Covington three for seven from distance in the first two games foreign Music Applause Music gets into the paint no real shot blocker out there per se for either team so if you can get to the rim you dont have to look around walk travel Texas to a timeout tied at nine 1533 or save repeat and now the moment weve all been waiting for our keys to the game brought to you by your local Ford dealers Mr jiminski I mean you and me um Youngstown State pushed the tempo we talked about 90 points a game they want to get out and run in the open floor and for Notre Dame different looks defensively zoned man try to confuse the Penguins as much as they can thats going to be their MO throughout the course of the year does their transition game affect that um well the thing that affects it most is Notre Dames offense because if you know theyre shooting a low percentage Youngstown State is going to be able to get out and run but for Notre Dame yeah changing the offense changing the defense if they can do that in a half court seven for Words early and Notre Dame goes up 119 Music Applause Music follow is good Adrian Nelson gets an and one out of it hes got six early and headed to the line Applause you know what and theyre trying theyre doing the right thing and you want to attack leshesky try to get him in some foul trouble make him guard now he backed off and didnt get the foul that time but that was a really nice take by Adrian Nelson four key transfers into the Penguins program and Nelson is one of them he comes from Northern Kentucky and he had a doubledouble against UT Martin on Wednesday night 12 and 10 oryx gets a breather setting down with seven early points one thing we didnt touch on with with the portal players that to you know especially in this group for everybody to maybe take a step back and say how can we all fit in here you know they may have been the guy where they came from but they may have to step that down a little bit in the interest of winning games with a great catch in traffic and he puts it in and found on the play well the one thing that Youngstown States been doing here is switching and when they do that lasheski has been diving into the lane and hes been getting mismatches inside against smaller players great live I mean you can just you can throw over the top of the guys who are guarding them inside at 6 10 200 hes got a huge advantage in there youre right free throw to come and nothing but net for his fifth point Nate went to the line 15 times and the Radford game made 12 and keep in mind he had 47 free throws all of last season well and thats a function of his game expanding hes been able to put the ball on the floor with a lot more efficiency this year causing big guys to guard him which they dont like to do outside and heres that changing D youre talking about Mike going to the zone and a foul on a show out of bounds stepping in on the line in that corner was John Lovelace Jr just lost track of where they was and that was a just a very active Notre Dame Zone that time Applause Music Applause Nate takes a peek Ryan gives it up heres the drive and the score nicely done by Dave Goodwin thing you like about that hes coming off a tough shooting night one of eight against Radford get some Rhythm put the ball on the floor get to the rim and then build outside from that he needed that basket early Music McBride hits the three now keep in mind in the first two games against lesser competition than theyre facing today of course but the ball still got to go in the hole and they were at 42 percent on threes in their first two games yeah the drive and Miss by Starland Penguins yeah 51 overall and off and running rebound Notre Dame coming up hobbling a little bit yeah he may have rolled an ankle trying to run it out hes just now coming into your picture Applause and a foul hes got a push so I think hes on McBride I think with Jessica a little contact on that drive look he got a knee maybe in his thigh or so Works back in Starling out well keep a close eye on Nate still flexing the leg Applause they have been the left ankola now Matt Zona is going to come in and theyre going to get Nate out of the game Mike Bray not taking any chances with uh with number 14 for sure Zona didnt play in the first game Applause he screams for Ryan and Carmack drills the three well and with lachesky out the scoring has to be spread a little around a lot more out on the perimeter and they have Ryan very capable scorer from there another Zone look Lefty Rush putting it up and off and ripping the ball away as Trey works Brian air ball were looking at the Notre Dame bench and I think its the left knee may have gotten banged for Le chesky yeah I dont think it was you know obviously he got ding but Im pretty sure it was a neon knee contact when he was taking when he got in the path of the driver foreign Applause he played every minute except one of the game against Radford so this is a massive break for lejevsky Applause Brandon Rush Applause transferred in from Fairley Dickinson Lovelace this kid was not really recruited by many people and Ill tell you what Jared Calhoun theyre coached very high on this young man he thinks he could be the best in the conference this year and on the overplay Lovelace commits his first foul that brings us to a timeout at the 11 57 Mark in the first half a twopoint ball game and Notre Dames favor Applause the iconic praying hands up the Notre Dame library and how about the lake effect snow Mr jiminsky I went to sleep last night there was nothing I woke up and there were six inches on the ground this extra added welcome to South Bend from coach bray to me and go out and I havent I havent cleaned the car off and I cant remember how long yeah but like riding a bicycle came right back to you I went back to my Connecticut and New Jersey and Philly roots yeah nothing like cleaning your car off of the Meadowlands after a Net game yeah those still having issues with Brooklyn Music Applause out of the timeout another name 20 on the shot clock foreign Music Applause Applause Music second field goal for Dan that looks very under control you want to drive them off the threepoint line but uh nice drive and shoot 2117 all right Music contact no whistle as Rush was denied lucesky left open and he bangs it home Youngstown is going to take a timeout a wide open look against the guy that is at the top of the Scouting Report yep and uh two of five in his first game we talked about him when he first started here he was a catch and shoot guy did that well hes really expanded his game but youve got to have something this was just trailing off of the break everybody got compressed on the Baseline you gotta find number 14 at all golf yeah thats thats right up there at the top of the list Music at 82 Notre Dame run to push this lead up to seven at 1109 of this first half Nates dad Jay of course played at Wisconsin in the mid 80s and sis Abby had a day game today for the Wisconsin Women they were winning big last I checked so a very busy Sunday at basketball Music Big Ten a deep League this year as well Applause Music so a timeout for Youngstown State no doubt some inspirational moments coach Calhoun and they go right inside and get the layin for Nelson you know Id really like watching teams respond after a timeout you know what do they do how do they run what theyre you know drawn up there that was a terrific play just a a high pick and roll and a lob through the basket well executed foreign Lubin is in for Notre Dame and Youngstown coughs it up on the break good defense by done on the front end of that but they didnt they were too close together on that twoman break good one left that one short and Ben Allen right there to stick it back in at six he was the only bench guy that got into that game Mike talked about they played just six against Radford yeah I think theyd like to see him his role expand another freshman him he aint 16 minutes in that first game and turning the corner hey foul as well on the basket by kohill Ill tell you what Bob Youngstown State has shown the ability to put the ball on the floor and get to the rim a lot of traffic up front yeah its a great screen yeah Goodwin kind of waving right there on the weak side but uh theyre theyre been some straight line drives coach Calhoun of Youngstown State is in his sixth season and by the looks it thinks this is his best team and a Follow by Dunn Wills basket makes it in essence a fourpoint trip yeah and lasheski mistimed it the ball hung on the rim an extra bounce Music Applause that pulls Youngstown State within three Music clock shot clock never got started and so Ill take a moment here to get that straight Youngstown State that stick back by Will Dunn Youngstown State now with nine second chance points to Notre Dames two five offensive rebounds has resulted you know theyre shooting uh 40 from three but uh 56 you know youre shooting 56 from the floor and that many offensive rebounds youre gonna put some points up on the board is 2623 right now Mike Bray talking about the defensive effort No Doubt Music oh thats good you know thats the other thing you know up front and uh you want Lubin to be one of those guys but whos going to be doing the rebounding and and the thing is in this game so far there have been a lot of long rebounds a lot of stuff for himself its been in the paint area so the balls been around the rims its interesting Mike and you as one of the great big men Id love to get your thoughts on this because the art of rebounding has changed with the Advent of the threepoint shot you get so many more long rebounds now which which took one of these big cot season last year so amazing that he had all those double doubles and the numbers that he put up but so many the perimeter has become much more important rebounding from a team standpoint you know long shots long rebounds your wing guys have to hang in there for those long rebounds in it Applause first half points I guess his leg is okay on the drive kohill left it way short words sees up Ryan hell drive it instead and throw it out front 2823 Irish Applause Music words at the top throws it away trying to hit Lubin in the corner Garrett Covington back in the game for Youngstown State heres the look and we you know I talked about it how about finishing with the left hand too I mean that makes it gives them some more style points on that the whole right side of the floor cleared out but uh he couldnt do that two or three years ago I mean thats a part of his game thats really grown Music over 1100 career points at Notre Dame and Mike Bray talked about he he was his most important recruit having Nate lashewski come back especially with Atkinson you know not being back this year such a big part of what they did last year catch and shoot for Covington bidding for his third three of the day Garretts dad John played football here at Notre Dame in the early 90s on some great blue Holtz teams and hes coming back from a torn Achilles yes as well that that was a career Ender a number of years ago and now its uh oh on the drive Starling Banks it in Applause Music 20 3023 Notre Dame Nice Lane for him he had lacheski out in the wing if they needed to kick out Applause Music Applause Raton babes Applause Nelson boy they dont have any problem letting it fly no uh and you know I think everybodys got the green light and at that time Goodwin No Hands Up on the shot it was an easy look at The Rim and a reach trying to pry it Loose kohill with his first foul a timeout 7 50 the time remaining in our first half JJ Starling the freshman with the score Irish by five our Focus shifts to the castle castle Coliseum on the campus of Virginia Tech and Blacksburg he gave inside the Commonwealth of Virginia as the the tribe of William and Mary comes up from Williamsburg to take out the Hokies of Virginia Tech six oclock tip check your local listings here in South Bend 750 left in our first half and the kind of uh Pace that Mike you had anticipated is playing out exactly that way but heres the thing I mean Notre Dame youre shooting 72 from the floor and its only a fivepoint game the difference being those five offensive rebounds and second chance points for Youngstown State and you know on top of that theyre shooting 52 percent so they left their defense at the door so far this ones going to be tipped into the backcourt and out of bounds to Youngstown State foreign over for Notre Dame its Fourth uh Jared Calhoun and the penguins have to feel great about how they played this first half Nelson tough shot and that bothered by the length yeah and uh but you know again I like the attitude theyre in attack mode theyre getting in trying to get some fouls trying to score inside not settling for jump shots Mike is that a product of veteran players that you come to a place like Notre Dame and youre not in awe of the surroundings youre just ready to go play basketball yeah I mean these these guys have you know a lot of them have played you know 90 plus games already in their career theyve been in some big venues so I I definitely think that it takes a little bit of the shock and awe out of you know playing in a place like this and plus Applause here so its you know its not a full Roar atmosphere that youd normally get right Adrian Nelson with the stick back another offensive rebound for Youngstown State Applause works Applause thank you 3227 Applause kohill is deflected knocked out of bounds look at the Youngstown ball with 18 on the shot clock as Lubin comes back in for the Irish penguins get the done on the offensive glass Music and this is uh you know theyve established themselves there and then Notre Dame again you see there a lot of ball watching you gotta tag your man first and then go after the miss foreign Music 16 first half points a long Tuesday made one threes doing it the oldfashioned way as well Applause 3230 Applause Dane Goodwin heres Ryan foreign Applause transfer gives it up lasheski drives and lays it in and again scoring with the left hand Music Goodwin Wards lejewski combined 1114 from the floor Irish by four back into that zone look its just the thing is you want to see if Notre Dame can rebound a little bit better out of that Nelson left that one short as we approach the five minute mark Applause Music Im not a lot of rules for Youngstown State to get these points theyre doing a lot of it in the half court Music Starling off the dribble man weve got a lot of contact inside this will be a hole on kohill second on the Youngstown State forward 3430 theres a look and then you see right there good trying to go yeah exactly but Ill tell you what to this point nobody in the in the bonus so far both teams pretty you know doing a nice job defending without fouling 16 fouls on Youngstown only three on Notre Dame tips it and a good save by starling Applause Music Applause JJ a couple of crossovers twists and misses and a foul Applause moving underneath I believe they called it on Covington starlings showing an ability to go both ways left and right able he was going to that left hand and then bringing his body back in drawing the contact there you know right now if Im defending sorrow and Im giving him some room I want him to beat me over the top hes too good when he gets into the lane his fifth Point Trey warts returns also that Zona coming in 423 left in the first half and a second shot for JJ Starling its still a pretty tight rotation I mean Zona into this game because lachesky got in hurt in that first half early on so hes getting a little bit more rest only seven guys for the Irish so far Mike Bray turns to his seat on the bench 3630 six points for starling Bryce McBride wearing a different uniform number today three rather than four and the layin is gonna drop from Malik green Applause 3632 good find off the dribble Music quick start the calm Works down a little bit in this game good one smothered and blocked and this one will go out of bounds and belong to the Penguins and Nelson doing everything out on the floor both ends of it he has been outstanding 16 first half points and then from the help side with the projection timeout this is what I call protecting the paint while Goodwin thought he had a wide open layup right there he had the inside tracked and great help side defense that time Nelson had one block in the first two games but this is a really really good helps and then you retain possession of the ball too Penguins down four youre looking at Dwayne cohill he was shaken up on that last play and theyre going over to check on him out of the game for a moment were down to 342 here in the first half Coal Hill with the two personal fouls as well too so maybe Jared Calhoun saving him a little bit foreign Applause going up against lachevski just rolled it off the front of the rim Applause I tell you this really to this point hasnt been an up and down game but both teams have been very good in their half court offense good one right in front Music eight points for Dane just really does a nice job hell attack the rim when its there for him but hes got the good midrange game as well McBride driving and belongs to another name Applause Youngstown State shooting 48 percent the Irish at 64 percent Applause Starling and the bump on Brandon Rush talking to the the coaches from Youngstown State and Jared Calhoun and there were guys there were people who come into this program who have never been 20 before there was a you know they were like were 20 you know and its gives you a little perspective well hes put together a program thats had a winning season three straight years for the first time since the mid 80s yeah Youngstown State has not been a Powerhouse for sure in preseason number five in the horizon front end missed it remains a sixpoint spread outside state has won 53 games over the last three years Music and the pass bounces out of bounds Lovelace with the error The Freshman he just didnt have a good angle to feed the post that time sort of a lost art in basketball well because theres not a lot of posts to feed these days but youre right its you know that was I like that I like that you like being out and receiving it yeah absolutely I like that skill in other players JJ starling and that makes it a nine point game now 4132 Applause love links good hands by lasheski and its going to be an add one from Malik green Music hey Bobby this is a little bit of a a red zone for uh for Youngstown State theres the curl boy starts knocking down this shot he is going to be really really tough to defend but then the other end you got green with that aggressive right hand gets to the freethrow line and you know for the Penguins they didnt want this game to get out of shape going into half into halftime so that was a nice answer to the previous basket green 23 years old his hes a sixth year senior hes working on his second Masters well and the thing too is its not just the portal but you had the coveted year thats given people an extra year as well exactly Applause 115 left before halftime Starling tough shot rebound belongs to Nelson Applause thank you Applause McBride Applause gets into the paint once again Dives to the hole missed it and a blocking foul on lezewski that is the fifth team foul on Notre Dame heres a look the attack right there just a little bit of a hip transferring in from Eastern Michigan Bryce McBride fifth year senior out of Jackson Tennessee Music his fourth Point Trey wurtz back for Notre Dame Applause a couple of years at Eastern Michigan career average at 125 in Ypsilanti five for McBride and a 4136 game so you talked about that danger zone Youngstown cuts it back yeah nice good answer good finish for them going into halftime Michelle had a look didnt take it worse now with 14 on the shot clock and a bump I love Lakes his second foul oneonone opportunity for the Irish Applause Music Music in comes Lubin hot goes lacheski 302 left in our first half yeah get him out for that last defensive possession not want to pick up that uh the second foul let him go in with the only that one foul for the last 20 minutes shot is good Wirtz has nine and the penguins are going to take a timeout Music 4336 in favor of Notre Dame and now a message from Works Nitro meatworks Nitro powerful tools for any project with gaslike power without the gas fueled by Power share batteries to give you the power to outperform 302 remaining 4336 inside that penguin huddle head coach Jared Calhoun we talked about him being in his sixth season at the helm an interesting backstory playing for only Mass Amino at Cleveland State and then his longtime association with Bob Higgins yeah good uh good tutelage there and weve shared some stories about uh coach massimino and Ive played in the with the Sixers I lived out in Villanova so got to know him transferred to Cincinnati was a student assistant with Huggins and then moved with Bob to West Virginia its so great to see Bob Huggins finally get that Hall of Fame call in Springfield Applause 336 Music Applause shot clock is off Applause Youngstown gets into it sets and a push by Wertz they had a foul to give so were down to 84 and a side out of bounds for the Penguins KY is going to come back in and the bride to trigger it for the Penguins Applause kohill gives it up McBride little long on the three in the first half ends with Notre Dame on top 4336 and oh well played first half and uh and actually if youre Notre Dame youre happy you know it looked like Youngstown State was really in a Groove offensively but 36 points for them at the half thats a pretty good defensive effort in the last 10 minutes weve reached the break in South Bend on scoring for the Irish lets see for Youngstown State if Malik green and Dwayne cohill can get going in the scoring columns balance that out big drift needs some help out there arnelson Im sorry Applause Music Ryan on the drive Scoops misses and the rebound dude Nelson Ryans hes been quiet hes the one guy for the Irish that has been only one of four now in the game foreign unbelievable shot wow thats a way to introduce yourself to the scoring in the second half and the Russian judge gave that a 995 degree of difficulty 4338 Ryan hooks it back in fact beyond the reach of blusheski so a turnover foreign not the best ratio for Notre Dame in that first half they had seven assists and four turnovers and that was thats something rare with this group a miscommunication between those two well everybody is using that this group is on the same page for the green theres a three ball well the two guys that I mentioned stepping up have made themselves present here early in the second half 4341 Notre Dame words dances through the paint Goodwin gets in close Applause green did not like that call at all he thought he played pretty solid defense but you see they really gave him a clear out to work in that lane area just that one little reach in the right hand on the hip Applause a lot of these guys are shattering the career games played record with all the extra time theyre getting youd think a guy like Kihei Clark up in Virginia good one playing at his 127th game today Rex pflugers the alltime record holder at 141 and you know a few years ago Bob you wondered if those career marks would ever get broken with the one and done so now guys are staying through three different Cycles theyre staying for seven years John Belushi stuff green on the rebound cohill whoa off the shin and Notre Dame gets it Ryan leaves it lachesky had it stripped thats tipped and leaking out ahead of the pack is Nelson Corrals it and dunks it hes got 18 this is illadvised pass to lashewski that started that break down the other end okay Notre Dames lead has been reduced to three lasheski foreign looking to create and lost the handle Music this was more of a function of why thank goodness there was a turnover because I never really got over half court Nelsons gonna pick up a cheapy right there but so far these possessions early on for Notre Dame a lot of oneonone dribbling they seem disjointed yeah not a lot of ball movement not a lot of player movement and Youngstown State looking to take advantage a turnaround by Green nothing hes got a lot of touches here early in the second half theyre trying to get him involved 4643 minutes plus into the second half Starling to the wing and Goodwin hell take the three and make the through Dave Goodwin with 14 his first threepointer of the game well you know and thats the thing that uh Jared Calhoun was worried about this good one coming off a poor shooting night against Bradford you knew that wasnt going to happen again and he looks very comfortable out on the floor catch and shoot three from the corner missed by Covington leaking out good ones nice look ahead that time advancing the basketball Goodwin on the run out after that long jump shot 5143 a little bit of breathing room for the Irish cohill up top to Green to this point in the game Youngstown State has answered all these little runs by Notre Dame Nelson short nasheski Notre Dame outnumbered but Goodwin had a look at the elbow tried to fire that pass and that Alleyway collapsed on him too many hands a bounce pass would have been better where Todd Mays with a tough one and all of a sudden the complexion of this game has changed up and down in this five minutes instead of being played in the half court Music and its way underneath the defense a massive breakdown for Youngstown you know what I dont know if people thought it was a whistle or a timeout literally everybody stopped playing except for lupine Applause Music green relying too much on the three right now its not dropping for the Penguins Starling kicks it into high gear follow is good by Lubin boy and that I think thats where hes going to get his offense on the offensive glass that last cheap one and easy two Notre Dame on a 92 run forces a Youngstown State timeout the Irish open it up to 10 5545 its boating with Mike jaminsky Bob Rath but back at Notre Dame the Irish up now by 10 GMan 5545 and only getting an outscored 129 in the second half but again this game at kind of a Tipping Point right now good time out by Jared Calhoun lets see how they execute coming out of the time out and thats Dane Goodwin William taking a nap down there in the Baseline giving it the Steph Curry treatment Nelson corkscrews connects what a shot by Adrian and go to your guy I mean its uh you know hes he had the hot hand and 20 points for him already in the game a new career high 5547 Applause Music lube and travels he got a little full of himself on that catch I think and again the scoring and another time out at 1414 in the second half Music we are back as Notre Dame has this eightpoint lead at 5547 Youngstown State with the basketball Penguins Mike have found a way to stay in this game yeah and still being five you know 50 percent in the half the three ball has dried up a little bit for him only one of four and have not been to the freethrow line so Notre Dame defending and keeping them off there and wiggling free Adrian Nelson Boy Inside Outside what a versatile game he is showing a transfer from northern Kentucky Pickerington Ohio product having a massive day at Notre Dame starling around it comes to worse cray uses the screen perfectly thats the thing you get you calm one person down for Notre Dame somebody else can step up good one has been carrying the load here in the second half lasheski really hasnt been a factor so far and then Wertz all of a sudden cant you know if he gets restarted a lot of weapons out there for the Irish and then theres the freshmen on the corner Applause elusive rebound but it belongs to Notre Dame Brandon Rush missing that three out of the corner 5749 Applause 13 minute mark poked Away by Nelson single digits on the clock works for three no thats a you know Nelsons coming in on a double double right now but uh and thats a good defensive matchup with him on the sheski because he can hes got the size to match him inside and out another Corner three by McBride Applause Youngstown State four of 15 outside the arc 5749 Applause Music Applause Music corner for starling I think at least right now thats one youll live with with him make him shoot the jump shot and uh since maybe Notre Dame a little more deliberate in the half court now running the clock down trying to shorten this game somewhat six on the shot clock Applause they are looking and thats a five second violation and what happened and Goodwin came out of his shoe he was going to be the outlet with the clock running down when he slipped there was nowhere else to go you know when that when that coming to the ball you have to you have to abandon the play at that point just get the ball inbound unfortunate wardrobe malfunction log turn four NASCAR country 5749 Applause Music Applause rush off the high screen a little pick and roll action and This Time Rush takes it right to the hole for his first field goal heres the lefthander too so finishing with his off hand on that play again the drive available to these guys back to a sixpoint spread and three a big one by Lubin had missed his only one in the first game and uh I dont know that was in the scouting report for him 6051 hes giving them some big points in the second half Nelson answers with a three of his own have a day young man 25 points Id make it 27 points and 10 rebounds and once again it looked like it was getting to these 10 12 points and the Penguins reeled him back in the lane opens up but Goodwin had it bounce out the balls out of bounds to Youngstown childrens tried to tap it out and save it but there was no one there we have a timeout with 10 58 to play Van Halen Lubin its one from Orlando 6054 this is the scene inside Castle Coliseum as the Virginia Tech Hokies get set to take on William and Marion that one coming along for many of you at 6 pm Eastern Time right here Mike young doing a fabulous job there at ACC tournament champions last year um also very active in the portal another old team in the conference Ive seen them in some preseason top 20 polls top 25 polls did a football game once William and Mary at Harvard Music and people in this Mausoleum of a football stadium at Harvard these guys hold up a sheet it says William go home Mary you can stay we might see something like that at Virginia Tech today so you have to tune in at six foreign Applause on the drive rush to nine Notre Dame with numbers Music Applause kind of a delayed call but its going to be against Notre Dame Applause heres the look and again it looked like a drive but tell you what then Allen Lubin has been terrific in the second half yeah hes just lachesky he almost got passed into that turnover he tried to avoid the block but his forward momentum carry him right into the defender and one theyre just theyre just clearing out lanes and letting guys put their head down and if youre Notre Dame the guys are getting into their strong hand to that right hand you got to sit there make them beat you with a weakness heres the look you see the the middle of the lane is wide open guys are just attacking Coal Hill was six looking for seven and a chance to cut it to three Applause Music hes done a good job at the line six for eight coming in threepoint play here Notre Dame with words they front the post nothing there and a foul coming as Ryan launched the three yeah not a great play at all by McBride doing a bail a guy that was going to be a tough shot for Cormac Ryan Music plus you know plus the guy too whos hes struggling a little bit Bob and you dont want to give him any kind of Rhythm he goes through the freethrow line maybe knocks down three finds something a new shot a little bit more confidence and you wake him up Music coming up our fast break future presented by your local Ford dealer second shot Applause Music Ryan is the guy who hit the go ahead layup with 95 to lift the Irish to victory over Radford at 10 points and thats rebounded the cash is in at the line 6357 and hes the most vocal guy of this group uh you know the leader really came on strong in the second half of last year man weve got a foul coming on Ryan foreign Applause first right now teams are pretty far away from the bonus Youngstown State only two team fouls Notre Dame that was their third Music halfway through the second half Music Rush steps back lets it fly moscheski rebounds Applause Music Applause Music words this ones a turnover McBride Music Applause trips and falls and a travel and even off that turnover really nice transition defense by Notre Dame got bodies back there was nowhere for McBride to go and he winds up tripping and traveling the crossover without the over Applause Applause a good one to the bench scarling over the timeline sixman rotation in this second half for Notre Dame JJ rolled it off the rim rebound done Applause Music Applause Todd scores and in that instance you know I talked about forcing guys to their to their weak hand but when youre running downhill and you know he had momentum its tough to defend that and get in the position Music Starling off the screen Music second half and they take it away on the run out here in the second block what a defensive play another shoe mishap for Notre Dame but that would have cut it to two this is a save this is out of nowhere too great hustle coming back Applause great block by Lubin Applause Music nine points hes perfect four or four from the floor two blocks three rebounds for the freshman with the rebound Applause as a freshman that you game the coachs confidence with play like this Music Applause head down driving blocked done with the beauty pushing Rattan Mays to the corner Rush thats a three its a onepoint game Applause first three of the game for Brandon Rush 6362 Penguins on an 113 run Applause Music luccheski Applause Ryan Thompson Applause a free throw when we come back foreign Applause Music presented by your local Ford dealer the new basketball season is upon us and the North Carolina Tar Heels pick number one Mike in the ACC but you know what Bob the core back but everythings different this year and Brady manic not there and Pete Nance is going to have to incorporate himself into that but pretty nice place to start off coming off a national championship run not bad at all and Armando Bay caught his prime to dominate yeah hes a double double machine last year maybe a little less offense this year with more people scoring around him but he has a load inside they caught off to a great start already the preseason rookie of the year is this guy Derek Lively from duke 71 out of Philadelphia very active great athlete and Dukes still rolling out a great Freshman Class year after year and as you look at the preseason pole bike we had a chance to see Virginia in the early going I came away impressed Friday night how about you yeah Ben Van Der plast is a guy theyre going to work into the lineup through the portal gives them a nice big outside threat dont sleep on Miami either but that that top four are very very strong and thats gonna do it early in the second half Notre Dame and a 10point lead Mike but Youngstown State has hung in there the word Brazilian comes to mind me there are times when this game could have gotten out of shape but uh Penguins answering it every turn in the second half its been different guys too I mean they really you know have relied a lot on Nelson in that first half but theyve had some good balance around him green coal hill rush all picking up the pace somewhat but Nelsons still 25 in the game Youngstown three of ten on threes in the second half Ryan finishes off the oldfashioned threepoint play to make it 6662 7 40 left and to the bucket one more time Brandon Rush its just beating him off the dribble yeah great spin back to his off hand crossed by the lack of you know Lube in the side the shop locking in there the rim is open foreign Applause back to a fourpoint game theres a sale in aisle five on both ends of the floor Applause Rush again this time to nine muscheski threw up the roadblock foreign Applause Music Applause off the screen Applause see anytime Machesky sets the screen out there you have to honor him so thats what makes that play tough it gives their Shooters a different look he cant get any help off of that that being said I think the Don has done a nice job on lashewski defensively three ball Miss by Green 610 left in a sixpoint game Applause Music Applause Music good one nearly turned right into a double team but escaped five in the shot clock good one and the rebounding in that possession Bob Coal Hill 43 and Youngstown State refuses to go away and they come down they scored in four seconds on that you see of course the long three on one end and you pick up points six point swing right there 70 67 good one elbow jumper thats no good then a foul on Youngstown makes that happen because he fights for the offensive glass and force Dunn in the wow first on will heres the look you see that run up the floor and thats just just reading the play cohill saying hey I got a good look at it theres some pretty good coverage on the board inside and you see Ryan right there trying to point out and say hey somebody get that guy well Mike Adrian Nelson has had his rest and he is back in now for Youngstown it is go Time game on in South Bend 70 67 five minutes and 10 seconds remain hes got a nice rest there and then you also have a timeout coming in under four so good clock management for his court time Ryan oh try to reverse it got it back through his legs and its out of bounds jumps down ball so like a Larry Bird type pass right there coming down the lane but could tell you what quick Hands by Youngstown State bails him out heres the look right here I mean this looks like an easy bucket thats pretty creative through the wickets with good call Hill and a foul Youngstown State the recipient of only six foul shots in this game and they will get two very big ones right here for Dwayne cohill foreign has six assists 12 points five of ten shooting and hes one of two at the line hes coming back from an ACL as well in 2021 the former Dayton flyer putting it in for his 13th point this to cut it to one with 4 39 Applause now the last thing you want to do in your own building is give the other team and uh you know States created their own hope great take beautiful laying by words and were going to time out for Notre Dame Trey wurtz now with 13 and a threepoint Advantage for the home standing Irish back to South Bend after this Music this is your secret to a deliciously easy discover the best presented by The Fresh Market huge games each way uh Adrian Nelsons been fantastic a double double for him uh 25 very efficient shooting in uh for a good one 10 of those points in the second half he has a great bounce back game from Bradford Roos one of eight from the floor also doing it on the glass seven rebounds for him but Bobby that time out again short bench clock management youve got another timeout coming under four here so Mike gray trying to get some rest for his troops in the last uh three four minutes of the game both teams sitting there with two timeouts remaining off the crossover coat Hill no fights for his own Miss and its won by his teammate stepping into the three is done no too long and then lasheskis hit the face Loveless that time just a little uh a little too over anxious to get the turnover still only uh five team fouls for Youngstown State heres the look you know that situation I mean hell learn that but youre not going to get that ball get back in transition get back and set defensively instead of giving up a cheap foul Applause four minutes left Music starling Music good one into the paint left hand good his career high is 27 hes got 20 today Applause 74 269 possessions get bigger now for the Penguins and it is going to be a turnover just dribbled himself into a turnover that time Applause staggered screen for words covered pretty well by Youngstown Applause Music Starling Twisted turning and scoring wow Applause really really impressive off the dribble this one rolls off for Covington but he will shoot two free throws with that being said Bob thats just a little bit too fast going back after a made basket I mean for Youngstown spread at them they got the ball in quickly back up the floor really put a lot of pressure on Notre Dame after a made layup miles Hunter is going to check in in a moment for Youngstown Applause Garrett Covington first time at the line today two for two for the season 258 remaining Music out of the game goes well done who really has done a nice job defensively on luccheski thats been a good matchup for them Applause five points for Covington Penguins down five jumps down picking up the pressure taking a little time off the clock Applause good one Applause waits for the screen its down on the switch and a loose ball take it away by Youngstown State and a drive and a lay it is good by Lovelace wow what an athletic play makes to get the turnover out front see why Jared Calhoun is high on that freshman warts at midfloor being harassed by kohio Music good one worse a little show and go Corner three good by Starling timeout Youngstown states welcome to Notre Dame yeah and talk about a confidence boost for this guy I mean the book on him Im sure let him settle for the jump shot but hes had a couple of Threes in this game now Youngstown State was scrapping and they picked the pocket of Goodwin and look at the athleticism yeah just this finish I thought that late father was going to throw him off some but that was terrific conversion look at this wide open good driving pitch Notre Dame players in double figures and Lubin sitting there with nine so really balanced offense that pushes the Notre Dame lead to six with a minute 54 to play and theyre theyre probably how we how do we kill these guys keeps on coming back 154 left Youngstown down to its final timeout Notre Dame has two left and each team with five fouls Applause cohill gets loose and scores again theres a wellconceived sideline out of bounds play out of that timeout theyve really done a nice job coming out of those Notre Dame trying to get it over in time and beat the 10second count 7975 youll need to foul here just solid D Applause a minute 23 starling still during the shoot going under on that screen is another one they went under on that screen daring him to shoot they didnt want the drive and he is answered with two big threes the first McDonalds AllAmerica to come to Notre Dame since Demetrius Jackson in 2013 theyve been waiting for his arrival and he has punctuated that arrival today Music heres the look you see theyre going to set those late screens La chesky altering it a little bit hes got a big guy on him Nelson not wanting to come out and pressure the shot Big Time jump shot right there Bob with one on the shot clock yep when it went through Music Starling is a darling in South Bend 8275 117 left and youre right about Youngstown State they are harder to kill than Rasputin again I I just have loved their execution theyre coming out of the timeout they got the drive the last time I I still think you know if you can get a quick hitter get it down to five you dont need a three right now the thing for uh Notre Dame theyve got to be ready now for full court pressure you know Im sure after a made basket that you know that Youngstown State is going to come after them back to back threes with the game on the line for JJ starling Music Youngstown State has to go 94 feet on the inbounds here after the Irish timeout 117 to play 8275 Applause Music Applause clock starts on the touch so Youngstown State Notre Dame not pressuring so buy some time inside Nelson now on the cut well executed wash half 8275 and Notre Dame beats the pressure now Goodwin Waits all Five Guys for Notre Dame pretty good ball handlers this is a tough team to pressure Music Applause Im gonna play this one straight up knock them into the foul game yet words nobody home well I just everybody for Notre Dame above the freethrow line Applause 8477 Rush going up left hand though has it shot clocks off now they get the foul to stop the clock on Adrian Nelson still only 16 fouls so one more before they could put them on the line Music here you see to everybody of the just the high screen role there and theres just no help everybody above the freethrow line Music Notre Dame thing here just be aggressive coming to the basketball to receive Applause Music and the foul on Nelson will go to the other end for a 11 for lecheski it had 28 and 12 for Radford hes got another double double today 12 and 10 well I dont know if he scored in the second half he has not Applause but he can help salt it away right here 195 left Applause what do you want so a Bakers Dozen for Nate Notre Dames up eight and boy credit the Penguins no quit in the men of Jared Calhoun second shot 8677 go Hill downhill and scores time out was 134 last time out Applause 8679 is our score Notre Dame trying to send these guys back to Ohio with what will be for the Irish a pretty hardearned win here today and uh you know I I think coming into this game they felt like the they had it put up over 80 against the team and you know for Youngstown theyve got a chance to to break that Mark coming into a you know they came in averaging 90 points so this is a pretty good offensive showing for them just other guys in uh for you know for Mike Bray other guys than lacheski stepped up and took up the scoring load in the second half you know cant underestimate those nine points from Lubin thats a you know Goodwin bounces back with a 20point effort for him you know Ryan after a slow first half 11 works with 15 starling 17 six of those huge those backtoback threes down the stretch tell you what it is I said it earlier if he starts knocking down threes oh yeah how do you guard that guy overall Notre Dame has shot 60 percent from the field and 53 percent from three and 12 of 13 from the line and theyre fighting for their lives here in this game 137 full court pressure by the Penguins Applause Music man the reach sends Cormac Ryan to the line were down to 127 William and Marriott Bridget in the tech many of you will get that game at the top of the hour six Eastern Time Music as you mentioned Mike a strong second half looks at a oneonone and its still it was still basically a sixperson rotation you know Zona getting in when was dinged up a little bit in the first half but that was only for a few minutes Applause 8879 Youngstown State does not have a timeout Nelson gets two more to add to his impressive afternoon of 29 Points three seconds two one thats it Notre Dame gets the win to go to 20 heck of a game yeah no I mean for Youngstown State Im very very nice showing you know all right step up in competition maybe youre not going to be able to score as much come in here give them 81 points but the Notre Dame good balance offense across the board didnt have to lean on lachevski nearly as much as they did in the game against Bradford and we have to salute Adrian
