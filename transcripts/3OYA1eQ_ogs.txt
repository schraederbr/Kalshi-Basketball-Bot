more with that thought and we are ready to rock here at the tuck Florida State with the opening possession between the Dolphins and the Seinals Martin Sville will bring it up into the half court set for FSU Robert McCrae drives the baseline back up top to Wiggins Makes the extra pass Somerville finds front iron and there is Chanty Wiggins to Clemson transfer giving Florida State a fresh opportunity here right out of the gates Steam strong drive to the bucket will draw some contact and an early foul called against Lockett Jr Well take a look at FSU starting five Somerville McCrae and Jones around the front court of Wiggins and Steam for Luke LS And you saw right there Sean the work they were doing in shoot around today with Steen attacking doing that handoff but if they give it to you drive to the basket And he took it right down there and drew the foul First free throw attempt was everything but drop for Steam Number 25 in white for Florida State The transfer out of Florida Southern comes in shooting north of 70 from the charity strike 0 for two cheering And so here come the Dolphins Well take a look at their starting five Wood Lockett Jr Sturk Boreio and Caparazzo makes his first start of the season 7footer is going to be a difference maker for Jacksonville or at least so the Dolphins hook There he is with it at the top of the key Hes been coming along Sean His size can really make a difference in this game but hes going to have to be physical Tried to slip to the basket Robert McCrae the fifth was all over him Steen skies for the rebound And here come the NLES Steen is a rebounding machine especially on offense McCrae the fifth showing off his range early going and the NL strike first The former teammate there Jacksonville transfer two You know he wants to get off going smoking hot tonight Sean he knocking down that first three not a good sign for JU an incredibly talented scorer over his career with the Dolphins showing what he can do as a facilitator as well this year under Luke LZ the first year head coach at Florida State a twotime NBA champion on the coaching staff with Golden State from 2017 to 2021 most recently with the Kings And he himself knows what it takes to win at this level as an ACC champion under Leonard Hamilton back in 2012 And what he wants his team to do is what he did at Sacramento State is work on their defense Thats a big focus hes had these last two games The take the Dolphins deep into the shot clock here That didnt catch anything and Steam brings it down for FSU Would have been a shot clock violation anyway Wiggins will tee up a three Frantic pace here to start The NLES with an early three They lead it by three after the first couple of minutes of play Now Barazzo gives it up to Lockett Jr the transfer from Boise State cheering Now theres Sturk up top swinging it to Wood the freshman off the turnaround on the baseline Nice looking shot there from Wood Wood the freshman Coach Mitzy was talking about him at shoot around today about how surprised he is the impact hes made coming in fresh out of high school Its been a real positive surprise averaging eight points per game Wiggins draws contact trying to corral the basketball Thatll be the second personal call against the Dolphins And for a freshman to have this poise to penetrate and realize not to try to force it take the little step back in the short corner Youve got to be excited Thats such a good step for these guys We got a little fun going on over there Sean Mincys not happy with it Wood and Steam having a little conversation By the way that foul I referenced was called on Enrico Boreio His first the second for the Dolphins as a team And a bump right in front of Jacksonvilles bench on the three ball attempt out of the corner Martin Somerville will head to the line to shoot some free throws for Florida State Good screen by Jones And then Somerville who can really shoot it He sold that contact but you know thats a heady play You know hes a good shooter and hes clean Hes made a three I think in every game this season Certainly has Hes made a three in the vast majority of the games in his career Somerville the sophomore out of Maryland good on the first free throw attempt shooting at 762 from the charity stripe so far this season is head coach Luke Gls looking on But just to sort of circle back to that point you were making there Jacob he has made a three in each of the last 40 games of his career Hes played in 44 hes made a three in 43 and hes a 40 threepoint shooter career Hes down at like 39 right now but you know he just needs more shots honestly So theres a lot of guys pulling the trigger here for Florida State So you get as many as you maybe want He makes all three of his free throws and Florida State leads it by four Sturk steps into a deep three Corowled by Somerville The Nolles have had the rebounding edge in each of their last four contests It had been a spot of bother majority of nonconference play for the Garnet in gold Something that they have taken steps forward in here of late McCrae down the lane draws three defenders and is short on the turnaround And you know JU leads the A in rebounding and rebounding margin So they really think that they can make something happen in this game And thats what Mincy talked about Coach Mitch was saying he wants to dominate the offense and the defensive rebounds tonight Nearly lost the handle there You nailed that Florida State has stepped up there rebounding not only just Steams rebounding but the whole team But Somerville trying to rebound a steal You cant just rip it out of his hand You got to got to take your time So the foul called against Somerville Thatll give us a chance to take a look at Jordan Mincy in year number five at the helm in Jacksonville The 2022 Joby Hall award winner awarded to the top first year head coach in division 1 basketball when he took over in Duval County Led the Dolphins to a 21 win season Got him all the way to the conference title game In fact Borio nearly lost the handle and went over the back with it And Robert McCrae the fifth was cheering a scoring machine in that run to the conference championship game two years ago for Jacksonville Wood got all three of those right in front of FSUs bench And there is the pleasant surprise the freshman and everyday starter And Wood and right back at you three more for the Seinals Both of these teams like to shoot the ball and when Chanty Wiggins is knocking it down thats a really good thing for Luke L But both of these teams are shooting it over 30 times a game Florida States number two in the country in threepoint attempts But Mity said hed rather get the ball inside tonight than Jack Threes cheering Traveling violation down there on the low block by Rivers who subbed in off the bench at that last stoppage Speaking of we got another one coming here in Tallahassee the leading 54 But praises to give him telling me how hard of a worker he is how humble of an athlete he is He also complimented the staff here at Florida State Coach Lous of course Coach Fly who also made that move over from Jacksonville Just really complimenting that young man and his success here guys Thank you very much Ansley and to your point remarked about just the kind of guy that Robert McCrae V is complimented that and then also said that there is value in surrounding yourself with the right people and that he is rooting for him here at Florida State where he certainly has done just that Turnover by the Seinals up by four Just over 15 minutes remaining here in this first half 5 minutes in Wheeler will tee up a three found back iron Kobe McGee skies for the rebound for the seminals This is part of that lineup that I think Mitzy wants to get the ball inside in with Rivers in there in third kill Nice work by Bong off the offensive glass Bong really is coming along Hes had a couple good games back to back career high in rebounds Career high in points in the last two games Seven rebounds 10 points on Friday night but looking a little shaky right now Its going to take him a few minutes Hes a freshman like coach Laugh said Hes got to work through the kinks Went up there and got it in traffic Then promptly had it knocked away for the turnover Lead still four for Florida State Lock it Jr guarded well by Le Jones Another empty possession by the Dolphins were shooting just 28 from the floor McCrae the fifth nearly lost the handle Miles all kinds of time to set his feet and cash in from the top of the key Picking up where he left off on Friday Cam Miles kind of got in the groove and thats what LS talked about at shoot round today He said that when Miles is popping out there you can see it in the way he walks around on the court Its going to be a tough night for the defense Florida State as a team has teed up five threes That is no surprise But what the Nles will be excited about is they have made three of them And you know you better check out the scouting report This guy can shoot the ball Theres nobody within 8 ft of him No ones flying at him He going to shoot you out the gym if you do that to Cam Miles but this has been a really good defensive game so far These guys are getting up under each other You talked about the Jacksonville shooting percentages Lets talk about Florida States half court defense right now One of the things coach LS has really harked on these guys defending and keeping the ball out of the paint Theyve done a great job but they did break down and give Lockett that attack shot at the rim with the foul Foul called on to Mab Basong So the first free throw make there by Lockett Jr ended a 2 and 12 minute scoring drought In fact to your point there Jacob and just to sort of revisit what coach Lags was talking about in that tough stretch for Florida State where they racked up a few losses in a row he called the issues he said that they were selfinflicted but they were also selfcorrectable Absolutely And its like he said its just like just stop your man Just get in front of somebody and guard them you know dont have pride in your defense and help your teammate on rotation Miles strong drive Empty possession though for the NLES Good defense by the Dolphins Its that size of the Dolphins Theyre the biggest team in the Aon and thats what Mit does He wants a different team than everybody else Its a guard driven league but hes got his setup with bigs down low and they causing a problem down the road for those short guards from Florida State driving in now cheering Nobody home on what JU was hoping would be a high low look You know ball pressure If you put pressure on the ball handler he cant see you and make a good pass and and then you cover your guys Your teammates got to do their job And thats what Florida States doing right now No field goals in over three minutes for Jacksonville who brings the pressure now on Florida State Great ball movement up ahead to Bassong The NLES beat that pressure and find the open man Its all about knowing where your teammates are And its one of the things that that Jim Moran Florida States associate head coach was talking about that in shoot around today The bigs stay up high when you catch that high post ball Do not go below the free throw line so that the teammate can flash from the corner which is exactly what Chanty Wigan stayed high and Basson flash low for the dunk 147 Florida State a really positive start to this game for the Garnet and the gold Nice athletic rebound in traffic yet again Bong into the paint Florida State swings it to Wiggins for three more Hey they missed that shot But Sean thats some beautiful ball movement Balls get stuck sometimes This Florida State team plays so unselfish on the perimeter and swinging the ball around Im not sure if they have taken a bad shot yet They have afforded themselves a multitude of really nice looks shooting 40 from the floor Beyond that from the perimeter and that has been a really impressive aspect Now the 10th team rebound compared to five for JU Somerville knocks in the three and Florida State just cannot miss from the bonusphere right now Look at that ball defense Theyre everywhere Florida State is rotating closing out and skying for the rebound as well That was a key on both these coaches talking about wanting to win the rebounding WAR AND WIN THAT WAR AT THE RIM TOM Baong to Baong getting it done on both sides of the floor and that will extend the Seolles lead to 12 What a start for Florida State screaming Hey if you run the floor your teammates are going to work with you And whoa you better get out the way cuz Tom Bong is looking for the rim I think we got a shot clock situation Sean Hes getting it corrected after they got loose ball They probably reset it I think thats what happened And Florida State does come away with the live ball turnover Somerville at the logo 20 seconds to operate here Steen comes up to set the screen Jacksonville brings the double Leaves Kobe McGee open in the corner That is strong but coraled on the weak side by the freshman Miles McGee strong take and will draw contact and a personal had a good look in the corner He was shooting it in shoot around today but hes wide open right there but puts it on the floor And I like him going at the big man Not worried about his size Straight into the chest of Caparazzo and just getting the foul on the big man Chance to add to the 12point lead Florida State is on a 70 run over the last 2 and 12 minutes Jacksonville without a point for the last three and a half minutes For all that has gone right for Florida State so far there have been a few misses there at the charity strike You mentioned it earlier McGee was filling it up in shootound Made 12 consecutive threes at one point In fact rocking those cheetah print shoes Those are pretty fly They have to send Anley over to find out what this they make him any quicker Well find out soon enough Hes going to take a breather for the moment though Quickly got him to the bench Exactly Florida State dials up the pressure themselves Steam got a hand in there and knocked it into the bench Itll remain with the Dolphins But how about that defensive intensity yet again Jacob Spot on with that Sean But also you know Minty was telling us and we know this and Coach Laps got the same problem Minces got six transfers and five freshman all new players Theyre still trying to find out who they are and and stay drilled down on Mincys focus where he had talked about they went and changed a little bit offensively lately and hes trying to get them back ready for conference play which is punching the ball down low in the paint not shooting threes But this defense is on fire tonight for Florida State cheering is kicked out of play I believe off of McCrae the fifth foot Itll remain with Jacksonville but with only 3 seconds on the shot clock They got a quick shot opportunity They may try to go at the rim here but you can still catch and shoot with 3 seconds maybe even one dribble Sturk will send it in Caparazzo defended by two seminals Its a shot clock violation Deans like Hold on now Thats another stat You taking my rebound That dude crashes the glass I love me some Alex Ste now has a couple of boards Jacksonville brings the double once again Steen keeps it alive for Florida State Somerville pull up off back iron Lea Jones crashes the glass Goals reset with Robert McCrae the fifth 10 to work with Somerville How about a fourpoint play Got it Got it right there again Somerville drawing those fouls And just crashing the glass keeping that bad boy active And Somerville is such a savvy player Thats twice tonight hes drawn a foul and stayed focused on the rim to deliver that threepoint attempt With a free throw make hell be the first to double figures And he is two for four from the floor Both from three Was fouled in the act of shooting a three made all three of those free throws and then cashes in the fourpoint play there Lockett Jr gets it up to Borio Back to Lockett Jr and Florida State is just flying around defensively The way theyre switching jumping to the ball and cheering if thats the best shot that Jacksonville can dial up that is a testament to what the Nullles are doing on this side of the floor My goodness And we saw it on Friday and youre seeing it again today LS has driven that home He has been harping on it since they got on the plane in Dayton And really before that but once they got on that plane in Dayton he was drilled down on defense The three of the fifth into the painted area Kicks it to Wiggins Sturk out to guard Robert Back out to Somerville Why not YES SIR hit the little man Thats a big thing McCrae does so well He sees his teammates He got in the paint and could have got a shot up Unselfishly kicked that thing out to Somerville for that open three FSU as a team six of 12 Somerville three of five cheering It remains with Jacksonville But now they got to scramble Sturk discards Wiggins will make the three and end the run But FSU defensively held the Dolphins scoreless for over five minutes 17 point lead for FSU as we head to the under eight immediate timeout Came in here as a shooter Hes the unsung shooter of the group that got brought in because they really talk about him as a point guard you know but they they starting him kind of at the point with McCrae but he can shoot the ball His size may hurt him in the ACC but its not hurting him tonight Deflection there by the Dolphins on the inbounds play remains with Florida State Daggers from deep I like that Jacob Telling you they hurt too cuz they go straight to the heart Three of five from the bonusphere for Somerville by the way 15 points against UMass down in Sunrise is his season high Hes run it up to 26 going back to his freshman year at UMass Lowel against NJIT That would be the career high of course So behind Somerville who drives all the way to the bucket kicks it to Miles Heres McCrae the 15 up a three off front iron Florida State is off to an impressive start leading by 17 Wiggins got a hand in there Deflected it Wiggins so long and tall up there Thats a big problem for Sturk with that own ball defense Sturk made a three to put an end to an over fiveminute scoreless drought And Florida States going to get whistled for the foul underneath the basket Trying to set up the high low Sean good job by Jacksonville What they ended up doing with some switching they got Chanty Wiggins the big man on the force duck up high And then when they realized that they got their big man rolling low Caparo Caparazzo and got him rolling down and the guards had to foul him not to give up the dunk Charles Caparazzo the Jo transfer from Comyville Community College a guy that his head coach Jordan Mincy says has been really turning the corner here of late cheering Shark on the drive kicks it back Taparazzo lays it and discards Tomas Bassong and there is that sevenfooter going to work Great job sealing Bassong on the top side so he couldnt get down there to defend and McCrae just kind of swiped at him trying to help Miles off the wing finds back iron and Florida State goes to work on the offensive glass again Robert McCrae the fifth not happy with this pass Its picked off by Sh or excuse me Sturk And here come the Dolphins You know thats a smart point guard Hes keeping up with his stats internally and his turnovers Thats his first turnover of the night with his three assists for McCrae cheering just active hands Thats another thing that LAS they chart We dont really talk about it because he doesnt tell us what their numbers are but they chart deflections They want deflections Thats why theyre leading the league in steals and and one of the top teams in the country in stealing the ball is with their active hands Heavy ball pressure Theyll get in the passing lanes Theyll mix up the man in the zone Do a little bit of everything Hes called it organized chaos if you will What a fight for the rebound here between the Dolphins and the Seinals Itll be a tie up and remain with JU In comes Alex Steen and Kobe McGee for Wiggins and Le Jones You know on that last possession Chris Ary has had a good look and hes a 40 39 40 threepoint shooter himself and said put some big numbers up this year as a sophomore but cheering he cant get his shot off with this defense flying around Got a dolphin down there stepping out of bounds in the corner I couldnt tell who had the ball That was Rivers who stepped out Florida State brought the double and forces the turnover McGee gets it to Steen Dumps it off to Miles Has it knocked away Sturk forcing another FSU turnover Locket Jr to the corner and Aras did get a shot off that time Found back iron Here comes McCrae The fifth Steen looks to run the floor now looking to get it up top BONG ALL THE WAY TO THE BUCKET AND one for the freshman Tom Bong Sean thats his strength is attacking the rim He can make a jump shot but you can see when he caught that thing he knew on that rotation he had a lane in front and was going straight for the front of the rim He just goes right by the defender uses his body with the contact The way he just extends that left arm staying with it keeps an eye on the rim A lot of good things ahead for that Frenchman Seven points now for Toma Song to go along with three rebounds And he is a guy much like Kim Miless fellow freshman that Luke Lou was telling us he thinks is really starting to round the corner Its exactly what he said He needs them to cross this bridge so to speak as a freshman as theyre about to go into ACC play And hes about to cross that bridge Sonia got me all hyped And it was almost freshman feeding freshman But it was Miles who got a hand in there to force the turnover and he tried to feed Bong They better be careful This might turn into a feed and frenzy cuz great play by another freshman from Jacksonville And Sturk has made some other plays to rip that ball loose off of Asans leg Evan Sturk 34 brings it up into the half court here for Jacksonville How good has he been defensively these last few FSU possessions Aras will tee up another three that doesnt hit anything An air ball by one of the most reliable perimeter shooters the Dolphins have MCGEE BUMPED ON the way up and one yet again for Florida State Not a norm of a possession for McGee cuz hes really a shooter But really smart play if its going to open up down there Go get what theyll give you This unselfish play Cam Miles with the feed to McGee and he just goes right into Rivers Rivers got to make it Rivers 610 Hes got to knock McGee off his off his block Dont give that layup 20point lead for the Seinals with five minutes to play here at everybody No ones been a defensive weakness for Florida State And thats one of the things that La has been harping on But their on ball defense their rotations their health theyre everywhere they need to be And thats why theres 12 points on the board for Jacksonville because of the defense They cant get a good shot And Jacksonville has been limited on the glass Theyre one of the better rebounding teams in the A Sun And in terms of offensive rebounds specifically they only have one So its limited their opportunities to rack up second chance points which considering the heavy ball pressure the Seminals have applied would be so incredibly vital And one of the keys to the game that my talked to us about was they needed to control the offensive glass And one is not where he wanted it to be FSU meanwhile six offensive rebounds 17 for the game The song brings down number 18 for the NLES Jacksonville pressures him on the far sideline Steen beats third kill and Alex Steen lays it in The Steen machine is where he needs to be every time He runs down the far go short corner and waits on the ball He is such a team player Never complains just plays hard every time 3512 Florida State with four minutes left here in the half That is a much needed and one for Jacksonville Great job going into Bangs chest when he went into him Just a contact forces his arm to come down You see that thing bend down His right arm came down on top of Lockett Jr and its putting him at the free throw line all night long So Chris Lackett Jr the sophomore from New Orleans spent his two previous seasons at Boise State red shirted his first year averaged three points and a rebound and a half a season ago He scored 10 or more in half of Jacksonvilles games this season Hes a good looking athletic guard Hes going to wreak havoc in the AON with those longer arms Hes got that athletic build and he has been trending offensively of late I mentioned those 10 plus scoring outputs four in the last five games In fact Somerville lined another one up gets his own miss gets it to Miles and Miles finds back iron Steam nearly still kept it alive for the Seoles but here come the Dolphins nonetheless Steam had that bad boy reeled in till it got shoved in the back Dont call me a homer I saw that foul 20point lead for Florida State Miles nearly knocked it away but his fellow freshman Wood is able to evade and drop in the midrange jumper Seven points now for Wood Thats some good recruiting Springdale Arkansas is where Hayden Woods from to get into Jacksonville Florida Jones falling away misses the triple Florida State keeps the possession alive Steen in the interior Somerville guarded by Sturk cheering and an offensive foul called against the Seinals Its going to go against Alex Steen The Nullles lead at 18 at the under four immediate timeout State in all sorts of ways his ability to tack to rim tonight and go inside Hes really made an offensive statement down low Seven points and five assists rebounds Florida State as a team has made 11 shots from the floor nine assists on them cheering Theyve moved the ball around while theyve gotten to work defensively as well Sean they are theyre the deflection Theyre theyre going to set a record for the season on the deflection Theyre tipping every pass that goes by These dudes arent thinking about their turkey and dressing and presents under the tree quite yet Theyre worried about this present Caparazzo thinking about a turnaround opportunity He banks that through and the lead is down to 16 Florida State without a point in the last couple of minutes Jacksonville on their best run here in this first half Theyre on a 70 burst over the last minute and a half Wiggins fouled on the way up Ball got stuck a little bit I I all night long theyve been kicking that ball out and throwing it around the w perimeter to get an easier weak side shot Looks like Wiggins was pretty focused on trying to get that shot up against the big man down low So a couple of free throws coming for Chanty Wiggins one of several seniors who transferred into this FSU program who earlier this season Jacob really had it going offensively but as the NLES struggled for a few games he did in particular And Luke LZ who you see on screen said really just the value of seeing shots fall really just builds the confidence of the team set aside who the opponent was The value of seeing shots fall makes a difference Well as you could see if you watched him play Friday night against Mississippi Valley State he went to the rim to get his baskets You know LS had told him he needed to go get some baskets Quit trying to shoot threes quit trying to shoot those deep shots and he did a good job in the first half against Mississippi Valley State attacking the rim And its such a confidence builder as a shooter just see the ball go through the net and then that makes those jump shots a lot easier from the struggles to leading FSU in scoring in their last contest to be specific with 16 against Mississippi Valley State Thats been the story here of Wiggins of late Thats that defense Sean you just watched right there Borio is shooting 35 from three and hes throwing up a couple air balls because these guys are closing out so hard Wood tes up a three That doesnt catch anything Still live shot clock cheering applause Itll go to Florida State Nothing is coming easy here for Jacksonville Not at all Theyre they came in and had a great practice this morning I was thinking that we may see bit of an upset coming in But youre not going to upset the way these Florida State seinals are playing hard But Jay Jones is just not going to let the freshman Sturk get it And he got caught over the back Second personal on Sturk Florida State now in the double bonus So two free throws the rest of the way for the Garnet and Gold And Le Jones who is only teed up one shot from the floor will now jump into the scorers column at the free throw line And LS talks about Jones as being such a tough toughminded kid for him that hes not you know he doesnt get caught up in his stats but he does want more out of him He He talks about his big four He needs all four of those big four contributing especially three of them or so for them to be the team they want to be as theyre going into the ACC play And Im talking about his veterans when I say the big four Wiggins McCrae McGee and Jones Back the other way Lockett Jr banks it off the glass And speaking of those veterans theres one of them Johny Wiggins Florida State made six of their first 12 threes They were over their last five before that Lockett Jr behind the screen 12 second differential Le Jones steps into a three Jones a shooter himself when he can get his rhythm and get focused Hes shooting at a 32 a clip himself And just like that the Nullles have doubled up the Dolphins here in this first half JU can close it out if they choose to do so The freshman Sturk Looks like that is his intent Would his fellow freshman on the drive met by Jones on the baseline and knocked out of play by Kobe McGee remains with the Dolphins but with just 3 seconds remaining Great job with both those guys McGee and Jones to work together to use that baseline to kind of trap him so he couldnt go anywhere and not let him turn the corner Getting some big man subs coming in right here defensively with Bang and Ste to take away any try to score at the brim right now here with 3 seconds on the clock Sean Sturk gets it in and a foul called inside the final second of this half Rivers fouled on the way up Will shoot free throws for JU Its going to go against Alex Dean Itll be his second Rivers did a good job going hard and selling the contact to get that foul to put him at the free throw line But at a 54 clip this could be entertaining Junior from Columbia South Carolina misses the first I got to watch him play a couple games last year I called a couple J games in Jacksonville and Rivers did some phenomenal work and and really had some breakout games late And thats one of the things Mincy was talking about with Rivers He feels like Rivers is going to have a really strong run through the AON because of how his bodys filled out and developed and how much hes worked offensively Knocked around and that tap wont go either And that will take us to the half What a half it was for Florida Tucker Center Holiday hoops continuing as the AON meets the ACC in the battle of the I 10 schools Jacksonville and Florida State gets underway once more Shawn Davidson alongside Jacob Rdenhower Ansley Top Chickic the third member of our team as Le Jones tease up a three immediately here in Tallahassee And with this stoppage thatll give us a chance to check in with Ansley who spoke with Jordan Mincy at the half Yeah Sean And I asked him How do you want your guys to respond He said they got to play Jacksonville basketball a level of toughness confidence He said some of my guys are doing that Theres about five that look like theyre still on the bus Guys thank you very much Ansley And speaking of toughness Sturk has been one of the tougher defenders but that is personal number three Jacob and Sean I mean Sean Ansley just said it and Minty said it himself He thinks some of his guys are already on the bus you know and thats what he was worried about tonight is intensity and focus in playing his game and not getting ready for the break Well see if there is an uptick in the intensity here as Alex Steen off the turnaround gets the scoring started in this second half for Florida State Its whether they can get a shot off is really the thing or how good a shot because theyre getting some shots off Theyre just not getting good looks Just eight made shots in this game for Jacksonville and theyve only shot five free throws as well Wood has been a bright spot He cheed up the three from the corner Did everything but drop Wiggins pushes the tempo back the other way for Florida State Heres McCrae the fifth strong with the right hand Gets the layin to go and had a little uh secret he needed to tell Lockett Jr as he was running by him up the floor But you could tell he was trying to get to the rim on that one He was trying to get it faster Six assists four rebounds now five points for Robert McCrae the fifth finding different ways to impact the game as he so often has this season Heres Sturk again with three fouls and his fellow freshman Wood up top The sevenfooter is fouled Caparazzo will shoot some free throws Fouled I believe by Chanty Wiggins And were talking about the senior from Columbia South Carolina So unselfish to give it to Steen and just getting this look But he said Not this time I want to get my look Sean Im getting in the bucket But the the senior such a good pick up for Luke Lson And really like a he talks about it as one of his leaders if not his leader He wants McCrae to give him a little bit more vocal leadership And if you go back to when Luke was playing we had the same situation when Luke was a senior where we needed him to really grab the bull by the horns and talk to his teammates every day and hold people accountable And thats what hes trying to get McCrae to do with his squad Ill go back and correct myself The foul was called against Leger Jones as Caparazzo makes the first of his two free throw attempts Sorry for getting passionate on that explanation Sean No absolutely And I think right on Q we just looked on you can see that Robert McCrae the 5th was having a conversation with his head coach right there because we got a camera crew and some people back in the room that they know where the action is Good defense there by Jacksonville knocking it away but Tomasan does well to win it back and will draw the contact in the painted area against the Dolphins Big man Charles Caparazzo trying not to let the smaller Van get to the rim Gave him like a body check across the lane Second foul called against Caparazzo Wiggins is brought down by JU And if that is something the Dolphins can do that will bode well for them Florida State has also decidedly had their way on the glass so far this evening here in Tallahassee And thatll be a foul called against Tom Baong on the reach Thats one of the things Mincy talked about He worked on his shoot around is attacking that ball screen and Wheeler got by the big man Got what he wanted Bon got to let him turn the corner or youre going to foul him Just let him go down and let the defense clean it up The way theyre playing tonight with the rotations hes not going to get to the rim Itll be the third personal call against Tom and he is relieved by Lee Jones Luke is constantly coaching Got the song over there before he gets to the bench coaching him up A foul called off the basketball I believe against Chanty Wiggins Thatll be his second It was a weird ball screen kind of hedge situation I didnt get a clean look Its kind of a weird look the way Chanty turned around You AJ Desai wasnt having any of it Anderson chirping Oh yeah Coach Mincys over there telling AJ to keep an eye on it AJ Desai one of the best officials in the ACC and in the nation So you got a good crew out here tonight AJ Desai Mark Schner Justin Porterfield the officiating crew this evening here in Tallahassee Fresh possession here for Jacksonville Wheeler drives down the lane guarded by Somerville Gets it back up top Borio for three off front iron and brought down by Steam Who got the rebound The Steam machine But that defensive help to close up the gap so they couldnt get to the rim Oh what a find by McCrae The fifth Wiggins got the shot off and a foul called underneath the basketball or underneath the basket I should say And that will go against Caparazzo Look at this effort Dean is going against a sevenfooter Hes 69 himself not relenting that ball to let the big man get it Picked up the foul though Thats unfortunate Oh no Caparoso got the foul Three fouls for either team here to start this second half Strong take all the way to the bucket for Wiggins who hangs and hits on the put back Its good to see that aggressive play Sean Wiggins is usually a little shy away from that contact I like him attacking following his shot going back up with it and just stays tall with it too He doesnt really get it down in traffic Stays with that ball The freshman tried to give a slap at it but he wasnt getting a chance back there with Hayden Wood slapping at the ball Just to circle back to the point that we were talking about earlier Jacob you know the veterans McCrae Chanty Wiggins Leay Jones Kobe McGee Luke Clouds told us he needs to see consistency out of that quartet who decidedly leads this Florida State roster But to get that consistency he needs more confidence and we have seen a very confident Florida State team led by those veterans tonight Those four guys are contributing and thats what he said Those guys have delivered at times and theyre delivering on defense over here right now But they have got to do it on offense consistency Theyve got to all come with double digit points or or account for points whether its with assist You dont have to give me 15 give me six assists And the one guy I didnt mention was Steen who was terrific on the close out and Martin Somerville He is just a sophomore but he is a bonafide scorer with 16 points a new season high And hes hitting it from every part of the threepoint line as they knock him to the floor too That guy stays with his shot That is the third time he has frankly been fouled shooting a three And thats a timely response by Aras And that is exactly what Jacksonville needs to see more of Theyve been hardressed to get a look for Aras so far And that is his first make as Wow what a pass by McCrae but what a finish to capitalize on the situation with Steam And just what a pass Somerville down there I dont even mean to say what a pass but McCrae is dropping dimes everywhere with Somerville shooting it And my man Steam Look at him put it on THE FLOOR GET OUT THE WAY BABY Im going through you Through you And look at the steam machine family right there You got to love that Panama City native Drove over from the beach supporting these guys Theyre here every game folks Its crazy They got a camper out in the parking lot buddy They tailgating Almost stopped in coming in today Sean they take it next level And they have had reason to be especially excited Alex Dean has been terrific this evening for Florida State and the NLES as a whole have been on both sides of the floor Aras looking for space in front of his bench Steps to the side Tracked down BY JONES cheering LOOK OUT HERES LEE WITH THE WIND UP SEAN HE SAYS IM ABOUT TO take it down with the rim in my hand cheering Le Jones Ive been waiting to see you do that all night Florida State has made each of their last four Le Jones running the floor for the slam and the nullles lead by 32 How do you get that How do you get that dunk shot defense baby He shot the gap and took it Steam there to corral the loose ball Somerville finds McCrae the fifth on the drive Steen on cleanup duty couldnt bank it back through but still working the offense Sean theyre up 30 plus points and not taking quick shots Good looking shot there by Lockett Jr as he approaches double figures now at nine points He has been a bright spot for the Dolphins The Boise State transfer hes just got like we talked about it earlier but look at his body Hes such a goodlook guard He is going to wreak havoc in the Aon Steen inside Lot of contact down there Steam could not get the roll Florida State though still leading by 30 Wheeler guarded by two seminals looking for some help And a bump right in front of the JU bench Thatll go against Robert McCrae the fifth But theres a lot more happening than that Defense to offense baby Look Jay Jones with the wind up just going at that bad boy and throwing it down home And hes not the only one having fun with that Look at his teammates baby Fired of it And Clifton which gives us three fouls on McCrae for the game lock it up there with with his freebies And so with the first up and through Lockett is into double figures for Jacksonville And he is the first for the Dolphins to do so 11 points now in fact for number 11 in green But if youre Florida State you just want to keep defending Dont go away from your game plan Even though youre up 28 run your plays It doesnt do you any good to go on a layup fest or just take quick shots And if youre Mincy you just want to keep chipping away running your offense and your defense So get ready Thatll be a foul called against Kobe McGee on the bump And its what it is man You get a technical foul theyre going to tighten it up And and its good that they do because you dont want anything to get out of control Play smart Keep the hands to yourself right now Thats the sixth foul called against Florida State That ball was deflected out of play Their hands are everywhere Sean Florida States activity tonight Yeah You know just moving jumping in the passing lanes tipping the ball Theyve been so active So itll be 18 on the shot clock here for Jacksonville Aras gives it up to Wheeler Wheeler tries to turn the corner Lea Jones comes away with the turnover Outlet pass up ahead to McCrae the fifth Gets it to the corner McGee off the trailer JONES ON THE DRIBBLE PENETRATION LE JONES WITH HIS SECOND slam of THE HALF HE SOLD BLOCK IT ON THAT ONE HE HIT THAT THREE EARLIER in the half and it opens up the lane for you Give him that ball fake and take off baby Eight points for Le Jones who really didnt break into the scorers column until the final minute or so of the first half He just sells it Sean and just says I got you baby Boom And once again look at the steam machine leading to Somerville right there the other threepoint dagger thrower and not even flinching They love their teammates Lockett Jr shields off Jones and connects on the baseline McCrae the fifth to the corner McGee that is too strong cheering Song keeps getting a bad assignment picking up the point guard Wheeler finds Lockett and Lockett has heated up here in this second half A new season high for Lockett with 16 Cam Miles had it swatted away by Will It will remain with Florida State You know Miles does a lot of good things and hes really good out on the perimeter but once he gets inside his his size gets exposed you know and Wheeler right there is a small guy too Is taking advantage and got that block from behind but Miles tends to only focus on the guy in front of him Thats one of those things that LS was talking about today that Cam Miles has got to learn a little bit as an offensive player as a freshman You know hes got to see the whole floor and not just whats in front of him Off the inbounds Florida State connects with Chanty Wiggins and a foul called after the play against Cam Miles Coach Lings case This is like you know its getting a little ticky So thatll be the second tech called against the Seinals here in the last few minutes I mean Locket when he made that sling just a minute ago was doing some extracurricular hand signals himself Speaking of Lockett now with 18 points make your free throws theyll quickly add up Technical foul against Cam Miles is his first personal of the game Wheeler streaking down the sideline Finds Aras in the corner Nice job getting back on D by Somerville Rivers You see that offensive footwork and moves that Mincy was talking about He gets in the gym every morning at 8 am You can see where its working out for Rivers Kobe McGee off the penetration finds Somerville Wheeler there for the rebound Theyre starting to jack it a little bit Sean Florida State needs to keep running their offense No quick shots Meanwhile the Dolphins have made each of their last four from the floor Lockett Jr swings it to the corner Aras for three Off the mark Jacksonville brings the double on Somerville Cam Miles from the corner Brought down by Rivers I like the way Jacksonville is still executing offense and defense Theyre still crashing the glass trying to get a good shot on offense Pocket Jr gets to the baseline Good ball movement here by the Dolphins Wheeler well off the mark but a fresh possession for JU Just one offensive rebound in the first half for the Dolphins Theyve had three more already here in the second Deflected by Somerville Still alive Deflected once again by Wiggins Hell be called for the personal And thatll take us to our media break here in Tallahassee The under 12 here in the second half The Nullles leading 6239 That is young No question Its the holidays Why not Lets have fun with those guys They got a drive back But you know Steen his effort and what he brings to the table for Florida State And everyone talked about his motor and right on Q Give me another rebound says Alex Ste And he is out there every night every possession If he hadnt got injured and had a little hamstring issue you know those last two games when they struggled may not have been the same outcome Rebound number eight for the steam machine to go along with seven points for Florida State so far tonight And the NL are going to look to him That is swatted out of play Remains with Florida State Donovan River like youre not the only one driving Hes like Im about to drive that thing out of bounds Ste with the baby hook and he says no sir Donovan Rivers says I got this bad boy on a night that has been generally positive for Florida State They are without a point over the last two minutes A testament to Minces Theyre doing a good job on defense but Florida State is shy away from executing on offense Theyve just been kind of getting shots Somerville does draw the foul here Thatll go against Lockett Jr But you know La is doing a great job with hes got Somerville out there Hes got Bong out there Hes got Cam Miles Those guys need reps and hes getting those reps So hes playing some different lineups which is affecting your offense too And theres a turnover but he needs those lineups getting accustomed to each other So when they go to Carolina after Christmas and Duke comes to town right behind him Yeah there is no easing into ACC play for Florida State with those two teams to get things started Look at Wood going to work on the offensive glass a couple of times over Wow All right And you know LS talked about that Thats why he made the schedule as tough as he did because he knew he had to start the ACC off so tough And even the Houston game he scheduled the Houston game because he knew then he had Jacksonville come They play kind of similar tough games And you got to deal with that when you go to Pittsburgh You got to deal with that when you go to Boston College But those teams are going to have to deal with Martin Somerville He continues this torid shooting streak Another three for Martin Five of nine 19 points in total for the sophomore A young man from Buoie Maryland is knocking it down baby Wheeler Nice shot with the pull up I think his games a little midrange and in He He wasnt doing so well from behind the arc but he is quick as a cat with that ball in his hand First made shot of the game for Wheeler Somerville drives it down the lane and draws contact and just his ball movement as weve talked about all night and he kicks it to the corner and Cam Miles such a pass in Somerville with his ability to get to the rim put that ball on his hip and drive through them His package is getting better every week Hes becoming a better player for Florida State and understanding what Luke L is trying to accomplish offensively That is the second foul called against Wheeler And with that free throw make Somerville has now hit 20 points in this game A reminder his careerhigh is 26 And he is edging ever closer cheering 6743 Florida State A score that has brought delight to many in the crowd I am not going to mention that Im not going to directly reference the actual number because why not Jacksonville is going to work nicely offensively Id rather talk about that Jacob Thats right Aiden Wood going to work himself That freshman Wood is I see why my said hes a hes a delightful surprise for him because he just keeps making plays Speaking of guys who have made plays Lockett Jr has made a lot of them here in this half McCrae the fifth is looking to find steam and Sturk picks off the pass Wood strong take to the bucket but Leger Jones on cleanup duty with the block MCCRAE THE BIT THIS TIME finds Steen for the throw down And it all started you said it with Le Jones in the defensive play Just stay tall both hands up there to slap that thing off the backboard But such an unselfish point guard and Robert McCrae 13 points on the break now for Florida State in this game They lead 6945 cheering and an and one opportunity One of the bigger players from Jacksonville who has been coming along nicely in the front court Allan Udu from Lagos Nigeria And Le Jones says Get that out of here bad boy I am taking it the other way and Steen with the pass from McCrae Single Dolphins A margin that JU hopes to trim into here with Allen Udamaradu senior from Wagos Nigeria who transferred in from Missouri State He will in fact cash in on the threepoint opportunity and the lead is down to 21 Sean Davis Jacob Rydenhower Ansley Topic our entire crew on hand as we are inside the final eight minutes of regulation here in Tallahassee and the strike serve calling it tighter But the biggest thing that sticks out to me right now Sean is you seeming such a good defensive game that theres only six turnovers for Jacksonville and only seven turnovers for Florida State you know but its just been done Especially Florida State theyve just sat down and defend it is one of the things coach L was talking about was guys just got to get in front of somebody and defend them not make excuses And theyve done that not off of turnovers which is what theyve done most of the season but off of straight up just guarding people A lot of empty possessions forced by Florida State who again you mentioned it They theyve kind of relied on forcing turnovers for those stops Theyve found another way to do it And now in the bonus the next foul by Jacksonville Wont yet put him in the double bonus Theyre still two away from that But two good free throws there by Le Jones The Nles have crossed the 70 mark Our officials are definitely tired of the talking Yes So Mincy and LS both need to get their guys to uh zip it Undatu has given Jacksonville a lift off the bench but it didnt zip the rim Its a nice baby hook from the big man Much better half of basketball for Jacksonville Only had 21 in the first half alone Already 29 and counting in the second Somerville has led the NLES offensively STEVE LEFT ALL ALONE AND HE CRANKED IT SEAN Hes like Le Jones youre not the only one that gets to crank your dunk up But theyre DOING A GOOD JOB ON THAT BALL screen and and theyre reading it and as soon as the defense goes the wrong way theyre ripping it going to the rim 11 points for Alex Steen Eight rebounds as well Sturk will tee up the three Brought down by Jones And again I think its been a while since weve talked about it I know Jacksonvilles had more success on the glass here in this second half But in general Florida States done a real nice job in that department Speaking of theres Steen with rebound number nine Fresh possession for the Seinals rebounding Jacksonville 3923 McCrae the fifth calls his own number down the lane brought down by Udu Youre talking about Ste Steen averages four offensive rebounds a game which is tops in the ACC and hes right on key right now with his fourth offensive rebound 23point lead for the Nolles Wood with the reverse The freshman Hayden Wood continues to impress with his ability to read the defense Jacksonvilles got a couple of freshman who have an insanely high upside Be a lot of fun to watch them in a sun play Steen what a dish to Wiggins Big feeding big Steen right there patting his chest at Wiggins He threw it too low Wiggins couldnt get a real throw down with it because it stayed below the rim on that lob Sturk draws two defenders Somerville on the closeout Sturk on the penetration Its an offensive foul called against Jacksonville But Alex Steen and the Steam machine from Panama City Beach is making everybody love to watch him play tonight with it ripping it through and cranking it down But you know he loves his teammates too A little higher John C Wiggins says Throw it above the rim Let me get a big dunk But Alex man that guys a great teammate A rebound away from a double double Hes certainly earned that swig of power raid Wiggins goes back up top to McGee inside five Miles its been that kind of night for Florida State Realized he was in trouble does what a good point guard point guard does and just attacks You know they get caught with the ball a lot late You know they get sometimes that hurts their shooting percentages a lot sometimes with point guards because they have to make a decision late But you get to the rim go get it baby Woods midrange brought down by Tom Bong and Bong has seven and seven Cam Miles right where he left off shown Friday night Itll be eight points now for Cam Miles to go along with four assists Aras Jacksonville has been hardressed to get him going consistently tonight and hes a key cog in their wheel and he has struggled But you know Ive noticed three or four times now theyve done a great job driving that baseline and using the rim as a to block the defender away from them Wood let down by Tomarazzo Sturk for three Thats no good Another opportunity for Jacksonville Aras for three In and out This time the freshman Miles brings it down for Florida State Wiggins midrange Thats not what Florida State typically wants to do But off the turnaround Chanty Wiggins Thats not LSs favorite shot selection but thats Wiggins is probably his favorite shot 16 points for Wiggins after leading Florida State with 16 in their last contest A corner three back the other way for Aras whos starting to find his footing albeit certainly too late for JU cheering 8257 seminals with two minutes left McGee finds the song and thatll take us to our final stoppage here in Tallahassee The NLES on their way to closing out nonconference with it assist guys in the country Tip the cap to Chuck Walsh Florida States terrific SID who is on top of every statistical category and nugget and intricacy of this team and of this program over the last number of years Thats just a tremendous note The fact that that is the first time anybodys done that in their career He came over and said Much less one season Ill top that Were not even in conference play yet Thats not like a little crack thing a creass thing Thats a super niche That is that is really cool stuff 8357 Florida State Tom two of three from the free throw line And I think if youre Jacksonville Jacob you will take comfort in how youve responded in this second half Oh yes Theyve continued to bring their offense and defensive execution And right here you want to talk about offensive execution Donovan Rivers goes right through Sha Mohamd But this just what Mincy said He said he is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the Aon And he showed that down the stretch He didnt get the opportunity in the first half because the defense wasnt letting him get going Jacksonville program picked roughly in the middle of the ASU but they have consistently made it at least to the semifinals every year under Jordan Mincy Hes a really good coach Came from a really good program down in Florida with Michael White as as he worked under for a while But hes a cheering good fit there from all his experience in the state of Florida You know its he talked about some of his recruits and who hes beat out You know he beat out FAU Thats an instate school Its a bigger school got more money you know they got football And here he is at a private school in Jacksonville is getting recruiting class after recruiting class to help him compete and contend for titles in the ASON Best freshman class in the AON here in this past recruiting cycle in fact So things looking up for Jacksonville who indicative of them being on the road in Tallahass tonight not afraid to challenge themselves Correct And you know what we talked about and Minty talked to us about it today He said he embraces this situation in the game that you got to deal with where its not go to a school for four years and you can transfer out and everything else He knows hes getting a guy like Hayden Wood who we see him on screen Youre only going to get him so long cuz hes going to put up numbers so big hes going to transfer He accepts that and he wants guys to be successful and move on just like Robert McCrae What hes proven is the ball around the perimeter to his teammates Yes he has Florida State 11 threes as a team A lot of those Martin Somerville five in fact five of 10 for Somerville number one operating with the basketball at the top of the key as we approach the final minute Jaylen Crawford has checked in for Florida State The song had the ball knocked out of play by Rivers along the baseline cheering Malik and Mohamed both in there both bigs the two biggest guys on the roster for Florida State The team fired up for Somerville after the night hes had Crawford for three Catches back iron and brought down by the song Jacksonville brings the double Its knocked away And one final thought for me here Jacob Luke Blous has mentioned it It takes patience to build a program and he said patience isnt something that he naturally has a lot of and so hes learning that on the fly He says look weve had a tough run and if Im a fan of this team I would be frustrated but there is belief in this building and these guys are bought into the process and despite as rough as the month of December has largely been for Florida State I think the response weve seen tonight as well as on Friday has been a real testament to what hes building And he talked about that He said the one thing his guys have not started pointing fingers not looked for excuses Theyve embraced the mistakes and embraced weve got to work together And he said Guys listen No ones coming to save us Its us Its us in the ring And thats his team motto and it kind of all flows together here Connected Hes like We got to be connected And then hes he talks about it If we all play connected on the floor good things happen And thats what moving the ball widing open teammate cheering on defense like they did in the first half Just smother your opponent with rotations and helping and stopping the ball I could talk forever about this stuff man I love it And its been an impressive showing for Florida State in all departments so far tonight as we approach the end of regulation Rivers with the throw down Again a positive second half here for Jacksonville Crawfords going to get another shot Hes crushing his statistics He came out of the gate shooting well in his in his 2020 minutes You know youre a 2020 man Youre either up 20 or down 20 Crawford got in earlier this year and caught the ball on the 17th assist that Robert McCrae threw in that opening game to set a record for Florida State But now tonight hes crushing it percentages Hes had Adrian on the radio call just a few feet to our right living and dying with every shot attempt but certainly proud of his boy and certainly should be at that Hes a tremendous kid and a tremendous addition to this FSU program And I think a lot of folks will be proud of what Florida State has mustered on both sides of the floor tonight The commitment the character the intensity have all been there for the Garnet and the Gold who cap off a challenging nonconference slate with a win at home against Jacksonville Holiday Hoop style 8763 the final for Florida State
