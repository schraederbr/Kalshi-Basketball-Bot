Tyson Walker for the Spartans down the stretch and so Duke comes out of that stretch against Arizona and Michigan State at 1 and one two and one overall and now Bucknell is here at Cameron and away we go bucknells got it first theyre one and three very proud Patriot league program home loss to Delaware a loss at pen they beat Niagara on the road and then most recently a loss on the road at Lal and theyve got the games first points with Rue Bia the 69 sophomore Bak is a good shooter his numbers have been struggling this year so far but playing very confident early Duke operates with four starters back from last year of course same lineup and theres Kyle filipowski off Target from deep and the rebound down to Josh Bosco gets his first start of the Season at point guard for Bucknell and only the third of his threeyear career because Bucknell is without its starting point guard Elvin Edmonds who suffered a knee in injury Tuesday against Lal and hes going to be out 5 to 6 weeks Noah Williamson no and then the sevenfooter commits the foul we might say you come off Michigan State and AR Arizona Michigan State and now how are you going to attack how you going to get better tonight for Duke well John shy still trying to get his team to be a little bit more patient in the half court with their shot selection change sides of the floor with good spacing yeah that was one of the things he said to us shot selection and also valuing the basketball Jared McCain out of the corner for three well thats important because McCain has not shot the ball well Tyrese Proctor has not shot it well and K Foster shot it well the other night but as a whole Duke has not been consistent from the threepoint line they of course struggled in that regard last season and so far just 34 from three that one rolled up and filipowski clears it 90 seconds in filipowski off the bounce dropped it off for Mark Mitchell well everybody talks about the power the scoring the this the that with filipowski but clear it off the glass bring it up yourself take it into the paint great delivery got to love that from your sevenfooter well thats what John sh told us today Mike is that thats the thing that hes improved the most at as well of clearing the passing lanes and attacking at the other end liftoff for Kyle filipowski and its a 70 Run for the Blue Devils the the loss of Edmonds is key tonight for Bucknell how are they going to get into a half court offense you cannot throw loose halfcourt bounce passes against this Duke Brasher heres Noah Williamson the sevenfooter from Lao with a handoff for bosow now the shot clock winding down as filipowski shows on bosow they move it and bgx sticks a three bjx two for 15 on the season coming into this game we watched him shoot this morning though hes got a beautiful stroke and John Griffin the third said were going to let him shoot the ball and get out of this slump the head coach back at his alma mater in year one as a first time head coach proor out a step back for the Blue Devils hes another one that John Ty said he is a good shooter but hasnt shot it well we know though hes run the team almost perfectly so far this season 19 assists with only four turnovers got to love that as a coach play all but one minute Tuesday in the champ I classic Jack Forest is 24 in Orange hes the top scorer for Bucknell been quiet so far Ian Moda junor off the bounce back out for Williamson he like filipowski can step out and shoot it and McCain one arms a rebound you see what Dukes philosophy is their game plan is they are not going to leave Jack Forest open at all filipowski turns it over passing out of a double team bosow in transition Moda made the cut and Moda draws a foul all right so we mentioned John Griffin the third first year as the head coach at his Alma M takes over for Nathan Davis who spent the last eight years as the head coach and Griffin was a 1000 point scorer and he was a captain as well in his time in Lewisburg well hes carved out his own Niche not only as a player and playing overseas and as an assistant coach and working in the NBA but now getting that first head coach opportunity and he grew up in the coaching World his dad was a longtime great coach at Sienna and St Joes and so he speaks to him quite of often and he should because his father was a terrific coach and still pays attention to whats going on with this program thats for sure they were on the phone for an hour this morning John thei third said his father was trying to talk him through how to win every possession Philip howski had the block out of Moda and McCain pushes for Duke up by three first four minutes here at Cameron its going to be changing defenses from Buck no were going to see a lot of different things that John Griffin throws out out there for the Bison today Mitchell going to work trying to muscle it through got his own Miss and that got fouled well John Griffin the third has played at Cameron before we stroll down memory lane with against Sheldon Williams JJ reick and number one D can bunell that year ended up having a 27 win season they made it backtack trips to the NCAA tournament and John Griffin the third back here at Cameron for the first time in quite some time tonight he was talking about that experience and he said I said we asked him what he remembered the most besides those two buckets were the volume in this building uh so but buckells had has a terrific program and John griin the third theres no doubt in my mind well get them back to where theyve been you know every program hits some rough patches but Bucknell is has a program and he understands it probably more than most because he played there and was had a lot of success as a player its a program that won eight Patriot League regular season titles in a 9year span from 2011 to 2019 you talked about the volume today at shooter around they had the speakers right on the court and they had the music blaring everything from techno tsunami was playing at one point to older School enter sanan got the Metallica fixed as if youre in blackburg its not my style anymore Mike I go for a little more smooth jazz but uh I can deal with it when a coach is trying to prepare his team and John was laser focused had a very strong preparation day today because hes trying to teach his team they they play so many games this month they dont have a lot of time to practice so when they have a shoot around they have to take advantage of getting better its their fourth Road game in a span of N9 days theyre now by five in the first four plus minutes here at Duke on a skip pjc knocks down another you mentioned he can shoot it hes got a good stroke he had missed his last 11 threes coming into tonight well when you look at somebodys numbers that are poor like that you say well whats going on is he just in a slump or is he taking bad shots I think itll been a little bit of both and its also a comfort Level Playing under a new coach and he looks very comfortable tonight Blakes Foster and Stewart into the game off the bench for John Shire here in the first five minutes and again its going to be changing defenses from Bucknell defensively Jeremy roach off the bounce with a shot clock winding down on Foster comes up short Blakes the rebound and then block by Applause Pepa well Dukes not going to leave Jack Foster so that means somebody will be open theyre not going to give natural help little just a little fade a little brush screen on the weak side good identification by Foster on the skip pass needs a little bit more ball pressure on the perimeter John Griffin the third is called rub Hidden Gem 69 sophomore from Iowa Foster on the Baseline out of bounds for shots steart he went through that play earlier today You got to switch you got to get better ball pressure and try to force the ball to the corner but that was just power Deluxe at the rim and now a j D2 Mercy H transfer on a handoff for Bosco being hounded by Blakes long two not there on the step back and then last Touch by Stewart this is a simple screen to screener play here and Bucknell overh helps little miscommunication I dont know if they want they want to switch that but they didnt switch it and they should this they overh helped on the Philip palsky on the outside again hes just drawn so much attention and then looked like he he kind of shoved The Freshman Stewart where to go Blakes the rebound off to Jack Forest Miss and Forest coming off a career high 27 is still scoreless wide open Blakes can knock it down and then a foul on the floor goes against Bucknell on the rebound action trying to take Kyle filipowski out with two Defenders on the inside but the extra activity on the blockout John Griffin the third talked to us today about how physical he expected this game to be having watched the last couple of games that Duke played he told us that he showed his team more clips of fouls and grabbing and all that than he did filipowski makes on film review with his team right now though Bucks trying to over play on these out of bounds ways they have to be careful because they should just make Duke throw over the top heres roach can knock it down Stewart the offensive rebound Stewart banging and filipowski cleaning it up too much attention paid to Stewart and then forget about the big fella on the backside someones got to rotate down try to find a way to put a body on him but Stewart showing that big time athleticism the Pogo thick freshman out of Florida good hands from filipowski and Company filipowski leads the break stward underneath had it blocked by aay and then aay clears it what a recovery on the backside as Stewart went went to elevate but Bucknell resisted high energy pip aay the Junior from Canada making his presence felt Off the Bench Josh a do wide open cant connect filipowski the rebound Duke is not leing Jack Forest at all they are just even on balls side or weak side they are sticking with him and making someone else beat them from the outside or inside I told you hes the top scorer for Bucknell at 17 a game long to Jeremy roach roach is such a smart player obviously the the fouryear veteran the fouryear starter just the glue of this team hes got the lead up to eight and then he gets tagged for a foul on the perimeter fresh legs coming in for Duke as roach sits after his first John Shire said to his teamate shoo around today we want to run make or Miss he said guys were going to have the subs ready well thats the way they should be playing because theyve got so many guys that can make plays off the bounce including the big fella filipowski theres Forest on the drive and it rolled off and the F not there but Forest runs down the loose ball and then not deflected BJ and Forest cant connect and its a turnover and the third one for Bucknell well bucknells going to ask going to have to find a way to get Jack Forest free at some point just divert him run him run him off some stagger screens or even off some dribble handoffs on the outside because right now Duke is just smothering him on the perimeter two turnovers and 0 of two shooting for Jack Forest fifth year senior most experienced guy for Bucknell high low heres Mitchell from y joh Shire wanted a foul there and hes very upset and I dont blame him there was a lot of contact under the rim but that was terrific execution by Duke against that zone defense of Bucknell they went middle then Baseline adds up to an 80 Run for the Blue Devils and John sh got teed up barking in the air of Bren Hampton still after the no call on Applause Mitchell oh this great execution they worked on this say the flash cutter from the weak side and then they go right inside and body slam right across you got hit on the head and I dont blame John sh I mean these officials cant take the night off just because its 19 to9 and its Duke versus Buck now I mean these kids on both teams are playing extremely hard some fire from the seconde head coach I dont understand what youre looking at youre standing right there on the play and there guy gets hit from the B from the side and across the top of the head and you dont blow the whistle this is what Johns upset upset about I dont blame him yeah he is still talking now with Tony Music Henderson see see what coaching does to you though Mike the nice mild manner maybe one of the nicest guys you could ever sit and talk to as a coach day of game shoot around and then then this this is what it does it wasnt Jazz when you were coaching that was post coaching 1811 is the Duke lead rather 1911 they had momentarily switched it on accident and Forest has his first bucket well thats a good move by Forest you know he kind of did it on his own they spaced the floor on the weak side he found a little lane and just made something happen spinning Mitchell gets the roll Mark Mitchell a key component all last season they missed him in the NCA tournament when he didnt play in the Tennessee game and they paid for it because hes a valuable commodity he does a lot of good things that dont show up in the box score for Duke hes got a game high eight so far and John Shire is trying to get him going told us Mitchell hasnt been great yet these first couple of games five turnovers the first two back for Mitchell and now Force is starting to get in Rhythm thats a confidence in your face Proctor was right up in his grill but Forest elevated over the top knocked down four of them part of that 27 we mentioned against Lal Tuesday against the Zone Mitchell had it roll off and then Ryan young commits a foul on Noah Williamson 2116 is the Duke lead 9 minutes into this first half at Music Cameron Services of the 7 foot1 backup big man Christian Reeves whos got a boot on his right foot in yesterday sprained his ankle in practice ses dealt with a few different injuries early on this season and then on the other side for Bucknell theyre without their starting point guard the junior threeyear starter Elvin Edmonds a right knee injury late in the first half in the last game for Bucknell on Tuesday and hes going to be out five to six weeks and you see how he had progressed so far this year yeah hes a gritty guard he gets them into their offense between him and BOS a nice back court for giant Griffin the third and uh you know so he was concerned about it tonight but BOS has done a good job so far of getting them into the stuff spacing the court and just running the team John Griffin the third said BOS had to make as many sound decisions as possible as Bucknell retains possession and so far it it does feel like theyve done a solid job of that three turnovers thats it for Bucknell and theyve been feisty you know its not the best place to figure it out when you come here but uh I think John Griffin the third understands you know how to operate you know give his team confidence hes tough on him but make give him confidence theres a good outside shot by Forest coming off a beautiful out of bounds play a little pin down on the weak side and a flash hes got 10 he and Beek have combined for 18 of the 19 that bucknells got and Bucknell within two against the Zone here is Foster driving Baseline finding Mitchell sends it back out for Proctor yes well Proctors confidence is growing tonight the first game hes felt really good from the outside and Forest has done a terrific job as of late just finding ways to get open against that Duke pressure you said it earlier Duke is not leaving 24 and orange Bosco off the bounce nearly lost it and got it back to the Freshman guard Brandon mccre getting some run with Edmonds out Bosco driveing kick biao cant hit not a good look a little rushed shot by B and now Mitchell got the early positioning with a size mismatch on bosow yeah thats what happens you know I think John griin wanted a foul in the corner but that was a rush shot when you take a rush Corner jumper thats what usually happens against Duke an easy one at the other end such a thin margin for error coming here for anyone sevenpoint margin Midway through the first half Williamson turns the corner off glass Applause no McCain off the bounce be out Mitchell got it and thats a good sign for Mark Mitchell thats what he did a year ago and he also distributed his numbers have been down this year but hes just trying to find his way with kind of a new lineup out there on the floor and he looks real confident tonight inside and out John Griffin need a timeout Mark Mitchells got 13 for the dukies we concerned a little bit that teams are going to start sagging off him and theyll have to adjust their offense and hell have to adjust his game but this is the mark Mitchell we saw from a year ago just confident knows how to get open on the perimeter and when the driving kicks are there he slides to that open area with also a good power game at The Rim above his season average already John sh said you know I think part of it is maybe adjusting to playing a little a little bit of a different position with a different rotation for Duke this year and yeah to your point John CH said teams are playing Mark Mitchell differently than last year even Bucknell spoke about it today they have a defense called Batman where theyre kind of lay off him but Im sure Griffin will make an adjustment watching Mitchell so far tonight Proctor fouls Forest yeah thats one of three different defenses Bucknell said it would use lot of Zone man and then Batman sagging off both Mitchell and Ryan Music Young Jack Forest to the line fifth year senior from lower Marian Pennsylvania same area that produced Kobe Bryant hey coming up next our mens college basketball coverage concludes with UC Riverside taking aim at number 20 Carolina at 800 Eastern CCH all the action right here on accn and the app John sh spoke about Carolina he thinks that people are sleeping on him but I dont believe that at all I think people really understand theyre going to be much improveed from EO playing with a chip on their shoulder after not getting into the tournament well see how they look in their third Game of the Year by the way two fouls on Tyrese Proctor iss on the bench for Duke eight points spread 8 and 1 half to go first half TJ power into the game cant connect offensive rebound Blakes bounce for Philip palski who got the seal well the the pass and delivery was perfect by Blakes but the filipowski the footwork the ability to carve out space and find that open area and get himself open on the Baseline and on the Block is special navigates defending the ball screen and now Forest hits another Jack Forest is cooking for Bucknell now J shot is a little bit upset with his defense now on force force has done a good job of adjusting and finding himself and making himself available but sometimes that happens Mike as the game progresses you forget the game plan and you loosen up a little bit when a guy doesnt beat you they better readjust against Forest Philip psky gets fouled by rubek Forest has a third three sevenpoint margin Bucknell hanging around against D beginning of the game trying to figure out how Duke was going to play him not only on stagger screens but off the ball as well and they were not giving any help so hes done a much better job of moving without the ball creating off the bouns and his teammates have done a really good job of finding him as well 23yearold who started his college career at Columbia spent a year there then two years at St Joe and now in his second year at Bucknell so at St Joes he overlapped with his now head coach John Griffin the third so he knows where to put him on the floor and very smart player you can see in todays game a lot of guys that dribble drive driving kick but Forest doing a real good job of making himself hidden On The Backs side of the defense and doing a good job of using screens away from the ball theyre going to have to rely on him a lot this year for scoring a guy who in each of the last three years has battled injuries throughout his career Duke leads by nine seven and a half to go in this first half here at Cameron with Tim Welsh Mike Monaco our entire crew behind the scenes Ryan young is Switched onto the point guard Josh Bosco whos waving off help Moda shot clock winding down back to Bosco driving on young kick MOA hoist can hit offensive rebound Beek Forest triggers too strong and the rebound ripped out by McCain and then off the shoe of jayen Blakes keeps it with Bucknell that was a really good defensive set on that possession by Duke you know they didnt allow anything to happen in the middle even Ryan young had 610 guarding the point guard but using his feet using angles using that veteran Savvy experience to deny in the lane so fresh 20 to operate with for Bucknell Applause young is on Noah Williamson this time and back out to Bosco for is working so hard op ball being dogged by Blakes five to shoot bosow comes to get it driveing kick and beia couldnt handle it and its a shot clock violation and another good defensive sequence for Duke John shs going to use that in highlights Tomorrow theres no doubt about it they did a great job of denying on the wing they played the ball screens well they played the dribble handoffs they helped they hedged they helped each other they played five connected as one so Dukes got it ahead by nine roach McCain young Mitchell and Blakes the five on the floor again Tyrese Proctor sits with two fouls McCain to strong and last Touch by Ryan Young thats probably what John Shire was talking about to us a little bit today just a touch quick instead of really probing the defense waiting for the defense to make a mistake kind of gave in and shot it early in the clock with not a lot of player movement or ball movement he said valuing possessions both with turnovers and with shot selection Pasco looking for entry to Williamson s footer pushed all the way out to the perimeter by young Williamson driving and scoring his first points tonight hes a goodlook young player hes hes not afraid out there hes pretty physical for his size hes put on some weight and John Griffin said to us that hes a guy who can be real good in this in their conference and this goes against Duke on Mark Mitchell trying to set up Jeremy roach a sevenfooter and hes just a sophomore with skills and handles this is just the Seas parted here here and young did a good job of guarding Bosco but not so much guarding the big F five minutes a game last year for Williamson hes stepping into a bigger role this year for Andre screen who transferred to Butler made the catch sends it back out and Moda cant Applause hit young going to work shs a skilled passer out of the post roach and now Mitchell so they sag off and he cant connects buckell struggle a little bit trying to dribble drive into the lane cuz Duke giv such great help and they have such tremendous overpowering length but I think they can get some open Shots by driving in and kicking it back out pass was too hot to handle for Williamson off the drive Bosco yeah he was right there he just there probably a Touch Too Close he put it right up in in Williamsons face and he couldnt react right idea Josh Bosco the Junior from Ontario we told you making his third career start without Elvin Edmonds five to go until halftime Proctor in with the two Applause fouls filipowski trying to carve out some space on Forest on the Block against the zone of Bucknell roach musling on Bosco corner kick Proctor and the rebound to Williamson good possession defensively for buck Nowell very active with the Zone rotated well and got out to the shooter no second shot Bosco driving in again trying to find Williamson and off of Duke Shu mentioned the defense of Bucknell John Griffin told us he was even going to toy with something he had never messed with before defensively switching from Mana Zone 15 seconds into a possession its a good idea you know throw the kitchen sink see how they react but more importantly its down here can they score again look at all the help Duke gives off the dribble Bucknell rotates to the weak side and looks to driving kick opposite I think theyll get some open shots held ball in the arrow points to Duke after Modo went diving doing such a great job of rotating not only with their length but they use their length to get the flexions and its hard to see in there to make that extra pass in the Lan that his Forest Buck now into six turnovers here in the first 16 Applause minutes right now theyre playing that Batman defense they are not guarding Mark Mitchell at all on the perimeter filipowski got bumped on the block by a j and Kyle filipowski is still down on the floor filipowski is in a lot of pain hes done a very good job tonight being physical playing without fouling which hes had issues with in the past but Collision on the opposite side of the floor as they look at Kyle filipowski will step away well check on him when we come back bottom right Kyle filipowski coming up to the block watch his right ankle he makes that little X cut across the middle of the lane hes trying to post and then repost and you see him go down and he get up very quickly so something to keep an eye on its help off toward the Duke locker room and that is hold your Brad type of stuff with one of the best players in the entire country the preseason ACC player of the year of course and the preseason AllAmerican in the sophomore Kyle filipowski guy who had 25 points in each of the first two games of the Season then coming off 15 points and eight rebounds Tuesday in the win over Michigan State well he plays so hard but he also takes a lot of beating because everybodys game plan is to stop him either with a front full front or a double or sometimes even a triple team and so without his services at least for now for Duke they lead by seven and theyve got a scoring drought of about four minutes now and theyve turned it over three times in the last three plus minutes and now bucknells got it down by seven headed toward halftime they made a good run without him in the Michigan State game at the first half when he went out with two fouls but obviously its a different feel when a team guy that stature that value is not on the bench at all late shot clock for Bucknell as bosow looks off to the sideline and his head coach to the corner Beek contested three got it in the face of Mitchell Mitchell was there but it was kind of a flatfooted contest he never jumped ands got that nice length at 69 right over the top smooth tonight his third three hes got 11 young underneath back out for Proctor exit thats where Bucknell has to be careful they dug in way too much it was a little bit of an over overhal situation on the inside with no filipowski theres no reason to double and triple team in the paint must stay home on the shooters and young passed it out BX feeling it too strong this time in the rebound of Proctor Duke wants to run tyres Proctor at the controls and now Mitchell going oneonone with the size Advantage off glass and it rolled out young the offensive rebound for roach got it now thats modern day basketball right there Mike Monaco instead of going right back up you turn and wheel to the outside and look for open Shooters because theyre going to be wide open with everybody in the paint and now roach is hounding Bosco who somehow escapes Bosco wraps it around and Beek too strong from the corner offensive rebound Moda and back out Forest cant hit good job by Moto thats what thats where you find the open Shooters where everybody is sucked into the paint you can kick it back out for an opener the analytics back that up as well off of offensive rebound send it back out for a three its a high percentage of them Foster no Forest the rebound and buckell wants to slow things down down by 10 inside a two to go in the half a team pick ninth in The Patriot league and they turn it over Ryan young the flush you dont get many of them but Ryan young with a jam and this place is alive well Josh Bosco made the mistake threw a loose pass on the perimeter and was like he was playing on a Sunday morning in the playground instead of in Cameron indor you cant not throw those loose passes Forest cant answer Proctors got it duks Off to the Races Proctor for foster down low its Mitchell and the foul this is exactly what Duke and their student body needed after Philip pasy left the building with the injuries a little bit of a somber field but their defense now in their Attack Mode taking over and how about this first half for Mark Mitchell in 19 minutes of action hes got 16 points on six of 10 shooting and his best game so far the young season smart playing tonight by Mitchell you know he knows theyre not guarding them but he didnt stop playing hes finding other ways to make things happen final minute for first half Bosco off the crossover back out for Williamson searching for Beek to the corner and on the drive mccre and offensive foul now Dukes pressure right now Mike on the perimeter has got Bucknell sped up and theyve got to calm down instead of trying to dribble drive into traffic use more of of their dribble handoffs which they did in the middle part of the half now theyre trying to drive in and throw loose passes on the perimeter or over penetrate against the pressure 40 seconds and John sh takes the timeout well take it with him quickly back to Durham right after this all right all right all right all right they you ch they say you changed hey Google take a selfie noted podcast host Ryan young has joked with his teammates about what the over under is for him for dunks this season and in the second week of the Seas season who saw this one well at one point hes guarding Josh Bosco the point guard out on the perimeter didnt ask for any help he say I can I I have this at 610 and you know at his age hes seen everything hes seen it all hes the old man on the team and he plays like it just experience and knows his role just loves being part of this program and does whatever John Shire asks him to do hes closing in on a thousand career points as well between his time in Evanston and here in Durham Applause 10second difference between game and shot clocks here at the end of the first half for the Blue Applause Devils Foster initiates around the screen from Young now McCain on the drive back for foster no doubt he San Forest the rebound and buck now can hold for the last shot with 6 seconds Bosco for Williamson straight away to the cup and he missed the jam Mitchell didnt get it off in time and thatll do it for a first half that finishes with a flurry son filipowski for number nine Duke came out about a minute after everyone else from the locker room out of halftime went through some warmups got some shots up tested out the ankle and good to go as Forest flat es for the first two of the second half thats good play call out of the locker room for John griin the third just misdirection forced direct face cut to the rim pucknell continues to Sag off of Mark Mitchell who was one of two from deep in the first half knocked down 35 from three last year on a pretty low volume of Applause attempts bosow off the bounce on Mitchell and thats just tough to handle for Noah Williamson hes done that a few times he dribble drives in there he gets himself in trouble with nowhere to go and Duke makes him pay with Tyrese Proctor Bosco kind of half ran back half sprinted half ran back you got to Sprint your tail off and he kind of put his head down a little bit after that turnover initiates with Ru Beek and now Ian Moda pores trying to run free from roach sh off some screens lot of dribbling from Moda working on McCain shot clock at seven heres Forest jab step drive and good hands from roach 22 to shoot for Bucknell a little bit too much dribbling now in the last few possessions for Bucknell youve got to dribble and make a quick decision and we talked about in the first half kick it back out love for Williamson and drawn a beautifully with just the two seconds to work with that was a very nice play everybody was outside a little twoman game in the paint again a Bucknell team at 1 and three theyve been busy so far the first couple of weeks of the Season roach knocks it down thats filipowski again they were loaded up on him on ballside and roach just flashed up from that Wing area and found himself wide open filipowski was banging with Noah Williamson and then Tyrese Proctor stepped in and had something to say to Noah Williamson foul goes on Kyle Music filipowski see filipowski they send the double theres no real reason to double him like that hes got his back to the basket about 10 12 ft away from the rim now he when he puts it on the floor thats different but its very difficult to double him on the catch because hes so smart hes an improved passer and hes got that size where he can see over the double theyre going to go to the monitor now and have a look at the exchange between Kyle filipowski and Noah Williams Williamson was trying to establish some positioning and he was banging with an unflinching Kyle filipowski you put your defense really in a tough situation against a Duke when you just aimlessly double from the outside and you leave somebody open on the weak side here youll see it a little this a little that I think we can let the fellas play on after that and just maybe call a common foul so the lead at 17 for Duke here in the first couple of minutes out of halftime Blue Devils coming off those backtoback games if youre just joining us against top 20 opponents last Friday against Arizona who by the way is now ranked third in the country and then Tuesday Michigan State ranked 18th and this is the first of three for the Blue Devils before Arkansas less than two weeks away on the road and then the ACC opener in Atlanta against Georgia Tech Forest being shadowed by Mitchell got a piece of it thats a bad decision by Forest he has to understand that Mitchell at 69 is not going to give him that little floater in the lane and now Mitchell attacking and thats what John Shire has wanted from Mark Mitchell got to make the defense pay if theyre not going to guard on the perimeter you have to find other ways to contribute to your team on the offensive end and Mitchell has done that tonight in a multitude of ways sophomore has already matched his career high with 18 beak recovered beak off the bounce has it roll off and then Mitchell fired to Proctor wasnt looking for it and tyres practor says just use Jared McCain or filipowski or or yourself Mitchell can bring the ball himself hes good numbers last year as a Music passer but theyre trying to theyre trying to do what John CH wants him to do theyll really race up the court get it up and its much easier obviously to get it up with the pass than the dribble theyre just trying to fly at Bucknell ball screen from Williamson for bosow low catch for Williamson who had to bring it down with the pass delivered there and then a Bucknell turnover there 10th already Proctor kicks McCain hoist hits now thats exactly what John Shire wants get it and go space it find the open man before the defense gets set and knock it in 80 run the last 90 seconds for the Blue Devils here at home at Cameron said to his team make or Miss guys were running we are running the entire game well this is a clinic on how to run a fast break Tyrese Proctor with his head up changeing Direction never put his eyes down on the floor but anything he knew exactly where his teammate Jared McCain was delivered the pass absolutely perfect right into the shooting pocket McCain took him about a half second to release and go tyrs predor with 11 points four assists and again no turnovers you know if you dont thr make that pass perfectly into the pocket that allows the defense to come back and get a good contest but thats why Proctor is a special point guard initiating for Duke who has seen its lead swell to 22 in the first four minutes out of halftime here at Cameron BOS with a shot clock winding down for Moda got it and much needed for Bucknell thats basically how Bucknell has to attack they have to keep trying to dribble drive on ball reversal and then try to kick it out and try to make some threes and just hope that they can get a few open ones youve been calling for that throughout this game Mitchell off the shot fake for an easy two and hes got a career high 20 Mark Mitchell is doing a real good job of presenting himself big but also sliding into open area hes doing a great job of reading his man and then getting open on the backside Bosco for Williamson he can step out and shoot it but no dice that time Proctor attacks in transition this time and back out for McCain on the dribble Drive filipowski is going to the free throw line first four plus minutes into this second half and its Duke by 21 at Music home are you having any fun Sunday catch a womens college basketball double header right here on the ACC Network up first its number 25 Oklahoma visiting Virginia at 2 Eastern and then Bucknell takes on number 19 Louisville at 400 Eastern Time both games also available on the ESPN app so you can watch anywhere with Tim Welsh Mike Monaco and our entire crew behind the scenes from Cameron Indoor Stadium game number four for number nine dke the headline in this one was the injury status of Kyle filipowski headed the halftime and great to see that he has been able to return to this game hes hes out there right before the start of the second half testing it out with all his medium to long range jumpers and that time was showed well on the box with the physicality drawing the foul how rare is his skill set in the game its its todays basketball Mike I mean the young the young kids of today they grow up everybody wants to be Steph Curry including the big guys and if you grow to seven feet and youve got the skills like wiama uh you know great things hell happen because I I like the way Duke plays though they dont totally rely on five out and take 45 threes a night theyll take threes when available theyre not a great threepoint shooting team but theyre good but we all know the analytics say take the threes but they still play Power basketball they play they have good balance to their system theyve taken 18 in this game theyve knocked down eight of them good clip 44 theyve got the 23point lead on Bucknell in these first 5 minutes out of halftime roach to the bench joining filipowski right now its Foster McCain Stewart three freshman for Duke plus Proctor and young five for John shy and the crazy back in Applause rhythm heres mccre off of the bounce to the corner for Beek doesnt get the roll and the rebound to McCain and again Duke runs shoveled out for Proctor too strong Stewart one arms a rebound back out Foster yes well theres your analytics Mike Monaco inside off the offensive glass back outside to a good threepoint shooter so nine made threes now for the Blue Devils 70 run and 153 run over the last three and A2 minutes off the forest miss the athleticism of Stewart just snaring that rebound way out of his area oh good pass from Young back to Proctor was Ryan young hes the old school player though hes got his head up hes always looking for that open man and just made himself available with the extra pass and now pipa trying to direct hand off for the St Joes transfer Quinn berer and back to aay and itll stay with Bucknell with 11 to shoot this is what we talked about still being able to attack the paint and look inside make that extra extra pass for the easy one Applause shot clock below 10 for rubak and mccre young got switched on to him and mccre stops pops but cant hit boy guard rebound are going to be so important for Duke John shers talked about that in the early going and McCain ripped out another and then he sinks and three theyre starting to get into their Rhythm not only on the offensive and making shots inside and out but defensively they are just swarming the Applause basketball 203 is the run for Duke and it forces Bucknell into another timeout and now 10 triples from the Blue Devils well going inside Mike usually creates open opportunities on the outside and thats what Duke has done all night long theyre trying to rim run theyre trying to play the power game with filipowski and MIT inside along with young but then Buck Nails not not going to give that up theyre going to give up perimeter shots and Dukes been able to knock him down hey tomorrow morning the ACC huddle crew will kick off today in Atlanta at Bobby dot Stadium at 1100 am eastern 60minute pregame show leads into Miami Louisville at noon Syracuse Georgia Tech is at 88 and the Huddle crew is with you throughout this building has come alive here in the second half and Duke is pulling away from Applause Bucknell 12 straight for the Blue Devils and heres a giant Dukes defense really starting to wear on Josh Bosco hes not used to playing these major minutes against this type of pressure aay got the roll as Steward went up for the block theres young banging with a J finding the cutting Blakes and tipped out of bounds by Burger Blakes McCain Foster Stewart and young the five for Duke McCains got nine points and a team High seven rebounds Foster drives and got fouled on the way Music up did move some pieces around in the middle of last season they moved Tyrese Proctor to the one and put Jeremy roach off the ball we really paid huge dividends you know they turned into a different type of basketball team kind of a team that played more of a quicker fast uptempo Style with a very efficient point guard but Proctor has taken it to a new level this year you can just see the confidence understanding how Im the quarterback out here on the floor everything runs through me to start but got great balance they unselfish play they can score in a lot of different ways as we said fast break they can go inside they go in out or they can just play a pure power game if they have to but I like when Young comes in because they run things through him and hes always got his head up to make that extra pass finding an open cutter he played more minutes in that win against Michigan State he and Caleb Foster both did as really the only two guys off the bench for Duke Quin bger for three out of the corner for Bucknell good execution by Bucknell understanding Dukes going to help on that dribble drive and kick to the weak side that drive and drift Foster can answer and McCain tracks down the offensive rebound and Duke is plus 17 on the boards TJ Powers into the game again McCains feeling it well theyre all feeling it because theyre unselfish there the court is spaced theyve got their head up their timing is excellent against that zone with their cuts and their ball reversal off an 11th offensive rebound for Duke good catch a just roll to the rim and Osco has settled down a little bit at the point in the last few possessions has three turnovers but does have seven assists good patience from Foster and then Stewart follows it up well this is where Duke size is just overwhelming Buck now right now I mean just the numbers not only the size per se but you bring in young you bring in Stewart Off the Bench you just keep going inside up on the glass TJ Power number 32 recruit in the country before he just checked in and played one minute in this game hes back in and Duke is in total control Midway through the second half at Cameron are you having they won eight Patriot League regular season titles in a 9year span is recently concluding in 2019 and who could forget that 2005 team that grabbed the sports attention with a win over three seed Kansas Pat flaner he did an unbelievable job and helping out at Penn State with Mike rhods Dave Paulson did a terrific job as well hes now at Holy Cross he had left Lewisburg to head off to George Mason driving dish and Williamson got the feed from bosow and now year one for John Griffin thei of course he was on that 2005 Team part of two NCAA tournament squads four years as an assistant at Bucknell and two more trips to the big dance and then as we told you most recently four years as the associate head coach at St Joes well hes got the chops lets just put it the way it is he he grew up under a great coach and paid attention paid attention to all his coaches was a great player in his own right won a Philly Catholic league title and uh actually was there that night and unbelievable upset he went mono a mano with the Great Kyle Lowry and uh I knew he was a player that night when I saw yeah we asked John Griffin the third about it he said not one but two wins over Kyle Lowry who hes known since he was 11 years old those over Kyles head oh you dont forget those Jeremy roach comes up short a really good player out of St Joes Prep sh Stewart goes diving does stay with Parnell the only difference between that and where he is now is as a coach you only remember the losses you dont remember the wins okay next but the losses you blame yourself and you have the sleepless nights but John he I really like talking to him today catching up with him I know him since he was a Youngster and he he gets it he gets he understands hes got a great opportunity with a real good program I mean theyre on a rebuild but they will get back there because they have a good basketb program a guy known for his intensity as a player and now a coach as well I mean he talked to us at the end of the shoot around he was in a full sweat he and his brother who was an assistant coach as well and Matt Griffin on staff with Brother John late shot clock for Williamson who has the mismatch scores with the left hand itll be fun to watch Noah Williamson this year in The Patriot league for bunell 7 footer we told you from lvia averaging 11 A2 and seven so far after just 5 minutes a game last year had the big game in the win over Niagara with 22 and 11 you know the score is what it is obviously youre playing against Duke and in this building but John Griffin theii is going to go back to Bucknell proud of his team I mean they have played hard they played tough uh theyve made a lot of good basketball plays I mean theyre going to be a threat in the in the Patriot League especially when they get Edmonds back theres Blakes on the Block and now Proctor we told you Bucknell pick ninth in The Patriot League got to replace a lot from last year at the top of the Music rotation and a traveling call on Jeremy roach this Bucknell team lost its top three scores from last year Xander rice is now at Monmouth Alex timbermans at winr and we told you Andre screen the big fella left after last years junior year and is at Butler Xander rice had 30 the other night at West Virginia as they beat the Mountaineers on the road under King Applause rice and he went off nine and a half to go second half action in Durham Pak is being harassed by Tyrese Proctor gets tagged with the foul and that is three on Proctor I think John chs take away from this obviously time left but cyres Proctors ability to knock down a shot with confidence and also Mark Mitchell just kind of getting back into that flow as a score a proctor three of five from deep and Mitchell we told you with a careerhigh 20 and we had asked John shy today what you learn the last two games and he said I believe more than ever that we can be good because he felt like they didnt play their best or in some cases even close to their best in their last couple of games and fivepoint loss to Arizona and then nearly a double digit Point win against Michigan State on Tuesday BC had to Jack nearly banked it in young the rebound tipped out of bounds by a do yeah truthfully they did not play that well against especially against Arizona here ball control empty possessions quick shots but still they had control of the game late they were up late I believe it was 2 minutes to go they were up and uh you know we all know how good Arizona is going to be as well so when these teams match up this early in the season you learned so much about your team and what you need to do moving forward well McCain no and Williamson the rebound its been college basketball so much better in the last 10 years because of these early season matchups the teams are just going out and playing each other heres roach and he drew the foul from forest its so much better when you get the heavyweight showdowns the first couple of weeks I mean when did you ever get back in the back in the day as we used to say uh Arizona at Duke in the second week in November and just a regular n conference home and home on campus so Jeremy roach after getting up going to the line the senior twotime Captain leads them in minutes and recently went over a thousand career points a lot of times though Mike your ability to schedule more difficultly is directly affiliated with the length of your contract me just tell you that much you know you want better feel good in your shoes before you start scheduling Arizona home and Home in both John obviously the brand new contract and Duke is so smart locking him in and then Tommy Lloyds a just a star at Arizona no doubt hey tomorrow tune in to our week 12 ACC Network football lineup starting with number 10 Louisville against Miami in noon Eastern then the hoges and the pack in blackburg at 330 and we finish the day with Syracuse and Georgia Tech at 8 all games available as as well on the ESPN app so you can watch anywhere yeah the leash is different and therefore the schedules are different well obviously Mike shashki is the greatest basketball coach weve seen in of all time but John Shire following his shoes has its been seamless you know obviously because of Mikes support because of the school support but because hes so good at what he does and he paid attention while he was next to Mike Forest moves it and Ado sticks it Josh Ados first points the senior from California and energy Giver in his third year in the rotation for Bucknell proor navigating dumping off for young back out Foster got it 12 threes for Duke kale Foster new confidence was found in Chicago the other night and hes continuing that this evening really built off that scoreless showing and bounced back John sh said a big time response with his 18 Tomo said he was the best player Proctor spins one out and Forest clears it for Applause bunell Dukes got 20 assists on 28 made buckets and those dozen threes continue to play harassing defense hands up in the passing Lanes contesting this in a stance fors BOS to make a tough shot its a two on a step back thing I like about their defense is theyre very aggressive Mike but they dont over gamble they kind of just play solid with each other power or no hes still in search of his first Collegiate points and then look out on press row Ryan Yos crashing Applause in buckell trying to hang around Dukes defense forcing the Bison into tough shots like this this year compared to last year for Duke so going into the opener John sh had said to us our guards need the rebound and he said we didnt rebound the ball well our first two games but it was better against Michigan State its been a lot better tonight yeah you can work on that obviously they have good quickness You got to just go find the basketball but when youre so talented on the perimeter with playing those three guards you kind of get into that mindset youre always out on the perimeter whether its pressuring on that defensive end or offensive end driving kicking but you know you can work on that by film and theres certain a lot of drills you can you got to kind of pound that into their heads that you need their help a little bit because you cant rely totally on Mitchell and filipowski and at 6 three you saw Jared McCain he has a game high nine rebounds to go along with a dozen points Boris got free cant connect and then another guard rebound from Caleb Foster well thats the advantage though and John Im sure is pounding this into their head is you get it especially on the number of perimeter shots that are taking these days you going to get those medium to deep rebounds and then you can run get a run out by yourself power no and and cleared by a j its always nice when a guard can just Kickstart a fast break without having to outlet the ball get and go like you were saying with Mark Mitchell earlier a do comes up short and McCains got a double double now the 12 and 10 off the bounce he draws a foul what sort of tempo would you like to see Duke play at as the year goes along well you have a sense of what their best is uh they have to play fast they theyve got that ability to create with those three guards and then youve got just a a big guy who plays all over the floor and is so smart and so tough and understands that some everythings going to go through him but he can create for others as well cant leave Jared McCain that wide open hes made five threes and hes got 15 inside a six to go in every touch challenging for forest and then he turned it over Off to the Races Foster lays it in now this is where John shires going to go back tonight and have his tuna sandwich and say with a little smile on his face and say my team is getting better because right now you know even with a 41 Point deficit uh 31 Point deficit youre youre looking up and youre team is just overplaying everything and pressuring the basketball and harassing theyre not taking a step back at all defensively coming up next our double header continues with Carolina ranked 20th in the country hosting UC Riverside at the dean Dome at 800 catch it all on acc Network and the app late night TOA fish is that what I heard yes but Mike I did go to a state school I didnt go to Notre Dame I didnt know 82 minus 51 is not 41 31 thank God we have a good producer in my ear to correct me good 509 to go couple of fouls on Stewart and AD do earns another splits at the line and Foster the rebound its Foster Blakes Stewart power and McCain and Stewarts got a chance at three hes got a chance to be really good because we all know what a great athlete he is but now theyre starting to show signs of becoming a good basketball player just the rim run is just special just unbelievable the footwork the ability to kind of gather himself clear some space a little drop step in the soft jumper grew up on the same street as Grant Hill those families very close in the upbringing of Sean Stewart who was number 19 in our ESPN 100 a McDonalds allame and as Duke fans know by now a standing vertical of 36 in the highest recorded in Duke history that topped Zion by a inch that plays well the luxury of bringing in steart and you bring in Reeves when he gets healthy and Ryan young and power thats where you can play a little bit more aggressively on the inside because youve got fouls to give and they showed it in the Michigan State game with philipos in fou trouble in the first half they just the lead Groove for Duke with him on the bench its been 10 Deep for Duke in this game and if youre just joining us no Christian Reeves because yesterday in practice sprained his right ankle so unavailable for the Blue Devils tonight the lead is an even 30 its funny it doesnt seem like it because Bucknell is hasnt relented they played solid they not just coming down the floor taking bad shots not turning over but Dukes defense has really been good and allowed them to get out and transition then of course their their spacing and their ability to move the ball from side to side and find open man and knock down the shot has really been the difference saw the 11 turnovers for bunell and theyve shot at 38 from the floor against dus defense Berger shot clock at four driving on Power and Blakes with the steel to save the power Foster in transition rounding out in the rebound Moda now Barnell runs and backs it out the bosow you know and everybodys not going to let you run up and down the floor we know that we know that when you play against Virginia you theyre going to make it a possession by possession game so you have to run good half court offense but I think Duke has that ability because they have that balance they will go high low theyll use the bigs inside theyll go into the paint theyll reverse the ball they theyll dribble drive into the gaps and then theyll take their threes on opportunity if they dont have transition McCain quickly through the leg slashing and fouled by Williamson 335 to go duke up by 30 trying to get to three and one basketball double header right here on accn that starts with number 25 Oklahoma in Charlottesville at 2 Eastern and then its Bucknell against the top 20 fo in Louisville at 400 both games also available on the ESPN app with Tim Welsh Mike Monaco with 335 to go here at Cameron Indoor Stadium The Crazies watching a top 10 team in Duke trying to get to three and one on the young season next up for Duke itll be Lal on Tuesday and then Southern Indiana week from today here at Cameron before the ACC SEC challenge the following Wednesday on a trip to Arkansas John knows thats a big game as well just put some points on the board for the old resume and obviously going to Arkansas you can do that with Eric musan Squad is again loaded in deep and Bud Walton Arena is pretty special place this is as good as it gets here but thats thats right up there yeah John shy was already chatting with us about what that ones going to be like making that trip to Arkansas its going to be a late night special walkon Spencer hubard is into the game he got a scholarship before this season and had points in the opener for Duke against Dartmouth 55 and white Blakes down the lane with the Finish Jaylen Blakes has played his tail off here in the last 10 minutes starting with his defense and his overall hustle and intensity the guys coming off the bench continue to to fly at Bucknell and then he just added his first points and now Stewart wrangles down a rebound 240 to go meanwhile for buck no this is their fourth straight road game we told you all in a span of nine days they finally get back home Monday against Southern Indiana here is Blakes navigating the pick and roll with the Stanford transfer Neil Applause begovic Williams into the block cant finish over Stewart B ofit straight on Stewart fighting for the boards and he got it free to power inside of two minutes and a fresh 20 a little bit of a collision over there power fouled but have to put the whistles away Hub calling for a ball screen got to get it up he does Ed Short fan favorite you can hear Applause that AAS for Williamson inside of 90 seconds to go Stewart didnt bite Moda pivoting and back out for Applause burer bosow on the drive mccre the cut the finish and the foul its good cut by Brandon M on the weak side and I know they like him they think hes going to be a player down the road freshman from the bronos he a utility guard who John Griffin the third even said back in the summer hes a really good cutter we found the space there from bosow reminder dont go anywhere we will get you to Chapel Hill for Carolina and UC Riverside 11 10 to go Applause here power got his own Miss and Drew a foul well you can see why John sh really likes power ability is another big just to put the ball in the deck change directions good footwork and fluidity at the rim and to see him play a little bit in his prep School up at Worcester Academy is absolutely going to be a good player hes got his first College Point free throw at the line for the native of Shrewsberry Massachusetts hes a really good baseball player as well a lefty up to 88 mph and a selfdescribed pretty good slider too thats imposing its 69 coming at you little Randy Johnson yeah final Applause minute Patrick OBrien true freshman was looking for somewhere to go and now Moda spinning on begovic and the finish that Pucket significant to some 7 second difference between game and shot clocks well John griin the third its got to be proud of of his team they fought hard hes coached him hard and theyre going to grow theyre going to grow he is an excellent basketball coach learned a lot tonight but Duke I think is growing as well understanding their roles understanding that they can play inside out and confidence growing from their perimeter players as well as with the ability to knock down shots hubard whistled for a block with 12 seconds Applause left so a couple weeks away from things ramping back up for Duke mentioned Arkansas then about two weeks away from that conference opener in Atlanta with again the early league play at least initially against Georgia Tech elsewhere around the league n name got a good win in Brooklyn and Miami got a win in the Bahamas against Georgia mat shik Carlos Boozer theyre standing by as we close things down at Cameron Duke is three and one 9060 the final over Bucknell here at Cameron tap to buzzer effort by Duke John Shys got to go home tonight and feel real good about
