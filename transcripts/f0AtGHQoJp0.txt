was so surprising for a Syracuse team that was trying to make a surge in ACC play We are underway our night cap of our midweek double header in the ACC and its Virginia Tech that starts with the basketball Hooks three and three in conference play All three of those losses have come in the final 10 seconds but they start strong with Avdales Take a look at the starting five for Syracuse cant turn it over as much as they did against BC Randolph 18 turnovers You cannot do that And 14 of those are from your your two best players and Nate George whos taking care of the basketball throughout his career and Donnie Freeman each having seven You cannot have that here if you want to come out on top Kings fires a three and hits it Good start by both teams Top Dallas lost the handle cheering and applause They say he was on the line so itll stay Virginia Tech ball Kings was as he reached in Hokei starting lineup Mike Young deciding to put Ben Hammond into the starting lineup making his third straight start Been a difference maker thats helped Dallas out It does It moves him off the point And now in the half court he becomes the deacto point guard in half court And with his size you cant blitz him He throws it over the top and just in one dribble hes at the rim like the previous possession That just rims out from Jaylen Bedford another sharp shooter on this Hoke team Heres Donnie Freeman I think Beford has benefited from both of those guys being there Talking about Hammond and ADAs ability to beat you off the bouncer Draw so much attention Given Beford a lot of open looks Starling weaves in Didnt get a clean look Well defended Christian Gerdak stuffed it He moves his feet so well You cant jump over a piece of paper but hes always in the right position Hes got great feet and great hands A Dallas works his way in Neo Abdales everything but the finish And theres Gerak Tips it in You cant move him Once he gets the spot its his And when youre fiveman like Kyle has to rotate over and alter a shot good luck when any of the front line guys or guards trying to crack down and box out Gerak Well Gerdak sprung to life with Toby Lwal injured for much of this hoping season And even now Lal is back healthy and Mike Young has trusted Gerak as just a freshman in the front court Yeah here Gerok just a steps slow but to your point he gets the foul there Once he got forced into the lineup he was the third string big and once he got forced into playing Mike Young couldnt take him out of the game Theres Adrien Autry year number three as a head coach for Syracuse and came up the ranks as an assistant coach for Virginia Tech from 2008 to 2011 Everybody knows the importance of this game for Syracuse back at home coming off that disappointing loss to Boston College Nobody knows it more than Adrien Autry You know obviously a huge setback to lose to BC when you talk tournament chances which everybody does here in Syracuse and theyve made it harder for themselves no doubt Randolph but the Orange they can still win their way back onto the bubble The opportunities are in front of them starting with tonight I think its surprising the BC game was them obviously losing the game and you see BC winning early today and theyre playing better but the Orange have been playing better And with Donnie Freeman coming back in the lineup you look like best basketball is ahead for the Orange And lets see if they can get back on track Alive on the money William Kyle on a rack attack William Kyle with the great pass and great finish there by William Kyle We know his athleticism and no hesitation there by Nate George coming off that ball screen Both of these teams starting strong on the offensive end Okeis have made three of their first five Hammond draws a foul here Called against George Cannot gamble on him Hes difficult enough to keep out of the paint Your job against Benny Hammond is just keep him in front if you can Try to use your length to make him shoot over the top Hes so shifty and quick Bedford stays with it Blocked at the rim Gerak there to clean up the spill for two Thats going to be a problem all afternoon I mean all night long You know when William Carol comes over to block shots which he does as well as anyone in the country someone has got to come over and box out Ger George got a good look from three but couldnt make the Hokes pay Hanssberry so good in the midrange Yeah its just a really gifted score the closer he gets to the basket But Nate George has got to engage the ball a lot quicker You let Benny Hammond get it you dont engage him that late His speed as you see here getting in the passing lane can alter a game Hammond the steel couldnt get the finish Well defended in transition by William Kyle and they say it touched Hammond last Itll be Syracuse ball here Youve got to bounce passes on the perimeter Im not a big fan of and I think Minnie Hammond thought that ball was just clearly off of William Cows hand and officials thought it otherwise Virginia Tech has started strong on the road with a late tip Theyve made four of their last five shots early lead Gerak couldnt control that one So itll stay Syracuse ball underneath their own hoop coming out The energy is the efforts there Lets see about the execution right now Good start Mike Young has the Hulk Hes primed here They One thing he told us he didnt want the desperation of Syracuse to to be a factor in this game Hes challenging his guys to come out and play really hard and play well I think thats the frustration from the Syracuse fan base The talent is there the effort is there the results have not been Donnie Freeman hes been a difference maker Knocks down the three to tie it at 10 He has His versatility has been the key to why the Orange have been playing their best basketball here of late until again the disappointing finish to the BC game was I think more the issue They led that game for 33 and 12 minutes but did not get the win A good start here Trying to do early has been early and often attacks Syracuse in the paint He wants to make this a game of physicality He feels the depth he has again with his Kings got it again Two early threes for Nate Kings Hes on a heater Had 27 versus BC Five threes and hes come out and knocked down two quick ones here Thats a great sign for the Orange Nate Kings knocking down shots Yeah hes got eight of Syracuses 13 Heres Abdales Draws a foul of the double team Starling came over and committed the foul Tell you theres so much dribble penetration for Virginia Tech William Cal is the only rim protection they have And right now hes rotating over to stop all the dribble penetration and posing problems on the offensive glass inside A Dallas misses the layup Got away with a foul there Baseline out of bounds play Now Syracuse going inside William Kyle had a layup but PASS IT OUT STILL GETS IT to go A tougher finish than he originally intended but it counts all the same Now he doesnt have the physical advantage over Gerak but when he leaves the game great decision quick to go at the front line guys with Toby Lu Allen Hes more of a thin front line guy playing a four Now Hanssbury who started the game at the four is at the five Bob Dallas this time connects Hes getting good looks Virginia Tech continues to attack the paint Thats the advantage now of having Ben Hammond in the lineup and him rotating from point to shoot guard He gets to dictate his matchup Freeman the floater doesnt fall Toby Lau and Jaden Shoot have come off the bench for the Hokes This is a Virginia Tech team offensively Randolph that is so balanced You take a look at their last four games Four different leading scorers Anybody can be the scorer for Virginia Tech That had been the key to both teams until Donnie Freeman just kind of took off here lately The Orange is that way Both teams for the majority of the season had five guys averaging in double figures Theyve shown the ability to rely on different guys Execus has just been a little bit more dominated by Donnie Freeman here lately And JJ Stling heads to the bench picking up his second foul in the opening six minutes Jay both of those fouls are just bad fouls for an experienced guard Goes right into Tyler Betsy who came in for Starling and commits the foul You can see the concerted effort Theyre going to attack the paint They feel like again the Hokes feel like they are more physical Theyre going to pound the paint See what adjustments the Orange make on that front line Will they go zone Will they trap Shows was coming in Had 22 and 11 against Notre Dame Hes coming off the bench but he plays starter minutes Missed 10 games with injury and comes in and they didnt know how quick he was going to be to get to his normal minutes He was on a minutes restriction Not for long Hes back playing his normal workload and a difference maker in that win against Notre Dame when he went for a double double Theyre close Once they get Tyler Johnson back and having their team hold and when they do watch out ACC Nate George cant get into the offense because an illegal screen was set by Sadique White You know Whites had limited minutes with Donnie Freemans return Its been hard for him to find a rhythm as of late The problem for the Orange its hard to take Donnie Freeman out of the game And so what it forces you to do now is play small and put Donnie Freeman as your five Abdales attacking White misses the layup Offensive rebound Battle for the ball and Abdales that rolls around and doesnt drop Two missed layups for Abdales Neo Dallas has got to find a way to finish those shots that hes gotten to the rim nearly every time he wanted Unable to finish Yeah not much to show for it Freeman lines up the three Cant connect Long rebound stays Syracuse ball This is the concern I have with the Orange offense Its a lot of dribbling and standing around that cheering goes down on the second effort for Sadique White off the lob from George So used to having William Cow there and now everyone else on the floor is a pip and pop guy Someone has to penetrate the defense to make it easy for someone else Dallas misfires the three and hes letting it fly Hes already taken seven shots only made two Betsy from the corn Its good cheering Thats the concern You had to reassert him in the lineup and he has proven to be their best player and now everyone else is trying to figure out how to play around him Hes had such a big impact Its hard for Red Archer to take him off up off the board Its been a great big man battle to watch Ammani Hanssbury against Donnie Freeman A George tracks down the jaded shoot miss Virginia Tech has missed their last four shots Its allowed Syracuse to grab control of this first half Kings the hot hand early Hes got eight Shot clock down to five Freeman reathers it The shot clock resets White a three Great patience there by Donnie Freeman Not panicking Shot clock was slow to reset Didnt rush it Syracuse has already knocked down five threes Thats only the fourth three of the season for the freshman Sadique White Jr Some great play here Just understanding the clock reset Probably should have been a foul but looked like it Syracuse will take the three instead Sneak White knocking down a three And thats not his strong suit versatile athlete there but those are the shots you take Its only his fourth three on the year Well JJ Stling on the bench with two fouls Cayenne Anthony and Bryce Zephr have come into the game Zephrs last appearance was at Georgia Tech earlier this month Theres Carmelo Anthony watching his son Cayenne cheering The Syracuse only had two bench points total of the loss against Fost College They are searching for a bench boost offensively Tighten up He can jump out of the gym He could have dumped that with his forehead He jumped so high He literally cut it and dumped his head so he didnt hit the rim Hokes 14 of their 15 points have come in the paint Syracuse still leading by eight Betsy cant connect are doing a really good job of making shots right now but theyve got to control the dribble of the Virginia Tech Hockey offense Theyre just getting in the pain at will and forcing a lot of rotation Bedford step back Its good Jaylen Bedford burries a step back three Yeah use his physicality there against Ken Anthony Just using his body push off there Something the freshmans going to get better at as he physically matures White missed it Hes not a good shot We just told you he only made his fourth three of the season a moment ago and he takes another there Off ball foul gives the ball back to Syracuse Good time to remind you next Saturday ACC Network quadruple header starts at noon with a good one between Pitt at Clemson and then North Carolina at Georgia Tech This is the critical part of the season January moving to February teams are sorting themselves out in conference play in the ACC Its been a log jam in the middle of the conference These two teams are part of that games like tonight I think itll be that way until the ACC tournament Jay yeah I think its just that much balance and parody in the league and the teams that you know there there are no gimmies See Miami found out that out against Florida State Syracuse found it out against Boston College Have won two in a row now And pit with coach Cape was always well coached and tough defensively And theyre never an easy out So if you dont come to play just dont win in this league right now Heres Donnie Freeman Distant Its a lot of standing around right there You You want to see someone for Syracuse make a play for someone else not named Nate George Colin for it Trying to post up on Anthony Splits two Misses the dunk Gerak rips it away and he cashes in inside As we talked about thats been the theme all day Theyre trying to punish the orange inside And again you rotate off Gerak One of the guards have got to crack down and try to push him out which I dont think they can do but you got to make sure he doesnt get the offensive rebound Freeman trying to end the scoring crowd AND HE DOES DONNIE FREEMAN drains the three and that ends a seven nothing Hokes run Thats another one of those dont take the quick shot He shoots it and he makes it and you screaming good shot Certain guys you just got to leave allowed him to have a longer leash on the offensive end of the floor and thats definitely Donnie Freeman for the Orange Syracuse has made nine shots tonight Six have been from three Virginia Tech the opposite philosophy Theyve gone inside Only have one made three Down the lane off the window No good from White Hammond in attack mode Pull up pop Got it Hes just a gifted scorer He really is Hes a much better scorer than people give him credit for And its why hes forced Mike Young to put him in a starting lineup Mike Young says he scored a ball better than he he thought he would be able to do even as a senior Just really impressed him with his ability to get going off the bounce and create for himself and others It wasnt necessarily recruited as a scorer as Anthony hits it plus the foul a Cayenne do his thing They were working extensively but two hours before tip off Really emphasizing foot dripping from Cayenne too Initiating contact offensively creating space with his feet No one in the history of this game was better than doing that than his dad Virginia Tech finds themselves at a sevenpoint hole Kyen Anthony looking cheering for the steel Knocks it away Itll stay Hokes ball 9 seconds to shoot Multiple guys either Ben Hammond or Mwah Dallas will have this ball in their hand and make a play Hammond right down the lane Missed it Had to go high to try and beat the Syracuse blocks at the rim This is a great rim protection Syracuse team One of the best teams in blocking shots in the nation That forces the offense to change what they normally do But they offer shots at the rim and do a great job of it with the perimeter guys as well Theyre not just blocking shots with their four and five Crosscourt pass Good look for three Nothing but the bottom of the net for Ben Hammond Getting shooting the ball so much better Playing with so much confidence Its up to 36 on the year from behind the threepoint line Freeman Tough take Rattles in and out No good Gets his own miss Keeps the possession alive Anthony into the paint ditches it off Easy finish for William Kyle Great drive there by Anthony reading the defense Not getting too deep Drawing rotation and passing for William Kyle for the easy bunny Ansbury contested three Cant connect cheering So Syracuse sharing the ball so much better today Nine of their 11 baskets have been assisted In the loss to BC they only had 10 assists on 26 makes This is just a great drive here And of the 11 baskets Syracuse have assisted on nine Thats the key to this team offensively with their struggles theyve had all year long I think theyve gotten themselves in trouble when they come down No passes just everybody attacking off the bounce When they try to create for a teammate it completely changes the dynamic of their offense Now youre looking at a team that becomes really scary with the the way and the capability they are having on the defensive end of the floor Kyle trying to spin his way free makes it This is what you wanted to see If youre an Os fan play with a level of desperation This is a very good Virginia Tech team thats not going anywhere Were going to have a really good game thats going to go down to the wire Backto back baskets for William Kyle The lead back up to eight for the Orange Hanssbury feeds Laauo Good finish at the rim Hanssbury front front court is an issue because they both can pick and pop Really good passers Offensive foul Illegal screen Gives the ball back to Virginia Tech Thats a good call But I thought he used his right shoulder there on the screen You love the physicality in which the Orange are trying to play But a couple of bad fouls couple of illegal screens and hopefully aggressive on the defensive end of the floor Im going to put the Hokes in the bonus next foul Donnie Freeman taken out of this game Adrien Autry has gone with JJ Stling on the bench since the 1406 mark So now playing without Starling and Freeman Big opportunity for this orange bench Protecting this sixpoint lead Heres Neo out Dallas 6 seconds to shoot Lau has to hurry Down to three on the timer Lau goes up with it This fires Good execution on the offensive end Even better on the defensive end of the floor William Cow was everywhere in that possession Anthony fighting through traffic Draws the foul and hell go to the line to shoot two Every time Ive watched Ken Anthony I just think he needs to stay in attack mode He just has a natural gift You could just give him space and not allow the physicality to get to him He can always have a positive impact for the Orange The latest in the Were number one documentary series chronicles the 1993 national championship winning Tarheelss led by Dean Smith You will get never before seen footage interviews with players and coaches Available now streaming on the ESPN app We got Carmelo Anthony in the house 10 years after that 93 team 03 We got to get a career number one Syracuse uh documentary and production laughter going right now Kayen Anthony getting extended minutes of this first half with JJ Starling in foul trouble The Orange finds themselves up eight Hammond tough take Tell you what Bryce Zephr has come in and really been a spark defensively Good take The Hokes been taken out of their offensive rhythm which is tough to do Theyve been a very consistent team on the offensive end this season No no no You think about their balance and what they have done by Syracuse in this first half The Orange up eight with 329 left until halftime Lets go check out school of the year Tomorrow were going to keep Three seconds Heat Heat Thursday night ACC Network womens music basketball double header Miami is at Notre Dame at 6 to tip things off And then North Carolina in Atlanta to take on Georgia Tech That is Thursday right here on ACC Network And heres head coach of the Syracuse womens basketball program Felicia Legget Jack what a season the Orange are having under Coach Jack 16 and three Just had a big win against Stanford And no rest Shes here on a Wednesday night late tip off here at Syracuse And Coach Jack rooting on the men right now Syracuse in front of Virginia Tech 352 Shes sitting there Theres a little break in the action Let me hit a couple of recruits up Well I think I saw Syracuses football head coach Fran Brown walk in as well Now that man is always recruiting as well So they got recruiting covered here in Central New York Bryce Zapper getting big minutes for the Orange right now And his last appearance against Georgia Tech played for less than a minute Hes been in for more than 10 in this first half with JJ Starling in foul trouble Hes been really good defensively being really disruptive at the point of attack WILLIAM KYLE cheering ONEHANDED JAM William authority The shot clock was ticking down No problem for William Kyle to hammer it home I almost jumped out my seat on that one I didnt know what to say looking at that I thought he was going to lay it up off the glass My goodness Thatll wake you up late night Wednesday night ACC double header in the night cap belonging to Syracuse in this first half of Dallas cheering Not a high percentage shot there Hes had a frustrating first half Yeah hes really struggled at the rim Hes gotten there that time I thought he should have used his left hand Hes really overly concerned about the shot blocking ability Anthony called for a walk Yeah he didnt He wasnt ready to shoot it on the catch He was ready to shoot that He should have caught it and shot it He had predetermined he was going to drive Hes got to catch that and let it go Virginia Tech in a threeinut scoring drought How do they jolt their offense here Randolph Oh theyre getting opportunities Just that rattled in and out No good Thats not a bad shot there There is everything cheering but the finish I got numbers if he pushes it The trailer Hammond hits the three Much needed for the Hokes Hocuses need to weather the storm right now Theyve gotten good looks Theyre just not making shots Betsy he was cheering and applause caught between a three and a dribble and he turns it over again Another opportunity there Just catch it and let it go Start doubting yourself and he elevates now and tries to dribble afterwards cheering Last two possessions on the offensive end have been really sloppy for the Orange for as well as Syracuse has played in this first half The Hokes trying to swing momentum right before halftime Crosscourt pass finds Hammonds and now Lw Lew lost the handle Stolen away Nate Kings has been really good on both ends of the floor Hes got to be gas Hes taking on bigger defenders Hes switching Hes guarding smaller guards shooters when he need front front court guys when he needs to cheering The unlikely lineup of Anthony Kings and Zephr Theyve been the bright spots for Syracuse So Virginia Tech good look in transition Shoot No good Lau offensive rebound Jump ball possession arrow goes the Oranges way And Syracuse can now hold for the right where they need to be Not expecting the Orange to shoot it as well as they have from behind the threepoint line Syracuse has controlled much of this first half but theyve fallen into a scoring drought in the last 2 and 12 minutes Could they find a bucket here in the final 10 seconds looking to add to this sevenpoint lead before halftime 4 seconds left in it Anthony trying to make something happen Kenneth Anthony gets it blocked by Lau Syracuse comes up empty Well Adriens team starts with a sevenpoint lead Virginia Tech starts with the basketball JJ Stling back on the court for Syracuse He sat the final 14 minutes and 6 seconds of the first half with two fouls and the Hokes go to Hansbury He had a very quiet first half and he cashes in the opening possession to start the second Problem is you try to lay off those front line guys JJ Stling his speed is a different animal coming in off that dribble handoff Well no rust for him 14 minutes on the bench to finish the first half They played very well without without him on the court Lwob lau hammers it home Thats the issue you have we talked about with the guards and Neo Agalas coming off that ball screen at 69 Hes looking over the top over the top Misses the layup Hes been attack mode to start the second half though Bedford right to the rack Hes fouled Come here This is a team again both teams know this is an important game Theyre coming out with a lot of energy here And I thought Nate Kings did a really good job of going vertical but he turned his body away Got to take that with the chest The Virginia Tech battle tested particularly at ACC play The Hokes three losses have come when they have been leading or tied with 10 seconds left in the game They have been state bitten late but they have played every team in conference play tough including tonight on the road trailing by four I dont know if Ive ever seen it happen three times to a team in a season but Mike Young certainly hasnt Its happened in the first six games of conference play Good turnaround there for Stling 413 Youre looking at the JJ Stling that was preseason second team Hes coming out super aggressive His speed is the difference maker And hes doing it on defense The hustle play by Stling Great anticipation leads to a Freeman three Cant connect Hammond blows by everybody Hanssbury calling for it Gets it Passes out of the double team Finds Hammond He cant hit it cheering William Cow just makes up for so many flaws on the front line of the Orange his activity and energy He challenges shots He could be in the threepoint line and run in and grab rebounds You cant see it at home folks But trust me when I tell you hes a oneman wrecking crew And whereas Virginia Tech has depth on that front line its really been all William Kyle tonight Theyve even had to play Donnie Freeman at the five for a three and a half minute stretch Starling lost the handle and turns it over You see the best and you see the worst of Sy Syracuse I think at times where they get into trouble is that they over dribble at times and need to be a little bit more decisive and a little early and also drive to a teammate Drive to create for someone else Abdales through contact gets it to go attacking JJ Stling Hes gotten there every opportunity he wanted to get in the paint just been unable to finish that time Was able to get one to go down Heres William Kyle 8 seconds to shoot Finds Freeman Freeman has to hurry Attacking Lal cant shake free That is just excellent defense by Toby Lal all over Donnie Freeman Thats just a great job of just paying attention to scouting report knowing Donnie Freeman when he flashes at the elbow he wants to get to that right hand Great job by the Wild holding his position taking that away forcing a bad shot in the turnover Very good start to this second half for Virginia Tech They made three of their four shots stringing together stops on defense Now Dallas misfires that time Kings fires a three hits it Nate Kings Thats his third three tonight Thats just great execution by the Orange and more importantly by Donnie Freeman Virginia Tech worked on that defense in the post when Donnie Freeman gets a mismatch Jaylen Bedford flying to the rim draws the foul Hell be at the line when we come back Pokeys team you lose that game and you made what was already going to be a difficult task that much harder And no doubt itll be an uphill climb for Syracuses NCAA tournament chances this season But if you win tonight you can try and kick on Its a long 1548 to go though Jay I know they lost to BC but they were starting to play some really good basketball If you can get this win here tonight theres plenty of opportunities to get quad one wins to put yourself back into tournament play Its not all doom and gloom for the Orange I know its easy to pile on when they lose a game like that to BC but youre in conference play now and things like that just bound to happen Nate George been very quiet Draws the foul and hell get two at the line And for Virginia Tech they came in tonight in Joe Lonardi ESPNs brackettologist First four out So squarely on the bubble A win tonight could actually be the difference in putting them in the projected field as it stands If theyre going to make it theyll have to win some of those quad one opportunities on the road Thats what Mike Young told us Weve got a gauntlet on the road Weve got to become a very good road team and theyll have their opportunities to do it The good thing about a lot of quad one opportunities they dont hurt you when you lose them You just need to win a couple You need just to win your fair share With the strength of the ACC this year theyll have plenty of opportunities both teams will to play themselves into the tournament And even though theyve trailed for most of this game theyve stayed within striking distance only down seven Hansberry has yet to get going in the paint Turn around Got it Ammani Hanssberry Thats his advantage I think against Donnie Freeman is to get him inside He has the ability to turn over either shoulder in the post Theres not a lot of room down there with William Call and Gerak battling Kings Hes had the hot hand but misfires that one Good look Good execution there by the Orange Just unable to knock the shot down Hansberry battling Freeman to the post Passes down to the double team Gak cheering had it stripped Mike Young wanted a foul The officials say play on Thats what the guards need to do We talked about that You got to crack down when William Cal rotates over to help George kick to the corner Kings no good Starling tried to fly in for the rebound and did just enough to keep possession with Syracuse was letting the ref know they missed one here and I thought the ball was clear and knocked out first then the foul came afterwards So I thought it was a good no call by the officials I know Mike Young doesnt agree with that but Paul was out of his hand before the contact thought it should have been Virginia Tech ball underneath but the hokeies steal it away Zero chance William Cow backs down Garrett Hack Bedford will cant connect on the three Virginia Tech is getting good looks in this second half They just cant make them Three of 12 from three Syracuse 8 to 16 Thats the difference in this game Shoot Cant corral that Itll stay Syracuse ball Good time to remind you next Saturday This is January 31st Great slate quadruple header right here on ACC Network It tips off with Pit at Clemson North Carolina at Georgia Tech two ranked teams next Saturday Part of our ACC quadruple header here on the network Just play WHEEL GET IN THE WHEEL I think you got to try to put Gerock in ball screens Just Syracuse Freeman trying to power his way in Pull up pot Throws off the rim No good Syracuse has now slipped into a two and a half minute scoring drought Put this lineup on the floor for the Orange Can you rebound The extra pass leads to cheering the flush Christian Gerach A really small group on the floor against the big lineup for Virginia Tech with Neo Abdales at 69 as a wing Gerok and Hanssbury at the four and the five Starling trying to make something happen Out of control layup missed And a foul A frustration foul called against Sadique White Stling sat the final 14 minutes of that first half and the Orange offense found a rhythm without him on the court Hes come in this second half and hes really forced the issue The ball stuck in his hands and the Orange missed their last four one of their last seven I think theyre attacking the wrong guy there Theyre attacking Hansbury in ball screens and he moves his feet a lot better than Gerak You allow Gerak to be spaced out Gardening City White I think you change those guys and make make him guard balls Shoot for the tie Hist and another foul on the rebound This game getting very physical That basketball is such a premium in a game like this and you battle for it a little too hard Thats four fouls by Monty Hanssbury And thats the issue that plagues him We talked about that in the open Hes a differencemaker but the foul trouble has been his downfall when he has struggled He just cant stay on the floor And hell have to come out for an extended period here Syracuse a threepoint lead Ansberrys had the assignment against Freeman Battle for the ball Ripped away Hammond has it Heres Ben Hammond Head of steam Kick to the corner Shoot NOTHING BUT THE BOTTOM OF THE NET Ties it at 45 Jaden Shu you got to know where he is Hes the one guy you cannot lose Shooting 42 from behind a threepoint line Got to find him in transition Virginia Tech on a seven nothing run to tie it here in the second half Freeman that rattled in and out It was halfway down but did not drop Hammond the floater doesnt fall and another foul on a rebound brings us to a stop in the action Talented not to share it and youre playing right in the Virginia Tech hands I dont I dont know any more nicer way to say it Well said Virginia Tech has dominated this second half cheering and theyve got an opportunity now to take their first lead since the 1640 mark in the first half They have battled back Give them credit for executing on the offensive end Well Syracuse has sputtered offensively Adrien Autry has gone back to a lineup that does not feature JJ Starling Remember he did not play the final 14 minutes of the first half with foul trouble And Syracuse shared the ball pretty well without him on the court So trying to inject some life as the Hokes take the lead Rolls around doesnt drop but Virginia Tech does go in front for the first time since the 1640 mark in the first half The Hogs is trying to be its almost like a boxing analog just body punching Syracuse They feel as though theyre the more physical team but they keep pounding Syracuse inside and on the glass They feel like they can pull this game out Syracuse has missed their last five shots Their last make came four and a half minutes ago Cenne Anthony back on the court He was an offensive spark of the first half Heres Nate George trying to make something happen A ferocious finish Sadique White Jr Nathan Much better offensive possession Ball moved from second to third side and then you finally got to an action that put Gerak in the ball screen and you get an alleyoop dunk Four Turn around No good for Dallas He struggled just three of 12 from the floor Well the freshman White and Anthony have given the Orange a spark offensively in this game No surprise theyre on the court here as the offense is looking for a jolt Freeman going right at Lal Righty hook no good Offensive rebound kick out And Jay thats just a contrast there of the previous two possessions You had a great possession before Just move the basketball when it all fails Put Gerak in a ball swing George in a double team His back off 3 seconds to shoot Freeman missed it He had no choice there but to go up with it with the shot clock winding down Gerak called for another foul Thats his fourth So Mike Young has a puzzle here with Ammani Hanssbury and now Christian Gerck both with four fouls Hell have to play small Now this lineup I think favors the Orange in the sense of now they can play through everyone but you still need to move the basketball You dont have to attack matchups anymore They dont have the size Continue to pound the ball inside Four guards on the court for Virginia Tech and one of them Ben Hammond just poked it away You can see Audreys upset about that The ball just sticks Donnie Freemans got to move the basketball there The wall going right at Freeman cheering who commits the foul Freeman Thats a visible frustration from the Syracuse head coach Hes reached a boiling point after this turnover slamming the table there Should be frustrating Hes trying to get these guys to move the ball share the ball and Donnie Freemans got to know he doesnt have to put the team on his back Its a lot of time left in this game and hes going to be involved in the action No need to hold on to the ball as much as he has Freeman comes out of the game Low lefty hook rolls off the rim no good cheering Now this is the problem that G Orange has when hes not in the game Hes such a big part of your offensive identity Who steps up now Nine minutes remaining in this one We expect a close competitive finish Another orange turnover Hammond in a run out and hell go to the free throw line to shoot two Mike Young saying it should be a goend He stepped all the way out onto Jim Beaheim court to argue his case And that backboard does shake now I dont think it altered the shot enough to make a difference I dont know how you change the ball Hammond knocks down the first Well Ben Hammond a very capable free throw shooter two for three on the night You go back to the triple overtime win against Virginia He was 16 of 18 from the free throw line Won them that game with his consistency from the strike And look for him with this lineup to get in the paint And this is the advantage of having Neo AD Dallas at 69 Now he can slide to the four Back and forth we go Late night in the ACC 10 lead changes Make it 11 WITH AUTHORITY Sadique White hammers another home Great job picking on a freshman We talked about Neil Abdales there Hes guarding Sadique White He comes up and sets the screen He doesnt switch Low trying to answer and hes found on his way to a dock But we have seen some great rim rocking tonight between these two highflying programs I think you got to do a lot of switching with the lineups that are on the floor That play is going to be there a lot with Lal with this lineup Hes out hes out there with four guys that can all play in the ball screen action cheering That just rims in for LW tie it at 49 Virginia Tech asking a lot of their big man Toby Lal right now with Ammani Hanssbury and Christian Gerdak both on the bench with four fouls That falls off the rim No good JJ Stling back in the game for the Orange The foul called against Lw who thought he got it cleanly Thats his first cheering The fouls are piling up for both teams We will be in the bonus the rest of the way after the next Virginia Tech foul Speaks to the physicality of this second half Anthony the floater doesnt fall Heres Hammond looking to go coast to coast Lost the handle Low cleans up the spill draws another foul and hell be at the line to shoot two offensively Hey both teams are playing hard and again this is a game that both teams need right Theyre theyre fighting for their NCAA tournament lives and they know that and theres a lot going on cheering Syracuse has cooled off from the threepoint line They started the game they were seven of 11 Since then theyve been one of seven And Virginia Tech has pound tried to pound them inside but Gerak and Hanssbury are on the bench with four fouls each So both team is trying to figure out what else they can do If youre the orange you want to have spacing cheering and applause to get to the rim because outside of Law theres not much the wall Theres not much rim protection there Starling rejected at the rim Followed up cheering Sadique White another rim rocker The Orange did what Virginia Tech had been doing to them The shot blocker comes over and alters the shot He didnt just alter it He brought broke the backboard blocking it cheering Foul called against Starling A late whistle will send Hammond back to the line Heres a drive and the ball comes over and blocks in the grass Saves it underneath his basket And Sadique White is there tried to tear the rim off And this on the other end cheering he kicks his leg out The pushers had to call it afterwards Virginia Tech has still not made a basket in the last 4 minutes and 27 seconds During that stretch they now have seven points from the free throw line Make it eight And theyre back up by two White playing with confidence Tried to go to the rim again Tied up Possession arrow stays with the Orange Hes trying to play physical against the freshman Got to know theyre going to double those guys inside and help Starling stepped on the line and thats a turnover Adrien Autry not happy about it Thought he was fouled which forced Stling out of bounds And they do change the call and thatll send JJ Starling to the line with a foul So Adrien Autry arguing his case ruled in favor of the Orange head coach Thats great officiating there I think Lee Cassell saw from the baseline and came up and changed the call Both of these teams in the bonus the rest of the way Starling makes them both Were tied at 53 716 left cheering Teams are playing hard Theyre battling Jay they both know whats on the line Syracuse trying to work their way back on the bubble after the disappointing loss to Boston College Our brackettologist Joe Lonardi has Virginia Tech in the first four outs They are desperate for a road win tonight to bolster their resume Virginia Tech just keeps going to the free throw line and they havent made a basket in more than five minutes now but theyve still managed to score via getting to the foul line Eight points during that stretch Thats Kyles third foul with this lineup J the paint is just so wide open and its allowing the guards with the proper space and drive Great job there by Beth getting in the paint playing off to the beat Wow Misses that one He is four of seven from the free throw line cheering applause Lets not forget Jay Wow Missed free throws and one of those critical losses cheering Well Virginia Tech their three ACC losses have come in the final 10 seconds where they have either been tied or leading Both of these teams know the importance of free throws Theyve cost them valuable wins over the course of the season Hokes have numbers but they dont push it And Kyle does well to get back They got an advantage inside now Now they got to rotate over No cheering jump ball and the arrow is with Virginia Tech I tell you what Nate Kings is having himself a game I mean its not just his threepoint shot making He has been competing on the defensive end of the floor here Tries to front fights around does a great job of getting that blocking that shot causing a jump ball Hanssbury back on the floor with four fouls Has it here Finds shoot Shot clock ticks down to six cheering Hammond down the lane The floater drops in for two Right around a 5second mark Youd like to see your guys communicate and switch that but its in the middle ball screen And thats because with Lals athletic ability you just dont want to switch a guard on him White forces the pass and its picked off THREEON ONE HAMMOND COUNT IT cheering PLUS THE FOUL BEN HAMMOND cheering Kings has stayed down clutching his knee Teammates help him up Take another look at the defense offense Yeah Ben Hammond great job deflecting that pass and here initiating the contact Nate Kings goes to the line with the chance to the and one Well this is Virginia Techs largest lead of the night They trailed for most of this game throughout the first half They have battled back Syracuse their lead was as large as 10 Syracuse seven second half turnovers and Virginia Techs ability to get to the free throw line Big reason why the Hokes are outscoring the Orange 286 since halftime Theyre just finding a way Jay theyve been struggling to make shots Theyve been able to put pressure on Syracuse and get to the free throw line And now the Orange about to come down and get a really good quality shot here Ben Hammond up to 18 points to lead all scorers Donnie Brandon back into the game for the Orange George left all alone Hits it Adrien Autry takes a timeout after the Nate George make Syracuse trying to battle back into quick transition offense has been a huge help for the Hokes Well both these teams are really good defensively when they decide to lock in Theyre going to take you out of their actions The difference in this game is just the Orange have been more prone to just a few turnovers here and thats just completely flipped it from a sevenpoint lead to now a fourpoint deficit Plenty of time in here regroup I expect a great finish here Youve been close and competitive throughout If you stayed up late on a Wednesday night youre about to be rewarded in the ACC because this has all the makings of a fantastic finish cheering Virginia Tech a fourpoint lead with the basketball Ben Hammond has had the hot hand 18 points to lead all scorers He has it here Now Dallas Foul called And the fouls have just continued to pile up for Syracuse in this second half Virginia Techs running a lot of single side ball screens now Looking for those lobs And if you switch like the Orange just did trying to punish you inside Now the Hanssburys back in the game So that is the Oranges 13th foul committed in this second half So Virginia Tech more than in the double bonus here for the final five minutes and change The Hokes have failed to capitalize as much as they normally do from the free throw line just 13 of 21 as a team thats under 65 Usually theyre up over 73 on the season sixth best in the ACC If theyre unable to close this out theyre going to look back upon those free throws knowing theyve given themselves a chance Theyve left a lot out there on the free free throw line And Syracuse fans knows how that goes at the free throw line Syracuse second worst free throw shooting team in the nation Kings lobs it for Freeman Donnie Freeman pull up pop Cant connect Theyre not going to allow him to get to that right hand Donnie Freemans got to make the adjustment and you go left and just catch and shoot Freeman just two for 13 Six points to his name Hes been averaging up over 20 over the last five games Abdales misses it Lal tracks down the rebound Abdales pull up three Left it short Battle for the board One by Stling George the lock Kyle corrals it Had no chance of putting that up Thats a great catch there by Cow George through contact cheering passes it out feeds Starling Starling puts it up Nothing but air Freeman battling for the ball And now Hammond has it Syracuse got to watch the spacing on the offensive end of the floor there cheering Abdales that drops in Been a tough shooting night for him Three of 14 before that big bucket Just bully ball there Nate King has done a great job defending him all night long But that time off Dallas was determined to get to the rim 34 points in the paint but those are the two most valuable for Virginia Tech T1 from the field Yeah theyre drawing the crowd and Dy Freeman was the focal point of the Virginia hope Virginia Tech Hoke defense and they were determined to take him out of the game Kings too much on it and the Syracuse scoring drought continues and theyll have to rely on their defense here trailing by seven under three minutes to play Hammond weaving through Lost the handle Theyre in perfect position to put it up and in Hanssbury got a hand to it Largest lead of the game for Virginia Tech Another Syracuse miss cheering Just another shot with no attempt to pass or three for anyone else been the issue for the Orange And now youre coming against a team thats executing at a high level on the other end Shoot the three Missed it Lao went over the back of Freeman Hes called for the foul And now Syracuse has made hard work for themselves after leading most of this first half of the first half trailing by nine with 2 minutes and 11 seconds left Theyll get free throws here because of the lau foul Thats a big opportunity for the orange Get points on the board with the clock is stopped Big opportunity here for Donnie Freeman to knock down a pair Freeman makes the first and earns the second Coming up later tonight nothing but net And then tomorrow after the womens games nothing but net Nobody has you covered in the ACC Like the Nothing But Net Crew after the games tonight and then on Thursday after the womens double header Freeman makes them both Syracuse will go fullcourt pressure here trailing by seven cheering into LW Hookies break the press Abdales double team finds Hanssbury Hammond shoots the three Rolls out No good cheering Opportunity for the Orange Thats a quick shot Again backtoback bad possessions on the offensive end by the Virginia Tech Hokes White cant connect from the corner cheering Syracuse commits the foul there Overly aggressive trying to win the ball back right after the miss Yeah it didnt need to take that three and just needed a quick shot Only four made threes on the season for Sadique White and one of those was tonight shots going for Ben and it sends Ben Hammond to the line who really turned this game around for Virginia Tech during that first half in spots just didnt have the offensive rhythm a Mike Young team usually has and Ben Hammond has dragged them out of it a team high 19 points seven of those points coming from the free throw line Well thats what he does As he gets in the paint he puts so much pressure on and he draws fouls and keeping him out of the paint is a tough task Freeman rolled the ball THE STARTLING AND HAMMOND STOLE IT AWAY Its a jump ball The possession arrow stays with Syracuse But how about the hustle from Ben Hammond Hes just wanted it more tonight What a performance by the sophomore And that exemplifies it right there Take another look at this Just a great effort there and Donnie Freeman threw it in and JJ Stling was not expecting him to roll the ball in play and Vinnie Hammond won the foot race Well its now or never time for Syracuse Time not on their side led by as many as 10 now trailing by nine Stling off the window and injling Adrien Autry calls a timeout Trailing by seven One have come against Syracuse last year and this year Hes got the Oranges number in a second half where Virginia Tech has dominated Betsy makes the three Back to a twopossession game 54 seconds remaining Hanssbury the inbounder squeezes it to Hammond and thats exactly who you want at the free throw line 10 of 11 on the night Yeah you may have to take the guy thats defending the inbound and keep the ball out of Ben Hammonds hands Im not going to allow him to close this game out Someone else is going to have to get up there and step up and make free throws And I dont want Hammond I dont want Jaden shooting free throws Everyone else is fair game cheering But you want a 5second count If youre in the orange on the defensive end of the flow here you dont need a three but you need a quick opportunity You got enough time here You can still foul more JJ starting in his speed and some step up ball screen here and get downhill Gets who just made the three fires another and is fouled So Tyler Betsy will shoot three from the free throw line with 454 remaining Betsy an opportunity to make this a fivepoint game Mike Young looks over here and just wipes his forehead after this foul Hes talking to Ben Hammond like what are you doing We cant see it there And I think he got him with the lower body I got Betsy a 63 foul shooter on the season Makes the first Two more coming Great opportunity here again Betsy makes both free throws Still one more on the way Yeah you pick up one Now you set your pressure And again Im doubling Vinnie Ham and Im not allowing him to catch this basketball and get to the free throw line Him and Jaden shoot But two guys you want to keep the balls out of their hand Make someone else step up and make free throws Betsy makes all three Fivepoint game 45 seconds remaining Virginia Tech does have two timeouts Mansbury gets it in to shoot THROWS IT AWAY Syracuse has it FREEMAN TO THE RIM Its a threepoint game cheering again Continue to deny Benny Free uh Hammond the basketball Make someone else cheering up ahead Hammond finds Lau Goes to the rim and is fouled Interesting decision He could have backed that out and killed 23 seconds off the clock here Instead decided to go to the rim here Jaden shoot just put the ball above his head trying to get rid of it Youd like for him to draw the foul A great job there making a quick basket here And cheering Sadique Sadique White with the foul there on the wall I didnt mean to honey And White is fouled out of the game cheering Low will shoot two Twopossession game Fourpoint lead for the Hokes We just showed you a moment ago Virginia Techs three ACC losses have all come with late misses Missed free throws Teams making circus shots cheering They have left the door cracked because of the turnover Two big free throws there by Laauo Again you dont need a three but you got to attack quickly here Under 30 seconds to play Starling right down the lane An easy layin for two Back to a threepoint lead for Virginia Tech 25 seconds left A Dallas trapped in the corner Betsy got a hand off it off Hanssbury And its Syracuse basketball Virginia Tech with two Do not allow Vinnie Hammond to get his hands on the basketball force someone else to get it and make a play and more importantly make free throws Nate George the inbounder Tosses it into Betsy Kings for the tie Missed it Aales has the rebound and hes fouled Neil Abdales will shoot two from the game You attack the rim and try to get a basket It still remains a one point a one possession game cheering if you cant get a steal in your course Now misses the first Virginia Tech has attempted 31 free throws tonight Theyve only made 22 cheering Now Dallas with a chance to make it a two possession game Fakes it into Stling Time not on Syracuses side Stling right to the rim Lays it up and in Cuts the lead in half and Adrien who have made five of their last six Hanssberry the inbounder He can run the baseline after the Stling miss cheering And the Hokes do have one timeout Hanssbury heaves it Finds Abdales whos immediately fouled Abdales just went one of two from the free throw line Just 19 years old The weight of the game on the freshmans shoulders as JJ Starling fouls out of the game He had to commit that foul Thats a really risky pass there for the Hokes but executed perfectly Hookies have lived at the foul line in this second half 29 of their 32 free throw attempts have come in the second half Can they close the game out from there with Neil Abdales stepping to the line The weight of this game on the 19yearold shoulders cheering Makes the first If youre doing it you got to be prepared If she misses the second one you got to go right away And if youre Virginia Tech you got to be matched up Out no good But Lel steals it away cheering AD missed the free throw Syracuse couldnt corral the rebound And now Toby Low will have two at the line What a missed opportunity for the Orange Its always the little things Jay Turnovers rebounding and here Only one guy on the free throw line for Virginia Tech Hokes and he wants it more and he gets it Does feel like the hustle plays have been the difference in this game as the fans here are still in disbelief for that moment here And and Betsy now fouls out He had to commit the foul after Freeman did not box out Lal successfully And all Toby Lel needs to do is make one of these two to make it a fourpoint game and likely put this game out of reach with only 5 seconds left in it Yeah And now if youre the orange you also have two players that have sat on the end of the bench Now Luke Fennels in the game along with Ken Anthony And those guys have not played in the last few minutes of this game cheering Clutch free throw One more coming Mike Young screaming everybody in the dunin here Do not foul Itll take a miracle now for the Orange Low knocks them both down late 5 seconds left in it George a desperation be He hits it but it will not matter Virginia Tech hangs on to a gutsy road win It leads Syracuse with a
