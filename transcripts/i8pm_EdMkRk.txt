as Duke trying to sweep the Bay Area after winning at Cal on Wednesday They got off to a slow start against the Golden Bears Used a late 13 nothing run to close out the first half and then dominated especially defensively in the second half holding Cal to a season low 56 cheering points as the opening tip controlled by the Stanford Cardinal out of bounds and Stanford a turnover It hit Oi after he tried to put it off the leg of Duke Its always interesting to see how teams start games defensively against star players and it was clear from John Sh We are getting the ball out of Okoris hands at the earliest opportunity Came off of that dribble handoff Double team was right there of Cororey not ready for it Quick turnover for the Cardinal Starting five for the Blue Devils Down the lane is Boozer And the lay and the game First points belong to Cameron Boozer Yeah I mean Duke goes to Boozer early in the game forcing the interior defense to make a decision on how they are going to guard him and it looked like Stanford wasnt prepared for that simple baseline or excuse me cut from the free throw line Ryan Agaral for the Cardinal Shot clock down to eight Agarwal trying to turn the corner gets inside the reverse and the rebound grabbed by Cameron Boozer Here comes Duke and Isaiah Evans Patrick Gumba poked away by Ryan Agarwal but a reaching foul called against Agarwal went for a careerhigh 20 against North Carolina on Wednesday Yeah Gumba had a big size advantage over Agawal Great job recognizing that going deep into that post Agawal giving up a lot of size Really had no choice other than to go for that steal Ends up getting the hand Heres Cameron Boozer spinning and hes got all four and the Blue Devils up four zip Yeah I I dont think that that was the game plan defensively on Boozer to just let him go oneonone against Young That is a big size advantage and skill advantage for Boozer I would expect Stanford to look to double team next time Benny Keeler Here is Oscar Heelte on the block and the freshman kicks it out Five to shoot for Stanford Agarwal finds an open Donovan Young way short on the three and it belongs to Duke And Young has been inserted into the starting lineup due to the injury to Aara He has came up short defensively there oneonone against Boozer and then that threepoint shot I think for Stanford a big game and a big opportunity against Duke and to this point we have not seen them really settled in the way that they were against North Carolina Second straight game the Cardinal will play without Chisum Para A lower extremity injury he has listed as dayto day for Kyle Smith and a turnover by Duke Here comes Ibuka Okori Benny Geler thought about the three Okori down the lane Has it ripped away by Cameron Boozer Here comes Duke Caleb Foster in transition And Foster and the rebound grabbed by Benny Geler for the Cardinal Great defense by the Cardinal on two consecutive plays Oori getting the steal from Boozer helping from the weak side and then the steal in transition trying to get it to AJ Roi Deflected stolen Here comes Caleb Foster Oneonone attacks Missed the layup Boozer The offensive rebound and put back That was a rebound in transition You didnt find Boozer but that was something that Kyle Smith was really concerned about Second chance opportunities for Duke The best offensive rebounding team in the ACC in an area where Stanford has had their troubles And at this end Stanford clearly having trouble with Dukes length Yeah And struggled getting the ball into a Corors hands Bennett Keeler missed the three and the rebound grabbed by Foster but a foul called against Duke going for the rebound Yeah I think if youre Stanford youve got to take advantage of the defensive presence that Okorei creates Get the ball in his hand Let Duke double team and then read what you have on the floor You have a fouronree advantage other places on the floor but you cant go away from Oy Ryan Agarwal gets free off the inbound and he missed from the corner Stanford out of sorts on the offensive end Boozer drop off and it falls off and the leaner from Malik Brown off the bench for Duke And here is Okorei across midcourt broken up by Duke Thats why Ibuka Okori can run and get it in the back court Okorei trying to drive and a foul out top and the first on Caleb Foster Yeah I I think sometimes when you are being double teamed every time you touch the ball sometimes its better to just go into an ISO so that you dont bring that second defender Very few people is is Dame Sar is a fantastic on ball defender I still if Im Stanford like that matchup for Cory him turning the corner getting into the paint Eddie Geler five to shoot drives on Kaden Boozer inside AJ Roi and Stanford is on the board He breaks the seal for the Cardinals Great move there by Roi Just a simple jump hook over the left shoulder but the strong duck in made himself available for an offensive play that was really going nowhere Pass broken up by Benny Ger and a steal for the Cardinals Okorei looks to attack Gets to the bucket Has a shot blocked by DSR and its out of bounds underneath to Stanford But Duke with a good start and Stanford with a turnover off the inbound Its lost in the corner and it goes over to Duke Thats already the fourth Stanford turnover in the first four plus minutes Yeah I mean if youre a coach that that is what upsets you much as anything when you have a timeout you draw up a play under out of bounds sideline out of bounds and you dont even get a shot of Sanford really just needs to settle down Let the game come to them a little bit Isaiah Evans launching a three had his foot on the line for a two but that was just a case his defender had his hands down Just go right over the top of him First two points for someone not named Cameron Boozer and the early sixpoint lead for the Blue Devils Aiden Camman off the bench for the Cardinals So is Cameron Grant and he finds Camman Deflected stolen by Duke Turnover number five for Stanford Transition Isaiah Evans missing a three Benny Geler pulls it down Stanford counters Lubuki in transition Foul will get to the line and its on Kaden Boozer Yeah And you could tell Okore is a smart player He knows what he is going to be facing all game long in the half court So if it is coming off of a turnover its coming off of a miss shot he is looking for anything in transition Smart move by him there He is as good as anyone in college basketball for a smaller guard creating contact Lots of times theyll go to that floater game Theyll go to the pullup game He loves getting into the body of the bigger defender and drawing fouls First point for the freshman And there are his parents who made the trek from New Hampshire Charles on the left Jamaa on the right as I Okori who has had 30 or more in four the last seven games coming off a Stanford freshman single game record of 36 in the win against Carolina Cameron Boozer backing in on AJ Roi and the pass underneath and the lay Elite Brown The versatility from Boozer on display Thats what makes him great He knows the double team is coming He sees if its coming high low and he has the patience to make that type of a drop off pass Not a lot of players in college basketball will do that Well Cory on a step back missed a three and the rebound grabbed Malik Brown the Syracuse transfer for Duke On the drive the step through the layin Cameron Boozer He went through three defenders there You know the blow by and then the step through and then the euro step I mean just you are seeing everything from him In and out on a three from Aiden Cam whos only made three threes all season Step back in the corner and the miss from Cameron Boozer So he is human and Stafford with the rebounder Yeah its deflected You just see Duke You just see Duke We talked to John Sh at at practice yesterday He talked about the importance of getting the ball out of his hands and mission accomplished here in the first seven minutes of this game Okori other than two plays in transition He has not been able to be effective in the half court Duke really selling out getting the ball out of his hands and the rest of the Duke players not making them pay Cameron Grant from deep and the rebound Cameron Boozer Now you knock down a couple of those shots and John Sh might change things up and do something differently but as long as the other guys for Stanford continue to miss this is what Okore is going to see all night And that was the recipe the other night Yes I went off against Carolina cheering as Kaden Boozer lost it out of bounds and Duke turnover but Jeremy Den Smith Ryan Agarwal other guys were stepping up hitting shots In fact Agaral and Den Smith each with 20 points and career highs for for both of those guys And that obviously is always the question mark with a star player is what are you going to do when he has an off night Where are you going to go Oscar Heay lost it Duke in transition Pass inside to Boozer Corner three on the way Short from Nicholas Jame the freshman from LA but kept alive by Duke cheering Cameron Boozer fouled as he lost the ball going up and free throws for Cameron Boozer Just such a quick first step because hes so strong If he gets a bigger defender on him he has the ability to do that Put his shoulder down drive by get to the rim Smaller defender hes going to look to post him up But what Ive seen early in this game is kind of an answer to what I think is the biggest question mark with Duke is can they lock in defensively for 40 minutes Theres so many games that we have watched this year or misses the first where they get up 10 points and they just become a little content trading baskets with their opponent But there was a game at Louisville They outscored him 40 to 20 in the second half of that game and that showed me the potential defensively of this Duke team And this is the closest thing that we have seen to that Eight points Theyve only given up four points One out of two Boozer has nine And that is something thats plagued Duke this season is some of the slow starts Well John Sh has to be happy especially defensively with where Duke is at to start this game Unbelievable Absolutely I mean this is exactly what he would want to see If you have a game plan and you ask yourself has it been executed Its pretty near flawless for the Blue Devils Smith lost the ball Diving forward Patrick Gumba and the arrow belongs to Duke Another Stanford turnover Thats seven in the first 8 minutes and 7 seconds And coach Sh has implored his team is to be the effort on the defensive end of the floor consistently We have seen it at times but this might be the best defensive start to a game weve seen from Duke all year Its like the line from Fletch doesnt take Sherlock Holmes to figure that out Even Larry Holmes could So youre saying Im Larry Holmes in this example Patrick Gungba on top Malik Brown for Duke as the Blue Devils go inside to lay in Patrick Gumbas first point Just just a clinic on both ends of the floor The unselfish play at the offensive end even with Boozer out of the game Gumba getting the ball in the high low Just looking effortless for the Blue Devils right now Seven straight points for Duke and Stanford just out of sorts One of nine from the floor They missed all four threes That was seven turnovers I Okorei who is beingounded Jeremy Den Smith drives throws it up off the window rattles out and the rebound Malik Brown for Duke Well that that might have been the best look that they have had in their last six or seven tries Its been a struggle Corner three way short from Nicholas cheering Stanford might have gotten a figure on Benny Keeler cut off in the lane Jeremy Den Smith FIRES THREE THATS what Stanford has to do When you get a stop YOU GET OUT and run every single time The length of Duke in the half court defensively I thinks going to be a problem all night When you can get in transition suck one or two defenders into the paint and kick out for threepointers That is great offense Well done by the Cardinal Foul called on Stanford Its on Benny Ger and the first against the senior but that was the key for Stanford against Duke the other night or against North Carolina Wednesday Austin they made 16 of 28 for three and the Cardinal made 10 of their last 13 threes to close the game Yeah I mean if you are a team that takes half of your shots from behind the threepoint line if you are struggling there its hard to make up that offense offensive output which is why the margin for error becomes a little bit bigger the better you play on the defensive end A lob for Boozer has deflected out by Jeremy Dmith 10 to shoot for Duke on the baseline Yeah and give a lot of credit there to Gumba I mean when you are playing opposite a player like Boozer you know hes going to draw that double team and that hard front you got to be able to throw it over the top The flip missed by Caleb Foster and the rebound battled for last touch by AJ Roi of Stanford and it belongs to Duke with a fresh 20 on the shot clock Stanford at 14 and four Its their best start since 2019 2020 and the Cardinal with wins against Louisville and North Carolina already here plus winning at Virginia Tech Stanford in fact has won each of their last four home games against ranked opponents The last time they won five straight first ranked opponents here at Maples Pavilion You got to go back to when Mike Montgomery and Trent Johnson were coaching at Stanford They won five straight from March 2003 through February of 2006 Cameron Boozer goes to run it down attacks off the dribble and the bucket Rolls it in with a left hand and Boozer already with 11 of Dukes 17 I mean just it it doesnt matter what you bring defensively hes got an answer for it if you guard him oneonone Just blew by Young and another Stanford giveaway Caleb Foster headbands Cameron Boozer and an offense No they call a block A block called Donovan Young of Stanford is first in the student section behind us Absolutely unhappy with this Lets take another look Young was absolutely sliding his feet Good call by the officials The contact was initiated by Boozer but I believe it was Young was moving Good call Fourth Stanford team foul Ball comes in Isaiah Evans off the inbound Long rebound Cameron Boozer Dar down the lane The size of Duke causing all sorts of problems Boozer with another offensive rebound The kick to Sar And Sar hes done a great job defensively on on a Cororey Throws down the hammer The emphatic spike from Dame Sar Danny Keeler trying to get free Pass inside to Donovan Young Underneath the kick Ibuko Cory in and out on the three and the rebound Isaiah Evans for the Blue Devil And that was the the easiest look he has had tonight on the drive and kick Nothing falling for the Cardinal Foul the second on Benny Geler Two shots coming for Duke Yeah I mean thats tough I mean Evans is 67 Giler cant stay in front of him But we look at Sar off the offensive rebound Take another look at it right down the middle and that is the place where you want to attack off of the offensive rebound The defense not set Saw our recognition and throwing it down And you can see why people at the next level are excited about this guy The length that he has what he could do on both ends of the floor 68 freshman One more shot for Isaiah Evans 87 from the line And hes been on a tear recently The last five games Eds averaging over 21 a game Hes made 20 threes in the last five games Yeah I mean he is another special player It doesnt stop Its the whole roster full of guys that could do it on both ends of the ball But for Duke they have 11 points off of Stanfords eight turnovers Stanford only has seven points in the game Jeremy Den Smith from way out there AJ Roi on the offensive glass And a foul is the second on Patrick Gunga slipper 21 Kyle Smith his second year on the farm previous stops Washington State San Francisco Colia and has the distinction of being the last at least of the Pack 12 as we know it the last pack 12 coach of the year in 2024 at Wazu Cameron Grant lets fly three Thats what hes in there to do Cameron Grant this year has taken 39 shots cheering to the floor 38 of its Well really what I want to see from Duke is can they have this killer instinct to take a lead from 13 and and push it to 20 So many times weve seen them get a 10point lead and content to just kind of trade baskets If this is a team thats going to be a front runner for a national championship put teams away Sar takes it to the rim once again The bigger defender He turns the corner draws the foul Foul on Grant Duke a couple of it and headed to the line Why would you want to be around the farmer Dame Sar at the line And one more coming for the freshman And the update on our top scorers the freshman that we highlighted Cameron Boozer is getting anything he wants right now I think that the difference in this as misses the free throw is that Duke has the ability to throw everything at a Cororey and say We are not going to let you handle the ball Were not going to let you beat you Stanford cant do that to Boozer You cant just triple team him when he gets the basketball because Duke has so many other pieces that could beat him But for Stanford its been a struggle for the other guys AJ Roi has it taken away Ninth Stanford turnover but Duke gives it right back The pass behind Isaiah Evans Yeah I mean and thats thats an example of what I just said I mean Okore had a guy on him a guy trailing him There was nowhere for him to go But he gets it to a wideopen stand for teammate and the ball stripped out of his hands for the ninth turnover Nine turnovers in a game in which you only have 10 points It is going to be a struggle until the other guys take care of the ball Jeremy Den Smith flies through for the offensive rebound And here he is Ibuka Okori has just two points from the foul line so far Theres two guys on him Theres nowhere for him to go STEP THROUGH AND SPINS IT IN SOMEHOW creating I buoy and that was a a breakdown there defensively Okori had picked the ball up so the second defender left and gave the opportunity for to actually go 101 but that was a tough shot Weve seen Okorei do it so many times Tough step back Cameron Boozer the miss Ryan Agarwal clears for the Cardinals Den Smith from deep too strong in the three and the rebound grab by Cameron Boozer already five rebounds We we said this earlier right That that Duke once they get up 10 you know can they put teams away A three from Boozer is short and Jeremy D Smith grabs a rebound for Stanford Inside six minutes left in the half Duke has led by as many as 14 points Cameron Grant drives baseline The layin Missed it The reverse Only a second twopoint field goal attempt of the season If Im Duke Im getting poozer on that low block Stanford really hasnt had an answer Turnover racing ahead Jeremy Den Smith down the lane AJ Rahuli fouled and one cheering THAT IS THE BEST LOOK FOR OFFENSE that the Cardinal are going to have You get a stop you force a turnover and you get out and run the other way before that set half court defense gets in position Great play by Rahosi finish and a foul and I think that Duke is just again Ive said it twice and I think its what were seeing Duke gets up 10 124 they are clearly in control of the game and they take their foot off the gas just a little bit offensively I think theyre settling for some shots theyre going away from some of their strengths they know that they can get every shot any shot that they want but if theyre not taking the shots around the post away if Im coach Sh I continue to go down low at 33 3 foul shooter missing the and one free throw The ball stripped by Ryan Agarwal and picked up by Duke Caleb Foster the lob and trying to finish at the rim but Cameron Boozer grabs it powers his way back up and in Two offensive rebounds You give this team three tries Very low probability They miss all three of them And Boozer with another strong finish Back to a double digit Duke lead and a STEP BACK IUKA OKOREI THREE cheering Just a matter of time before those shots start to fall for him But again defensively that was a shot in the first five minutes Duke would not allow Okore A little bit of a drop off And now hes getting oneonone looks Stepping out for a three Cameron Boozer answers for the Blue Devils I mean you just look at the shots that Boozer takes in this game He is getting layups offensive rebounds shots right at the rim or hes knocking him down from the perimeter Such a difficult guard already 16 for Boozer JEREMY DENT SMITH DRIVES THE LANE AND LAYS it in First points rather a second bucket for Jeremy Dent Smith And just spreading the defense out getting a nice oneonone dribble from the perimeter AND THE CHARGE DRAWN BY SECOND foul on Caleb Foster and Stanford starting to find a little bit of their game Absolutely Offensively things are opening up a little bit Defensively youre showing some signs of intensity and a Duke team that looked like there were no cracks in the first six or seven minutes Now in the half court how little room he has had to make plays Double team He gets rid of it Not able to get the play down low Now he gets into the paint again Another double team As the double team leaves he finally gets an opening and the strong finish And off of the high pick and roll Sar slips just a little Creates room and Oy able to get the long two But it has been a hard time coming for Oy in this first half His last game nine assists one turnover This game zero assists two turnovers The defense was at another level for Duke in the first 15 minutes of this half but they have led up and youre seeing some signs of life from the Cardinals And how about the last two halves Cameron Boozer at 17 points 10 rebounds in the second half in Berkeley on Wednesday And hes got 16 and six as Aiden Cam stepped on the baseline Stanford with 10 turnovers now They average under 11 per game 82 lead Have a lot of dignitaries here Thats Golden State Warriors owner Joe Lake sitting courtside Hes just at Cal the other day wasnt he He was No he was here actually on Wednesday night He was watching the Carolina game here at Maples Joe Lake a frequent visitor to Maples Pavilion Dame Sar missing from deep and the rebound flying in for the offensive rebound was Malik Brown and a foul on Jeremy Dent Smith of Stanford his first You just you see the frustration on Kyle Smith You know when we talked to him at shoot around this morning one of his biggest concerns was defensive rebounding I mean that was an excellent defensive stance in the half court there forcing a contested shot by Sar and you just at every position the length the athleticism just a little bit bigger a little bit faster for the Blue Devils and extra possessions to a team that already is playing at the level that they are makes it that much harder and Kyle Smith knows it One and one for Malik Brown Only a 58 foul shooter And Abuka Oorei claims the miss Stanford so uncomfortable offensively and Duke is the reason why Now Kyle Smith is spacing the floor with four shooters surrounding Aiden Cam McCory trying to drive on Dame Sar Cameron Grant lines it up for the corner in and out on the three and Dames Sar the rebound for Duke Yeah that is a great look And again we we talked about when you run that pick and roll normally it gets the point guard open but when teams are doubling now youre just bringing the extra defender So Kyle Smith going to an isolation Slam Cameron Boozer Malik Brown just missed the layup right at the rim But Boozer never gives up on a play Another offensive rebound and two of the easiest points Boozer has had all night 35 points 17 rebounds in his last two halves of basketball I mean its it it really is impressive He doesnt take a play off And another missed shot on a good look for Stanford And Boozer has scored the last six And an illegal screen out top Duke with an offensive foul And its on David Sar his first Look at Brown with the easy layup Misses Boozer comes in with the slam It is going to be a long night for Stanford You want to win basketball games Keep your opponent off of the offensive glass and dont turn the basketball over Two areas where the Cardinal have struggled mightily tonight And quite honestly considering the way they struggled in those two areas surprising theyre only down 10 Jeremy Den Smith the floater and the rebound Another one grabbed by Cameron Boozer And these are just shots that have fallen for Stanford They were falling against Carolina on Wednesday Kayen Boozer off the window and the first points for Kaden Boozer Duke is up 12 Den Smith gets inside Hayden Cam had it knocked away and Cameron Boozer forcing a turnover Thats the 11th 11 turnover Thats unbelievable You said they average 11 on average9 on the season And theyve got it with a minute to go in the first half ISAIAH EVANS FALLING DOWN And thats a great finish by Evans Weve seen him do it all season long But the pass by Boozer once again And Duke has come back to life Up 14 music The general manager for Stanford football I was a huge Colts fan playing for the Pacers And that day he retired was a sad day for the entire city Shocking news Trying to get Stanford football back on track And they recently hired Tita Pritchard from the Washington Commanders to be the new head coach Former Stanford quarterback Cameron Grant five to shoot Grant doesnt see it and IO Cory launches and that is a shot clock violation Another brilliant defensive sequence from Duke I mean youve got to have awareness of that shot clock I mean I think he had a look at the rim if he had known how much time was on the clock and it has other than brief moments a couple of stretches this has been a half that has been dominated by the Blue Devils Stanford 29 shooting and 12 turnovers And Duke has matched their largest lead Theyre on a six nothing run and a strong close to half number one Cameron Boozer into the lane leans in and scores again Brian Agarwal from beyond midcourt and thatll take us to halftime The first 20 minutes its been all Duke They have suffocated St Oh they really have And its been led by Boozer doing just a little bit of everything on the floor again The the the poise Boozer with 20 and a struggle 12 in the first half Yeah I mean its really just not the team that we have seen over the last really two weeks of the season And again I think it shows what Duke is capable of the length the size that they have defensively when they are really locked in and the importance of a Cory to this team and when he is kind of taken out of the game by being double teamed every time hes on the floor Does the Stanford Cardinal have the firepower in other places to make teams pay for double teaming Annie Ger five to shoot down low to Oscar Heilte who gets inside First points for the freshman from Belgium I really like he just a freshman I think he really is coming into his own throughout the course of the season Hes a big strong long player Very good rebounder and defender I think you will see his numbers continue to improve over his career The kick out Caleb Foster from deep missing a three up over everybody Cameron Boozer the offensive rebound and then a foul and hell take with a strong hit on Patrick Gunga whos still down on the floor and I think Andrew Luck down to our left might take notice of that hit by he first whistled against the Stanford big man and Gunga still down Just kind of inadvertent contact really nothing there by he guys scrambling for the ball and Gumba getting the worst of it Oh he got him Got him in the elbow Looked to the head It didnt look again intentional Just two players Hell take kind of raised that arm at the last second or turned his shoulder more to protect himself from Gumba coming at him Theyre going to take a look to see if it warrants more than just a common foul on Oscar Heilte So its a coachs appeal Hell no So this is a coachs appeal for an upgrade to the call and which means if they are incorrect itll cost Duke a timeout Yeah And foul on Stanford will appeal for possible upgrade There you go The explanation from Bill Cington Jr Theyll review it 14point Duke lead early in the second half and this foul in Oscar heelte has been upgraded It is a flagrant one which means we upgrade the foul on right 15 to a flagrant one foul So we have two shots big ball on the end line So after the appeal from John Sh it has been determined the flagrant one and they did deem the contact to be excessive by heel Itll be two shots for Patrick Gumba and itll be a Duke basketball because of the flagrant one It was an appeal which is different than a challenge But it still had they been unsuccessful would have cost Duke a timeout But they were successful which means they still have a challenge in fact that they challenged and are correct They still have another one after that because it was an appeal and not a challenge Yeah And I think that the the officials got that right When I watched it in real time it looked as though he had just kind of turned his body to protect himself but he did kind of lead with that elbow and a lot of contact on Gumba Lob off the inbound the drop off and Gumba denied at the rim by Oscar Hilte who leads Stanford to block shots and on the floor Boozer diving forward comes AWAY WITH THE LOB TO GUMBA Unbelievable by Boozer Just the lob pass initially to Gumba Now he your star player gets on the floor for a loose ball and gets an assist or excuse me he kicks it out He got the hockey assist the secondary sitting on the floor Just a great play and showing that your best player is not above getting dirty and on the floor for a loose ball Third foul of Patrick Gunga off the ball But the largest lead for Duke early in the second half but again just the pass there not many people are going to do that And then your star player getting on the ground getting dirty the awareness to get rid of it And Duke great possession there The basketball IQ for Cameron Boozer is off the charts It really is I mean it is I I really think that that is the thing that sets him apart from most freshman You know I think obviously his name has been out there in the in the prep circuit for a long time I The guys probably been double team since hes 8 years old and he just makes the right decision every time hes on the floor Benny Keeler Shot clock down to five for the Cardinal Ibuko Okori in the lane Offbalance shot blocked by Dame Sar And here comes Duke And Sar pushing Caleb Foster will back it out Gathering And the foul on AJ Roi And Cameron Boozer will head to the strike And again its just its just matchups I mean Rahosi maybe has the size to to match up with a guy like Boozer but he doesnt have the foot speed you know So Boozer just recognizes that puts his shoulder down The weak side help is a little late getting across and Roi no choice but to foul Boozer Boozer one for two at the line and he hits the free throw And now Boozer with 21 with 11 rebounds in the top five draft prospects And right now Boozer third on that list Yeah I its a good year to have a top five pick If youre the Washington Wizards and youre in danger of losing that pick you want to make sure youre in the bottom four Yeah Well my Indiana Pacers without Hallebertton and its been a rough year It be a nice pickup to get one of those guys IO Cory that pass deflected out Duke has just about doubled up the Cardinal AJ Roi the shot clock winding down Flips it up Went and go to get it again and then has a shot blocked and its out of bounds Stamper ball I mean its just again youve got Gumba at 611 Boozer at 69 Sar 68 with the length that he has You know you want to tell a guy you get a ball under the basket you you kind of chin it and you go up strong But against those trees better course of action might be to just kick it out and get another look Ball comes in Oscar heel Stanford held to 19 points by Duke in the first half The second fewest they have scored in any half this season The other was against Notre Dame when they scored just 40 for the game They had a 17point half And a turnover by the Cardinal The step back by Isaiah Evans And the rebound tipped to Ibuko Cororey who pushes And theyre just too loading to the ball Every time A Cororeis got it theres someone on him Theres someone waiting for him and really just nowhere to go Drop step AJ Rahosi The reverse lay Quick move by Rahosi I like it on the perimeter Hes gotten a couple of offensive boards couple of duckins and easy baskets and Rahosi an interesting story where he began his college career as a walkon for Kyle Smith of Washington State as driving the lane The layup missed by Isaiah Evans and Stanford has numbers if they push it Ibuka Okorei finds Benny Geler had a good look at a three and the rebound Cameron Boozer and those are just the shots that have been falling for Stanford You know again Cororey picks up the ball the defender swings to him leaves Geler wide open Geler has made that shot the last couple of games And tonight the other guys for Stanford just cant get shots to fall back door down the lane Isaiah Evans just got caught watching the ball Hes got to come across on that weak side as Evans cuts He could have came across a little bit late in a game for Stanford in which really on both ends of the ball it has not been what we are used to seeing here The back door cut Raosi stays on the ball side and an easy dunk defensively Not much of a defensive presence by the Cardinal Just to finish the story on Rahosi he left Washington State went to division three Claremont Mud Scripps College as Rahosi on the offensive glass and back in by AJ Roi Last year was a second team division three allAmerican and a first team academic allAmerican and then transferring to play for Kyle Smith again the grad transfer to Stanford Well I think thats something that you never heard of 10 20 years ago A D2 D3 guy moving up to D1 back door delay in Kaden Boozer for Duke And youre seeing that more you know where everyone is starting wherever they can get an opportunity to play and everyone is now recruiting the lower levels And I think youre going to continue to see more of it Ryan Agarwal fires three First points for Agarwal coming off that careerhigh 20 against North Carolina where he made six threes against the Tarheelss Kaden Boozer drives off balance Blocked by Ibuku Cororey and then tripped as Ryan Agarwal Second foul on Kaden Boozer 15 minutes left Duke of 16 trying to stay perfect on the road Strong physical you know a little bit different body type for for Camboozer A little longer Ibuko Cory finds an open Cameron Grant Missed a three and a foul going for the rebound on Duke and its on Nicholas Javvena You talk about Boozer you know I feel like weve been hearing about this guy for three years You know everything on the prep level the hype about where he would end up going to school and its you know its not often that players with that type of hype need it And I think in a lot of ways hes exceeded it 58 from the field on the season Thats remarkable with the defensive presence he faces every night Okorei gets free too strong on the three and there is another rebound Cameron Boozer grabs his 13th Yeah we watched Boozer in practice yesterday It was just impressive to see your best player leading all the drills right Having that type of energy that carries over Its clearly a great practice leading up to this game And I think what you see from Boozer in the games he doesnt just turn it on He does it in practice as well Out of the double team and its out of bounds Last touch by Stanford 48 on the timer for Duke Yeah it makes it easier for John Sh and the staff when your best player is among your hardest workers Yeah it is hard to win at any level when your best player doesnt bring it in practice Doesnt set that tone You dont have that level of accountability And that is a big reason why this team is as good as they are Lob off the inbound at the rim Malik Brown with the bucket A just too easy The weak side for Stanford has got to be in the paint on that Thats a hard pass to make to the opposite side baseline Have the defender down low Not allowing that lob Buco Cory and a reachin foul Thats the third on Caleb Foster No theyre not calling it on Foster Its on Malik Brown his second And again Dame Sar is on the sideline right now But that length at 68 has been so hard for Okori to get around him Now he has the smaller defender in Caleb Foster So hes making a little bit of a point of emphasis to get around him more and get into the paint with the smaller defender on him And the foul on the perimeter the second on Nicholas Jamena We talked to John Shy about Jamena You know that he he really likes his game Things have been a little bit up and down for him in terms of making his shots but really thinks he could be a player for him down the stretch that plays a bigger role as he continues to get more comfortable in his freshman year McDonalds allAmerican freshman from Harvard Westlake down in Southern California as Ryan Agaral off balance AJ Rosi fouled on the offensive glass Raosi a little bit of a bright spot here for Kyle Smiths team in the second half Really bringing the energy not quitting even though his team is down 18 Third on Malik Brown Number 21 Team fell number six on Duke already in the second half Cameron Grant off the inbound short on the three and the rebound grabbed by Duke Blue Devils who are 50 this season on the road In fact theyve won eight consecutive true road games dating back to last season Deflected out by Ibuka Okori pass the ball Theyre not like that Duke coming into today tied with Clemson at top the ACC 50 And Duke taking on a Stanford team thats three and two A surprising start for the Cardinal considering the split they had against Virginia and Virginia Tech last weekend and beating North Carolina In fact a rough week for the Tarheelss here in the Bay getting swept by Stanford and Cal The layin Patrick Gunga What a pass by Boozer Gungba made himself available knowing that Boozer would find him on time and on target But for the Cardinal in those three wins Okori has scored hes averaging 30 points a game And the two losses hes averaging 11 and a half Thats just a big storyline of and and not necessarily though Cororey has had bad games then or in this game Its just been defensively teams completely taking him out of the game and nowhere else really to go offensively and that has been the storyline for this game as well Unfortunately for Kyle Smith especially with the injury to Chisum Par and Stanford hoping to get it back but their options are limited A par is a guy whos not afraid to take a big shot or make a play offensively a veteran a senior transfer from Harvard Yeah And without him and hes a guy thats willing to create not just for himself but for others Yeah Kyle Smith he he pointed out he was really the only other guy on the roster that can create his own shot beat a defender off off of the dribble get into the paint on the roster Uh and unfortunately in a league where everyone scouts everything you know people are going to watch this game against Stanford How did Duke have so much success and will look to repeat it as Gumba the strong move down low got to the key Yeah And Gungbo will head to the line There is Chisamak Par2 who missed the game against Carolina and was injured against Virginia last weekend But again its its its that its the general storyline of how much can you expect from Oki and you cant have him play hero ball every game right It is it is the other games and Kyle Smith knows this Um but its other guys stepping up finding other ways to find scoring Cory Again Im not going to Im not going to say he is struggling or having a bad game even though you look at the stats and they might indicate otherwise Its just a team completely selling out to stop you and knowing doing anything to make the team pay for doing that Gung by the second Blue Devil in double figures now at 10 and the largest lead for Duke and they have dominated this game from the opening tip First appearance for Jaylen Thompson off the bench for Kyle Smith and Stanford 5 Aiden Camman tries to turn the corner off balance The flip in the first points for Aiden Cam I liked it He looked like he was going to the a dribble handoff to the corner Just made a quick move to the inside Gumba not ready for it And a strong finish by Cam Cameron Boozer leans in Got his own miss Had a shot blocked Knocked away by Thompson Stanford comes away with it Four on three for the Cardinal JEREMY DEN SMITH BUMPED PLUS ONE Thats exactly what the Cardinal need A great defensive play on one end leads to a fast break going the other way And the Cardinal showing some life Deep hole down 18 It has been a long night for the star player and Okori or excuse me Dom Sar only three points in this game but I think you can argue hes right up there for MVP of the night with Camboozer with the way that he has forced Okori into difficult shots One thing I will say with Okore he was cramping up at the end of the Carolina game Wednesday night Not sure if its affecting him I did see him with the the gun on his calf I I wouldnt be surprised I mean youre asking really everything of him and he has delivered on so many games in the in the last seven as Boozer again I mean its just its just too easy Its just too much of a size difference there 23 points 14 rebounds and four steals for Cameron Boozer Another double double And for Boozer that is his ninth double double his 1120 point game Its also his sixth double double when he scored at least 20 points And it looks kind of casual right Like it doesnt look like you know this is this amazing game for him as Dent Smith Smith Smith knocks down the threepointer He just makes it look easy 11 for Jeremy Dent Smith I mean Boozers 10 of 15 six you know I mean its just incredible the efficiency that he plays with ISAIAH EVANS answers with a three Just the second made three for Duke in the game Aiden Cman slips by Boozer down the lane Camman cant bank it in Jaylen Thompson trying to keep it alive for Stanford Last touch by the Cardinal I find that at any every level of basketball high school college NBA 20 points is this kind of magic number where guys start taking shots that maybe they shouldnt They gamble for a ball defensively where maybe they shouldnt The referees maybe call the game a little bit differently Duke is there now right So can they really put their foot on the neck of Stanford and put this game away to a level that maybe maybe it is already but thats been the question mark with them slipping to the bucket The step through and a foul will send Patrick Gungba to the line And two more free throws And when I say that I think Im Im looking for quality shots right Not just looking at it like Hey were up 20 points Im open Maybe this is an okay shot as opposed to working the offense and getting a good shot Defensively locking in keeping the guy in front of you as opposed to maybe reaching for a steal that would get you a dunk easily in transition Rattles out for Gungbo the sophomore whos now four for five at the line Foul was on Jaylen Thompson Duke just nine for 14 from the line in this one Stanfords only shot four free throws for the game Lets go baby Turn me up Back to a 20point lead Jeremy Dent Smith on the move It Its almost like the offense is a little easier with our Cororey out of the game because theres no double teaming You know youre just kind of playing straight up basketball and maybe you dont have the same talent with Okori on the floor but youre not facing all of the double teaming Isaiah Evans Loose ball picked up Who else Cameron Boozer now 25 Aiden Cam gets inside then missed the layup and the rebound tipped pre and ground by Nicholas Jmena for Duke Boy right at the rim I mean nothing has come easy for Stanford And now you get a layup a really good look at it and you just shoot it over the rim Nothing going right Step back from Boozer Three Theyre going to say a two for now I think that was the right call I think the toe was on the line But again its its he doesnt force anything When the shots there he takes it When its not he makes the pass Jeremy Den Smith launching a three 16 for Den Smith the only Cardinal in double digits Stanford now going to his own trying anything to slow down Cameron Boozer Caleb Foster down the lane and the offensive rebound and Patrick Gungba is fouled It is all Duke on the farm 19point lead and Cameron Boozer Was it a two or three Im going three Duke will have another one WF20 Miami Indiana Monday night as Patrick Gungba at the line One more coming and during the timeout they reviewed that shot by Boozer It was indeed changed to a three as Gungba hits both now is number six Duke has matched their largest lead Its crazy Stanfords made five their last seven shots from the floor Yet they cant gain any traction Its just been one of those nights Duke has an answer for everything Another forced turnover for Dent Smith with the careless pass And and this was I think what everyone is kind of waiting to see with Duke right I mean listen they only have one loss on the season Theres they are flying high but could they play at this level defensively for 40 minutes And they have done that And I I think that would be a story line on how good this team can be And the layin by Malik Brown You John Shs been searching for a complete 40minute game Yeah especially on the defensive end and this is as good as theyve played at that end of the floor Aiden Cam slides in missed the layup but hes fouled And you brought up the Louisville game for example Austin where they played 20 minutes of fantastic defense Yeah and that was a game where Duke really didnt bring it in the first half of the game and they outscored Louisville again on the road 40 to 20 Now 40 points is a lot but thats kind of on par with what were accustomed to from the D Blue Devils I think its the 20 points defensively And I asked John Sh in practice yesterday if he thought that was the best that they had played defensively and he did And do you ever remind your team hey what we did against Louisville that is what we are trying to do And I think that thats the type of effort that you have seen here uh in in this game for 34 minutes One for two eight came Number 20 Cameron Prince And Stanford just 6 for 20 from three in the game Coming off the threepoint barrage they threw at the Tarheelss where they made 16 for 28 and theyre 9590 win against North Carolina here Wednesday night Yeah I mean its remarkable that the team that we are watching in front of us had 95 their last game The steel and lay Ibuka Oki McCori is not going to quit Great job getting into the passing lanes Duke a little careless just passing the ball on the perimeter Boozer leans in draws the foul on Oscar Heilte Again its its the size and the quickness You know he knows hes got a quicker first step than he gets the ball in the middle of that zone Quick first step draws another foul Two for four at the line for Cameron Boozer The gymnastics seasons underway and our first ACC Network meet Sunday afternoon as number 13 Stanford and number 11 North Carolina from Carmichael Arena Chapel Hill Coverage begins for Eastern 1 Pacific and its also available on the ESPN app No more for Boozer here and he missed Thats the only thing that hasnt worked for him in this one Foul shooting That would have given him 30 if he made both of those Something tells me hes going to get it Way to put yourself out there Okori and that three challenged Great defense by Sar Dame Sar again that that 68 length Oki at 62 hes going to have quickness over a lot of guys but the length of Sar he can space a Cororey a little bit and still contest the shot second on Ryan Agarwal Sar just fights across that pick and again that length of Cory created the space that he wants to and on most nights thats enough space to get off a good shot but Sar knows that he has the ability to contest the shot and take up that ground Elite defender David Sar Evans hits both Duke will head home They got Wake Forest coming up next Saturday and also just one game for Stanford This will come in the rivalry game Theyll take on Cal right here next Saturday evening The ball kicked by Damesar But the first visit for Duke to Maples Pavilion the fifth alltime meeting They played last year at Cameron Indoor and Duke trounced Stanford Jeremy Den Smith missing from the corner and the rebound Caden Boozer for Duke Last year in that game Duke shot 63 made 14 threes 10670 as Tyrese Proctor led five Blue Devils in double digits with 23 Cooper flag by the way at 19 Not as highscoring but just as dominant Duke here on the other side of the country today I mean they just have done everything that they needed to You know 35 points in the first half is is definitely under their average but they shot 51 from the field They But they held Stanford to 19 Yeah I mean they just theyre doing what they had to do This is a very mature game that we are seeing from Duke They are playing it you know within the game plan You havent seen a lot of you know guys going oneonone because theyve got the big lead defensively The game plan has been followed perfectly If youre John Shy I I dont know if you have any criticisms defensively if you watch the film Stanford 36 Six of 22 from three as that one crawls in And Boozer leads with 30 30 points 14 rebounds for Cameron Boozer Seven at the offensive end I mean that was another story line thats gone a little bit under the radar as Duke just dominating the boards Another Stanford turnover Thats 17 Duke went on that run over in Berkeley late in the first half on Wednesday 13 nothing run They trailed for a good chunk of that first half as the step back rattles in for Isaiah Evans And then in the second half they just stepped up the defense They held Cal to just 26 points the lowest in a half for Cal this year And also they held the Golden Bears to just 56 points for the game which is the lowest theyve scored And that defensive effort continuing here on the farm this afternoon Well I mean with with four minutes left to go in the game Stanford still doesnt have half as many points as they did in their last game against Carolina where they scored 95 So and they average 78 a game but at least they have more than they scored against Notre Dame when they had just 40 in the game of the season Number eight Darren Harris And certainly you pay attention to the offense but as a team the defense for Duke is the story as they have just suffocated Stanford 17 Cardinal turnovers tied for the second most in the game this season and just 35 shooting for the Cardinal Yeah I again you know John Shy and his staff they they had a game plan and up to the players to execute it and it was flawless First appearance for Darren Harris of the afternoon or early evening on the farm Prime time on the east coast Kaden Boozer desperation shot Why not Duke by 30 Kaden you are really ugly Benny Geler tries to get inside The drop off AJ Roi fouled at the rim and two free throws for Rahosi Well I guess if Cameron Boozers not getting you Kate is You can just see that there is no quit from Duke Cory brought the ball across the court immediately two defenders come and get the ball out of his hands forcing other people to beat you Raosi really been effective here in the second half Been one of the more consistent contributors Malik Brown has fouled out and first appearance for Cameron Sheffield the senior from Alpharetta Georgia the transfer from Rice And also the first appearance for Jack Scott the Princeton transfer for Duke Ibuko Cory leaves His ball game might be done with nine points the second fewest in a game As the free throw spins out for AJ Rahos and as good as he has played in the second half the foul line continues to be a struggle for him 0 for two in this one and 32 on the year And unfortunately the the story line for Oki three conference wins hes averaging 30 points a game three conference losses hes averaging 10 And that thats going to be something that theyre going to have to deal with all year and kind of back to the drawing board finding different ways to get him the ball The step through and a block is called a foul is on Jeremy Dent Smith and Darren Harris will go to the line Kyle Smith look the margin for error for even especially in a game like this against Duke but the margin for error is super thin It is It is razor thin today And if Okore is not scoring Austin Stanford has real problems Yeah And you know maybe were being a little hard on on on Stanford right I mean this Duke team is a national championship contender They have one loss on the entire season You know they have McDonalds AllAmericans all over the place They have length and size that most teams across the country do not have Um as you go through conference play right theyve already played um right They played Carolina theyve played Duke theyve played uh Virginia Most teams dont have this size and length and youre not going to have the same level of problems um against most teams that you do against Duke That is what makes them special 10 straight points for Duke Here is Den Smith down the lane and Jeremy Den Smith with a strong move Hes coming off of his careerhigh against Carolina 20 points knocking down shots everywhere on the on the court in that game The transfer from Cal State Dominguez Hills a division 2 allAmerican a twotime D2 AllAmerican Den Smith as across the key Now Den Smith fouls Nicholas Jmenya Number 25 Jeremy Denith his third personal again I feel like we we talked about it a lot but you see the graphic with the defense and what they have allowed in this twoame trip 56 versus Cal 46 here 37 in both of the games I mean that is just elite defense from a team that I really think that has been the question mark You know can they do that night in and night out cheering And they certainly came on this trip with a point of emphasis on the defensive end And John Sh has got to get on that plane headed home happy with the way his team played on that end of the ball And it was clear yesterday at practice for Duke That was the point of emphasis was defense and making it uncomfortable for Ibuka Okori I think he just knows his team right And he knows what theyre capable of and hes just not seeing it on that end And and they still find ways to to to win because of the offense that they have the star power of a guy like Boozer uh the rebounding that they have on any given night But every team every coach regardless of the talent right youre trying to hit that max potential How good can we be How far can we go And he wants to see it consistently And he did on this trip Step back by Benny Geler The long two And Geler with his first points of the ball game 90 seconds to go Jmena fouled Count it and one for Nicholas Jmena Everything going Dukes way today And and I like that from Jamea right I mean youve got to make the most of your minutes Mas minutes you know in in big parts of games has really been up and down Hes struggled with shot selection at times shot making at other times Kind of the natural es and flows of being a freshman playing at this level And just a great drive showing the athleticism that he has We talked to John Sh He really likes Hamemena and his play and wouldnt be surprised if his role increases as you go further in the season Dent Smith lost the rebound last touch by Duke and its a Stanford ball on the baseline Coming up next for these teams we alluded to its Dukes got Wake Forest coming up next Saturday And then you got to reimagine Louisville and that showdown over in Chapel Hill coming up February 7th with Carolina And Carolina is heading home licking their wounds after getting swept by Stanford and Calal 10th team foul Two shots for Benny Geler 93 from the line Nearly automatic for the senior the former walkon Geler And one more for Benny Keeler Thursday night ACC Network womens basketball double header Hannah Hidalgo a number 23 Notre Dame hosting Miami at 6 Then the Tarheelss battle against Georgia Tech Another great night of hoops coming up Thursday Womens double header Notre Dame Miami 6 Eastern followed by Carolina and Georgia Tech And an offensive foul Illegal screener Fourth on Kaden Boozer And coming up for

Clemson and then Georgia Tech Jeremy Den Smith on the move missing the three AJ Rahosi elevates for the rebound Raosi falling down Missed the put back and the rebound grabbed by Duke The Florida twostep for conference games will never sound right No And its not like Miami and Florida State are all that close either Complete opposite ends of the state Of course Florida State up in the panhandle and Miami down in South Florida Roxy youre youre teaching me some geography Youre throwing it all in here Roxy I love it Could you get at Stanford laughter You just automatically get smarter Osmosis Well you turned it down so you could have found out the real way Yes Shockingly that Austin Croer was had the chance to go to Stanford but it worked out for me at Providence College my if you gone to Stanford imagine what you could have done with your life I would have had that knowledge 12 years in the NBA Come on Tremendous performance especially defensively as Duke with his sixth straight win Remains perfect in the ACC 171 and Cameron Boozer dominant 30 points 14 rebounds his third 30point game I mean you cant say enough about Duke and what they did both ends of the ball Well Boozer is a stud We knew it coming in Proved it here And defensively cant say enough of the game plan that Shire had Holding Abuk Koi to nine Stanford 35 Duke rolls in Maples as we roll into the studio and Sam Ravage
