the lineup by ebiasamoa Christian Ray and LJ Owens Delaware comes in with one win and one defeat for the home standing Duplo doubles to bounce back after that loss against Kansas and Indianapolis on Tuesday night Derek Lively the seven foot one freshman from Philadelphia will start tonight ahead of Ryan young with Mitchell philipowski roach and Proctor opening tip to the visitors excuse me foreign Applause Indoor Stadium and Delaware taking its sweet time look at that shot clock here is the drive and off the high glass of Miss for LJ Owens he scraps for that rebound with two blue doubles on him comes away with it up off his knees and weve got a hell ball so the arrow will give it to Duke lets take a look at our Ford keys to the game well and you saw it in that first possession uh Delaware is going to look to control Tempo Bob they want to try to you know milk the clock in each possession for Duke just maximize that size theyre theyre really big up front one of the best rebounding teams in the country to this point in the season Blue Devils this pass goes behind live later its a turnover and its been an issue uh early on I mean this is you know guys are all trying to get on the same page Livelys trying to get in shape coming off that calf injury good hands by Lively and another jump ball the arrow will give it to Delaware you know thats the thing that shoot around today John Shire challenged his team to to dominate this game but not just on the offensive end of the floor he wants him to dominate down at this end of the floor as well Mike it reminds me a lot of a baseball player taking batting practice you know you could get in that cage and you could face BP and hit off a machine but until you face live pitching it really doesnt all come together and theres a three ball by Davis to get the night started for Delaware youve got to get the game action absolutely and uh you know practice and you know Whitehead is going to see the court probably tonight for the first time so all new for him and I would think its going to be until December that this team really gels if everybody stays healthy Delaware collapsed to the rim and knocked the ball away but fouled in the process and that foul is going to be judged to asamoa heres the looking theyve got guys in the front line that you can just throw the ball up to the rim and theyll go get it Lively again you know with the injuries the thing you have to do the last hurdle is to trust in it especially you know when you talk about a calf youre talking about lift getting up to the rim missed the opener he debuted against South Carolina upstate seven foot one freshman his first opportunity at the foul line for the season this is the first and hits the second three to one Delaware thats the thing you know try to make Delaware uncomfortable in this environment early on poking pressure Music Davis a hand on this is Jameer Nelson JR out of the double team Davis tough shot Applause and no whistle everybody thought there was a stoppage but none instead of it and he was just so good changing the ends made a nice defensive play didnt get the block but uh forced up a tough shot and then in transition not a lot of people are going to beat him in a foot race ties the game at three LJ Owens grad student out of Annapolis Maryland Delaware opened with a win against a D2 Team in Wilmington theres a deflection off of the shot clock Music wiggling into the lane and the lane bike Christian Ray is good you look at Ray and you know his points are a bonus hes averaging 12 rebounds a game so far early for Delaware but nice find he had an easy layup Applause if they can maximize possessions like that thats exactly what the doctor ordered nice movement foreign big strong kid The Freshman out of New York yeah I like his game very fundamentally sound hasnt shot the ball well so far in the year but thats going to come around Davis missing tipped out by Christian Ray it belongs to the Blue Devils Music Applause third game and Cameron for the Blue Devils this season wins here over Jacksonville and South Carolina upstate Applause roach backs it out Mitchell Lively goes Cross Court philipowski but double team came from his man and that was a good find out of the double team inside a lot of times thats the last skill that a young big guy will learn but terrific Cross Court pass philipowski three for 12 on threepointers prior to the game thank you Nelson had flicked away recovered by LJ Owens he puts up the three back irons Proctor has it freshman from Sydney Australia into the paint protects shoots hes another Blue Devil Mike thats had a little rough start in terms of shooting the basketball four for 21 yeah trying to come over to the states and and figure you know figure the game out here but that was a you know nice find and one of the things too and is this dude team is such a good offensive rebounding team you can force the action a little bit you do got a seven nothing run to lead by five lets talk Mike a little bit about Kyle phillipowsk its time for tonights starting to watch brought to you by Hardees well you know we talked about it he hasnt been shooting the ball that well but rebounding hes seventh in the country did 12 rebounds a game first Duke freshman ever to start his career with three double doubles so you know really solidus minutes really expanded against Kansas 33 minutes in that game hes going to be a nice addition to this team inside and outside Delaware and there is philipowski are hard hes starting to watch with his numbers so far Delaware has this one rejected by Kyle down the floor Proctor and he just put his head down there was a oneontwo break that time and uh Proctor has really been attacking the basket the first five minutes of this game my hands trying to I was going to say try to sit on it but that doesnt sound right or a blue hand something may hatch there you go and long three is goodbye Jamir Nelson Applause his dad of course was the great Jameer Nelson Senior unbelievable college player at St Joes former National player of the year Applause long time NBA players phillipowski now to the wing Applause Proctor inside boy there was contact and theres the whistle on Jamir Nelson were getting ready to check in here comes Derek Whitehead and they are excited to see this young man the 67 freshman foreign player in that in that freshman class and they got both of them yeah and Whitehead he is ready to go he has had right foot surgery on August the 30th the balls knocked out of bounds yeah but he this is the young man who led Mount Vern to back to back High School National Championships and he he played there for five years he went there as an eighth grader and the list of players who he had his teammates is you know hes played with Big Time Players in Big Time games like a whos who a basketball yeah over the last five six years the guys hes played with down in Florida knocked away this is Juan Marco arletti and before for Delaware theyre really locked in on Nelson theyre going to try to make other people beat them in this game asamoa his first two averaging 105 per game 1210 hes a guy he can not only knock down threes but get to the freethrow line as well Bob Mitchell easy look from 15 Kansas City Kansas freshman makes it a fourpoint spread Applause Davis the Whitehead looking good on defense Corrals the rebound hes um practice for about two weeks probably full on full contact for about a week up to this point good footwork the grad student from uh Northwestern really sound fundamentally not a you know wont overpower you with his athleticism but just really sound 1610 Applause 45 is Nigel Shad into the Delaware lineup again the shock clock down to three this one bumped off the rim by arletti twisting and turning to try to score his roach and hes found I know you appreciate the footwork from a big man yeah this is you know Proctor now showing that he can dish as well carried it in a great job I was just you know making himself available in the passing lane and then an easy finish for him foreign by Jeremy Roach Jalen Blakes now is in for Duke he wears number two the sophomore from Somerset New Jersey and you know right now I think Duke is theyre very comfortable playing nine guys and you know when you can come off the bench with the number one high school recruit in the country thats uh its a pretty deep Squad yes its called an embarrassment of riches is what its called exactly its Jacob grandison its a boat Applause 1810 Duke we talked about the defense on Nelson good pressure here on Owens and a takeaway but Nelson just picked up his second foul to compound the problems for Delaware CEO long head coach Martin uh inglesby goes with him with two fouls out on the floor Applause Radisson that goes off a foot out of bounds and we have a timeout 11 49 time remaining first hatch more prepared for this job than I ever was when I got him well and think about you know Mike coming from West Point I mean it was a culture shock coming down to this conference um you know John having lived it um just played in it coached in it was familiar with the whole territory so you know it makes sense that it was easier pressure out front draws a foul on Jalen Blakes foreign Applause Music with that depth I mean this Duke team can be hyper aggressive defensively they just have bodies that they can and not just bodies but you know really talented players that can come in nice Baseline cut Ray kicks it out a baseline jump shot is a beauty nicely done by Kevin Riley The Freshman out of Arlington Virginia yeah really sound this nice pump fake got himself an open book on the Baseline 1812 Duke first half from Cameron Music a long bomb from the wig follow Anderson time to perfectly yeah Bob this team averaging 19 offensive rebounds a game now that means youre shooting percentage isnt great but still youre cleaning up a lot of misses and uh just in the right place at the right time for grandison Johnny McCoy the personal when the one guy you know Delaware couldnt afford to get him foul trouble you know come here Nelson to pick up two 2112 Applause just dipped under the 11 minute Mark biggest lead tonight for the Blue Devils Applause Christian Ray hits the brakes then the defense evaporated you know the guy with the ball is pretty important and a nice ball fake he got both guys to move off of him 2114 Music Proctor step back three Applause Music Proctor scoring at all three levels so far in this game midrange jump shot got in for some layups and now knocking down to three one hands a rebound precocious might be the way best to describe him hell drive and get fouled this foul on jair Davis its his first of the game and you know with with Jamir Nelson out somebody they needed him to step up and hes now struggling one of six so far in the game for Davis Proctor coming off nine points three boards and three assists Against The Jayhawks on Tuesday a ton of international experience that he brings to the Blue Devils how about you know five rebounds and two assists to go with the scoring to this point as well outstanding first half 2612 and thats going to take a lot of pressure off of roach you know if he continues to make plays like hes doing 2614 loose ball and out of bounds this will belong to Delaware with 12 on the shot clock now Jamir Nelson will reenter the game with his two personals at 9 47 well one of two things well see if Delaware maybe plays a little Zone to try to hide him defensively or you know wherever hes guarding I think Duke attacks him to try to pick up that third foul Davis two free throws coming Derek Lively committing his first foul and thats you know thats a good idea for lively to to try to attack him defensively you know coming off an injury your lateral movement may not be where its going to be in a you know in a week two weeks or so Applause and now a quick message from Works Nitro Applause meatworks Nitro powerful tools for any project with gaslike power without the gas fueled by Power share batteries to give you the power to outperform Applause 2616 well Delaware is in a one two two zone right now Music flakes dialed in on that three confident stroke another holdover from last year didnt get a lot of playing time but oh opportunity hearings boy what a terrific split right there Nelson has five phillipowski good ball for the Devils Jeremy Roach coming back in as well as Ebbie asimova for Delaware already the Blue Devils with eight different scorers in this game to underscore your point Mike about the quality depth on this team and the only one who hasnt scored his Whitehead whos seeing his first action here tonight of the year Proctor Applause for lively wow well he is just such a live body quick off the floor got inside position on the offensive glass and a push here against Jeremy roach and that will be his first look at Lively he is Lively this is very bouncy so long too and if youre gonna block them off Bob youve got to do it three or four feet from the basket or hell just play right over the top of you as the coaches say do your work early yes sir 3118 Olson Delaware with an offensive rebound pump fake Livelys not buying it the great defense results in a block shot kept his feet on those pump fakes and forced a tough tough shot phillipowski Chicago is not afraid to pull the trigger on those shots not bashful and a nice drive here by Nelson draws the contact Music the foul on lively is his second next week the Blue Devils will have Bellarmine here Scott Davenport brings in the Louisville Slayers the third the third straight conference reigning Champion that theyll play in a row and then its the Phil Knight Legacy out in Portland or Duke will play Oregon State first on November the 24th then either Florida or Xavier thats a an 18 tournament great field again out at the motor Center and the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Portland 3118 you played in the vet back in the day whats that Veteran Memorial Coliseum in Portland way back in the day so you set some records in that place right yeah they were really 33s or 45s team turn around for Roach Applause offensive foul and thats the third on Nelson we have a timeout 7 36 the time remaining in our first half its Stella with you with Cameron Indoor Stadium and ACC fans get to know this young man Tyrese Proctor hes been impressive yeah hes first two games five points total started to feel better in the Kansas game and really is blossomed here early in the first 20 minutes doing it all layups inside getting out on the open floor he can finish in the paint area hes locked down to three hes got some five rebounds and a couple assists as well really nice numbers for him early would you classify him as a combo guard you know what its almost like its a throwback to like the 70s where there were guards yes you know like he and roach I think are just like their cards you know they can make plays they can score they can they can do a lot of things like you know rather than put a a one or a two or a combo or whatever hes just a guard Proctor has five rebounds so far tonight Delawares team total is five 3119 now for Dukes theres only seven misses in the game and theyve gotten some offensive rebounds too so whoa thats gonna be an offensive foul as Mitchell had his elbow right in the throat of the defender Music yeah just the rat you know and he had positions really didnt have to do that and its just a you know its just a little over anxious freshman move trying to you know get in the action Christian Ray at Davis needs some help look at the seven footer move his feet and a three ball for Kevin Ryland Music youve been impressive Off the Bench 3122 nice feet underneath and the lane is good by right now as opposed to his teammates hes going to play below the rim but hes got some great pump fakes inside he has a knack for finding space foreign Music Christian Ray gets rid of it Music Davis but stepping out of bounds Applause Ursula watched the pump fake right here good delivery no real shot blocker out there for Delaware but still made a nice use of the rim Applause coming over of course from Northwestern for Chris Collins a ton of Duke history of his honor I was going to say a Duke Duke to Duke Coach transfer Applause Delaware ball was 609 to go in the first half Young the shoe I mean you know the way Duke has played just the eye test you would have thought this lead would be a lot bigger right now Delaware Music speaking of the eye tests yeah theyre trying to put your contact back in on the move like this very impressive and you know theyre giving players a lot more latitude you see the Duke transfers which they havent done a lot in the portal up to this year but four of them coming over but it certainly speaks to the fact that youve got even though they werent in this program experienced college basketball players to go with all these freshmen and I I would think maybe you know John Shire going forward thats how this team may be built you know to Youre Gonna youre gonna attract the best out of high school in the prep schools and sprinkle in some of those older guys from the uh and the guys they they brought in coupled from the Big Ten you know power five conferences been through the wars yep now getting a taste or they will of ACC action 3322 Music Applause Christian Ray makes his move gets rid of it nice pass sets up Davis for the three those were the shots you have to knock down I know its pressure but he was wide open it was a terrific fine Applause back to the basket Ryan Young nice cut on them well if youre Whitehead thats exactly what you need a nice easy bucket to you know thats your first score in the game and the great find from the pivot off the front of the rim loose ball to Roach now Whitehead will drive it from the wing and weve were going the other way this foul is going to be on Ryan young I believe for a push heres the first Duke field goal for Mr Whitehead Music yeah you see young and his you know Whiteheads guy just completely lost where he was and you know guy turns his head back cut very fundamental basketball six foot seven out of Newark he helped the Freshman he looks old like you think of the Freshman for Duke last year they all look like men he looks like a grown man yes LJ Owens his first free throw of the season is a success 3523 Applause played at William and Mary so back in the colonial after a tour of Duty at UMBC had 11 points in their opener against Wilmington fouled out against Air Force 3524 and a blocking foul will send Blakes to the line Music 504 first half and Jalen Blakes steps up and they um like the ball handling for Duke here in this game early on eight assists only two turnovers so far in the game should a very high percentage of 59 percent very efficient game got it Blakes its the second for his fourth point 3624 Applause Owens against Roach loose ball Dukes got it stolen back by Delaware still loose on the deck and weve got a foul coming on the Blue Devils Whitehead theres the play everybody wanted to pick the ball up and Advance it and theyre going to unbox you know I think he was just going for the ball they called him pulled a trip on that I dont know about that one Bob Applause but you know I love the hustle the you know the willingness to get on the floor and get after the basketball front end secured by Riley quite the shooter as we saw on that three ball a little bit earlier in the half from Bishop OConnell High School in Arlington Virginia with 41 percent of his threes in high school obviously this is a little different animal up here but it certainly suggests that this guy is a shooter 3626 Applause nice Cut and the jam by Granderson well I really like the offense running through Ryan young he makes good decisions and guys are just cutting at will and a nice slithering move by Davis now they desperately need him to get going offensively hes got seven theyre big star Jamir Nelson Jr saddled with foul difficulty here in this first half hes got three and has scored but five hiking up the three arletty Kevin Ryland theres that touch were talking about and fundamentals the pump fake the little side dribble Delawares cut this thing to seven a timeout at 356 of the opening half Duke 38 and Delaware 31 more coverage from Cameron Indoor Stadium right after this Music but he gets everybody involved and Duke I think Mike tonight has shared the basketball extremely well and still you know theyre looking at nine assists two turnovers very good decisions and especially out of the post too guys cutting to the basket take it with the defense gives them Music but Delaware has come back and they have gone on a 60 run of their own to cut this back to seven and you mentioned it earlier theyve found a way to hang in this game without Nelson no and you know Riley is the one who has stepped up for him in uh 10 points in eight minutes hes perfect from the floor hes knocked down a couple of threes banging his Mitchell and the rebound belongs to Christian Ray of Delaware foreign Applause s finding a way to get some rebounds well and more importantly defensive rebounds keeping Duke off the uh off the glass for a second chance opportunities Applause heres Riley Riley still a nice fine crosscourt and a pickoff step through Lane is good by arletti his first basket and Delaware is within five thats again a good confidence builder for our lady whos not shot the ball well this year so far maybe that gets him going theyre theyre finding offense from other people out on the floor with Nelson out of the game Irish Proctor to the basket thats blocked block the block that time a spin around by Owens no Applause Music Applause philipowski around the ribbon in seven for Kyle you know what if hes hes a tough cover because if you put a shorter person on him to take away the outside he can hit that midrange or post shot Davis and again Delaware look at the clock just a bit arletti from the corner Mitchell Boyd in this stretch I dont think that the coaching staff for Delaware can be upset with the looks that their team is getting theyre getting good shots Applause catch and shoot for Proctor shooting percentage for Dukes starting to come down after a very very quick start Delaware with the ball down seven 68 seconds left in the hand Applause marletti roxan gets it back out now to Owens Applause and a little too physical that time by grandison Music one its just not a good foul because only six seconds on the shot clock right there you had they were that possession really going nowhere for Delaware and he just really bailed them out and in the bonus is Delaware stay tuned for the Toyota halftime report brought to you by your local Toyota dealer well have our driven segment featuring head coach John Shire of Duke front end missed missed and Dukes going to take a timeout 568 seconds remaining here in this first half so a chance for Delaware to maybe cut it to five but the front end of the one and one missed Applause yeah those are tough I mean theyre theyre margin for error very slim but you know a really a nice job because the last four minutes of a half is where Duke can get a you know a spurt they can score a bunch of points and stretch the game out but uh Delaware has really managed this last few minutes very well and the blue heads bring a championship pedigree to Durham tonight these are the reigning Colonial Athletic Association Champs and uh mild surprise they got hot when it counted the most and they went on to the NCAA tournament they lost the Villanova in the first round but what a moment with Ford blue head basketball and head coach Martin inglesby and they are looking for their very first win against the top 10 opponent and uh theyve not beaten their ranked opponent either and when I found out today that Martins dead Tom used to play for the Hawks that got me excited I could imagine is he on one of your boards at one point in time as a matter of fact oh a tip is good up as grandison all right theyve got some live bodies along that front line yes they do 4233 Duke arletti beautiful good answer comes back with a three 4236 Applause Music shot clock is off Applause Jeremy Roach down the wing looking inside but the overplay now its a bounce to philipowski he moves in thats going to be a travel so Delaware will get another crack at it here with 52 plenty of time to get up the floor and get a shot lets see what Duke throws up and if youre Duke you dont want to foul and put them at the freethrow line in this situation grandison out and Blakes back in thank you Delaware is going to sub in Kevin Riley and Duke needs to lock in on him hes had a terrific first half full core pressure they dont have a lot of time three seconds two pulling from dig its blocked and the half is history Davis tried to launch one but the defensive stop protects the Duke lead at six as we have reached halftime here at Cameron Indoor Stadium number seven Duke roared to a big lead early but Delaware chipped away its always a pleasure to be with the Duke Legend an ACC Legend one of the greatest players this conference has ever produced Mike jaminski back at Cameron Indoor Stadium but allow for you it really is its been a couple of years covid was uh a rough stretch for everybody but um always a always a special place for me bobowski lays it in yeah it just he really got great position in the paint deep in the paint Applause keep an eye on Jamir Nelson for Delaware with foul trouble that whole first half lets see if he can get going here early for them good save by asimova comes off the screen firing his second field goal the senior from Rockville Maryland 4438 and hes been quite hes their third double figure score so uh you know a few more points from him would certainly help the cause phillipowski cut off bounce into the middle oh what a pass by Lively how about how about the three freshmen moving the ball that time amongst themselves nice work at Close Quarter Applause Owens a little daylight in the lane had to Arc it up and off the glass Applause tough finish for him in traffic filipowski a spin move loose ball picked up by LJ Owens that is the fifth Duke turnover Applause Owens back to the basket is Ray thats flicked away and 11 on the Delaware shot clock you know its impressed me in that philipowskis ability to defend away from the the interior hes done a nice job keeping people in front 25 feet from the basket 4640 Blue Devils and thats going to be a travel Nelson took it to the floor with him just so anxious to get into the offense lift his team up you know frustrating for him to be on the bench for most of that first half and you still buying a tripped a little bit here but you still have to let the game come to you absolutely absolutely and you know hes got to be careful too on drives to the basket he didnt pick up an offensive foul that way foreign to the top and Proctor middle ball screen by philipowski and we got a hold yeah that was on assamova Elmos rips him his arm out second foul line ibby out of bounds underneath for the Blue Devils Music Whitehead in that first half I wonder how much hell play in the second as Mitchell takes it up and gets fouling Music Christian Reyes his first of the evening well shooting foul sends Mitchell to the stripe and you know the things with injuries too Bob like I mean with Whitehead youre warmed up you know you go out and you you know you play in the first half you just wonder about a guy sitting there getting a little cold you know if you got a good warm up in the second half they may give him some minutes early but um you know I thought I didnt flash this he played pretty well for this his first action Mitchell in the opener against Jacksonville 4842 Applause firing the three the Lebowski clears beautiful motor by Road step down again yeah and nobody stepped up to uh you know stop the advance of the basketball and thats what you have to do with him initially Duke by 10 Nelson passed in traffic Applause Music Applause Rogue spins Lefty off the glass no everything but the Finish Applause asimova takes the three so much for controlling the tempo for Delaware some quick shots Mitchell steps through thats a good time face things were getting away from Delaware Duke takes the lead to a dozen Mark Mitchell goes in a nice move to free himself and Duke goes up 12 5240 for players from this conference in the NBA but you know what Bob thats just the fact that if you want to compete and win in this league youve got to have guys are going to play at the next level yes I mean North Carolina theyve done it thats why Virginia has made their jump in their in his last 10 years thats the type of talent you have to have exactly catch it should filipowski Applause and Delaware wins the rebound thank you Applause they just theyre so locked in on Nelson and oh what a tough shot yeah and he created something out of nothing that time great finish 5242 Mitchell strong move to the glass Applause give the blue hands credit they have found a way to stay in this game right and theyve kept Duke off the offensive blast the shooting percentage coming down only five offensive rebounds for Duke to this point the average 19 pull up for Davis Applause Music Applause Baseline cut intended for philipowski in the pass intercepted Nelson gives it up asamova nope it remains a 10point spread five minutes of elapsed in the second half Music Jeremy roach off the pick Music Applause the basket young thats taken away and a foul on Ryan his second good active hands on the double team coming over that time and that brings us to a timeout pretty good answer by Delaware after this bird 10point game and the blue Delaware got down 13 Mike they cut it back to six in that first half behind the three ball now they dont have one yet in the second half but they were on it late in the first half yeah five uh five threes in that first half kept them in some pretty good looks you know stretching the defense Cross Court passes I thought that Riley really gave them a terrific lift in that first 20 minutes hes hit two of the five threes for them uh you know they just they keep hanging around and hanging around and uh so you know credit for them theres the preseason Poll for the colonial house and really good Ive seen Charleston theyre going to be very good in that League gave Carolina all they wanted last week 5242 is our score turn around for Davis and its an eightpoint game and theyre challenging the post guys to defend oneonone inside and that was a very patient move floor spread here for the Blue Devils Whitehead has checked back in for Duke his second stint Applause else on the board Applause Nelson running the floor inside now they kick it out the three ball by arletti no again you really cant complain about the looks Delawares gotten just not taking advantage of them oh for four on threes in the second half rolling it off the rim is Ryan Young Nelson again behind the back roaches had him in his sights all night yep done a nice job and keeping him in front Applause Davis again out rebound for Proctor and Proctors been a little quiet offensively in the second half nice running the floor right straight down the pipe Ryan young you know you know old time West unsold used to say the shortest distance is a straight line and thats exactly what Brian Young did on that drive Applause 444 Applause heres the looking you know Nelson will just barely 61 and uh good help side defense from behind arletti lays it in Applause 5446 the Junior from Italy has given the Blue Hens a lift off the bench Applause road schlobbing but that one high and wide intended for lively yeah I said Lively is bouncy But Not That Bouncy eight turnovers for Duke they had four at halftime thank you Applause again Delaware has a chance to knife into the lead a little bit more here Mr three that would have cut it to five this ones picked off but out of bounds for Whitehead really nice job reading the passing Lane that time because Nelson was wide open if that pass gets made he has a good look at a jump shot clock at six Nelson Applause hits the hard and a charge thats number four Applause now the referees are getting together Justin Porterfield hes come over to talk to Jeffrey Clark I didnt think it was a charge they may be reversing this call Music I wonder if they restrictive area Applause Music yeah I dont know who if theyre going to give that to Lively because he was the one you know he kind of turned sideways and then reached in and initiated the contact actually theyve called it I believe a roach so itll be his second Nelson well theres a chance at the line tonight you missed it a very fortunate rehearsal right there for Delaware instead of him having his fourth foul Nelson splits the pair 5447 Applause which gives it up grandison for the dribble handoffs for Whitehead he swings it Lakes oh look out Applause everybody getting up roach okay our lady was the one flying through the air that time picking up the foul that was dangerous talk about taking a fake hook line and sinker Music Applause fortunately everybodys okay 11 48 Look Out Below 5447 Duke at 1140i security protecting the paint Mike jaminski Duke showing off its great length and instincts well thats the thing the length really Pops to my mind when you look at this team at just about every position and uh nice job hitting the floor right there and I you know I broke a young team the offensive end is the first thing to come the defense is going to be the last thing to come but this team has a chance to be a very very good defensive ball Club and looking to pass this test tonight Duke was a heavy favorite coming into this one but Delaware despite the fact that Jamir Nelson has been in foul trouble from the start theyve theyve hung in this game but Bob you know weve seen games where its early in the season and theres a lot of talent around the country and weve seen midbaser teams hang in games yes sir there have been very few blowouts off the bounce roach misses the rebound belongs to Duke and Blakes Applause Music Whitehead Applause Baseline spin approach hes the shortest Duke player he was buried in amongst Delaware guys and he comes up with the ball not only that but a chance for a threepoint play look at this just getting down getting control of the ball and the Finish inside terrific play our lady with the reach in his second foul and a free throw for Jeremy Roach and hes got his seventh point of the night Music Applause Nelson over the timeline 1115 to play side step three for our lady Applause whos laying able to get out there bother that jump shot catch it shoot grandison good first three of the night just his third of the year yeah two of 12 coming in before that 13point lead matches Dukes biggest and a foul well nice job that time by Nelson seeing the big switch that time you drive right at that player try to pick up the foul Livelys third side out for Delaware Applause picked off flakes Delaware Jalen Blakes hiding in the weeds and it was the smothering double team on Nelson that really facilitated that that pick off watch this hes just got people all around him great anticipation by Jalen Blakes Music seven left in our second half and the Blue Devils create a little bit of breathing room on this 80 run to go up 6247 and Delaware you know theyre forced to call that timeout things kind of slipped away from only one time out left but they theyve taken these situations and theyve had an answer lets see if theyve got one for this goal for dealer Dukes biggest lead of the night at 15 1037 to play tremendous balance he had the Duke scoring tonight getting lots of contributions everybody whos playing they scored and you know what with with Whitehead you can see whats there just the timing and and game shape not quite obviously not there yet dipping the toe into the pool yeah hey this is you know its the the perfect opportunity for that to happen and they you know maybe get some Court time against Bellarmine and then that big trip out west Applause Music Blue Devils coming back out on the court Music Applause 6247 now Delaware will go the 94 feet to get this thing restarted here Heavy assamoa Plays it in here comes Jamir Nelson his season high is 18 Nelson has been held to eight tonight he has been a Marked Man by The Duke defense and its its the personal foul number thats held him down Applause you know for the most part theyve really tried to attack Lively oneonone in the post I think hes done a decent job without any double team help not fouling even though you know he gets called for that one two free throws for jair Davis last season of freshman sensation great down the stretch over his last 14 games averaged 16 points and seven rebounds to go away and this one rips out he was the Rookie of the Year of the colonial and the tournament MVP then has a string of 16 straight double figure scoring games going so very very consistent missed both free throws so hes sitting on nine still 6247 Ill take the blame for that yes the bringing up broadcasters Jinx there you go oh boy at the rim and a foul odd Delaware boy roach got up in the air and then the contact by asamoa foreign I think you know if he had just gone for the layup he probably would have scored it but you really have to admire the aggressiveness thats big time play its a pretty good challenge too at The Rim roach with his eight points he came alive in that NCAA tournament Im not sure the Blue Devils make it no to the final four without him no they dont 6447 Applause Owens backs it out a drive by Davis rebound Young Music phillipowski step through laying good well he is seven feet tall pretty versatile Sean hes you know he can post up he can knock down the three and a nice little dribble drive that time Delaware has gone three minutes and 40 seconds without a bucket theyd need one desperately and get it here on the lean in laying by LJ Owens good move flakes for three in and out and weve got a foul on Delaware and Samoa is fourth well hes got plenty of room to uh to maneuver here just a good up and under Bob you you look at this this new team is it gonna devolve into a really good threepoint shooting team Applause in this game and a 20point lead for Duke 6949 just like that very explosive Owens trying to find some daylight throws it up on the glass and pulled out by Young Applause Blakes feet set splash crazies respond in kind 7249 and 182 Duke run 22 points Off the Bench now for deer and a travel on Davis heres where everybodys just compressed getting back in transition you know and Blakes just finding the open scene foreign 7249 is our score and here come the Devils looking for more and just be curious to see you know as this lead grows you know does Whitehead go out there and get a little bit more time out on just Court time at this you know you were alluded to that earlier is so important you know you get them you get them a few minutes here in a blowout game second foul on philipowski 7 53 left at Cameron 97 53 left in our second half to Marco arletti ready to inbound it here for the blue hands Applause this is Riley had such a good first half shooting the ball a little long on this one and I think you got the coachs attention with the first half that he had theyve been locked in on him defensively this one blocked as Nigel Shad came up big Applause Music 21 on the Duke shot clock Music Applause Applause that one I think she had got a piece of that one yeah hes been a factor in a couple of plays here thats the first time weve seen Proctor get really aggressive in the second half Proctor got it again nice clean look out of the inbounds play 7449 trying to get those to the corner takes it away Proctor tried to tee up young down the middle picked up by phillipowski plays at home they bailed him out that time and Proctors he got caught up in the air without a real good pass to make and he got bailed out by a teammate smothered a lot of tall trees on this campus oh man theres some size out there for this Duke team and and they can just reload going to the bench too not a lot of drop off along those four five and three positions and then you know when when Whitehead gets into shape give you another Wing a big big win Music and a beautiful follow Inside by Nelson gives him 11 hes been able to manage to this point he had that close call picking up the fourth but hes been foul free in the second half personal foul line Johnny McCoy his second 17 fouls now on Delaware so free throw Music and this will send Kyle filipowski to the line coming off a career best 17 against Kansas a couple of nights ago this is the front end here and again poked away and out of bounds to do oh you gotta love the hustle just never give up on the ball Applause foreign takes the three oh nice Todd didnt roll in for philipowski he set that high screen and then just got great position on the offensive glass Nelson Applause Delaware tough tough night for him yeah and the three ball was their friend Mike in that first half there oh of eight in the second thank you whiteheads the basket is going to count and a foul inside on Delaware Music Applause well heres the shot and its hes had trouble getting him to fall so far but uh friendly roll there at home and just uh you know at this point Dukes depth and size just really wearing Delaware down Music and on the foul Davis commits his second phillipowski is going to get a 11 Applause Jalen Blakes back in and Tyrese Proctor out and how about Proctor double for him 13 points 10 rebounds four assists I would say have a night hits the second shot and gives way to Derek Lively 5 28 left Applause Nelson hooks it back up top Riley missed the three Nelson comes up with the offensive rebound needs help but turns it over shovel it to Mitchell foreign this team can really change ends of the floor too sir a lot to like about this ball Club Nelson blocked Lively gets another one and a foul to boot and thats going to be his fifth well its you know Nelson hes not going to quit and uh it was the follow through that in the body contact right there so Derek Lively calls it a night score is five and Jacob grandison will come and take his play well you know that and you look at it Dukes got three guys with four assists in the game Lively being one of them and theyve gotten some good passing out of their front line as well and they can you know they can they can suffer a Fallout from them theyve got guys behind them and come in and play thats a great sign for these freshmen that are learning their way playing Team Basketball moving that rock 8252 Applause flakes Whitehead for three foreign picking it up Blakes left it short it was contact no foul and I think hes more worried about where the contact was coming from than actually finishing the shot and the jump stop turned by Davis and this when you know what Duke has out there right now probably their shortest lineup that theyve put out there this evening not a lot of big bodies so the the lane has opened up some Davis gets the double figures so that streak goes to 17 you know but this you know with this lead that John Shire can Tinker a little bit and see you know what this combination can looks like thats a travel time out 351 to play second half Duke now with a huge lead over Delaware working tomorrow Evan Lopez calling the Florida State game warm Tom worm hes got the game in Louisville working those boys hard and they love every minute of it too 8254 Duke I always love going with Tom up to Syracuse hes the mayor up there yes in a long line of Syracuse broadcasters do they still give him the honeymoon suite at the hotel absolutely absolutely royalty Music 3 35 remaining Applause Granderson heres Whitehead spin move to the bucket follow is good Todd Mitchell well I mean again you see whats there with Whitehead and its just going to be a matter of timing and you know when he gets his legs Underneath Him and confidence in that foot foreign Mitchell and a reach in Nelson commits his fourth I thought for a second this shot by Whitehead was going to go down and now its just great control good strength inside now the Freshman from Kansas City Kansas out of Sunrise Christian Mark Mitchell getting the free throw Logan Curtis number three comes in and Nelson heads out of the game and that might be it for Jamir 256 left second shot for Mark 21 Mitchell is finished 8654 Duke Music hes cut Riley though couldnt make the playin move it out lob inside Reeves had a block got it back Turk hooks again and gets fouled Christian Reeves thats the line youre you know Im sitting over there for 37 minutes and all of a sudden you know you come right in youve got to hit the ground running and try to finish that pass did a nice job staying after the first Miss Music Applause um lets go come in with another seven footer Off the Bench and Reeves Ill just come at you in waves with a great uh you know pedigree him too and hope coming from Oak Hill and theyve got another one from Oak Hill on the way Caleb Foster they were teammates at Oak Hill second shot good saw a kale Catchings come in for Duke number 12 8854 225 left Music oh Reeves the rebound Applause you know the thing too Bob that you know Im thinking about with all the depth that Duke has makes for great practices you know especially for the big guys dreams with the dunk that is an excellent point Mike and so underrated you do get better when youve got great depth like that your practices are competitive it makes both guys better and especially in a you know time where teams dont have a lot of big guys up front but theyd have to work against in practice but you know with this young talent and size all these guys can be a better every day foreign Music Whitehead stays out there to get a little playing time and moves the ball well too white hit Reeves the rebound Applause Music Applause Music hoop moves it back out with a minute 19 Whitehead inside the threepoint line lets look at stroke 9254 and this you know hes going to get about 15 minutes of court time which is probably about if they could script it out before this game probably you know about what they wanted him out there for his gonna take a stoppage here just to substitute Im gonna get these guys in the game you know forever say they played a game at Cameron Indoor Stadium 9254 and you got to think that you know Nelson feels bad you know coming to this stage wanting to you know to put on a great performance and never got a chance to leave the launching pass no yeah three those three first half fouls thats really tough to recover from Applause a minute nice post move by Nigel Shad red transfer played three years at Kansas State won it Pacific before joining Delaware Applause foreign off the glass Applause and the arrow gives it to Delaware down to 33 seconds Duke will improve the three and one we mentioned bellamon is up next week before the jaunt out to Portland Bellum in a dangerous team they play at a unique style they really fly up and down the floor threepoint shooting its going to be a test yes terrific coach Scott Davenport one of the great coaches in basketball and superhuman being 9256 no shot foul on Whitehead is second Delaware will fall to one and two Music and I think they showed their brethren in the colonial theyre going to be an upper echelon team yeah theyll be competitive theyll be in the top third of the league for sure thank you Applause and you know theyre two big guys never got going in this game Davis struggled for 16 from the floor and Nelson with his issues and you know theyre not going to be able to win a game like this with those guys and those numbers Applause three over Delaware 9258 the teams shake hands after a for the most part Mike until the last 10 minutes of the second half a pretty competitive basketball game yeah and I just think that depth and size and athleticism of Duke just
