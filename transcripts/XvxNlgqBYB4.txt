on the earlier matchup eight miles away a month ago and were about ready to go in this one Ron Gruber Bill Covington and Clarence Armstrong are the officials tonight and we are ready for the tip of our Sonic Blockbuster matchup and Duke controls and again the five seniors including a walkon in Jackson Watkins are starting for Carolinas we bring you the starting lineups brought to you by degree first for Duke the usual starting five Jeremy roach and Four Freshmen out there for the Blue Devils and an early touch for philipowski and a travel is the call and that was the walkon Jackson Watkins digging down on him Jay and helping out yeah Watkins didnt go to double team but he dropped down and caused that travel so Roy Williams always did this Hubert Davis is doing it how long will Watkins be in the game Justin McCoy as well Caleb 11 RJ Davis obviously are coming in soon Applause a timehonored tradition here at Carolina leaky Black coming off an 18point effort against Florida State Monday turns it over stolen away by Jeremy Roach and he gets fouled on the drive and thats what Carolina has to be concerned with not just with this group but overall North Carolina has to have its offense help its defense you cannot have turnovers and allow Duke to play ahead of your defense that happened in the first game 202 in Fast Break points in favor of Duke and you see Caleb love RJ Davis coming in in a warm Ovation for Justin McCoy and Jackson Watkins as they sit down so Huber Davis in his second year as the head coach here in Chapel Hill he got all five of the seniors in there to start and now hes got his starting five in them Mark Mitchell whos been playing extremely well lately misses the runner and leaky black with the rebound hes going to have to rebound all game long and Derek Lively the second with an early statement here from the rematch after swatting away eight shots in game one oh Derek gladly the second hes so long and super athletic and excellent timing obviously that was an off the ball black uh block you give credit to Tyrese Proctor for stopping the ball and getting in the way of leaky black in the basket Carolinas won three in a row Duke has won five in a row coming into this game Applause sticky black Baseline and philipowski knocked away this one phillipowski was there so was Lively their Rim protection is outstanding two seven Footers in the starting lineup for the Blue Devils in filipowski and Lively this is the Freshman Tyrese Proctor philipowski on the drive knocked away bothered by Bay cotton here come the heels good pass everybody in the lower deck here on their feet at the dean Dome as Carolina strikes first filipowski misses a three Carolina needs to look to run as often as possible and pass ahead look at that position by bacon but philipowski with another block just the length in athleticism of Duke making those recoveries bacon had inside position and tried to go up quickly but phillipowski just wiped it away so the Blue Devils with three blocks in two minutes and 20 seconds but Carolina cant get guns you know cant be shy theyd still have to go to the basket and a travel called on filipowski at the other end just a beautiful play by North Carolina in transition the little drag screen in the middle of the court and the roll to the basket just a spectacular pocket pass between the two Defenders by RJ Davis and when Davis has the ball I think North Carolina is a better team when he initiates offense as hes doing right now pay the blood in the corner playing off the ball Davis draws a crowd shot faked by leaky black gets to the elbow and knocks it down well you have to stay down on that shot face you recover a little bit late to Leaky black but youre not worried about that threepoint shot youre more worried about the drive take away the drive recover late to the shot Carolina fans will remember Monday night the shot picked by leaky black against Florida State got to the rim a huge dunk late kind of the dagger in that game and philipowski just leaves the floor and once you do you get put in rotation and leaky black is a very good Corner shooter thats really his spot other areas on the court youre not as concerned about him taking the three first year is the head coach of the Blue Devils program for John Shire who won a national championship as a player on staff for many years as an assistant told us before the game the defense has led the way but offensively he feels theyre much more connected recently theyre still looking to score though in this one and a turnover love is fouled trying to hammer it down instead will be going to the line for two Carolina is doing a very good job of impacting the ball theyre trying to get into Duke ball handlers they got caught on a switch and then a terrific shooting of the gap by Caleb love almost got that to go down but you like how hard he took it thats a very difficult pass out of the post you make a diagonal pass out of the post you are inviting the turnover and to let the defense take it the other way Applause so love whos had some very big games in his career against Duke most notably of course in the final four a year ago knocks down the first one and it is five nothing Carolina 314 into the game and Caleb loves getting to the freethrow line is a very good indicator of his aggressiveness you dont want to just be aggressive in taking jump shots but being aggressive and getting into the paint drawing help and playing out of it the foul on Duke was on Tariq Whitehead hes come in Off the Bench for filipowski lively with the offensive board Duke sixth in the nation an offensive rebounding percentage North Carolina has to be aware of where Tariq Whitehead is because he is an excellent threepoint shooter you want to turn him into a driver Mitchell the Lefty into the paint over Nance and Duke on the board that was pretty good defense by Pete Nance you dont want to allow middle but at the same time he stayed between Mark Mitchell in the basket didnt go for that shot fake and made him make a tough too chipped away recovered by low Applause black shut off on the Baseline now Davis will try and stepped out of bounds to turn it over well speaking of Pete Nance hes going 94 feet with Jay billis Oreos Pete has been on fire before the cookies he was just nine points 28 from three but since the cookies doubling that average 18 points per game I can tell you I had never heard of lemon Oreo cookies but the team on their recent trip to Florida State there were 20 boxes in the lobby when they arrived they shot a School record 143 Im not saying theyre successes because of the cookies but Im not saying its not well Jay and I are Oreo snobs Holly were were in that were in it for the real thing but if its working for the heels go with it not superstitious but why risk it bro you cannot go underneath the screen on Jeremy Rose because hes going to pull up and shoot it youve got to go over the top and force him inside the threepoint line but yeah I dont want Citrus with my Oreos Im taking more chocolatey goodness roach averaging just over 13 a game over 16 a game his last nine he had 20 in the first game between these two yeah as baycott looking for a teammate threw it out of bounds now when Jeremy roach has the ball in the offensive end he gets a little screen here and Caleb love goes underneath it you go underneath it hes just gonna pull up and take a rhythm three you gotta go over the top of that and stay into his body and then Armando baycott gets the ball on the other end gets doubled in the post and just threw it away roach was out several games with a toe injury The Freshman Tyrese Proctor inherited a lot of the ball handling duties as he knocks one down and even with Roach coming back either can handle either can score and John Shire very comfortable with the the Junior and the freshman in the backboard well Tyrese Proctors just 18 years old he should still be in high school came in from Australia but he has changed this team in handling the ball they caught aggressively towards the bucket and draws the foul how about this with these free throws North Carolina will already have shot more free throws in this game than they did the entire 40 minutes in Durham Little Slice cut off the screen around the freethrow line just a diagonal screen and I think that I think North Carolina is going to try to get Armando baycott on the Move more often against Eric Lively II instead of just posting him up on the low block and having him go oneonone in the post third point of the nicer bacon he had just one Monday night in Tallahassee against the Seminoles the heels did win the game but his only point was a free throw in the last minute of play and that is a very unusual 99 for a guy whos been one of the best big men in the country the last couple of years Ryan young into the ball game for two hes an excellent rebounder and you have to keep him off the offensive glass and stay down on all of his pivots and fakes hes very productive in short minutes when he comes in for Duke sets the screen frees up roach who misses the jumper and the alltime leading rebounder for the Tar Heels pay cut is down with it they got put pressure on the shot and then got there for the rebound Applause big gets doubled and kicks it out double looks like its coming off the dribble love with a contested three and back comes Whitehead a little weave action up top Proctor using the screen into the paid floaters short but a foul whos called looks like they got fake hot and got him on the hand that weave action up top some people call it false motion its really just to move the defense and especially move the health and perhaps get a switch before you get into something an attack right side coming up next with top teams in the Pac12 get after it 10 oclock Eastern time tonight number eight Arizona number four UCLA the Bruins very much into play for a one seed it is an ESPN Sonic Blockbuster and youre looking at two of the most productive players in the country Jay and azulous to Bellis and Jaime Hawkins Junior well both of them National Player of the Year and first team AllAmerica candidates and Jaime Hawk has in the last month averaging about 23 a game and we were there for that first game at McHale out in Tucson and Im not seeing a more physical contest all year long than that one I dont think either team got the 60 points but there were a lot of they were standing there like 60 standing eight counts in that game it was played very much at the pace UCLA would like that game to be played at well see about the rematch tonight at Paulie Davis the kick leaky black the three he knocked down three of them Vince Carter is in the house and hes loving that hes trying to operate out of the middle of the floor less opportunity to help they caught the block young the offensive rebound phillipowski for three and runs it down now roach open in the corner and hell bury it boy The Long offensive rebound those offensive rebounds are killers Carolinas thinking about taking it the other way and then all of a sudden they gotta match up and play defense and Jeremy roach wide open in the corner and now an officials timeout called and puff Johnson is injured thats why we have the stoppage Pete Nance will be coming back in as Johnson in some difficulty makes his way off the court for a young man whos just been injured so often unfortunately in his career hopefully this is nothing serious he looked like he was holding that left hamstring not sure exactly whats going on they got a report on it but Huff Johnsons he can space the floor for North Carolina because he can hit a threepoint shot the defense has to go with him and that will open up some things inside for baycot Jacobs Anderson into the game for Duke guarding leaky black now a touch for Bangkok the double black again for three tipped around and a foul going against the heels looks like fake hot going after that offensive rebound phillipowski went down Applause a delayed whistle and bacon not happy about it at all it is bacon it is his first as we all get another look yeah thats not a foul thats just rebounding theyre both going after the ball and Huber Davis doesnt like it one bit he does not want to have to make any tough decisions with his senior big man a good job by baykot to run the court clear that area out man couldnt quite fit the shot fake got all the way to the and you give Babcock credit for that because he ran the floor and flattened out the defense and that opened up that drive for Pete Nance roach misses this three Nance the rebound eight minutes in just 119 here Duke by two but they caught the last two possessions has raced down the floor on offense I dont know love for three Applause knocked around in roaches should produce Caleb love took that shot on the first side of the floor North Carolina didnt move the defense at all the Lebowski guarded by Nance and Nance called for the foul his second when North Carolina gets a piece of the paint when they drive it and force help they can play out of it they got the ball to Leaky black on the left side of the floor hes able to knock down that three in this long rebound when Duke gets it filipowski does a nice job of attacking the paint drawing the help and then Jeremy ropes wide open in the corner ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by John Deere nothing runs like a deer run with us fifth year senior leaky black among those going through senior night here in Chapel Hill Armando Babcock as well leaky had a blue jersey from last year a white one from this year hes been here a while Holly thats right in fact he has set an alltime UNC record tonight with the number of games played and you know his name is leaky black but his real name is Rashawn Malik black and I asked him about breaking that record tonight and he said this place has changed my life so much it means the world to me that I will leave here with my name on something said I want to be remembered as a guy who really fought through things a bad ankle is freshman year playing through it in his sophomore year since Ive gone through a lot of adversity but Ive never quit on this place and now his name will be etched forever here at North Carolina a place that he says changed his life forever a guy whos been a great teammate a great defensive player beloved in the program and it felt to me Jay like when they were announcing the the five seniors that leaky black got every bit the Ovation that Armando bacon did and thats saying something because it was loud as heck for Bakehouse well hes one of the best defenders in the country and has been for quite some time all right Duke is doing a good job of they are impacting the ball right now and especially off of screens theyre showing and recovering DeMarco Dunn in Off the Bench a little strong on the three Pete Nance has two fouls pup Johnson has left with an injury DeMarco down and dontrez styles are both in Off the Bench right now and you can see Johnson grimacing in the hallway as he tries to work through whatever it is Carolina kind of Hit and Miss game to game what they get out of their bench at the best of times theyve only gotten 27 points Off the Bench total in their last five games shot clocks at two does roach know it got it off in time but didnt hit it here come the heels Davis and a much needed bucket for Carolina RJ Davis is the Tar Heel that needs to get going in this game we had 16 points and 10 rebounds in that game against Virginia and hes a guy with a good midrange game can knock down threes hes got to really get going offensively the lapowski trying to back down leaky black and using the size to his Advantage scores over him and using his strength you know philipowskis only five of 18 in his last two games oh of five from three but when hes got a size Advantage he needs to take advantage of it and take leaky black down into the post trick crossover Davis soft off the window and good well you really have to force him into that screen he turned that down with ease with a great crossover and got all the way to the rim Mitchell for three and hell hit it he doesnt take a ton of them but a mark Mitchell shooting a very respectable 38 percent from three on the season that actually percentagewise leads to the Deep the Duke team not just his 183 on the season but hes hit some big ones I won against Notre Dame in the corner was huge hes been playing some very good basketball recently for the Blue Devils Dunn shut off on the Baseline Carolinas got to move the ball a little bit more its a little bit too much dribbling in one side of the floor not this time for Davis in the rebound to filipowski and when you take long shots that doesnt give Armando bacon as good of an opportunity to get a rebound Bangkok got all of that well he timed that beautifully and runs the floor and finishes and the Hall of Famer Roy Williams on his feet for that big cot is playing in a different gear changing ends thats three or four times hes beaten this match up down the floor and that was after blocking a shot under the basket cant really have a better sequence than that can you lapowski throws it away the fourth turnover committed by Duke three Subs coming in for John shires Blue Devils right now but your point is well taken about fake God his his Motors really running in this game isnt it Duke is able to substitute more often than North Carolina and you wonder toward the end of the game is that a little that extra extra rest extra freshness gonna be a factor you wonder can betcot ever come out of the game he hasnt yet tonight and hes headed back to the freethrow line again a great effort well baycott moved Lively first and then made that Baseline spin to get an angle but Armando baycat has been active a great block and then he immediately runs down the floor the other end beats philipowski down and muscles his way to an easy basket had to work hard to get something easy Eastern with womens college game day coming to you on ESPN2 at one oclock Eastern on ESPN itll be the ACC championship between the Virginia Tech and Louisville and then itll be the SEC Championship at three oclock Eastern again on ESPN Holly Rowe will be there in Greenville South Carolina college game day covered by State Farm starts the day noon Eastern on ESPN2 John Shire pleading his case with the bill Covington Armando Badcock to the line what a career he has had the alltime leader to Carolina in both rebounds and double doubles yet due to the current set of criteria Mr billis that Carolina has as much as Armando baycott has done he has not satisfied any of the criteria to get his name up there in the rafters ACC Player of the Year first or second team AllAmerican most outstanding player of the final four or the teams most valuable players should they win the national championship should they tweak the criteria if need be to get them up there well hell be first or second team AllAmerica this year so hell satisfy it but if he doesnt they got to figure out a new criteria I dont know how he could be the alltime leading rebounder and not have your name up there alondis Williams of wake one ACC player of the year last year as Proctor knocks one down and baycott as remarkable as he was last year and he was was not a first or second team AllAmerican he was named today as one of the 15 finalists for the wooden award if he makes it to the next round the last 10 by definition then hell be a first or second team AllAmerican and assuredly his name and number would go up in the Raptors I think bigots going to take Young on oneonone see if they double good pass out Dunn misses the three and Whitehead down with a rebound for Duke and Dukes going to double Armando baycott somebodys got to knock a shot down or make a play Dukes taking the risk because theyre not as concerned about a three being hit if he passes out young with a offensive rebound you talked about how skilled he is really at carving out position on the offensive glass hes got 16 rebounds in his last 40 minutes in the last few games hes just productive when hes on the floor he will wedge you out thats what he did on that play Brad transfer from Northwestern and John shires say young cannot wait to get to the NCAA tournament Joe Leonardis got Duke is a sixth seed right now well you just get philipowski went for that shot fake Again by leaky black and you cannot leave the floor you just put late pressure on the shot watch leaky black in the corner after that little ball screen just gives a little shot fake and when he puts that right foot back you know hes gonna drive I mean youre not gonna shoot when you put your right foot back rattles home the first and it feels like maybe opponents Jr giving that shot a little bit more respect and leaky has been streaky this year from three but hes been shooting it pretty well lately but he has been getting guys to bite well you dont want to DARE leaky black to shoot the ball you dont want to leave him open he can make those shots but you have to just recover late and put pressure on him but where he can really hurts his job fake and drive because hes going to draw help and then hes a good passer out of it Buck Johnson leaving the game with an injury Hollys got an update guys he injured his right ankle he is not sure theyre not sure if he can return yet or not theyve had him in that back hallway with athletic trainer Doug Halverson kind of running it out to see if he can return I did notice he left the court yesterday at practice all as well and I am told it is the same injury so hes gonna have to see if he can fight through that all right Holly thank you but again Pete nams with a couple of fouls hes on the bench thats why Dontre Styles is in the game and Tyler nickel a freshman from Harrisonburg Virginia getting ready to check in wide open Wiki black rebound filipowski when Carolina reverses the ball and then attacks thats when theyre at their best offensively Mitchell aggressive offensively and hes rewarded with a trip to the line we talked about the the bench situation for Hubert Davis sometimes you know Styles gets a lot of minutes then he doesnt play the next game Dunn doesnt play then he gets some minutes and its amazing its March J but Hubert Dave is still kind of searching Game to game who he can go to Off the Bench for production there hasnt been consistency with what Hubert Davis is getting off the bench so it is going to get game to game depending on what he feels like he can get out of particular players and with particular matchups Ill tell you this guy at the free throw line Mark Mitchell hes been really good the special last three games hes shooting 63 percent 90 percent from the line and averaging about 14 points per game over that stretch really good Defender yeah the blood misses the bank attempt to the back comes Proctor White had dribbled it off his foot three on two love it goes boy what a catch by leaky black that was a gutsy pass by RJ Davis one of the few transition opportunities against Duke in the two games but that pass was behind him watch where this pass goes gutsy passed but it was behind him he still caught it and was able to finish on the other side of the rim just a superior play by leaky or excuse me by Caleb love and kept his eyes on the rim the whole time the foul on Ryan young his second he has gone to the bench love it the line so youve got Caleb love with green shoes heat Nance with lemon Oreos we got a lot of citrus looking stuff working for the heels you saw Bay caught on the bench maybe just until the under four time out big numbers for Caleb love in his career against the Blue Devils they need every ounce of energy they can get out of Armando baycot tonight The Freshman Jalen Washington is in the middle right now for the heels for the Baytown on the bench and philipowski goes right at him it bounces to Whitehead and thats going to count and a foul Washington wasnt Square as a Defender but philipowski just went right after Jalen Washington went over the top of him kept it alive and again the offensive rebound and Whitehead able to get it to go when your initial first shot defense is that good youve got to get the rebound to finish that defensive possession philipowski just went right over the top of Jalen Washington the fifth offensive rebound of the night for Duke to just one for Carolina Duke gonna go underneath every screen on Seth Trimble hes only made one three on the year but a good driver refreshment in the game for the heels now including Trimble and he kind of telegraphed that one and Mitchell picked it off its a little bit too much probing and too much dribbling and when you dont have it pass it out reverse it and then you can attack spins and lays it in what a move we cant give him that much space you know Jalen Washington backed off him and gave him a two or three feet and then philipowski just took up that space and then spun off his body again another big time game coming your way later on tonight from poly Pavilion 10 oclock Eastern time Arizona and UCLA Applause Duke trying to go to Kyle filipowski with this last North Carolina lineup let him go against Jalen Washington just took the space up spun off it and got it to go Music ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by under two dollar and three dollar craze for a limited time only mean sign well this morning on college game day jay Von Comer congratulations one nineteen thousand dollars sinking to half court shot first time anybody has sunk at all season Holly Rose with a couple of guys who witnessed it firsthand thats right well I want to go with Coach Greenberg first for the state for the Jeep halftime report coach you want to talk about Dukes aggressiveness yeah it does start a good job of extended possessions by getting to the offensive class and then when they get that offensive rebound theyre attacking playing downhill and getting to the rim all right were both frustrated because the post passing is not quick enough to Armando baycott how do they improvecott is running his tail off and hes open early theyve got to get him the basketball early because hes better on the move especially against Derek Livelys link you sound like a frustrated big guy Im a frustrated hes a big man and not cookies just feed him the basketball Bobby thanks guys looking forward to that Reese Davis and Seth and bonds with the Jeep halftime report coming up 3 49 from now you saw Armando baycott is back into the game he sat for a minute in 14 seconds and again Carolina needs everything they can get out of him tonight to have a chance to win this game and Ill ask you the captain obvious question how big is this game for Carolina I think its must win but North Carolina needs to win this game to get into the atlarge conversation and feel like theyre on the right side of the bubble heading into the ACC tournament otherwise the heels have to do something extraordinary and right now Tyler Nichols still in the ball game and the reason it says he can shoot it you know if bacock gets doubled he can kick it out and nickel can knock down a three roach to the freethrow line the kick to filipowski Big Time battle with baycod and its an and one opportunity as Badcock picks up his second foul philipowski getting some oneonone opportunities down on the Block he took fake caught down on the Block it looked like an initial drive but nice little pivot and then a shot fake and baycotts arms were down a little bit so that contact is going to be called to foul nine times out of ten Applause philipowski having a big night he is the eighttime ACC rookie of the week this year and with a baycot picking up his second he goes to the bench in all likelihood for the last 326 and a half and Pete Nance whos got two fouls himself back in hard to believe and Jon shires talked about this a couple of times in a preseason practice he didnt like the effort from philipowski and philipowski was asked to leave practice its hard to believe that guy is this guy because boy he can really fight through a lot of stuff on the court he uses a talented seven foot pressure Carolina going to flex action off an initial ball screens and this is not an offensive rebound lineup that they have in the ball game black trash to follow up his own Miss but philipowski down with a rebound aside from a team offensive rebound I dont think Carolinas got a straight up offensive Rebound in the first half what feels like a huge 250 here for Carolina with a bait caught on the bench and theyre already down six roach got a switch step back three rebound Davis Carolina has to take any opportunity to run Davis trying and he buries it youre going to get something better in transition than grinding it out in the half court against Dukes half court defense because of their length and the fact they protect Gap so well fast break points 90 Carolina but theyre still down by four Mitchell passed up the three and he got taken out by a screen by philipowski and that opened up the offensive glass boy what a battle philipowski is having with a couple of heels and he emerges with the ball and Nance really fought him inside got a piece of that ball and Pete Nance has been much more active defensively over the last few ball games Bill Lebowski nine and eight already in this game got a switch Proctor being guarded by Tyler nickel and settled for that Davis pushing again Music and his fouled RJ Davis is so good in transition not only a good passer but hes got the ability to hit this short little jumper his middle game is excellent he can knock down threes and hes made over 50 of them on the season but his middle game really makes him a weapon and I think North Carolina is better when hes the primary ball handler to initiate offense Applause Whitehead his second hell come out a little pacing from Huber Davis who has talked about what last years team accomplished and maybe the weight of expectations for this years team Jay based on what last years team did and he wants this team just to be able to accomplish whatever it can and feel good about that and Hubert is an endlessly positive upbeat person as you know but hes still got some very high hopes for this team going forward well North Carolina has ability it is not a great perimeter shooting team but they can make shots and they can play better than they have throughout the course of the season and now is the time to do it and theyve played well the last couple of minutes without baycot on the bench with two fouls Low cross screen for the screener Carolina guarded it well roach turns the corner and the call is going against him he just put that arm out as that right arm and just put it out to discard the defender North Carolina playing drop coverage that means Pete Nance is playing hes not up with the screener Ryan young to hedge and that way you take away the three and make it a like a floater or a midrange shot you make it more of a tough two Justin McCoy the transfer from Virginia he went through the senior night festivities is back in puff Johnson is back on the bench Hubert Davis has used 12 players in this game between injuries and some foul trouble love spins elevates and it wont stay down for him one for five looks like they got a foul on Pete Nance and thats number three Jay Caleb love with a little spin move here and its not too difficult to shot but Nance going after the ball knocking Proctor down now Proctor goes to the freethrow line its not so much the foul as the fact its the third foul thats so damaging for North Carolina and Huber Davis not happy at all so man sitting bacon City and McCoy Styles and black the three bigger guys out there right now for Carolina this is not an alignment we have seen the heels use very often at all if ever Im not sure theres been a more important player in Dukes Resurgence this season than Tyrese Crocker coming in to handle the point guard duties he is an excellent Defender and very good on the ball and hes a good off ball Defender as well but thats really allowed Jeremy roach to become more of a scorer not think about ball handling Duty John Shire told us pregame that Proctor asked for the toughest assignment for the best offensive player that the other team has on the perimeter yeah he doesnt always get it because Mark Mitchell is an excellent Defender so is Jeremy Roach but its nice when they ask I never asked like put me on the worst guy Music what a matchup coming your way the NBA Saturday primetime game tonight on ABC and the ESPN app Joel embiid and the Sixers Giannis of the Bucks who have won 16 in a row coverage begins with NBA Countdown at eight Eastern five Pacific look at that list of names that have come out of this program and have gone on to the NBA and I got a chance in person living in Toronto to watch that guy for a number of years there you can count on one hand guys who are more exciting than Vince Carter Larry Brown who played here was an assistant coach here in the house as well iwcc hes wearing that thats either Indian Wells country club or Iowa Western Community College Im not sure which one I think you could make an educator and why was his son wearing a Garrison brookster yeah that is odd smothered it that is a huge play they can hold for one and North Carolina has the arrow to start the second half so that stop and if Carolina gets a score here and the ball to start the second half thats a big play to make that block good job coming off the postman and styles wipes it away and now North Carolina with the chance to score before they go into halftime huge play defensively so Duke and Carolina meeting for the 260th time Carolina ball with 108 seconds to go baycott back in for this offensive possession to end the first half has to be smart here you dont want to get a charge and you dont want to get any kind of over the back foul going for an offensive rebound into the backcourt for Davis Applause refuses the screen gets inside the follow will not go but knock it off the rim thats gonna count thatll be a goaltending call on filipowski the ball on the rim now Hubert Davis has to sub out Armando bake out here but baycott because Ryan young came over to block the shot that opened up the offensive glass he never misses those and missed them both but philipowski took it right off the rim for basket interference in the goal Town yeah definitely the right ball count the bucket first half comes to a close Kyle filipowski other than that last play had a whale of a first half nine points and nine rebounds but Carolina despite an injury to Puff Johnson and foul trouble for nanson bacon they are right there in a game that they you would assume deaths is a matter of personal opinion Joe Leonardis got him as one of the first four out right now the heels with the first possession of the second half down by two and Bay cod in all likelier its going to get a slice cut there it is and then a wide pin well guarded by Jeremy roach to keep RJ Davis from taking that hand off man Chopin in the corner misses the three weak side rebound leaky black throws it out of bounds to retain possession a moments ago Holly Rowe visited with Hubert Davis well coach Davis your team really battled but what was your biggest concern going into the locker room well just allowing them Second Chance opportunities they got seven offensive rebounds for 10 points and you know theyre the number one offensive rebounding team in our conference they do a great job of getting deflections and keeping the ball alive thats a major emphasis for us in the second half weve got to limit them to one shot every possession because when we do that then we get out in transition we had nine good points in transition thats what weve been good at all year my hope is well be great at it in the second half you must have done TV because my second question was transition but you already answered it so exactly what you were going to ask okay thank you guys Weber Davis a step ahead Proctor has it knocked away the heels with a chance to get in transition Davis boy in two pretty good opportunities Jay here in the first minute of the second half that wont go down for Carolina a leaky black grabbed an offensive rebound but the presence of Derek Lively II made it a lot more difficult and North Carolina when they push the ball up the court theyre going to get something better quickly than they can get after grinding it out good help by Mark Mitchell to take away that role by bacon Nance with an air ball on the three he was just one for ten in the first game against Duke has not been a factor here tonight had been playing extremely well coming into this one 16 points per game his last three and he cant let that affect him now Pete enhance is going to have some open opportunities with all the attention going to baycot and hes got to be quick to shoot it Proctor turns the corner and Baker playing way off of Derrick Lively a oneman Zone hes playing drop coverage on every ball screen roach floats it up and in and Duke leads by four roach now with eight roach really good with that middle game hes got a good floater that was just a pullup jump shot with a little hesitation Applause good pass bacon will head to the line thats number three on Derek Lively the second but he got a great angle Applause watch the angle that Armando baycott gets here just got right into the chest of Derek Lively II and held him off on the high side and that was a beautiful pass leading him right into his move RJ Davis delivered an absolute Gem of a pass well it seems like every game at which Armando baycott plays he passes somebody for something on a North Carolina alltime list if he knocks down this free throw he passes Michael Jordan for 14th on North Carolinas alltime scoring list should have stayed four years MJ you would have put it away thats right 14th on the Carolina scoring list first on the alltime rebound list Proctor is fouled by Davis on a threepoint attempt RJ Davis went under the screen and just like Jeremy roach in the first half Proctor just stepped back and pulled the trigger and Davis trying to recover just went right into him as he was trying to come down didnt mean to but did create some contact before Proctor came back down to the court now the 18 year old from Sydney Australia at the line for three and Tyrese Proctor is a good shooter he shoots close to 90 percent from the free throw line hes only shooting 30 percent from three on the season but he has been trending upward for John shires parents they were just about every game that he played as a player they get better seats now that hes the head coach Applause Shire from Chicago his parents still living there and as you say they have traveled well to follow him as a player and now hes the head coach in his first year taking over for Mike sure John Shire went to the same high school as Chris Collins theres quite a fight between those two as to who was the best player all time there the double on bakas Mann spines black black misses the three and its Duke ball you cant ask for a more wide open shot that was an excellent pass out and second pass Carolina the worst threepoint shooting team in conference play in the ACC now they made 14 of the Monday night at Florida State but they are only two for 12 so far here tonight but its a question right now of whos shooting him Applause Lively and thatll be number four on Derek Lively the second Eric Lively thought that betcot was gonna go for a little dribble handoff but baycott with the left hand kept it that was the keeper play dribble handoff no Im keeping it and got an angle and got that body contact and goes to the freethrow line and North Carolina doing a much better job in this game than they did at Cameron Indoor Stadium on February 4th they are living at the line in this game only shot three free throws in that first contest and Duke now loses its Best Shot blocking presence for a while Lively out Ryan young in I think for North Carolina now going into bacon in the low post and going against Ryan young make Duke double and then play out of it but youve got to play through Armando baycott right now and Babcock making him count at the line isnt he he is now seven for eight from the line tonight and again its a twopoint game Proctor around and out Carolina ball Nance into Bangkok lost it and roach will set it up when bacock catches the ball in the middle of the lane its a lot tougher to double him Proctor looks off a health Defender oh follows up his own Miss what a beautiful tip in right over the top of RJ Davis with the left hand by Tyrese Proctor you know hes 65 and long arm hes got a teamhigh 11 Duke by four Bangkok down to the court itll be Duke ball Youngs going to help him up Bacons okay tried to go into the body of Mark Mitchell but watch this excellent second effort a good fake to get off the floater and then really quick to the ball for that lefthanded tip in by Tyrese Proctor when he let it go I think he knew that he had missed it but nobody got a body on him again he reclassified could still be a high school senior boys he got a bright future the Lebowski I think hed lock out a piece of that philipowski got it back and oh Lambs at home what a tough finish by Kyle filipowski great initial block by leaky black but philipowski with the great second effort yeah he has played like a man possessed tonight hasnt he now 11 and 10 on the night so consistent with his productivity as a freshman the double doubles love is fouled and will be at the line when we come back Kyle filipowski has been everything Duke could here tonight well this is his 27th game in double figure scoring got the ball blocked but stuck with it and this is a powerful finish in traffic by Kyle filipowski Applause my name is exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by the Sonic steak and bacon grilled cheese for a limited time only Sonic what a night for Kyle filipowski Duke leading Carolina by six here in Chapel Hill Duke comes into this game Holly having won five in a row over to you theres a reason for that after they beat North Carolina in February they were feeling pretty good about themselves the very next game they went to Miami and got run out of the gym John Shire said after that game it was the turning point of their season because the players got together and had a 90minute players only meeting where they got back on the same page the next game was a loss but since then they havent looked back winning five in a row he said that was the turning point of our season they decided they wanted to be good they thought theyd arrived after that North Carolina win and they realized they hadnt they got back to doing good things and their defenses turned up theyve been a top 10 defense in their last five wins and that has been the turning point Shire credited Jeremy roach and two grad transfers young and Granderson so the older players on this team for kind of taking charge and leading the way in that meeting they are only three and six this year in True Road games all of them in ACC play a battle for the rebound again and this time Nance and the heels come out with it love for three and Carolina now two for 13 from Beyond The Arc and theyve had some good looks North Carolina their offense has put a ton of pressure on their defense and their defenses performed admirably but North Carolina cannot get a shot to go down from the perimeter the lapowski open mans a good seal on Mitchell Davis down with a rebound I think theyve got to look to Bangkok Applause but its taken away a turnover that pass went to the wrong hand you had to throw it to the other hand on the assist from Proctor a transition bucket for the Blue Devils who now have their largest lead of the night heat Nance made a pass into Armando baycot but he threw it to his right hand and threw it to right where the defense was you throw it to the left hand hes got a bucket low up and in a tough one for Caleb love how much better does Caleb love when hes attacking the basket and now Ryan young has lost a contact I watched this pass by Pete Nance and watch where the defense is on Armando Baker if the pass is thrown to the other hand thats a basket and uh you give Ryan young credit for getting to that side and then that led to an easy basket on the other end that turnover and Caleb love goes right into the chest of Ryan young he wanted an and one didnt get it meanwhile the first sub of the second half for Huber Davis is Puff Johnson returning to the game left in the first half with an ankle injury but hes back in now as Caleb love has whistle for a foul his second its a little too physical off that Iverson cut off the elbows by Jeremy Roach but Carolinas got to continue to look inside to Bangkok and continue to put the ball in the deck and get in the paint thats the way youre gonna draw help and get open shots otherwise youre taking challenge jumpers roach off the ball now gets it from Proctor Applause Proctor comes to get it again pulls up too strong and bake out his seventh rebound of the ninth well good job by Mark Mitchell to get back and Corral the ball love no tip no puff Johnson no they caught yes now that looked like North Carolina offensive rebounding it wasnt just Armando baycott puff Johnson getting his nose dirty and getting to the offensive glass and they are on their feet at the Smith Center in this allimportant game for the Tar Heels here on senior night Proctor behind the back step back way short Carolina took away the initial action and it was a oneonone play by Proctor Davis time timeout Duke it cant just be Armando baycat on the offensive class he gets inside position keeps it alive but Puck Johnson gets in there and keeps that alive again and then a great pass from Caleb love leads RJ Davis to just the third three for North Carolina as they tie it up at 43 are you ready for this suffering from sinus congestion Joe Lunardis got both of them as two seeds UCLA certainly feeling like they have a chance to move up Alabama Kansas Baylor All lost today you feel and I agree with you Alabama Kansas that does not hurt their candidacy for a one seed no theyre still one seed so the one that UCLA can get is if Purdue drops off that one lines where theyd lose early in the Big Ten Tournament the heels on a 70 run to tie it at 43 their last lead was at nine to eight love is fouled aggressive again and rewarded for it again as he will be at the freethrow line when we come back what a good one it always is Carolina and Duke all tied up Duke and Carolina tied at 43 as we welcome you back here to Chapel Hill and take a look at our game time moment brought to you by Guinness Duke a very good offensive rebounding team this season and very effective in that regard tonight Carolinas Jay talked about right off the top of the show getting to the line way more than they got to the line in the first game and Cameron a month ago and Carolina getting out in transition some but you know Huber Davis would like to see even more of it Armando baycat 15 points 10 rebounds four of them on the offensive end and he has blocked three shots Applause but for North Carolina the challenge in the half court is to continue to run offense with pace in the first half there were times when Carolina was dribbling too much when the heels move the ball they are really difficult to guard love with the ball Davis off the ball on this trip Davis being guarded by Jeremy Roach they got guarded by Young trying to back him down love puts it up with the shot clock running out and young down with a rebound for the Blue Devil that was a big rebound because puff Johnson was unimpeded to get that but Ryan young just grabbed that with both hands and snatched it away from him and John Shire looking for big minutes out of young with Derek Lively the second saddled with four fouls a little low cross screen for philipowski but blacks forced him further out to catch the ball about six seven feet off the lane and then evidently had two hands on him and thats a foul on leaky black his first I just saw a shot of Derek Lively the second with those four fouls and that means North Carolinas got to attach the basket its not the Dukes not formidable still defensively but they dont have that shot block weapon to wipe anything away Whitehead a little crossover and baycott still got him his fourth block of the night Put a Little Euro Step on Armando baycott but he must speak multiple languages because he wiped that away and another Miss three for love and another rebound for young not sure that was the shot I say go inside to baycot or attack the paint off the dribble its been a while for Duke theyve made just one of their last eight field goal attempts roach has it knocked away and another block by baycot and a reach in foul on Whitehead with fake cut playing in that drop coverage when hes not up on ball screens but playing in the middle of the lane yeah hes been so good at challenging shots but that means Duke is taking instead of taking an open three or getting a roll to the basket and something easier theyre taking those little midrange floaters and those are tough twos and Carolinas been very successful in protecting the paint especially in the second half and how about this the second Blue Devil all ready to pick up his fourth foul both Lively and Whitehead on the bench with four as Proctor comes back in and here comes the slice cut and Ryan young is just mucking that up straight cut leaky black cutting gives it back to baycott and phillipowski steals it they had Badcock trapped and he couldnt find anybody theres a lot of big bodies muddying things up underneath philipowski and young young with his physics physicality and philipowski with his size now filipowski driving on leaky black leans in and finishes its a strong move against an excellent Defender but leaky black made him take a tough one right over him Bill Lebowski having a very big night here for the Blue Devils now 13 and 11 leaky black for three pump Johnson another offensive rebound and a foul away from the ball going against Duke Huff Johnsons activity has been impressive in this game Applause pal filipowski going one on one no double going against leaky black and that was just a strong tough move by the freshman uh Jeremy roach has done a good job on RJ Davis hes sticking with him got a switch now hes on love Dave is open step back got it or just that switch when there was a ball screen RJ Davis when he got the switch attacked Tyrese Proctor hes got 15 and Carolina whos got its first lead since early in the game but it rattles out on young boy everything but the Finish there as he looked to put Duke back on top that was like playing against your dad in the driveway he just backed him down his first points of the night Carolinas early offense is much more effective than when they have to grind it out Mitchell a strong drive and finish looking for a foul Duke back within two is John Shire calls timeout foreign North Carolinas defense has been solid and much better rebounding and RJ Davis when he got the switch attacked it and a great throwback against the pick and pop and Pete Nance Oreos for everybody lemon please epweek is upon us we cant wait to get to Greensboro for the 70th annual New York Life ACC tournament it all gets started Tuesday afternoon at the Coliseum and we will have all three first round games for you at 2 4 30 and 7 oclock Eastern on acc Network and the ESPN app whats at stake with Miami beating pitchers whats going on Miami into Virginia are coach hands Miami the one seed Virginia the two Duke with a win tonight gets a double by they would finish somewhere in the top four Carolinas locked into the six or the seven but much bigger picture and much more importantly for the heels they need a quality win tonight and this would certainly count as that if they can pull it off Davis to a wide open leaky lap rebound Lively back in there now with four fouls all right Duke is sticking with Caleb love and RJ Davis and theyre saying hey leaky black if you can make shots makeup betcon getting what is surely a brief breather on the bench right now for Carolina Lively back into the ball game with those four fouls Proctor two Lively and its all tied to set a little slap ball screen and Lively could roll all the way to the basket it was in the middle of the floor and nobody picked him up on the roll Applause Love Takes the handoff somehow finds black with the pass and leaky lays it in to put Carolina back on top boy smart decision by leaky black he could have taken another three there instead he put it on the deck to get all the way to the rim Duke looking to attack in the middle of the floor try to eliminate help Proctor would tend to shoot billipowski for three wow he can go down to the post that was a pick and pop set the little screen and then popped right to the threepoint line on the left side and made leaky black recover just 28 from three on the season but stepped into that one with a lot of confidence love creates a little space in the soft touch puts the heels back on top and that is not an easy shot a little horn sat into a slot ball screen Proctor gets it to go boy how poised is this 18 year old he doesnt just blast off that ball screen he plays it with pace and got his defender on his hip with his size able to score over the top and youre so worried about that roll with Derek Lively that he can just throw it up and Pete Nance had to honor Proctor with the ball they caught at the scores table but a long stretch without a whistle so Carolina going without him for a couple of minutes here Davis philipowski the rebound Rhodes probably got away with the foul there that wasnt called as his players look over the Wardrobe still in the horn South two up top two in the corner shot clock at five and two roach has to force it out hit the rim but its Carolina ball great challenge by leaky black as a health Defender love great anticipation by roach on the Steele they battle for it and the heels come up with it that was a great opportunity in transition stifled by North Carolina boy in the seconds keep moving here baycott unable to get back into the game no whistle well if you were looking for a pretty game this is not it but it has been pretty and RJ Davis has been a Difference Maker for North Carolina hes got a gamehigh 17 and thats the eighth lead change of the night Music roach guarded by love with 10 on the clock Music philipowski again barreling into the chest of leaky black and a foul called on black RJ Davis and he has got to be exhausted with how hard he has gone going up against Eric Lively the second pulls up hesitates and knocks it in off the glass a big time offensive play by RJ Davis ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by John Deere nothing runs like a deer run with us Applause all right the 260th edition of Duke and Carolina has been much more gritty than pretty the lead has changed back and forth theyre both playing hard as you have set off and it doesnt seem to matter what the records are what theyre fighting for the game always has an unbelievable amount of emotion and intensity well its always a fist fight and this game is going to come down to an offensive rebound a loose fall a turnover forced because neither team has shot the ball well at all give credit to the defenses but weve seen some open shots missed but these two teams have been very physical and have fought for everything philipowski at the line Purdue a 77 freethrow shooter on the season he has played 30 extremely physical minutes tonight and the numbers bear that out hes now up to 17 points and 12 rebounds and make it 18 and with big cot back into the game I think North Carolina has to take advantage of that theyre going to start him on the wing then he gets a little slice cut to get him down into the low post hes drawing a lot of attention filipowski right there hes playing way off leaky black black blocked by Lively got it back shot clock at seven Davis tries to split the double black forces it up and its a shot clock violation on the Tar Heels and give credit to Derek Lively the second because he wiped away that scoring opportunity for North Carolina just his presence around the rim philipowski was shading toward Armando baycat and that left leaky black wide open he decided to drive it and Derek Lively denied it his third block of the night hes only played 13 minutes because of foul trouble another great game coming your way at 10 Eastern 7 Pacific tonight from Paulie itll be Arizona and UCLA roach into traffic kicks it out and because of that dropped coverage hes running right into Armando baycat in the middle of the lane Proctor into the pain too strong tipped and gathered by Nance Carolina has really protected the paint effectively Dave is open and way too strong and yet another rebound for filipowski because of all the minutes that North Carolinas usual starters have had to play you wonder if their legs are an issue on some of these shots especially for RJ Davis hes had to hes probably run six miles in this game hes barely come out of the game leaky black has not come out of the game Music roach and Mitchell both very heavy minutes Purdue phillipowski up no good and again Carolina could retake the lead baycott got a piece of it and forced filipowski to adjust that shot while in the air love to Bangkok needs some help and finds Davis back to Megan and hes fouled on the drive baycott just gets to the front of the rim and a good find by RJ Davis and the seventh team foul on Duke so one and one coming for Armando Baker now Dan anytime theres a drive really good big guys and Armando baycat is at they get to the front of the rim and present themselves he got past philipowski philipowski had to foul him otherwise it would have been a bucket Applause baycott now eight for nine from the line in this game and where would North Carolina be in this game without the freethrow line Applause Armando Bakers father Applause for tonight what a season and on his senior night what a career Armando baycat has had here in Chapel Hill Carolina can be aggressive theyve only got four team fouls you dont want to give them away so lapowski fouled by nans who cant believe it philipowski just got that angle on Pete Nance whos ninth in the ACC in Block shots but that angle was enough got caught on the high side just a little shot fake Jab and allowed him to get his shoulders just past Pete Nance boy hes got a remarkable ability to do that too especially as a sevenfooter strong enough big enough and agile enough to create those kinds of situations well if he takes that short jumper that is not all bad news for Pete Nance defensively weve given up a contested two rather than giving up something at The Rim Music Duke back on top 11th lead change in the game eight of them will come here in the second half inside a minute and a half to go but a regulation love in the corner out to Davis Applause they play on black it wont go tip no and its Duke ball or leaky black seems surprised by how open he was for that short little jumper off the glass now Duke doesnt have to be in a hurry just over a minute to go duke with the ball in a onepoint lead Roach splits the defense and lays it in boy that high ball screen gave Jeremy roach a lot of space to play with and as you said he just split those two Defenders and got all the way to the rim and Jeremy roach has had a tough night shooting the ball but made the big play when it was required to give Duke a threepoint lead but running it that high and then he got to that left hand he just went right in between leaky black and Armando baycot to get it up off the glass anytime theres a screen set you have to force the ball handler to use the screen he was able to refuse that and that gave him a ton of space in the middle how high it was set was really important in that play big picture for Carolina again the importance of the game theyre on the bubble right side wrong side who knows they need a quality win if they dont win this one tonight theyre going to do a lot of damage in Greensboro this next 43 seconds huge for the heels and I dont think North Carolinas thinking about next week or the NCAA tournament theyre thinking about winning this game and right now with just under 44 seconds left in regulation with a threepoint deficit its not about getting a three its about getting a relatively quick score I mean you dont have to get it in 13 seconds but you have to get a relatively quick score and then get it down to a get it down to a onepoint game at least if you get an open three thats fine but you got you got to get something going to the basket here and draw help and then play out of it lets see what Hubert Davis and his staff diagram for his team and right now for Dukes defense its about RJ Davis and Armando baycott to give help off of leaky black and then recover late to him and you certainly have to be aware of Pete and ants in any sort of pick and pop situation but how many times over the course of his career have we seen Caleb love make a challenge shot in this type of situation Carolina shooting just 31 percent on the night and just five of 22 23 percent from threepoint range and as Jay said again they do not need a three right now they need a good look a wellrun possession right now and for Duke defensively you have to stay down on every shot fate Applause elevator play Davis in the corner back to black 12 to shoot slack drives cut off by philipowski finds Davis into the chest of lively and its down to Mitchell and a foul going against the heels itll be bacon and the presence of Derek Lively II Applause RJ Davis went right into his chest wasnt able to get the call or the score and then the loose ball comes up with a foul on Armando baycot but that doesnt put Duke in the line that on the line thats just the sixth team foul so North Carolina has to look for a steal right right here if not a quick foul of Johnson in for Pete Nance and you have time to get a quick trap as well Mitchell to inbound into philipowski whos immediately fouled and philipowski is 77 percent freethrow shooter seven for seven tonight theres going to be some training room time after this one physical fist fight yeah but after buzzer yep I mean cant speak for for anybody really but boy it feels like the kind of game that filipowski likes he seeks out contact and he has been at the top of his game for the moment this game began one and one for the freshman left it short clock turned off 15 seconds to go down by three love doesnt get it Lively the rebound ahead to phillipowski and he will lay it in to ice it for the Blue Devils up five with just 22 seconds to go and this game was won by Duke on defense and on the glass and Carolina does not guess that win that they were Desperately Seeking Duke comes in here and picks up a big road win sweeps the regular season series from the Tar Heels they earn a double by in the ACC tournament and what a a strong performance by The Freshman of Duke notably
