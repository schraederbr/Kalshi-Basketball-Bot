then they closed the regular season by beating Clemson then they beat Notre Dame and is this an elimination game who knows but obviously the stakes are incredibly High here this afternoon Roger AES Bert Smith Tony Henderson are the officials and pit wins the tip Jaylen low at the point a freshman and a good one from Missouri City Texas and this is Bob Carrington who almost turned it over you talk about two quality freshman guards hit has him as feder Rico feder Rico lays it in for the first bucket of the game well they brought a double team right to Blake Hinson youll probably see quite a bit of that because Hinson needs to have somebody on him all the time when he catches it he can shoot it from deep and he makes a ton of them and this is where Wake Forest could have an advantage Fon Reed the third a bigger body than Federico Federico hildr in the corner now bopy Miller pulls up from 12 cant hit it Reed had it but Carrington now comes down with it for pit Pittsburgh has some excellent guard rebounders ish leot and Bub Carrington combined average close to 11 rebounds a game Zack Austin turns it over great anticipation there by Miller Hunter Salis First Team all ACC and down with the rebound is Zach Austin transfer from High Point they split regular season games pit winning earlier in the season and then in the rematch wake blew him out beat him by 33 cam hildr is guarding Hinson they tried to switch there and Hinson took advantage of it but good coverage in there by Andrew Carr both Carr and Fon Reed need to stay out of foul trouble in this game they need to be on the floor for Wake Forest Carr had a great game against Notre Dame yesterday double double blocks steals assist you name and he did everything for them hes trying to post on Carrington hildr scored all 10 of his points in the second half of yesterdays game and you think hes a big key here this afternoon a huge key his defense on Blake Hinson is going to be really important Austin wide open but missed the three and both teams cold out of the gate whoa Salis goes right through Carrington missed the shot Reed has it but itll be hit ball well incidental contact is hurting some people in this thing going to look incidental you can see the double team now coming right at Blake Hinson he just back dribbles and got it right underneath to Federico Federico who did a good job of holding off his defender on the offside boy Hinson is tough 106 made threes this year that leads the ACC its also a pit Pro prog record but hes awfully good at going down on the post and posting up a smaller Defender as well hes big and strong so if he gets that match up he can do that but he shoots 42 from three as a high volume shooter and hes in range right now look he he wants the side cleared so he go oneonone back down with sales now Reed over to help shot clock its seven tipped away and hildr has it for Wake and thats going to go to get them on the board and tie the game at two BO what a finish by cam hild he got fouled it just wasnt called Hinson putting it on the deck this time musling his way in boy right now this is like a pickup game on the playground no blood no foul hon is 67 235 and again he can beat you inside and outside the horn set now a back pick instead of the back pick hes coming off it so Salis is going to be a big focus of this pit defense cuz he can really score transfer from Gonzaga who has had just a marvelous season but he and Carr miscommunicate there cam hildr was able to knock that ball essentially to himself and takes it for that lefthanded layup and thats a foul in any sport but Hinson was going for that back down just went right into the chest of Andrew Carr knocked him back to create that space By the way Jay wake 16 and one at home this year and undefeated wearing the gold uniforms this is the first time that Steve forbes team has worn gold on the road maybe trying to bring a little Joel magic to a a neutral Court setting here in Washington I cannot reveal my sword I was going to say that is digging deep on the research nerd alert there you Applause go is legged is in Sixth Man of the Year in the ACC number five in white the kick to jayen low and the Lefty just a little bit too strong hints in the offensive board taken away by Salis ahead to Miller right now Wake Forest going to the basket is playing through a lot of contact and first it was hildr then Miller getting those both to go on opposite sides of the bucket there are great guard matchups in in this game yeah this going to be fun yeah leet Rises up into a three and puts pit back on top ishma Lega who started his career at Rhode Island in his last five he was just two of 12 from three but still average 10 points per game that gets him off to a nice start in this game a starter at the beginning of the year a switch in the lineup Jaylen low went in midseason once he recovered from a nerve issue in his knee at the beginning of the year and its really seem to help him and and the team as a whole Aton Reed the third knocks down a three to tie the game 7 for 27 so now eight for 28 on the season shooting the three another Gonzaga transfer just like Salis good pass feder Rico finds hingson and now both teams are heating up now feder Rico is going to roll to the basket now you cant help off Blake Hinson on that thats given up a two you help off Hinson thats given up a three and he makes them like layups again the clear out Reed on feder Rico and Reed Scoops it up with the reverse to get him back within one what a good start for the big guy he pivoted around there was a ton of contact with Federico and then just used that step through move to get to the other side of the rim Music low has it knocked Away by Miller recovered by Le and hildr down with the board for Wake one thing when you play Pittsburgh youve got to be alert for long rebounds so guard rebounds are going to be imperative Balls loose and which way will it go its going to belong to pit out right now pit started the year 1 and five in ACC play they want up 12 and8 they the four seed to double by three and five in Quad one a couple of good road wins seven Road wins overall for Jeff cable team thats impressive the bad loss was a a home loss to Missouri and nobody knows exactly whether theyre in theyre out these two teams obviously today is going to have an impact on that I think what you and I can both agree on is that both of these teams they have a pretty high ceiling when these teams play well they are extremely good theyre both NCAA worthy teams hildr back into Carr Hinson got knocked down hildr is open and buries a three thats great inside outside interaction Andrew Carr didnt have it immediately kicked it out to hildr and then back inside to car where he could repost and when he drew that double team kicked it right back out and hildr was ready to shoot it leot says why not just pulls up and buries it its a long two he had that right hand drive just after the timeout and now knocking down that shot he was a scorer at Road Island average 16 a game and let him in scoring and steals Matthew Marsh into the game for Wake for Fon Reed and guo Diaz Graham who just came down with a rebound is in the game in the middle now for pit good block out he can shoot this hit by five the 7even foot sophomore from the Canary Islands hes not the strongest guy in the world but hes got some touch thats his 29th made three on the season shoots just under 40 and you were right he can shoot it but he can also make Applause it Hilder off to bopy Miller tough turnaround but this is a guy who could make tough shots not this time and pit with the ball and a fivepoint lead its good to be able to make tough shots I just dont think you want to seek him out like that he knew he missed this one ran after it but cant keep it in Applause bounds well I really enjoy watching ishma Leed play he averaged close to 19 points a game in the two games against Wake Forest went seven of 11 from three in those two games so no matter what color uniform Wake Forest is wearing he likes to play against them I love this matchup of Salis and Carrington Carrington is a hes a special talent as a freshman and Salis again coming over from Gonzaga former McDonalds AllAmerican First Team all ACC this year he gets tied up the arrow will keep it with a weight how about that defense now look theres nothing in the rule book that says you have to let go of the ball and Carrington wont let go of it but that was great defense to stay in front and then knock it away that was a big time play by Bob Carrington these two teams are play in this game like it means everything to them and it very well may for their postseason hopes a fivepoint lead early for pit getting after it at the defensive end Panthers up by five do both of these teams need this win today to have a chance to get in yeah and the fact that quad quads can change weak to week just its even more discussion about why cant you put a a value on the game at the time its played if we can do all this stuff with analytics we should be able to tell what is this game worth at the time its played Music right and its changing almost hour by hour now and again not all quad wins are created the same right you a number one team versus a number 30 team on your on your home court those are both quad one wins and obviously the net is just one of many things that the committee will look at but I think it goes without saying that both of these teams have a very clear understanding of the significance of this game no question and this is the time of year we face this with certain teams every year this is when you get to say must win you know sometimes youll hear it in February those arent mustwin this is must win Music time inbounded to Parker Frederickson who did some really good things against the Irish he knew the shot clock was running down the desperation comes up empty he had seven points and three very important steals at critical times for the deak yesterday hes so active hes such a smart player the Pits defense has been really good the last several possessions leg at the Miss read the rebound car back into the game for Wake leged had to pick him up in transition they need to look inside to him they want to go inside to Reed again big strength advantage on Diaz Graham he finds Carr and a little too much Applause shoulder a lot too much shoulder upon further review too much shoulder not enough Applause chest better to Rico Applause Music handoff hon thats a tough one rounding out on the long two and another rebound for Reed well he can make that but give credit to hildr that was an excellent defensive stand he just took to force that tough two Carr good outside shooter more of a face up big big physical battle right now with Hinson Carr somehow keeps that right foot down a little bounce pass gets it back and it goes all right those guys never left the lane both Carr and Reed never left the lane wake back within three we talked about it yesterday how different Reed and Carr are and how their skills as big as compliment one another nicely Carrington Le it now low hildr switches onto him low pushes off they play on and it bounces free low gets another opportunity and now theyll get another one and finally the third try is good as leged lays it in well there is a lot going on in this game yeah a lot of whistles that havent been blown this is going to be a fist fight for the whole four 40 minutes now into the horn set trying to get a wide pin for Frederickson back to Salis nice look Carr blocked from behind by Hinson boy that was a fabulous pass deep one and it goes for Blake Henson and Steve Forbes just got teed up for arguing the no call on the last trip down the floor on what looked like a push off by low as Blake Hinson Jay just hit about a 28footer to force Forbes to feel compelled to call a timeout terrific pass inside and then the great block by Henson got a little arm but youre not going to get to him there that is deep on Deep by Blake Henson Applause Steve Forbes incensed at the lack of a call on the previous trip when he felt low pushed off and called for a technical foul so its two shots for Bob Carrington this is the first well Steve Forbes was right in his judgment that doesnt change the fact that he got the technical foul but he was correct to note it hit now with its largest lead of the game up to nine game resumes at the point of interruption so it is weight Applause ball Zach Keller making his first appearance in the game today number 25 in Gold Miller oh a lot of traffic in there theyre fortunate to get it back Miller open for three and a great look ahead to Hinson challenged hard at The Rim by hildr and hell be going to the line Blake Henson was expecting contact and the defender hildr went flying as a result well Hinson is Applause strong pit coming in on a threegame winning streak this is their first appearance of the tournament again wake beat Notre Dame yesterday wake lost three of its last four in the regular season and the one that kind of stands out is the home loss to Georgia Tech thats the one where you said boy thats the one you got to get dont dont leave uh the door a jar at all but they have put themselves in this position did bounce back with a nice win Clemson played well yesterday but now find themselves down 11 to pit in the early going here in this one you wonder sometimes what you would value in the committee room because when youre talking about Bubble teams all of them have proven they can lose games to me the separating Factor is who have you beaten and who can you beat and whats going on with other bubble teams matters as well Villanova was on its way to losing to deple in the Big East tournament and got a Justin Moore three late to salvage that game Kansas State got a big one over Texas last night all of it is part of this big intricate jigsaw puzzle we will step aside pit up by 11 back in Applause Music 30 a quick look back at what it was that incense Steve Forbes the lack of a call on Jaylen low there yeah theres no question that was an offensive foul just wasnt called and Steve Forbes wanted to get his opinion in and did read the kick Frederickson a good shooter comes up empty and back comes pit led by Carrington Carlton Carrington is such a good player got good size to four at the point and a heck of a guard rebounder Diaz Graham dribbling into some trouble finds leg Leed bothered by Frederickson kicks it out hildr should have had that ball yep oh now theyve got it Miller hildr up and good and a foul of a boot what a pass by bopy Miller to the sprinting hildr on the right side so a turnover leads to a run out a bucket and a foul as wake tries to get back into this one Midway through the first half its now a ninepoint game what a great season for Blake Hinson of the pit Panthers first team all conference and looking like a j so far today it leads Pittsburgh in scoring and obviously threepoint field goals made first First Team all ACC and he is a tough cover because of his shooting range his shooting accuracy and then his strength as well he can take you down in the post back you down get to the free throw line hes just had a spectacular season for Jeff Capel and pit Jess Sims has more Dan on Saturday after a Pits last home game Blake Hinson actually stayed on the court taking photos and talking to fans well after the arena emptied and when I asked why he did that he said listen just to years ago when I was dropping groceries off at peoples front doors no one was asking me for my autograph so I feel like I need to take advantage of that kind of stuff because you never know when it might end yeah thats a good point Jess I mean Im going to start asking the door Dash guys for their autograph just to make sure they understand how grateful I am hon played a couple of years at Old Miss transfer to Iowa state did not play there now uh at pit and again just having a phenomenal season he and Hunter sales two of the very best players in the game ACC this year RJ Davis of Carolina the player of the year over the top to Reed beautiful Reed sets the little middle ball screen nobody picks him up and hildr lofted it up beautifully boy the middle of the floor is such a hard place to guard that action you run it on the side youve got a chance you run it in the middle its so hard to help Corner three not there for Zach Austin read yet another rebound he is clearing SP uh space and cleaning the glass at the defensive end boy wake had an opportunity to really get out in transition just mishandled the ball on the outlet pass as feder Rico had gone down that gave him a numbers Advantage hildr off to Salis under 10 to shoot great job by legot and a turnover now watch epon Reed right in the middle of the floor sets the screen opens up and look at the distance that ishma leot would have to cover to tag him and get there CU there was a threepoint shooter spotting up on the other side of the floor its really well executed by Wake Forest low the kick leg at the extra pass Bob Carrington the Turner around wow that little shot fake just opened up the middle and allowed Carrington to get past car thats a big time pivot and turnaround jumper hes got a lot of game averaging 20 per his last Applause four and a takeaway Leed caused it and low is such a good ball handler got two point guards on the floor essentially swatted away still pit Applause ball getting into the paint and that is a tough shot usually youd want to shoot that turnaround jumper over your right shoulder to go over your left and then still square up and shoot it with that kind of touch is really difficult a steal by boopy Miller and lays it in to the other end to get him back within seven the transfer from Central Michigan has had a really good year for weit those the kind of turnovers that Crush you Tom ISO of Michigan State calls those turnovers for touchdowns you cannot guard a runout Le it air ball on the three wake ball I dont think you want to shoot that shot I mean look how he had to go to catch the pass it wasnt like it hit him in the shooting pocket Reed swings it extra pass to Carr had a really good look couldnt knock it down and its pit ball much to the dismay of Fon Reed and Steve Forbes that was great ball Movement by Wake Forest now heres where you just have to give a little pass fake youre making that little usually call it guard to guard but its big guy to guard pass give a shot or give a pass fake let Miller shoot the Gap and that looked like it went off feder Rico to Applause me Hinson driving on Miller swings it Carrington Baseline tough turnaround fade away if youre weak you could live with a shot that difficult Marsh in Reed up front for the deakes right Applause now Miller lost it boy and pit being really really disruptive defensively and theyve come up with it active hands and great help and a wideopen Carrington well this games going to ATT track me yep whoa Hildreth with the spin but it wont go both teams shooting just around 40 so far theyre getting up and down but theyre not putting the ball in the basket all that Applause often Le it count it ninepoint lead for the Panthers boy he loves that spin right hand dribble spins around goes down the lane line what a beautiful play Music Hunter Salis J averaging better than 18 a game has yet to score in this one for a week well Carringtons done a great job of sticking with them not really helping off Carrington does a great job of staying in front as well so does lean hild fouled by leet ishma Le at the ACC Sixth Man of the Year thats spin move hes good enough to start for Wake Forest wakes got eight points off those six turnovers and theyve got eight fast break points I got a pretty good idea those two things are connected that is wakes second free throw attempt first make with hildr at the line and Steve Forbes would be thrilled with his team being at the line a lot because they are one of the very best free throw shooting teams in the country almost 80 as a team happens every time actually it doesnt yeah not every time statistically that would be impossible one of two for hildr hildr still on Blake Hinson is trying to take him down to the low post whoa and they got hildr there he kind of backed into Diaz Graham I think he was helped into Diaz Graham yeah look at him backing into him yeah number two on hildr Carrington very tough Runner tipped back out though in a fresh possession for pit and Carrington buries a cornered three and Pitch lead is now 11 well you never find yourself as wide open as you do after a broken play and a really smart pass by low to get it to Carrington in the Applause corner hildr boy he did a nice job with his right arm and shoulder just to push off enough to create some space yeah just a strong drive a little slot ball screen on the right got him to that left hand Ws got to find a way to get Salis going at the offensive end Diaz Graham his second three of the game look how high that ball screen was set not sure they want to be up that high and just have a pick and pop that gives a wide open three to G mod Diaz Graham that was his twin brother Jorge Diaz Graham out after season ending ankle surgery good hands again this time by legot legs got really active hands he got four steals in this game already terrific pass to bub Carrington and you dont get that much time to shoot in a horse game and then Diaz Graham off the really high screen and roll and Wake Forest was really pressing up so that pick and pop pretty easy for Pittsburgh hits 6 for 15 from three wake just two for n they go into Reed he cant hit and hining down with a rebound good job by Diaz Graham Reed got that low position down in the middle of the lane but rather than foul Diaz Graham just made him shoot it over the top this is kind of an ouncer cliche 101 but boy feels like a big minute and a half right here for a wake and its getting even more dire as low lays it in and the lead grows to 14 got the switch and low going toward that left hand and took advantage of it hildr has to throw it all the way out up top to Salis at the switch po to three and boy did they need that Applause wow still an 11point lead for the Panthers into the final minute of the first half they can take their time here and still get it two for Applause one legged Baseline puts the brakes on kicks it out Carrington the floater or pass actually and a foul and a shooting foul itll be a couple of shots for Diaz Graham after the foul on Carr its really good job by Pittsburgh when the ball gets kicked back out not just settling for the jumper but look at Salis gets the switch and Blake Hinson just gave him a little bit too much room playing the drive and he pulled up on him first bucket for Applause Music Salis and Diaz Graham now with seven Off the Bench you look at what legot and Diaz Graham have done Off the Bench for pit in this game thats been huge well hes got seven double figure scoring games on the year and last year Diaz Graham only hit seven threes on the season this year hes now got Applause 30 splits a pair and its wake ball down by a Applause dozen the more Wake Forest spreads the floor the better good switch out and a hold inside going on as Graham but thats just the third team foul committed by pit hell sit feder Rico back in and now Zach Austin coming back in for buff Carrington early in this game I didnt think they should call fouls they should throw yellow Applause Music flags they close out in a hurry on Frederickson respecting his shooting ability now Carr still lots of time on the shot clock Salis short and More contact underneath and another pit foul a car went flying down toward the basket St and that ball was short so it was headed toward that was going to be a run out for pit which is four team fouls so again no free throws wake to inbound with a shot clock turned off leget was has really been physical with Salis coming off screens on out of bounds underneath hes let not letting him have anything Miller up top Reed and whats the call that be a foul on officials are going to talk about it no its just going to be wake ball with Five Points three to go speaking of football WS winning the time of possession here at the end of the half but theyd love to actually get a couple of points out of Music it still wake ball down to 35 well theyre getting work in on the out of bounds underneath thats for sure theyre getting all kinds of practice just trying to get a clean look but again and uh pit deflecting so many passes if Wake had the possession eror imagine how long this could be and they turn it over as the first half comes to a close pits defense the big story pits bench scoring the big story as they lead by a dozen in this tremendously important game for both the Panthers and the Demon Deacons Jess Sims has just hustled all the way to L and he said number one we got to work on our defense he said specifically uh a picking on the pick and roll driving off to the basket theyre killing us offensively with the rebounds and offensively for us we got to play with some confidence we need to not turn it over or hold it but rather drive it to the basket and most importantly finish yeah not a team that generally struggles offensively thank you Jess they average better than 78 points per game this year they had 26 in the first half Hinson a step back three wow just lowered that right shoulder into hildr and knocked him back just a bit to create that space that kind of strength and touch is a really rare combination what a battle down low between Carr and Hinson Hinson got away with one there but hes staying low guarding Carr now Reed banging down low with Hinson hildr a corner three and he got fouled he got hit up top by Austin it looked like Austins momentum took him into his body as well but I thought I thought the foul was on the arm first either way hes going to the line for three free throws hildr the high score in the game for Wake he did not score in the first half yesterday against Notre Dame had 10 points in the second half had 10 in the first half here today but again theyve got to find a way not only to get Salis but also a way to get boopy Miller going at the offensive end and a number of the Fast Break points that Wake Forest had in that first half were off of steals and pit clean that up and really Clos down the number of turnovers they were offering Applause up all three for Applause hildr back to Carrington taken away by Salas hes got Applause trailers they dont get anything easy out of it can they get a good look in the half Court well just that mishandling of the ball by Salis took away a layup that should have been a layup Reed with another size Advantage this time on Austin but he traveled a good job by Austin to come over from the weak side and offer help and Steve Forbes knows that should have been a layup and they come away with zero after that turnover these two bubble teams competing for a spot in the semifinals against the top seed North Carolina which was so impressive in a win over Florida State earlier today another pit turnover just mishandling of the ball two in a Applause row give Pittsburgh credit on each of those turnovers they got back and kept it from being an easy bucket double team on Reed doesnt matter he didnt walk that time just stepped through got to the other side of the rim to Shield off the block shot and got the foul returning for the he draws a crowd do he but Austin just gave him that lane to the basket just you dont want to worry about the pass back out you just have to stay between your man and the basket and if he shoots it make it a tough two 7 foot 240 a starter two years ago at LSU played at Gonzaga last year behind Drew Timmy so didnt have nearly as big a roll and now this year after getting granted that second waiver that happened in early December December moved into the starting lineup a little bit later and is a tremendously important part of the Wake team little bit of life right now for Wake Forest crowd trying to get him into it now heres the switch hildr going on to Carrington that puts Salis on Hinson Hinson driving him kicks it to legot who had a big first half and is fouled by Reed number two on Fon Reed Pittsburghs done a really nice job of driving Closeouts anytime the balls reversed or its kicked back out they are given a little shot fake and a hard drive low swings it to lean misses the three and Salis down with a Applause rebound Salis looked like he stepped on the foot of Carrington stumbled but appears to be okay and again Reed going to work here comes the double he didnt see it he didnt know it was coming and wake is fortunate to maintain possession great job defensively by ishma leet he just didnt come over to give help he came over to steal the ball watch him go around Fon Reed looking toward the middle thinking the double team if it comes is going to come big to big and he just stealthily comes in from the Baseline side how often today have you thought or said boy thats a really clean look for Wick there is nothing easy at the offensive end for them especially those first two turnovers that Pittsburgh coughed up you know the first one should have been a layup and Salis mishandled the ball but give Pittsburgh credit I mean they turned it into five on five in a Applause hurry jayen low the foul Jaylen low saying I didnt I didnt touch him he grabbed my arm as he was trying to go Applause by a good help by low Salis into the paint and got fouled from behind by Hinson the Wake for is continuing to attack the paint when an initial surge was stopped by low Salis just looked like he was going to back down and got into the middle of the lane and my mistake they give it to feder Rico not to Hinson from behind so Salis at the free throw line and are you calling him by his first or his last name there H it depends on my mood a guy so nice they named him twice Federico feder Rico we talked about this with Carolina and I think you can feel it with pit to everybody knows their role on this team they do what they do well over and over and over again I think Jeff cable really likes the chemistry of this team especially right now its developed over the course of the season and a team thats really learned how to fight together Leed is having himself an afternoon hes a player leads pit in rebounding second and assists second and offensive rebounds he just does everything for Jeff capable and the Panthers just feels like wake needs a spark you know a run out for a dunk or something just to get them going the pit seems to be carrying the the tone of this game the intensity of this game maybe thatll help nice tough shot made by cam hild when everything is tough in this game Lake Forest fighting through it that was a heck of a play by hildr hes got 15 leged got the switch takes the three and hits it Bo youre going to switch with Fon Reed hes got to switch up into Le it not worry about him driving by you give up a two but he steps back and knocks down a three right in your grill and Steve Forbes calls a timeout when you switch you have to switch up to take something away and that was more like Drop coverage by epon Reed III and that was a big three for Pittsburgh and Ishmael leaner and Angel gray and get a look at some Bracketology as Joe lardy has both both wake and pit on the bubble on the wrong side of the bubble right now wake first four out pit next four out one of the things working against pit is they did not have a very difficult nonconference schedule looked it up today ranked 340th out of 362 so 128 in the league is great but they didnt get as much done in the nonconference as wake did but it may all come down to who wins here today yeah to me the nonconference schedule doesnt matter if they say its your total body of work as long as your total body of work work is what it should be and you get enough games in conference who cares what you did nonconfidence and the great day continues for ish leing he is just so tough I mean that was a tough drive and a big time finish it was 12 at the half wake I think on two separate occasions got it down to eight with the ball early in the second half and now its back to 13 and to this point in the game Pittsburgh has eight Mage threes in in the game Wake Forest just three car into traffic and is Applause fouled and a Timeout on the floor hit maintaining right now this double digit lead and they are grating getting an absolutely great performance from the accs Sixth Man of the Year ishmail Leed leading the way for the Panthers call me ishmail Music well its not necessarily who starts its who comes in and plays really well and Ishmael legett certainly is at the top of that list Jeff hes got a lot of game we mentioned he started at Rhode Island where he averaged 16 points and six rebounds a game one of the best guard rebounders in the league and really in the country but point guard ability he can score and he has really been impactful on the defensive end huge day for him nice day for Diaz Graham Off the Bench and even the free throws arent going for Wake like they normally do 80 as a team third in the nation six for 10 so far today Pittsburgh has been really stingy inside the lane its not like Wake Forest has been able to throw the ball inside to Fon Reed or Andrew Carr and really get Applause anything carington finds Diaz Graham he didnt even look at the basket kicks it out to Hinson and its out of bounds still pitball boy there is a ton of contact on that that wasnt just all straight up and down that was remarkable and Hinson certainly not a guy who is uh opposed to seeking out the contact on his way to the rim youre telling me thats not a foul I mean come Applause on cam hildr helping mop up the floor there you go cam Ill tell you that is versatility right there is yeah thats a job well done that is versatility 10 on the shot clock this is low got Carr on him Hinson steps back and hits another one when is this guy not in range what do you do thats just big time offense Blake Henson is a baller man and look at the look in his eyes as we can see on defense hes off on the weak side right now but he is all kinds of locked in right now good help by G mod Diaz Graham out top not allowing Salis to turn the Applause corner extra pass but they cant cant get a clean look well that was just terrific recovery defensively and pit is just winning the battles right now yeah they are winning the game on the defensive end thats going to be a shot clock violation not a tie up boy this is impressive Pittsburghs defensive effort watch how they recover when this ball goes out wow textbook do kids even know what a textbook is anymore they dont even have text you think everythings on their iPad I think so it is and a bucket for Carrington the assist to Diaz Graham it is the largest lead of the game for pit just a beautiful cut from the left elbow and Diaz Graham could see over the top not enough pressure to take away Vision delivered the pass beautifully where does weight go for offense nothing coming easily hild gets a clean look for three cant hit it and it belongs to the Applause Panthers good decision by Carrington not to launch that dont need it right now just need a good offensive possession after playing such great defense Diaz Graham driving on bopy Miller and draws the foul now watch Bob Carrington just gives a little step and go and a back pick by low and he gets the easy bucket and how do you guard this I mean boy Millers given up a lot of size but just a step back and drills it Jason capable the great player from North Carolina Jeff capels younger brother great crossover by low and he is fouled gave a little up move and kept the dribble and then crossed to get to that left hand is a great ball handler just fantastic and they seemed to be getting wake in unfavorable matchups for the Demon Deacons and low took advantage of that one right away you know they spread them out really well and a lot of that really high pick and roll action really spreads the defense you got to help from Along coming up at 500 pm it is ACC pm and then tonight at 1130 Eastern the outstanding nothing but Ned crew will have a complete breakdown of todays second round ACC Tournament game all coming your way on acc Network Im starting to sense a pattern here so thats an outstanding crew were just Reese in the guys unbelievable well youre not going to be the guys anymore I see Andrea over there its reys Andrea and the guys Carr look at the physicality from Hinson does not give an inch hilds three wont go Reed has it knocked away brought it down Carrington took it away with two hands and a block called on Cameron hildra Pittsburghs just quicker to the ball and theyve been stronger in just about every facet of the game and this has been an incredibly physical game and Pittsburgh has met the physical Applause challenge not only have they met it it feels like they have sought it out they have initiated the physical challenge yeah theyve delivered the first punch caring inton off the handoff short on the three offensive rebound Le Applause it hes in range air ball wake beat Pit by 33 at the end of January on their home court granted but just a totally different story on a neutral Court here today yeah the pit defensive effort has been really impressive Reed Banks it home but they got a long way to go still down Applause 17 low got the switch Carr on him and that means hinsons got a guard on him and Frederickson but he lost the handle good job by Fredericks and to just stay in front and be tough he can make some threes they could use a couple thats for sure Salis on the drive and he lays it in Steve Forbes hoping thatll get Hunter Salis going at the offensive Applause end Applause now Reed on low low driving them and is fouled by Fon Reed and thatll be number three on the big man for the Demon Deacons a huge game for a couple of bubble teams and pit up 15 right now wait to get back into this one uh pit came out and as you said they kind of threw a punch in the early going and theyve just kept on swinging and they have been the more physical determined team it appears so far in this game yeah Pits been fantastic and Jaylen low stepping the line right now hes got five assists zero turnovers in this Applause game Im impressed that Jeff cable like he can get down there like a catchers Crouch and he can just sit there for minutes at a time Im my legs are sore just looking at him maybe he cant get up Jeff was a great player man used to love watching him play 17point lead for the Panthers you when you showed that big 12 bracket what a steal stepped out of bals when you s showed that bracket you know Kansas is an interesting case you know Kansas State beat Kansas early this year when they were at full strength right so with Kansas scuffling toward the end of the year is that change quad one all that stuff thats an example of something hey you got to put a value on the game when its played right playing without uh Dickinson and mcculler yesterday mcculler in and out of the lineup the last several weeks so well see what their seed will be a tie up itll stay at this end of the Applause floor basketball is about Rhythm establishing yours disrupting theirs and Pittsburgh has disrupted any rhythm that Wake Forest could establish in this game I mean theres still a long time to go in this game but it has been all Pittsburgh Salis knocks down a three he is starting to heat up here in the second half the only openings hes had from three are when hes gotten a switch he hit that one over Hinson in the first half and that one over Diaz Applause Graham theres that same AC that got the layup low gets the switch again Reed gets some help from Frederickson low kicks it out shot clock at three leg at the force and an air ball gives it back to the decks strong defensive stand by Wake Forest after that three by Salis thats the kind of stop you need get a score here get some momentum Applause going they can score in bunches when theyre Applause clicking Carr and Hinson just doesnt give an inch Carrs 4 Ines taller but Hinson is one strong guy Salis again it goes backto back threes for Hunter Applause Salis oh this is a big possession right now for Pittsburgh if Wake can get a stop here this game looks a lot different than it did a couple minutes ago Salis nine of his 12 here in the second half Diaz Graham is open hes made a couple of those today but not this time and here comes waken transition good job by Hinson Frederickson has to give it up finds Reed and he is Applause fouled this on the screen the roll boy Salis with the switch off just Diaz Graham was heading one way he couldnt just stop on a dime and recover and then Blake Hinson trying to recover to him Steve Forbes asking for a foul when he was Landing Big Time plays by Hunter Salis hildr driving Baseline up and in and a chance for three how tough was that what a run by Wake Forest we were just talking about how it was all Pittsburgh and for the last four or five possessions its been all Wake Forest hildr back to the free throw line Applause 90 run wake well Pittsburgh has to get something going toward the basket you know theyve settled for some jump shots they werent bad shots at all but you got to put Wake Forest in a position to foul here get something to the rim Leed gets the switch driving on Reed and Reed called for the foul they keep putting him in that spot and that is number four on Fon Reed its a smart play by leg it put some pressure on the rim and ultimately he winded up getting to the foul line are they going to call that on the floor looked like it was going up but its on the floor so that is a loss for Wake although they do bring Andrew Carr back into the game and now with a readout feder Ricos coming out and Diaz Graham who just sat down coming right back in more perimeter big against perimeter big really at the five spot at the switch now got Frederickson on gz Graham good job by Carr to stay down five to shoot leet somehow kept possession couldnt hit the layup good challenge by Carr at the rim with both hands Miller Baseline finds Salis Miller got away with a hook there but saved the ball car down low blocked by Hinson talk about help defense and look at low going Coast to Coast to lay it in thats a big sequence for the Panthers and a huge block saving a basket by Blake Henson and leading to a run out and a bucket thats a fourpoint turnaround on that block yeah it looked like it was just the a fraction of a second it away from being a sixpoint game Miller had to adjust and draws the Applause foul some defensive plays Loom larger than others and with Wake Forest making a comeback just about to lay one in Blake Hinson comes and saves a bucket and then jayen low on the other end gets one fourpoint turn around Music now the big story coming to this one both of these teams squarely on the bubble perhaps playing with the feeling that their season rides on the outcome of this game so not surprisingly here at the ACC tournament quarterfinals it has been a physical intense affair with fake has made a little push theyve gotten back within 10 they were down as many as 19 earlier in the half again the latest Bracketology from Joe lardy has wake first four out pit top team in the next four out but pit leading on the scoreboard right now by 10 in this all important Music game and Wake Forest can get it under 10 with these free throws from boy Miller been a gutsy comeback just to get it to 10 quiet day so far for Miller who averages better than 15 thats his fifth point of this one he does have four steals in the game pit is out rebounding weight 2618 theyve made four more threes than the Demon Deacons have Wake Forest does not have a second chance point in this game is 8 to nothing in favor of Pittsburgh in that category hildr back on Henson and Reed still on the bench for Wake hes got four fouls now bopy Miller called for the foul and thats going to be number seven on the Demon Deacons yeah just a little elbow back screen to have him curl it and Miller has to switch is wrapped his arms around Blake Henson so we will see a fair number of free throws down the stretch wake as we mentioned theyre great 80 pitch just 70 as a team on the season and Hinson for all that he does well just 66 from the line got to back up to the threepoint line to shoot him Applause yeah made them both might have been the reverse announcement yeah with great power Jay comes great responsibility as you know Salis hes come to life here in the second half wow thats as tough as it gets and really good defense by bub Carrington you know he stayed in front and made him take a tough two and Salis made it thats just really good offense Hinson and tapped Away by Salis but theyve got a foul Hinson just rolled him down to the right block and locked him down but Carrington did a great job keeping his chest on him staying in front and GMA Diaz Graham gave a little bit of help thats just a superior offensive play in the lane by Hunter Salis his first foul Hinson right back to the free throw line again for one and one this is the front end wakes got it again with a chance to get as close as they have been in a long time if they can convert here and they will absolutely beautiful pocket pass from Hunter Salis off that slot pick and Applause roll thats just gorgeous and a great finish by Andrew Carrs a little handoff opened up and then Diaz Graham with the foul but Carr was able to finish it thats a big play and all of a sudden maybe all of a sudden its not accurate but its a fivepoint game hit L by 19 earlier this half turned it over still loose and Hinson called a timeout boy wake had it down on the floor couldnt squeeze it Carr appears to be shaken up for the Demon Deacons as he gets held up and its pit basketball after Hinson calls a timeout just a simple mishandling of the ball pit ran That Elbow action cut back door and then low was coming off for a handoff just couldnt complete it bobbled it and then how about Henson that was a smart play just to maintain possession at a time where Pittsburgh needs to stop the bleeding get a score here and create a little bit of Separation after this just spectacular comeback by Wake Forest and the stakes are high whether its a must win or not nobody knows but its certainly being contested like its a mustwin game I think it is a mustwin mustwin is fair once you get to to tournament time its certainly a mustwin for the ACCC tournament Championship yes and I think if youre a process oriented person youre trying to win the championship you have to you have to win this game now the bubble you know we dont know how the committee is going to vote but you know I trust jool and ardy and all the other braist that this is a essentially an elimination game for the loser but theres a long way to go in this thing and both teams are fighting but a really impressive comeback by Wake Forest still 638 to go wake has never LED in this game the final Pittsburgh Im looking to get the ball in the hands of ishma leget and let him drive it get something going to the rim Frederickson trying to stay with low now Carr switches onto him Carrington now with Carr Carr having to switch out onto all kinds of different guards Carrington the pullup wont go in and out but wake made him take a jump shot quick one from Salis and he comes up way short on the three Steve Forbes clapping his hands try to stay positive and encourage his team hit with the ball back I think got to look to drive it here legs thinking the same thing Sal is not making it easy leot gets the shot off and hits what a tough move by Ishmael leot but by driving it you put Wake Forest in a position to foul and even a common foul right now puts you on the free throw line legot now has 20 his season High 22 against wake Carr might have gotten away with a walk he did hildr its a three and its a fourpoint game well we are seeing some gutsy plays and cam hildr has been spectacular in this game on both ends of the floor Le it driving again count will they count it no basket but it is a foul on Hunter Salis and hell go to the free throw line but you get him to that right hand getting downhill you know how you going to stop him heres the play before going oneonone against Salis he mishandled the ball then just went straight into his arm could have easily been an end one and then Carr did he Shuffle his feet doesnt matter its three at the end with the great ball Movement by wake forus and then heres the foul Bo what a terrific shot one and one for Le his first trip to the line today and gets a friendly bounce outstanding free throw shooter 85 boy with all the driving that he has done today you would think hed have been there before that but all of his points have come from the field until that one hes now got 21 he gets downhill he looks more like Derrik Henry made them both just just over 5 minutes to go in regulation Carr is bumped by feder Rico and its two free throws the rest of the way for the Demon Deacons fed Rico had to help on that little handoff and then get back down to Carr and just put that forearm shiver into him actually this ball screen and then he rolls to the basket couldnt get it right away but feder Rico had to recover going in this game theres been so much contact B A the subway Music Applause push used a lot of the rim but got it to go an 80 free throw shooter as Federico comes out Diaz Graham back in Wake again has gone a while without Fon Reed he is sitting with four fouls its Carr and four guards out there for the Demon Deacons again a fourpoint game Jeff capable going to keep going with ish leget got the switch out of bounds officials looking at one another its stays with pits initially there was no call the referees were looking at each Applause other look like Frederickson might have gotten a pinky on it but that was Applause it Hinson rebound Carr starting to feel like Whoever has the ball last is going to win Salis and Miller having a conversation they both wanted the ball Salis got it too much size and Diaz Graham has to give it up now he gets it back left hand and hes fouled strong Drive I thought Diaz Graham might give him a little bit more space hed be able to pull up for that three but it was pretty well defended until the end when Diaz Graham fouled him just caught him in the back of the head when hes going up so Salis to the line for Applause all of this leading up to selection Sunday and it all starts at 6 Eastern with sports center here on ESPN re of the guys looking at the mens field of 68 as the brackets are announced and Bracketology breakdowns of each region and at eight the womens field of 68 is revealed again with a complete breakdown immediately following Salis one for two three point game low Baseline reverse no tip no leg it yes what a rebound Wake Forest allowed low to refuse that ball screen get to the rim it was a challenge but thats a big time offensive rebound by one of the best guard rebounders in the country Frederickson Carrs got a guard on him and low they dont get him the ball theyre trying fredericksons wide open car the rebound up and now in and again its a threepoint game high drama here in Washington in this big game for the Panthers and the Demon Deacons open side screen and r got

to five yod Diaz Graham got hit right in the face and is pleading is case to Tony Henderson one of the officials its not going to work if they didnt see it then theyre not going to see it now a Timeout on the floor with 248 to go as pit is managing to do enough Jay right now to hold off his comeback attempt what a huge play by Ishmael leet almost got the tip in that out fought Andrew Carr

minutes ago and well see if immediately pit tries to get a switch and and put him in a spot where hes got to defend a guard yeah Id get Id put it in the hands of leg to let him go to work hes got 26 points in this game and here he goes got bumped by Carr will they count it on the floor is the c well thats two hes had where just a extra little bit of continuation thats the right goal absolutely but impressive finishes on both of them line Le whos got 26 points already in this game Frederickson back in on offense because of his threepoint shooting ability Leed has been far more than just a score in this game hes got seven rebounds and five steals hes been Applause everywhere made them both Carrington taking Applause Salis and a foul away from the ball on Leed as Carr tried to post him up and Carr going right back to the free throw Music Applause line cars been really aggressive you just set a screen there and rolled down into the low post but hes been aggressive posting up Applause Diaz Graham returns for Austin the only player actually neither of the two players who have four fouls in this game are on the floor at the moment with all the fouls there have been nobody on the court is in imminent danger as Carr makes them both leg it being guarded by bopy Miller theyve had no answer for leg it today turns the corner on Carr kicks it to Carrington Hinson Diaz Graham Banks it home what a big bucket and a really good job by Diaz Graham to catch it and go up right away no hesitation Salis surrounded has it taken away by Hinson Steve Forbes is upset he thought that was arm there and low and the Panthers can afford to be a little patient here on this Applause trip another one for leot what a Applause game Bo what looked like a foul on one end turns into an incredibly tough bucket by Ishmael legot on the other he has been a man among men now watch this play by Hunter Salis going in watch him go up thats a lot of contact there for no foul going up with a shot and then Leed awfully tough going right into the chest of Andrew Carr backing him up and still getting it to go well you talk about a tough Drive downhill North South and then a little East West into the chest 11 for 18 from the floor 28 points his season High had been 22 earlier this year against wake and he has blown that number away here this afternoon and hes done everything hes done it on the offensive end getting into the lane knocking down threes hes got five steals in the game he has rebounded a terrific guard rebounder there has been not one facet of this game that Ishmael leet has not Music excelled he has been a real Nemesis for the Demon Deacons this season and even more so here today and hes got pit a minute and 21 seconds away from a date with Carolina in the sems tomorrow night look at the bench points and a lot of that its all legged in Diaz Graham but a wake hasnt gotten a single Point Off the Applause Music Bench B Carrington still on Hunter Salis Carringtons done a really nice job he does a great job of staying in front Frederickson way short pitball lot of pressure on that shot Pittsburgh has to be strong with the ball here its a spot throw in and you have to expect Wake Forest is coming after it Diaz Graham comes back to help out no need for Pittsburgh to be in a hurry here boy Los got a good handle doesnt he hes a fantastic ball handler and a foul on Frederickson two free throws coming for Jaylen low Jaylen Lows a good free throw shooter as well 85 from the foul line for the Freshman from Texas here are some of the games hes had 17 points six assists no turnovers against Duke and twice in the last two weeks hes had at least nine assists in a game nine against BC and 10 against Florida Applause State boy they had it down to four had it down to three too much ishma Lego y its Applause 10 into hildr who lays it in inside the final minute can they get it in and a move Jeff cable was counting to five and called a timeout at 4 and A2 yeah Isle was standing right under the basket you can run the Baseline like move and get out of there and hild appears toting down the threepoint line for NC State if you are not someone who typically watches a lot of ACC basketball or you havent seen NC State I promise you DJ Burns is worth the price of admission he is a very enjoyable talented player and it it seems Jay the game plan always revolves around him for one reason or another whenever you play State well hes an offensive lineman with barishnikov feet thats a great thats a great way to describe it 525 to go pitball up by Music Applause eight again Diaz Graham down to help out they hand off to low and a foul good job by Diaz Graham to come back to the ball and make himself available as a receiver gets the ball into the hands of a an excellent free throw shooter and Jaylen low Diaz Graham being guarded by Carr just came right up and then low calling for it he wanted to be the guy that gets fouled so weve mentioned on a couple of occasions wake is significantly better at free throws than Pit but and you mention low if youre Jeff capable if you get the right guys on the free throw line youre fine Lowes 85 legats 85 Carrington 79 and those are the three guys who figured to be handling the ball down the stretch one of Applause two no fouls no threes for Pittsburgh goopy Miller Stripped Away by Carrington the hands of Pittsburgh Carrington Leed low Pittsburgh has done a great job here in they answered the Bell when Wake Forest made it a one possession game or was it a two possession game was it two I think it was one briefly it was one I think it was a one and a half possession game like it at the line again pit fans enjoying this and they should they they watched a gritty performance worthy of the city of Pittsburgh hit has they came into this league 10 years ago obviously had a ton of success in the Big East we all remember that their only trip to the semi since theyve come to the ACC was their first year in the ACC in 2014 they are on their Applause way oh boy oh boy dont need this at this stage of this game if youre wondering pit and Carolina met once during the regular season way back on January thei at pit Carolina 1 by 13 and if you didnt see the Carolina game earlier today boy did they play well against Florida State Carolina was awesome and and it wasnt just that they played well they played really well it was how hard they played together and that was I think you Ed the term Clinic it was just Applause spectacular both teams battling right down to the final whistle here today it is obviously going to be a very very long 72 hours for fans of Wake Forest basketball pit fans probably cannot wait for tomorrow night fans and players alike will have to sweat out for the next three days for Applause Music Applause weit you know how about two freshman in the back court too in Carrington and low not playing life freshman you know its funny I was just thinking that that that these guys dont project as freshman and thats been true of Carrington all year long timeout for Steve Forbes will use a timeout with 204 to go is this tournament team and then if you have to go to the paper I get it but you I felt this honestly felt the same way about Clemson last year committee didnt right but this is a tournament team theres no question in my mind and I felt that way about wake about 3 weeks ago and then they had that three game losing streak and obviously that kind of changes your of course your mind a little bit but but Im with you you cant quantify ey test but boy when you watch pit uh they feel like one of the best 36 at large teams yeah dont get me wrong I mean Im not saying the it test is the only only thing you use but I dont think you ignore the eye test either I mean you cant just go on paper on this thing well I guess if youre voting you can do whatever you want Carr misses the three and that is going to do it wake gave him a push in the second half but pit holds wake off and they win by a dozen to enhance their tournament resume and to advance to the semifinals against the top seed in the conference the North Carolina Tar Hill we are looking forward to that one the first of two semis that well have for you tomorrow night here on ESPN
