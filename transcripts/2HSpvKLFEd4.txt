Jerry Heer and Justin Porterfield We are underway Final day of regular season play in the ACC And boy Virginia Tech would like to keep their winning ways going Backto back wins for the Hokes And now here on senior day trying to send out one of the alltime greats Hunter Couture with a win on his home floor Limiting dribble drives Thats going to be key in this game for Virginia Tech In particular the guy with the bar right now number three Burton for Notre Dame They have to keep him under control Burton could very well be the ACC freshman of the year Certainly one of a couple of candidates in that category Take a look at the Virginia Tech starting five Weve talked a lot about Couture who has it here His backcourt mate Shawn Padulla That rims out from three Offensive rebound Second chance opportunity here Pedulla passing out of the double team finds Couture for a three Cant connect Thats a good contest and close out that time uh by Braden Shrewsbury Again Padulla one of the better threepoint shooters uh in the history of uh the ACC Carrie Booth another freshman on this Notre Dame team draws the foul You saw the Irish starting five This is a young team all underassman in the starting lineup for first year head coach Micah Shrewsbury Three freshman two sophomores and theyve improved a lot over the course of this season Future very bright Uh we talked with coach Rubberry before the game and again early on in the season they were figuring out and anytime you start and play that many young players uh that many minutes youre going to go through some growing pains but fantastic job of coaching and youre right they have gotten better and right now playing some of their best basketball all year Yeah enjoyed our conversation with him before the game and and he said Look were a different team than we were in nonconference play And I think you look around the league this is a team that you do not want to see in a couple of days in DC Absolutely Again and theyre packed Theyre ready to go down to the uh ACC tournament right after this game They are not going back uh to Notre Dame And again theyre a team that is very balanced Obviously really good back court but their front court has been playing better Collins knocks down the triple Its a Notre Dame team that has won five of their last seven games Applause And heres Burton in attack mode spinning his way into the lane Deflected pass Davis recovers it He drives in lays it up but couldnt finish Excellent ball movement that time by Notre Dame On the other end Jay defending the threepoint line against this Virginia Tech team Thats going to be key the closeouts that Notre Dame has in particular all the actions that Virginia Tech runs Baron lines up a three off the mark Burton a step on Padulla Virginia Tech has numbers here Four on three Couture transition triple Got it We saw him out here two and a half hours before the game working on that same pullup Uh working with the assistant coaches Uh his release is so quick If youre not there on the catch forget about it One of the quicker releases uh in college basketball Great transition offense by Virginia Tech Davis tries the three that rattles in and out Doesnt drop Pull draws the foul falls off the rim and hell get two at the line And watch this transition right here Again a four on three Excellent execution in transition that time Pick your poison if youre Notre Dame And Hunter Couture shooting over 40 from the threepoint line and came into this game well over 300 threes made 326 career threes Call it 327 after that last one Yeah hes the alltime Virginia Tech threepoint leader Its surreal for Couture that this is his final game in Castle Coliseum after five years playing for the Hokes he leaves one of the as one of the alltime greats to ever put on the uniform Well we spoke with coach Mike Young prior to games and hes always intense before games but uh we asked him to describe what its been like coaching Hunter Couture and he just lit up again Hes just uh extremely proud of the career that he has had More importantly though he said the young man that he has become Burton He answers with a three He has really improved his shot Not just a drive to the basket player I tell you what if he hits that consistently uh he is a monster to try to keep in front of him So shifty adding that part to his game Really its just going to make him one of those unguardable guards in the league Tyler Nickel drills the three Both of these teams not shy They will let it fly Excellent action that time again The communication for Notre Dame on those pin downs cross screens and double screens Youre going to have to communicate Cant give clean looks Every single Virginia Tech shot has been a three in this first half and they have knocked down three of them The Hokes a 105 lead early trying to send seven or as low as 10 It really again its a huge game uh for Virginia Tech Uh when you talk about going down to the tournament and getting an extra day rest uh it is huge and obviously uh big implications uh on this game this afternoon at home for Virginia Tech It was a couple of years ago that the Hokes won four games in four days to win the ACC tournament for the first time in program history Booth drills the three from the corner Theyre hoping to do the same thing this week in DC Hunter Couture was the MVP that tournament in 2022 Another good possession offensively uh for Notre Dame Padulla right down the lane Scoop to the hoop for two And thats great body control of that time by Padulla use of the ball fake and then finish with the left through uh through contact offensive foul going the other way on number three Marcus Burton his first called against Burton his first theres Mike Young fifth season as Virginia Tech head coach and not to spend all this time on couture but he was telling us Ive never gone through a practice a road trip anything without couture who was his first snee when he took the job five years ago It certainly is going to take some getting used to when Hunter Couture is no longer in a uniform for Virginia Tech And thats two fouls now though on Marcus Burton And two quick ones and thats not a good foul Again the previous play charge again you dont want him picking up Charge trying to set screens and then right there really no need for him to try to reach against Padoula Thats the last thing you need if youre Notre Dame because Burton has been the catalyst for the Irish winning ways of late Theyve won five of their last seven on the back of Marcus Burton So Logan Ims fellow freshman into the game for Burton Heres Boutique Shot clock down to seven Boutique trying to muscle it on Zona That doesnt fall And Notre Dame stayed home that time Didnt double Previous possession Uh they doubled That time they decided to stay mantoman and single coverage against Potique Applause Deflected ball falls to Booth 7 seconds to work with Booth in the lane and a foul called 23 Tyler Tyler Nickel got a piece of Booth on the drive And right here again Booth previous uh possession two possessions prior hit a three that time aggressive shot clock winding down and and Booth has got great length Applause and also uh becomes a Matts a problem as he continues to work on his game but his ability to play off the dribble Notre Dame head coach Micah Shrewsbury told us that they need more contributions from the carry booths from the Tay Davises from the Keba Jai cuz they cant just rely on Burton So with the star freshman out of the game you need that supporting cast to step up here on the road Yeah youre absolutely right And I think uh again he said it to us as you said theyre better uh when those supporting guys are giving those uh extra efforts defensively and offensively Oh rocks the rim That gives some juice to Castle Coliseum Hokes leading by four early Applause Applause Shrewsbury Hes got such a quick trigger Couldnt connect there from three Transition three Rex Steiner put too much on it Applause Nice look inside Zona hammers it home A classic pick and rolled to the basket And what a beautiful find of that time by Davis Zona though again setting the hard screen and then rolled hard to the basket Help was late You cant execute the pick and roll any better Rex Steiner from three That rolls in Applause three Well whats lost in that The pass by Couture Yes Rex Steiner with the quick release But what a pass by Hunter Couture Again that is a long diagonal pass on point Alls he had to do Rex Steiner was catch and shoot And Virginia Tech has now knocked down four threes in this first half They struggled in the first meeting between these two teams to to shoot the three just eight of 24 in that game in Southbend Lost at 7466 Music Applause Notre Dame playing extended minutes right now without their starting point guard Marcus Burton on the bench with two fouls Pineszi in traffic Not a good look there Great defense by Tyler Nickel And even better block out that time by Potit to clean up the defensive glass Nickel on the drive Great take Count it Plus the foul Tyler Nickel Jay that is all set up uh because of the threepoint shooting Again they have Notre Dame spaced out Look at the spacing and the nickel with the finish through two and one Beautiful offensive spacing by Virginia Tech Music Applause Checking back in for the Hookies Number five Patrick Music Applause Virginia Tech has made six of their last eight shots They have started redhot offensively built an eightpoint lead early eight minutes into it Music Shrewsbury lost the handle Ripped away Applause Music Padulla tried to squeeze it in Notre Dame got a hand on it but Padoula trying to win it right back And he does forced the foul This is going to be Virginia Tech ball The Hokes leading by their last seven games in large part to Marcus Burton but hes been a nonfactor early Yeah foul trouble early The early charge foul and then uh really not a good foul away from the ball away from the basket trying to get a steal against Badulla They can ill afford not to have him on the court As you said he is the leader of their offense leads them in assist and also the guy that makes them go offensively as the leading scorer So back into the game here trailing by eight and hes on the court with two fouls and a lot of time left in this first half Couture couldnt connect on that three Matt Zona getting extended minutes And thats another offensive foul on the screen Carrie Booth illegal screen there And thats the multiple times now in this game Moving screens Yeah Again youre moving into him Again you cannot lead with your shoulder Referee right there Thats an easy call You got to stand still when you set the screen again Anytime you lower that shoulder or move into the guy trying to come off to defend it pot nobody there and he slams it home Jay they may need to check the screws in that rim My goodness I mean he shook the whole basket on that one right there Booth answers with a triple Hes knocked down two from deep and they all been off of great ball movement again Impressive uh the response by this Notre Dame team Booth again with another three Booth with eight of the Irishs 15 Heres MJ Collins Right back to Poti He has been a problem in this first half Mal Poti making some impact plays Hawk Well check the screws on the rim My goodness Malijah Moi with the finish The whole basket was shaking after that one My goodness he is so powerful and he has been a big reason why theyve had success this season of that interior presence on both ends defensively and offensively 0 for two from the line there Notre Dame trailing by seven Burton kick out for Ims A three Got it Logan I his first basket of the afternoon and thats why its so important to have Burton in the game again Draw two kick it out I was ready to catch and shoot Another good offensive possession uh by Notre Dame where the ball was moving and thats something Michael Shrewsbury talked to us about before the game He needs to see more ball movement like that from this young team Yeah Burton comes back in and theres just a lot more rhythm offensively Here he is again Scoop to the hoop for two Marcus Burton And one of the things he talked about Burton when we asked him whats been the difference beginning of the season and now said things are slowing down for him Previous play go make a play for your teammate Right there understanding spacing and right now Notre Dame on a run Yeah the Irish with the momentum Theyve made their last three baskets since Burton has come back into this game Micah Strusberrys team on an eight nothing run and theyre right back in it down two And its their defense Thats something he talked about Yes offensively we have gotten better uh in this last seven to eight game stretch But he said defensively thats been the big thing that hes been impressed with with this Notre Dame team Great ball movement Lines up a three for Booth Miss fires in perfect position to clean up the spill Kebai And that might be their best offensive possession Uh yes they missed the shot at the end but the spacing excellent ball movement some of the best And then the offensive rebound put back Collins answers with a three Virginia Tech back on top for three Dont blink with either one of these teams The way theyre shooting and that three ends a 10 nothing Notre Dame run But Notre Dame has cashed in on their last four possessions Shot clock down to six Kebai back to Burton Step back three No good Robbie Baron a deep three Misfires Everything goes through Marcus Burton Good ball movement again on this possession for the Irish Burton got a good look from three Missed it Well both teams are getting quality looks off of excellent player and also ball movement Music This time a foul going against Virginia Tech Good back and forth game here in the ACC Virginia Tech a slim lead by three to secure a buy Obviously that means the less games they have to win to try to eventually win a ACC tournament championship But again at home and also lets not lose sight of the fact that this could potentially be the last uh time Hunter Couture plays in this building for Virginia Tech Yeah its only scheduled time I suppose they could accept an NIT invitation and hed get one more home game here but yeah theyre hoping they can go down to DC and win their way into the NCAA tournament Interestingly Joe Lonardi our ESPN brackettologist still has the Hokes in consideration on the bubble Burton took a lot of couture there Stepped back and knocked it down He is so tough so shifty And if youre a Notre Dame fan though you hold your breath on that play It looked like Couture was trying to pick up a charge but Burton again able to stay on balance and finish onreamed 14 on the other end A nice back door cut that time by Hunter Couture And again he draws so much attention Youre afraid of him sprinting off a down screen That time though he faked like he was coming off a screen went back door Again his movement without the ball is huge Great day for college basketball on ESPN and it continues with the Saturday Prime Sonic Blockbuster The best rivalry in the sport North Carolina and Duke 630 Eastern Who do you like See you throw me on the spot man I mean you know Im going to throw it back at you Who do you like I think Carolina gets the season sweep locks up the number one seed in the ACC tournament Ooh thats thats a tough one right there Ill tell you what uh at home Im always going to go with the home team So theres my answer Thatll be mustwatch 630 Eastern time on ESPN Julian Roer left alone in the corner and he makes the Hokes pay Well right now both teams over 40 Notre Dame right now five of 11 from the threepoint line All of them have been excellent looks Baron trying to spin his way free Rejected at the rim by Booth Notre Dame dialed in defensively Oh what a defensive play that time by Booth Thats just an individual going to make a play And another block on the other end Padulla with a head of steam He is so crafty Sean Padulla in transition He is able that time so fast and his ability though to finish uh in traffic again Thats twice now uh hes been able to knife through the defense and then finish Shrewberry on the drive off the window and in Thats an added part to the freshmans game Hes just continued to get better and the chemistry uh between him and Marcus Burton I tell you what those two are going to create havoc in years to come for the ACC Padoula again gets his way to the rim Sean Padulla starting to heat up Look Michael Shrewsbury thought it was an illegal screen on the dribble handoff Not happy the refs did not call that Shrewberry the coachs son Backto back buckets for him And Padulla and Shrewberry trading punches here Baron left alone for three That rims out no good And thats a break for Notre Dame Thats a wideopen look for Baron Roer Hes come off the bench and drilled two threes Time out Mike Young Notre Dame back in front for the first time since it was 2 nothing And the Irish shooting lights out 55 Blackburg Virginia Olsen is here to perform at his performance coming up in moment We welcome those joining us on ESPN You just watched some college hockey know what it takes to go down to the ACC tournament and win four games in four days Punch their ticket to the ACC tournament They did it two years ago Hunter Couture was the ACC tournament MVP that week And now can you believe it Two years later its the fifthear senior final game here inside Castle Coliseum He got a great ovation pregame and you know his teammates his head coach they want to send Couture out with a win on his final game on his home floor And our conversation with head coach Mike Young you know hes intense a day of game Uh we asked him though uh what its been like coaching Hunter Couture and hes softened right up Big smile on his face It has been an absolute pleasure for him Going to take some getting used to uh calling games without Hunter Couture in a Virginia Tech uniform And for Mike Young hes never gone through a practice without him His first snee when he took the job but he has delivered in his five years here for the Hokes Good ball movement Got a good look just couldnt finish it Robbie Baron keeps the possession alive Collins a three He buries it Two things in that play by Baron The offensive rebound and then uh that skip pass through traffic Uh what a possession for Baron that time A lot of guys would have tried to force that uh offensive rebound back up stayed patient and made a beautiful diagonal pass for an open three Offensive foul going the other way And thats the third foul on the freshman Carrie Booth in this first half Thats an easy one for the refs to call again in good position of that time lowered his shoulder and coach Drewberry talking to Boo who again future very bright for that young man hell learn but again thats a veteran right there baiting him into that offensive foul now this has been a fun first half all tied at 34 both teams shooting better than 50 from the floor nobody picked him up Shan Padulla hes got nine Thats just the breakdown in communication again Nobody just picked him up Looked like there was going to be a screen No screen He just kept going and nobody helped Applause Shrewberry draws the foul Son of the head coach Micah Shrewsbury Braden Shrewsbury will get two at the line And again right here again just a breakdown in communication Little false uh ball screen and Padulla just keeps going to the basket And Micah Shrewsbury has built this program since taking it over the first year head coach on defense The one thing that you can expect from Notre Dame game in and game out is them to be dialed in defensively Its a big reason why theyve won five of their last seven games So its surprising to see the Hokei shooting 54 already 36 points They have gotten better Again I had them early in the season midpoint and then now And thats what you want to see as a coach Future very bright Obviously their back court Shrewsbury and Burton Those two again are going to create a lot of problems in the ACC moving forward Uh but he was impressed as you said with their defense The defensive effort really has been key Offensive rebound Keeps the possession alive for the Hokes into Potit Boding up Keba Jai musling it Falls off the rim No good Good job that time by Jai just walling up against Potit Not giving ground and forcing him in to a tough little jump hook Tay Davis trying to spin his way free Shot clock down to 10 Roer into the lane Nice move Julian Roer fires Notre Dame back in front Put on a clinic with his footwork Reverse pivot spin and then go up with the soft touch and finish Excellent patient and then also key playing off of two feet Couture goes up with it Cant hit it Another offensive rebound Potit And hell get two at the line I mean Potit has such great size and strength He is so difficult to keep off the glass Does a great job positioning for offensive and defensive rebounds Thats now four offensive rebounds in this game for Elijah Poi Ties it at 37 The champ week continues tomorrow Three excellent womens basketball title games We tip off the day one Eastern with the ACC championship followed by the SEC Championship game and then finishing the day out west with the Pack 12 What a day for womens hoops And these two programs met in the semifinal on the womens side earlier today Virginia Tech and Notre Dame And it was all Irish So down goes the topseated Hokes That is a stunning result You know many would say okay Notre Dame could win but by 29 Wow Yeah anything can happen And again I think its going to be the same a lot of the same on the mens side as well too called the Virginia Jets Again on any given night any one of these teams uh can beat you uh by 30 or lose by 30 Uh again I think its going to be a very very competitive and wide openen ACC tournament Applause Back tied at 38 Well these teams theres just not much to separate them in this first half And really what Notre Dame has done a great job of spacing the floor Again we talked about their threepoint field goal shooting Both teams uh over 40 40 from the threepoint line Collins way off the mark from three Another offensive rebound though And heres Padulla Right back to Collins Cant connect the second time either And now Virginia Tech below 40 Those though are two pretty good looks Music Music Applause Traffic fading away Cant hit it And thats not the look that Coach Ruseberry wanted offensively right there Padoula splits two and it drops in plus the foul Shan Padulla stealing the headlines of this first half Well his ability to finish in transition Hes hit some tough shots through contact Look at this right here A little euro and then finish with the soft touch Sean Padulla and one second is 13 Young in a game that has been very balanced scoring Padulla leads all scorers with 11 and now make it 12 Virginia Tech nosing in front by three here at the end of the first half Music And a use it or lose it timeout taken by Micah Shrewsbury will take it with him The Irish as Shrewsbury has done in year one at the helm of Notre Dame Hes got a young team all underassman in the starting lineup but theyve won five of their last seven games and theyre battling here on the road down three Marcus Burton has been the catalyst to the winning ways Has the ball here Applause Shot clock down to seven Burton in attack mode to Julian Roer whos had a hot hand in this first half Fights his way to the rim Blocked by Baron Five seconds to work with to the corner Collins slams it home Onehanded jam and Virginia Tech ends the first half with a Notre Dame balance scoring four players with six points or more The Irish start on defense trailing by five And for all the attention on Hunter Couture who has the ball here lines up a three This fires it was Padulla and Collins that led the way Sometimes on senior day you you could start to press And I think though also dont discredit Notre Dames defense Look Hunter Couture Shawn Padulla theyre at the top of the scouting report Notre Dame guards did a good job closing out on Hunter Couture Applause And then also Couture spent a lot of energy chasing Martin Marcus Burton True Again he is their best defender Hunter Coutur So again spent a lot of energy on the defensive end as well in that first half Broken up and Davis lost the handle Itll be Virginia Tech ball Well actually Justin Porterfield and Bill Cington Jr going to come together here and rule that it stays the Irish way Somebody was going to be unhappy after that exchange and uh they rereversed it and gone back Ball now to Notre Dame Applause Music Shrewsbury lost the handle Podulla right to the rim off the window for two Sean Padulla Theyve been unable to really keep him out of the paint and then some of the shots hes hit have been tough That right there thats not an easy finish He made it look easy through two defenders high up off the glass Music Davis spinning his way in draws the foul Hell get two at the line You know we have to mention in the first half Virginia Tech playing without their primary big man Lynn Kid You see him there in sweats on the bench This was a surprise to us did not go through the shootound but we were told he was able to play but not playing in the first half And at halftime we were told no update on Kid from the Hokes communications department Well Ill tell you what uh obviously huge game as weve talked about as Davis knocks down the first free throw but Virginia Tech a chance to secure a buy in the ACC tournament uh in that uh first round So again important game uh for them Last regular season game uh for Virginia Tech A lot of implications prior to the ACC tournament Yeah Virginia Tech can finish as high as a seven seed headed into the ACC tournament as low as a 10 Notre Dame can finish as an 11 but they would need to win today and a lot would need to break their way So they are most likely locked into that 1213 game on Tuesday Tyler Nickel missed it Offensive rebound Meal Potit He has five offensive rebounds and then hammers it home Twohanded flush Meal Potit Thats just the grown man move right there again Strong lower body and upper body and then finish with authority help was too late Burton drains the deep three Much needed for the Irish ACC going to be on notice with that young man right there I mean he is one of the only freshman averaging 17 four assists and two steals in college basketball And that game right there that part of his game really improving the threepoint shooting Burton so shifty Backto back buckets for Marcus Burton And with that bucket he passes Troy Murphy for Notre Dames freshman scoring record Incredible achievement And Troy Murphy could flat out ball One of the alltime greats uh in Notre Dame history And Burton again I think his name when its all said and done is going to be in that discussion He is having an outstanding freshman campaign Couture five on the timer Gives it up for Collins A three No good Burton called for the travel there Took a step before he dribbled Well travel on that one But uh look at this right here Marcus Burke with the steel and then in transition he is a handful euro and then finish with the soft touch on that previous possession though the threepoint shooting as well too Again his game just continues to develop under coach Rubberry and their staff Couture trying to get hot Hes just been off the mark all afternoon long now One for six from three Very rare off day in this building for the programs alltime leading threepoint shooter 327 in his career but it has been all Shawn Padulla Everything but the finish there Perfect position Wesler follows it up for the Hokes Thats great work by Wesler again Padulla drawing two that time Call it three defenders Gets herself on the offensive glass Burton trying to split the double team Knocked away Padulla in transition Backto back missed layups for Padulla And Wesler battling How productive has he been off the bench today Patrick Wesler got the ball was fouled Impact plays like that one in a tight highly contested conference game in the East Carrington again another talented freshman guy thats going to play for a paycheck But me and you had a discussion on which one of those guys if you pull them off their team which team would struggle And I would say Notre Dame Obviously a completely different team without Marcus Burton Tough runner goes for Shawn Padulla He leads all scorers with 14 this afternoon Yeah Im with you Huck I think right now my vote headed towards Burton And Padulla continues his hot shooting 16 points now Left alone and hes fouled from behind by Wesler But Zona fell hard on the floor right on his back Foul task number five Thats his second team Lets hope hes okay And thats a good sign of Matt Zona able to get up Certainly that one painful So again hes trying to walk that one off again Hes provided them with some solid uh minutes And right here again path just open up Somebody trying to contest Again obviously basketball player right there just trying to come up with the block and the hard fall afterwards I think Wesler got the ball It was the body that the foul was called Now the fans are yelling loud here now Again theyre on student break but I believe theres some free bacon if theres two missed free throws Oh they could taste it Im supposed to be impartial on these games but Im going to tell you right now you start handing out some free bacon I might start making some noise Yeah Does it qualify for the broadcasters They say everybody in the building I said Hey if it qualifying for it I may under the table start kicking some chairs Both teams found themselves in a little bit of foul trouble in that first half Marcus Burton most notably picked up two early ones He stayed with two inside Wesler Burton stripped that cleanly You know Matt Zona with three fouls and Carrie Booth with three fouls as well for the Irish So you want to be aggressive defensively but you you can ill afford here on the road The fouls continue to pile up if youre Notre Dame And youre right Absolutely You want to play aggressive but you obviously cant have guys in foul trouble or as we get closer putting uh Virginia Tech in a bonus situation Padulla off the screen catch and shoot Missed it And Virginia Tech they are not shy from three They have attempted 22 threes in this game Theyve only made six of them And that previous one right there thats a clean look Again I think thats a breakth for Notre Dame Padulla and Couture both have had some pretty good looks from three Applause Burton finds Roer Julian Roer with 5 seconds on the shot clock Gives it to Burton who gets it to go acrobatic The freshman Marcus Burton continues to be terrific And the coaching staff wanted an and won This is going to stay Virginia Tech way Hokes leading by three And on that previous possession with Burton he never stopped moving Again a ball was stuck in the middle He just kept right into his cut moving without the ball And acrobatic finish Music Padulla pull up pop Cant stick it Great job of team blocking out that time Two bodies on Potique trying to keep him off the offensive glass Burton trying to go behind the back Lost the handle up to Couture Padoula wide open three way off the mark but he follows it up and puts it in Sean Padulla never gave up on the play and coach Rougeberry is hot again Nobody blocked him out He shot the ball He was wide open but then nobody uh put a body on him He just ran picked up his miss and laid it in uncontested Applause Applause 5 seconds to shoot Burton Kick to the corner A three Rimmed out No good You cant ask for a better look that time Shot clock winding down Padulla drives right into Logan Ims who commits the foul How about this All 61 Padulla from outside the arc follows it up Nobody blocks him out Cashes in And again this is why coach Shrewsbury he said Look little things like this young team that cannot happen in this game right here Uh youre trailing five 1248 to go Those little plays again talking to his young uh star freshman point guard Music Its bad enough when the smallest guy on the court gets a re rebound ever But when he starts outside the threepoint line thats borderline unacceptable if youre Micah Shrewberry Couture off his knee Turnover But for as good as Hunter Couture has been throughout his Hokes career fifthear senior has struggled on senior day Just one for seven from the floor five points Applause Roer working on Nickel trying to shake free and finally draws the foul Home fans dont like it And now Mike Young is hot again Felt his guy was just in good position Nickel felt it was a bailout And both coaches working these refs again right here Nickel No need to reach Julian Roers been a nice boost off the bench this afternoon Nine points for the junior Missed the second So a fourpoint lead for Virginia Tech Little more than 12 minutes left in regulation The Hokes trying to finish the regular season on a threegame winning streak Deep three Rims out No good Give and go Kebab Jai flies his way to the rim for two And give and go exactly to perfection Beautiful pass that time by Braden Shrewberry again Drew the defender over Pinpoint pass Soft touch with the finish at the end Nickel for three Got it Tyler Nickel buries a big three Again know your scouting report that time Again Nicholls trying to come off that little curl You have to be there on the catch or have better communication with the big step out heads Just cant let him get a clean look Applause I trying to create for himself Tough take Missed it Nicholl Hell get two at the line when we come back with Shawn Padulla and Marcus Burton out of this game the two leading scorers line of Duke to decide who will be the number one seed in the ACC tournament Look at RJ Davis He could be a unanimous ACC player of the year this season 18 20 plus point games Wow And credit Hubert Davis and their staff As you take a look at the ACC standings top seven We talked about whats on the line of this game uh tonight for Virginia Tech a chance to secure that uh first round buy at the ACC tournament But back to RJ Davis the year that he has had really youre right I mean it could be one of those deals where pretty much everybody is in agreement who the player of the year in the ACC is I think its obvious whos number one but boy two through 15 to round up the rest of the all ACC will be really tough to decipher Yeah it really is And again I always try to put a premium on where your team uh finishes but I think this year it becomes even more muddled because again there is a log jam uh in the middle and top half of the ACC standings Back door denied Young got a piece of it at the rim What a recovery uh by Young to break up what looked like a clear uncontested dunk Swiped away by Burton Up ahead Roer and Julian Roer hammers his home Didnt have to worry about someone getting a piece of that from behind that time Roer and easy to see why Marcus Burton close to three steals per game Hes got great anticipation He also picked up those two early fouls of the first five minutes of this game and hasnt committed a foul since Padulla show shooting over Burton Misfired there Davis on the drive draws the foul And Michael Shrewberry continuing to talk to the ref He feels like on some of the dribble handoffs the bigs of Virginia Tech are using their hips and legs to block off In particular Burton Burton is taking uh some hard hits every time uh the guards In particular Padulla is coming off one of their actions Music Applause Tay Davis in attack mode all the way to the rim and slams it home You cant attack the rim with any more authority than that right there Couple of those have gotten blocked He took all the guesswork out Im going to go and try to rip the rim off Big time finish And Virginia Tech playing without their primary rim protector Lynn Kid in this game And its allowed the Irish to get up in close Shawn Padulla continues to do his thing up to 20 points to lead the way for the Hokes One of the best scorers in the ACC Shawn Padulla His ability obviously to pull up from anywhere but then his finishes Nobody protecting the rim right now and Notre Dame getting layup and dunk after layup and dunk Again both teams theyre doing a great job screening We dont talk about that enough in games Uh right now both these teams in particular the bigs doing a great job freeing up guys coming off pin downs or off any dribble drives Padulla Hes had the hot hand all afternoon and it continues 22 points for Shawn Padulla Well they just cant keep him out of the paint I Hes just blown by guys and then finishing that one Probably the easiest one he had Some of them really difficult finishes Key thing is though for Notre Dame they got to try to contain the ball better And thats now four makes in a row for the Irish and all of them coming in the paint Another strong finish The Padulla Show trying to continue here in Blackburg here on senior day The fifth year senior at Castle Coliseum You take a look at his family Kathy and Rodney his fiance Khloe and you know how much he means to this program over his five years here but also how much this program means to the Couture family Yeah really a remarkable career You look at his numbers over 326 career threes over 148 games But I think the biggest thing and Mike Young talked about this of the type of young man he has become and always has been in terms of representing the Virginia Tech community I really enjoyed speaking with him this uh morning at Shootaround and will all always be remembered for those amazing four days in March in 2022 And boy theyd love to do it again And theyre a team especially with this back court of Padulla and Couture If they go down to DC DC and start making some shots anything is possible It is going to be a very very entertaining ACC tournament as it always is Collins shakes his way free Cant get it to go and is fouled Music Lunards number two Thats his third personal foul right now Again uh we talked a lot about Padulla but Collins has been solid uh for Virginia Tech 11 points three of six from the threepoint line and six rebounds Again doing a great job rebounding from that guard spot Applause And the Hokes are a perfect six for six from the foul line in this second half One of the best foul shooting teams in the country and a sevenpoint lead with under seven minutes to play trying to close out the regular season with a win here at Castle Coliseum It be a threegame win streak headed into the ACC tournament Burton somehow gets to the rim He is so crafty And thats the key word somehow A lot of times it looks like hes going to get really lost in the middle of the defense He finds a way through and you said it best Hes so shifty and able to finish in uh traffic Battling for the ball Collins and Burton Burton There was contact no call so itll be Hokes ball And one of the things Burton you have to be aware anytime you play against him hes going to be active in the passing lanes Look at this right here again uh passing lanes or anytime youre dribbling he is really aggressive trying to go after steals Couture tried to squeeze it in to Baron Miscommunication Everything going through Marcus Burton right now in attack mode Couldnt finish there to clean up the spill plus the foul Tay Davis he has had uh some moments in this game One dribble drive and finish And then this right here grown man offensive rebound put back That is just a relentless pos pursuit after the ball That time picking up the miss by Burton Now the level of effort on every rebound every loose ball every defensive possession right now for both of these teams you could argue both teams are playing their best basketball Certainly theyre playing their hardest basketball right now headed into the ACC tournament And those plays right there again those second chance opportunities loose ball opportunities Thats the difference between you going home or continuing to play That was halfway down from Nickel rimmed out Twopoint game under 530 to play Two teams desperate to finish the ACC regular season with a win Head into DC and postseason play with some confidence Burton spin cycle leaves it short That would have tied it at 66 Oh everything except the finish That right there might have been a little fatigue again Beautiful spin move Just short arm Nobody picks up Nickel whos had a very nice performance Hes up to 13 points on the afternoon Applause Shrewsbury Couture all over him Thats a tough take and the freshman delivers And this back court this freshman backcourt of Notre Dame their ability to break you down and then hit some tough shots That time Shrewsbury tough contested pullup in the lane All underassman on the floor right now for Micah Shrewberrys team Padulla a three off the mark No good Tapped out Collins He cant hit it Two really good looks and it falls right back to Badulla Maybe third times the charm here for Shawn Padulla Collins weaves his way through traffic A fourth possession here and Robbie Baron finally puts it home Notre Dames inability to secure the defensive rebound Now that could be the difference in this game Booth trying to quiet the crowd Misses it That feels like a big possession in this game Virginia Tech scores on one end Booth got a good look and couldnt finish it on the other 17 second chance points for Virginia Tech Baron too much on it Applause Burton lost the handle dives on it to keep it alive And now Tay Davis Baron all over him Davis stays with it and makes it a twopoint game Hes keeping them hanging around in this game with his work on the glass Key thing for Notre Dame now defensive rebounding Thats been an issue again 17 second chance points for Virginia Tech And 15 offensive rebounds for the Hokes Four on that one possession alone Couture launches into it Off the window and in Hunter Couture Applause Burton blowing by everybody Nobody picked up the freshman right to the rim for two He is so fast so shifty and these guys are playing on fumes right now Mike Young is going to get a timeout You could not ask for a better finish here in Blackburg Final game of the ACC regular season Two teams trading punch for punch Hunter Couture trying to close his Castle Coliseum career with be Jay Alter with you How about the two guards Marcus Burton and Shawn Padulla stealing the show Well we talked about the back courts of both these teams at the tip Shawn Padulla really what cant you say about his game Tough finishes in transition or in the half court And then on the other end Marcus Burton another phenomenal uh performance for the freshman Both these two guys have hit difficult runners and floaters in the lane through contact Its been an impressive performance by both Padulla and Virginia Tech clinging to a twopoint lead Little more than two minutes left in regulation The Hokes trying to improve as much as possible their ACC tournament seating with a win They could finish as high as seven This would mark three straight wins for Virginia Tech Foul off the ball Roer got tangled up with Hunter Couture And well step aside You dont want to miss this finish in Blackburg Twopoint game with two minutes left Fourth all afternoon long in the ACC Nothing Skyhigh Two teams playing with tons of passion And with two minutes left its a twopoint game Both Virginia Tech and Notre Dame desperate to win this game today They take some momentum with them into the ACC tournament in Washington DC For Virginia Tech since the calendar flipped to March when this sport matters most they have not lost a game Trying to make it three wins in a row headed into the ACC tournament with tips off Tuesday 2 Eastern time All three first round games on ACC Network Couture knocks them both down So its a twopossession game Hokes leading by four Its March a winner go home month and important game as weve talked about uh for Virginia Tech Last regular season home game for them Burton in trouble gives it up to Davis and he draws the foul Fouls on Virginia Tech Now Virginia Tech had a foul to give 62 and right here Yep Good call by the refs again Key thing positioning Uh theyre in great position again Hes still moving as the offensive player is trying to go to the basket Theyre a little late Fourth foul against Robbie Baron And with Lynn Kidd not playing today they dont have the front court depth they normally do Hand off for Burton Everything working through the freshman right now Lost the handle off his knee Big time defensive stop by Virginia Tech And thats the one area though with Burton Again turnovers Hes been better And weve talked with Coach Rubberry before the game about that the game slowing down for him But in that situation right there again have to be better with the ball have to have a better possession offensively And the Irish going fullcourt pressure here with a minute 33 left down four into Potit and hes immediately fouled shooting one and one Notre Dame does have three timeouts to work with down the stretch here Virginia Tech has two 34 on the season in conference play shooting 70 So the strategy for Notre Dame works out that time again and not a holding out for defense Theyre just going to put it looks like Potit on the free throw line Burton right to the basket lays it up and in and cuts the deficit in half Now if youre a Notre Dame dont want to get beat long Its there Theyre faceguarding everybody Couture picked up his dribble and Mike Young wisely takes a timeout Well take it with him A minute 10 remaining Final game of the ACC regular season And it comes to a fun finish to one timeout with a win The Hokes still alive for a possible seven seed in the ACC tournament They would clinch at worst the eight seed which would give them that buy through the first round Adjustments out of the timeout Notre Dame says All right were going to take the press off and were going to play See if our defense can hold up and get a stop One minute to play Heres Hunter Couture Final game in Castle Coliseum passes off Padoula Sean Padulla delivers again He has 26 points tonight And some of them off the degree the charge in terms of degree of difficulty and getting it done on the defensive end as well Padulla everywhere Weaving through everyone Sean Padulla he cant be stopped Micah Shrews really takes a timeout slams the ball right in front of the official Justin Porterfield Micah Struberry fired up Well I think a couple things Uh the turnover but then I think the lack of being able to control the ball uh in particular of Padulla and he is hot again team has been uh playing so much better uh in these last six or seven outings but unhappy again some of the no calls He felt like his team was not getting I think the bigger issue Shawn Padulla uh continues to live in the lane 28 points uh in this game and they really been unable to keep him uh out of the paint and when theyve tried to throw people at him you saw on that previous possession uh hes just slid around them that time the euroep finish Padulla the last three baskets for Virginia Tech He has taken over this game and given the Hokes a sixpoint lead 35 seconds remaining This is a critical possession for Notre Dame Game on the line for the Irish into Marcus Burton Spins his way free right to the rim for two And the fullcourt pressure comes Key thing right now again dont get beat long if youre Notre Dame Theres its there over the top Virginia Tech just not seen again Obviously dont want to turn it over Number three Marcus Burton Thats his fourth personal foul 19 foul MJ Collins to the line And thats Marcus Burtons fourth foul One more and hes out of the game Collins with the weight of the game on his shoulders to shoot one and one 84 in conference play from the free throw line and he missed it Virginia Tech has missed two front ends of the one and one down the stretch here Burton through three defenders draws the foul and everything for Notre Dame is going through the freshman Marcus Burton And heads up play again understanding time and score No need 221 seconds No need to come down and jack up a contested bad three Marcus Burton with his speed understands look theyve been unable to keep him out of the paint keep the pressure on and now youre at the free throw line with a chance to cut it to two And I think the big thing set your defense up Try to go for another steal If not obviously youre going to have to foul Rims out no good And a foul immediately comes in Committed by Booth And thats now his fourth And it sends MJ Collins back to the line this time shooting two Virginia Tech on the game 50 15 of 20 uh from the free throw line 75 Notre Dame 12 of 17 71 And if you came to ESPNU looking for South Carolina and Tennessee womens basketball well get you to the SEC tournament right after were done here in Blackburg Music Collins knocks it down An important free throw because now its a twop possession game Collins has done a little bit of everything in this game for Virginia Tech 14 points eight rebounds and four assists has played a complete game for Mike Young and Virginia Tech Under 20 seconds left for the Irish Burton takes it himself Tough take Good defense Somehow stays with it And a foul is called 10 seconds left So time not on Notre Dames side but Burton will head to the foul line Weve been talking about it all second half and throughout this game Whats at stake uh on the line for Virginia Tech A chance to secure that first round buy in the ACC tournament Applause Burton makes the front end of the one and one A chance to now make it a onepossession game again Missed it short Davis offensive rebound blocked by Baron and Tyler Nickel is fouled Taye Davis had a chance to make it a twopoint game but his layup at the rim rejected Missed opportunity right there by Davis who has been really good for Notre Dame in particular on the glass right here again Great work but then a great recovery to come up with that block And Taye Davis unable to convert Applause And Virginia Tech tested here in the regular season finale Notre Dame gave the Hokes everything they could handle but make it three straight wins for this Virginia Tech team undefeated in March And theyll go into the ACC tournament with plenty of momentum Well they did what they needed to do
