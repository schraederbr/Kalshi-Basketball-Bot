to NC State and firstear head coach Will Wade Kansas and NC State are here If youre looking for the end of Memphis Louisville that game is on ESPN News This game is underway Clarence Armstrong threw it up along with Roger and Tony Padilla And the Wolfpack in front of this packed house in Raleigh has the first possession They go to Cuadir Copeland their 66 point guard for an NC State team that has played a very difficult nonconference schedule doesnt have that signature win yet And Vin Allen Luben whos been red hot misses the first shot cheering Heres the JayHawk starting five Peterson for his fourth game with three transfers or two transfers and Trey White and Melvin Council Jr The bigs have been very good The freshman Tiller and the sophomore Flory Bedonga Now theyre going to force Peterson to read and react North Carolina State is going to blitz double every ball screen that Peterson is involved in Melvin Council Jr transfer from St Bonaventure Theyll be okay if he shoots it and not cheering Peterson and he misses the first one as Kansas commits the games first foul Thats in the scout report When you think about the way he plays council shoots around 35 from the field Theyre going to go under every ball screen Theyre going to contest late Him taking a jumper and not getting to the the rim is a win for NC State Undersized NC State team but boy can they shoot it Best threepoint shooting team of the ACC And Kansas has already picked up fouls on Bedonga and Peterson Maybe their two best players in the first minute and second Hey look this is gamesmanship That was not a foul in my opinion but Copeland with a great job of wrapping his leg around it getting the refs to buy in And what do you do to the best offensive player in the opposing team You attack them defensively Copeland over to Trey Hollerman Paul McNeel Copeland and Hollowman All big time shooters this year Williams and the North Carolina transfer Luben Here is Darien Williams An early paint touch That is a good decision AND A GREAT SIGN if youre in C State applause and cheering It has been a rough four game stretch for Williams Held under double figures in the last two The Wolfpack make it a point to get him an early look and an early basket cheering Now Peterson driving on Williams kicks it for three in and out for Trey White NC State a top 20 offense in the country so far scoring at just under 89 points per game against an elite Kansas defense Williams way off the mark for three and its off of Luben If youre a North Carolina State fan you love the fact that D will is being aggressive early only averaging 11 points per game over his last six And at times I am baffled KB when you see game logs where he attempts eight nine cheering or 10 shots per game That should be 16 17 18 shot attempts per game for the preseason ACC player of the year And last year he elevated his game against Kansas cheering Gets the rebound off the missed three by White Williams Copeland behind the back McNeel no good from three And here is Derek Peterson the 66 freshman out of Canton Ohio Sets up a three for Council whos just 6 for 28 from out there but has a big look early Got a chance to talk to Bill Self before the game about Council and hes like Hey one of the things I love about him at sometimes hes just lost in the rhythm and the flow of the game His decisionm could be better but I love the fact that he competes every possession Williams swings it Hollowman in and out Peterson taps the rebound to Williams Back inside to Luben Good hands by Peterson And then a foul Oh this is a big one if its on Bedonga And it is the second on Kansass big man in the first 254 Well thats good news for Will Wade who said last week that this has been what you would call a hostile takeover after the loss to Auburn He felt like his team wasnt playing as hard wasnt defending as hard as it needed to So he has kind of put the accelerator down and they played very well in the win over Liberty Wednesday giving up just 45 points And youre going to be in a big advantageous position now because Bedonga 15 point per game nine rebound a game player for Kansas Jay is on the bench early When you think about NC State obviously theyre talented Theres no doubt about their talent but talent doesnt always translate into chemistry and playing for one another And Will Wade has challenged that thesis multiple times Theyre coming off their best defensive performance against Liberty in their last game in which they absolutely demolished them defensively Councel feeling himself on another open look from three Heres Williams for the Wolfpack Pull up three No good Hell grab his own rebound Drive it Leave it short Williams has been aggressive Hes taken four shots as Council tries to go coast to coast and Tony Padilla got a foul in from behind It was Copeland on the body not McNeel with a block And Bill Selfs team will take free throws The winningest coach in Kansas history Say it again The winningest coach in Kansas history Surprised you listened to me Theres one per game And I got it out of the way laughter early Why do you want me to say it again cheering I just dont think theres a lot of coaches better than Bill Self in this game of basketball And when you win as many championships as hes won Big 12 titles regular season titles Big 12 tournaments the way he imprints himself on his teams at times Are there teams that are offensively challenged or defensively challenged Yes But the success is written he is one of the best to ever do it in the game of college basketball and his teams had to do it this year without Tarant Peterson for seven of the 10 games But he feels like that may help in the long run the way they played defensively without him as McNeel breaks a three NC State has started 0 for five from three Will Wades team the best threepoint shooting team in the ACC Kansas has the fifth best threepoint defense nationally States missed a couple of open looks Peterson yet to shoot it until now Thats a quick release and well off the mark Luben will let it bounce out of bounds Well if theyre blitzing Peterson on everything he has to give it up and give it back real quick Force the defense to rotate 44 early Foul trouble for Kansass Bunga here in Raleigh Well I think its a combination of Donovan Mitchell and Brandon Roy who used to play for the Portland Trailblazers and you know hasnt played basketball essentially in a month And I think in that Missouri game even though they won and he played decently in 23 minutes for 17 points I think a lot of his teammates deferred to him But I I I think this is a huge opportunity for Kansas to continue to grow what they do on an offensive side If he can continue to find his rhythm with the way other players have played it allows him to reach a higher ceiling ultimately Off the Williams miss Heres one of those players whos really stepped up Trey White in Petersons absence White second in scoring rebounding and assisting Beats Kansas in threepoint and free throw shooting Hes got the ball right now The transfer from Louisville and Illinois and USC Deari McDow off the bench into the corner A lot of threes from Councel early whos just a 19 shooter Copeland almost a little too hot to handle but Hollerman strokes it The first three for the Wolfpack cheering Trey Hollerman a 52 threepoint shooter in the early going cheering Heres Peterson guarded by the 66 Copelan 66 lead guards Luben in the switch White Council once again boy they are giving him all kinds of space and Councils hit two from three Well they said since he was a poor threepoint shooter he was going to have to poo it from the outside Copeland Motors into the paint Layup wont go And heres Peterson off his second rebound Yep Got the trail Give it back He does Councils fifth threepoint attempt of the game is in and out Kansas has taken eight shots Councils taken five Well you could take the shot but also you could take a couple of dribbles in and attack the rim Theres Luben and that will swirl home I cant tell you how big it is for Van Allen Luben that Floyd Binga is out with two fouls Bingo averaging 25 blocks per game Six in the nation Towel not close on a three That is well see Clarence Armstrong and Roger say its going to stay with Kansas Coming up next its not just Indiana and Kentucky Its Dicky V and Sir Charles and our friend Dave OBrien who will be getting hazard pay tonight This was a lifelong dream for Charles Barkley Hes talking about this for a while Wanted to call a game with Dicky V Theyre going to make it happen this year Indiana Kentucky the main event following our game You were with Dick last week at Kentucky and that was just the warmup for what will be one of the wildest shows in television this year It will be a fullon podcast while theres a basketball game going on at the same time which Im all for Its going to be awesome baby Peterson no he is 0 for two But you love the level of physicality NC State is applying to Darren Peterson He cant get to any of any any of his spots on the floor and they are blitzing him on every action making him make reads and being a passer not a shooter Matt Ael terrific freshman misses a three Ael freshman out of Baltimore coming off a good game in their blowout of Liberty in the paint Heres a touch for Bryson Tiller Thats too deep Able with a rebound I dont know if Kansas has taken a shot inside THE TANK LUBEN STOPS IT INSIDE OF TILLER leading to a Bill Self timeout Alman with what one heck of a pass You talk about a guy that is the ultimate competitor for this NC State team and also a guy that you you think about how he competed helped Michigan State to win the Big 10 by three games made the Elite 8 last season Just a progression with the Sparties from where he started to where he is now for the Whoop Marco Jackson on the floor for Kansas No Peterson right now but theyre used to that White leans in This is one thing that NC State emphasized and shoot around Do not let Trey White get you into foul trouble And you could see a little veteran savviness to force the foul Well hes telling his players you got music to be smart They emphasized multiple times today do not stick your hand in the cookie jar Trey White is so good at leaning his body into yours and creating contact Keep your hands outside and wide Keep it parallel from him and shy away from the contact But they got caught Peterson right hamstring How long does it take to feel 100 or feel close to it after a hamstring strain I mean it took me almost a whole year honestly Its something that lingers I went through it my rookie year in the NBA Obviously playing 82 games is different than playing 36 or 40 but still its something that never really goes away You have to treat it and the only thing that truly heals it is time and therapy Allan Breed in the corner pushes a three too strong Just let me say this K All the people at home that think that this kid doesnt want to play basketball when you think about Darren Peterson they dont know what theyre talking about He wants to compete He wants to be on the court but like anybody you got to make smart decisions around your future and you dont want to tear something Holland short on a three Look you understand why people see a potential number one pick miss a month theyre not sure what the timeline is and people start to ask questions Bill Self has emphasized as theres a fallen need Hes emphasized it in public Hes emphasized it in private Like this kid is doing everything he can Hes getting as many treatment sessions as he can per day He wants to play He was also sick last week He wants to play badly This is they dont think of Kansas at all a situation where a kid sees guaranteed money in the NBA and says Im going to shut it down They believe Darren Petersons going to be a huge part of the rest of the year He just has to get healthy Let me tell you the mindset of a kid who would shut it down He wouldnt be on the road trips with his team when he wasnt playing cheering on his teammates from the sideline Like he is engaged He is a teammate And Ive seen a lot of kids who are not engaged or players who dont want anything to do with it because its all about the money Thats not Darren Pearson Heres JayHawks down making sure you can double your impact Theyre matching up to 1 million in donations during VW week And again that was the link vorgdonate Hollowman short out of three I dont know why Matt Ael flared out for a three He had an easy rim for a dunk NC State now one for 10 from three and winning Trey White He misses a three Paul Embia cant get the rebound Kansas is now two of 15 from the field and 11 of the 15 shots or threes They have one shot let me say it again louder one shot in the paint At some point you have to start attacking those gaps get to the free throw line see the ball go in Is it something NC States doing or are they just not showing the aggression they should be showing Well theyre recovering late to Melvin Council They want him to shoot that Thats playing into what they want Heres a look in the paint and Trey White scores it You know thats the thing for Kansas sometimes offensively They get stuck Guys like Melvin Countson Darren Peterson Trey White are the guys that have to put their head down and find a way to attack to get to the rim Oakland and Luben at the scores table for NC State Heres Hollowman Allen Breed sixyear player came over from McNiss with Will Wade and he gets fouled on the drive applause First shot foul coming Watch straight right Thats a great job Defenses kind of overcommit one way and drives against the grain finding a way to finish strong at the rim A team high 20 points and a season music high 13 rebounds last game second double double in his last four games And like we talked about earlier KB Trey White finding his way offensively Council finding more shots Bingga obviously being out right now with two fouls Hes gotten it going offensively earlier before All these are pieces that have had to rise with their level of play considering Darren Peterson is not on the floor Flora has been out since the 1706 mark Trey White will get a breather as well Peterson returns for Kansas Darren Peterson number two freshman in the country ranked only behind AJ Debants of BYU in the recruiting rankings He has yet to score in this game in seven minutes Hes 0 for two Peterson guarded by the sixyear Allen Breed and switched off to Williams NC State will switch everything Theyre comfortable with Van Allen Luben switching on the guards Tough shot Its short and its out of bounds as Cole Rosario crashed in Just a tough tough shot for Malaw Floating away from the basket floating out of bounds off of one leg A runner Thats not the shot you want offensively And McDows going to take a seat Jaden Dawson who only played the final minute of the game last game is in Can you tell I know a bad shot when I see one from somebody whos been subbed out a lot after taking those bad shots Well I I saw a picture of a brick next to the NC State pep band today and I had to take a selfie with it because that summed up my entire career I was going to say I didnt shoot a lot of bricks in this building Vladier Copeland short We forgot you played in this building even though you probably shot about 80 All right great Got a chance to see Kale Wilson play A talented player Mark Pope hasnt found a way to get his team over the hump but still another huge opportunity against Indiana this evening Well weve had a significant development in this game That foul is on Darren Peterson Hes going to stay in but hes got two So Bunga is out with two Tougher to play their big man Peterson will remain in the game with two more fouls than points They got to give NC State a lot of credit Theyve taken Peterson out of the game Theyre blitzing him on everything and he only has two shot attempts thus far Allen Breed now Luben comes out Theres the blitz in the double team He has to get rid of it NC State recovers well into the FRESHMAN AND BEIA DENIED BY Luben and Beia gets it back cheering Shot clock hasnt reset He puts it off the rim No good The freshman who was originally headed to NC State before recommitting to Kansas Colombia Ruben only has three blocks in 254 minutes Thats his fourth block of the season Copeland strength Rosario biting him up on the post attempt Gets it back and finishes through traffic What a finish Six Cole Rosario Acrobatic left hand lay Didnt score a point Played just three minutes on Saturday Thats the matchup Kansas is going to switch post up Top misses a three NC State 1 for1 from three and then Paris Arsenal takes away the ball from behind Now Copeland long steps through THE LANE FINISHES AND gets fouled cheering The chattiest man on the court hyping up his team and his fan base with a threepoint lead Careerhigh 28 points versus Texas 22 points versus Auburn Will we Wade said hes like the dog of our team Hes the closest thing we have to a fulltime dog And when you get a chance to talk to Copeland he likes to yap He likes to talk He loses himself in the fight of the game Bill selfdein foul was taken away Changed to Jaden Dawson Heres the play that was originally called a foul on Peterson You can see Dawson right there Number one undercut Copeland Thats why Bill Self was mad Kansas bench realized that Peterson had two fouls because the foul going to break was called on Dawson as Copeland averts a threepoint play The Kansas bench probably thought Wait why is that Dawsons first He should have another And thats why the game was stopped for review Well Im sure Kansas is elated that Darren Peterson didnt get a second foul As Im watching the replay Im like Can he see Manu ball Please step in and take a charge cheering still goes to show you the level of improvement that Darren Peterson can have on the defensive end You look at his size his frame Theres no doubt about it He is an elite gifted scorer one of the best that Bill Self has ever seen but still his basketball IQ on the defensive end and other smaller things will naturally progress the more he continues to put in the time and effort around the game NC State has shut him down so far WAC leading by four Kansas is four of 20 two of 11 from three NC State five of 20 one of 11 from three Peterson again out of the double team Council all alone hits his third three of the game Hey look everybody has a plan until you get punched in the mouth The plan is to let Melvin Council shoot the ball Hes made three shot attempts but still if youre just playing a game of odds you like your odds if Melvin Council has to drop 30 tonight in order for him to beat your team Luben from Williams block to block for the slam And Ben Allen Lubens got an early eight cheering Alingo on the court but now Luben is going to have a lot of shots at the rim that will not be contested And you wonder boy how is Luben going to handle the size of Kansas Well handled it easier because Bedonga got two fouls in three minutes Bryson Tiller has not scored Thats a wild shot in the lane Heres Copeland NC State has led pretty much the whole way Up three now with seven to play in the first half Wack looking for that big signature nonconference win against this tough schedule Copeland crossing Terrence Arseno No good Are these good looks NC States getting from three Its good looks both teams are getting from the outside but none of them are making shots at a high cliff Council batted around to Luben whos got eight and six right now I mean theyre one for 12 And this is a guy that needs to get going not just offensively but his ability to facilitate plays He should be doing a lot more stuff like this operating out of the post against a smaller guard Williams will screen for McNeel Get it back Hes all alone He misses another wideopen three Heres White in transition Tied up by McNeel Good defense and a jump ball will stay with the Jay Hawks Well Troy White just brought the ball right to the defender and McNeel You brought the ball right to him If anything keep that ball on the side of your body use your left shoulder and create contact trying to get to the rim But great hands by McNeil Jr to get in there and to draw up the jump ball J NC States coming off a game where they allowed their fewest points in 11 years 8545 against Liberty And Will basically said Yeah we were good We got to be massively better though against Kansas as Peterson finally gets going And thats a bucket But Will has to be thrilled It took 14 minutes for that guy to get on the scoreboard And by the way think about the degree of difficulty with that shot He wasnt on balance He was fading out of bounds Like those are the type of possessions where even though hes so gifted hes going to score but you want those low percentage shots for him at NC State Williams Bungas back on the floor now with those two fouls and Williams banks it in over him Theres a part of Will Wade where I am sure it could be frustrating because you want D will to be aggressive They are a different team when he hunts his shot White That shots goalended by Copelan 2120 as we go back to the Peterson basket A guy just averaging 20 points per game You see him coming off this little pin down here He makes a read attacks that body but still tries to draw the contact Still a very tough shot but hes so gifted he can make it look easy Hollerman feeds Williams This is where I think he needs to take his time Draw the double team Methodically work your defender down Didnt get a double team and then took a wild fade away One more dribble there for you I think you could just keep working him down on the block Councel again COUNCEL HAS HIT FOUR THREES He was five for 27 on the season and he has shot Kansas into the lead Hes got 13 of their 23 as Copeland spins to tie it at the other end cheering Peterson back from council Got it quickly Got it in the air and missed a three Tiller taps it to Hollowman Trey Hollerman Hes got a chance to shoot And it feels like were at the Y doesnt it cheering Peterson into the body of Copelan who was all over And then Copeland picks up his second foul said coming into the game Melvin Council was shooting 19 from the threepoint line But the beautiful thing about shooters they have no conscience And this is what I was talking about before for guys like Copeland and Williams to back down their opposing defenders be methodical in their action make reads off that And a lot of times with their size and their frame theyll find themselves at the rim with point blank shot attempts Copen leaves the floor with those two fouls Peterson gets it into Bedonga Williams against Peterson now Leans in and Peterson buries it from nearly the same spot 2523 Kansas which has trailed pretty much the whole game with a couple of leads on the last two possessions Petersons got four Hollands got a big tiller on him Luben Paul McNeel not scored it yet Very methodical possession for State Got away with the walk there He sure did Hangs in the air Misses wildly Its as good as a walk Kansas is clamped down defensively and hit some shots Well if you want to know why Darren Peterson has a chance to be the first pick in NBA draft this is a pro move This is why you call him a baby Donovan Mitchell or Brandon Roy Look at the way he dips his left shoulder into his opponent Dips his shoulder into him Creates some space Woo That thing is smooth cheering Thank you Tom Green I mean that thats exactly what we were talking about One of the leagues and nations best shot blockers is not in the game and NC State shouldnt settle for taking contested threes They should punish them down low on the block with the likes of Copeland and Williams every possession Petersons going to get to the lane now to the line He just hit a couple of jumpers from that right side of the lane Hell shoot his first two free throws of the game with a foul to first on Vin Allen Lub You know when he figures it out its going to be even scarier Right now hes only averaging around 37 free throw attempts per game For a guy whos able to have the athleticism and that frame that he has he should be going to the free throw line seven to eight times per game He should be getting nine to 10 points a night from the free throw line Thats a point there Goes one for two Top five NBA prospects right now are all freshman You are one of many Lets talk about what a special freshman class we have in college basketball this year AJ Debasa put out a show at the Garden Tuesday as McNeel misses a three Rebound to Floronga But this kid to you as as high a ceiling as anybody in the group do you think Darren Peterson Yeah I may say Cameron Boozer I may say Cameron Boozer cheering just because I I think his game he could play inside out He could do it a variety of ways AJ Debons obviously in that category Kingston Flemings from Houston in that category Theres a lot of big time talent out there Darren Peterson is special but I I need to see him do a lot more than being just an elite shooter Considering this is my first time watching it in person theres no doubt about the talent level I just want to see it translate cuz right now NC States doing a hell of a job Oliver misses the three NC State cannot hit from deep One for 16 from cheering three White feeds the post and Tiller Largest lead for Kansas cheering White driving it into Williams hands off Badonga who stuffs it home Will Wade takes timeout The Jay Hawks have scored the last seven and extend their largest lead back in 30 to Raleigh Like in order for them to reach their ceiling who are the people that can make their game easy for everybody else Thats Trey White and thats Melvin Council Jr Theyve got NC State in a scoring drought right now Hollerman snaps it as a scoring drought of about three minutes Five for Trey Hollerman cheering NC State which has been inconsistent defensively this year played so well much of this first half but hasnt hit a shot So Kansas kept hanging around hanging around And now the JayHawks are hot Tiller swings it to Council Why not Got a careerhigh tying four threes He cant hit a fifth The one thing you like about Melvin Kelson Jr hes going to keep shooting it He doesnt care what his shooting percentage is what anybody says Theres no doubt hes a firm believer in his own ability McNeel ANOTHER GOOD LOOK AND FINALLY a threepointer goes for NC State cheering First made three in 14 minutes of game time cheering cheering Heres Peterson in the final minute of the half Not close cheering Seventh straight for Kansas Copeland McNeel Almost eight straight for NC State WILLIAMS CLEANS IT UP AND HE TIES THE GAME MATCHING THE 70 run of the Jay Hawks A great job by Van Allen moving cheering keeping that ball alive getting it back up on the rim What a fun finish to the first half Game that was pretty sleepy for about 17 minutes cheering and has awoken dramatically in the last three Council leading the way with 13 White bricks cheering it Williams will hoist at the end of the half Thats Wide Whites And we are right back where we started All tied 70 run Kansas ball game considering theyre shooting poorly from the threepoint line Petersons lowest scoring first half the season Kansass lowest scoring first half NC States lowest scoring first half So a great defensive team in Kansas and a team thats coming off a great defensive game in NC State Their defenses have been the story as Cadur Copeland misses at the rim in this 3030 tie Something very fascinating I saw during the break Darren Peterson did not warm up with the team He came out with the the gun and then he got stretched for about six minutes So Im curious how he approaches the beginning of the second half Well maybe he doesnt need to stretch Maybe he should do more stretching That seemed very easy Just the gunned it right into the hoop on the pass from Beda whos been a great passer by the way this year Flory Bedonga Two assists a game Kansas the first bucket of the half Williams with a high arcing shot That wont go Hes been much more aggressive Thats the good news Jay Well the bad news hes only three for 10 Heres Tiller into beda right through his hands for NC State The shots Williams getting are they good looks Well they took 23 per perimeter shots in the first half 18 of of them were threes and 16 were contested Not the reason why they had the worst shooting half of the season for the Wolfpack McNeel Williams Luben from the backside Peterson took it away Almost lost it Ahead to Council White all alone for three No good Is anybody going to get out there and at least try to contest it and run after it late Kansas is not having a great shooting night either Four for 19 from three NC State two for 19 Dont give it out You attack him Hollerman will hit it anyway Im okay with Hollerman taking that three but if youre Van Allen Luben and you have Darren Peterson on you down low on the block you attack him cheering Peterson gets it from Tiller Quick swing to White Badonga is inside Missed most of the first half with foul trouble They were plus 10 in his minutes though Councel off the rim Bedunga mist timed his jump NC State led by Hollowin and Luben with eight Williams try to join them with a bucket Instead its knocked out of bounds Now watch this back door cut by Darren Peterson This isnt a hard cut Hes not sprinting at full speed You just need to have better defense if youre Copeland Got caught standing up not seeing ball you man And then youre seeing the defense in the other end by Darren Peterson coming over from the weak side for the big block and pushing the ball in transition I mean he can do so many different things but if youre NC State you got to bring that same tenacity you had on the defensive end to start the game where everybody was down in the stance and it seemed like they were playing with passion and vigor music fouled against council First of the half This is first of the game NC State by a point McNeel curls and gets fouled from three A three shot foul will send Paul McNeel Jr to the line Couple of great womens basketball matchups for you tomorrow afternoon in the inaugural Sprouts Farmers Market ESPN Invitational This used to be a big time Big 12 matchup Baylor and Texas Number 13 number two on ABC followed by third rank South Carolina against Penn State over on ESPN Two of the top three teams in the country in action tomorrow afternoon Foul was Trey Whites first McNeel 88 free throw shooter misses the first one deep You know Kevin when I think about the ACC I think Duke and Louisville are in a class of their own I think North Carolina is right there And depending upon the pattern of behavior you see from NC State starting mostly on the defensive end if they play with a sense of urgency the way they played against Liberty if theyre able to find that energy here in the second half and play that way consistently I think they can crack that North Carolina State to be up there in a second tier McNeil just one for three Luben cleans it cheering up and makes it a threepoint possession Anyway real quick you think Virginia can be in that category too I think Virginia can find themselves in that category as well Much much better ACC top to bottom this year NC State didnt even make the ACC tournament a year ago A revamp roster a new coach new life here in Raleigh Peterson open Cant do that if youre NC State Darren Peterson hits his first three and he is in the double figures is a fabulous freshman for the fourth straight gain to begin his career McNeel step back jumper No good This is one for seven and one for three at the line White too hot to handle for Beduga and a Kansas turnover Now pay attention to D will in this highlight He just loses Peterson here Theyre going to All right cross McNeels on him now Nobodys watching him Hey theyre pointing Nobodys paying attention to where hes at You have to keep an eye on the most elite scoreer on the floor No recognition defensively Everybody caught ball staring twice thats happened against Peterson in the half Hollerman Copeland will drive it Get cut off by Bunga Peterson knocked it away Its on the deck NC State has the arrow and will maintain possession on the jump Got to love how active the hands are for Kansas You see why they have one of the most elite perimeter defensive units in college basketball Everybodys hands are trying to pick the pot Theyre active Theyre blinding contesting Theyre all over the place defensively Its actually going to be Kansas ball So I guess the arrow was reversed there and Kansas had arrow Thats the third turnover committed or just the second committed by NC State in the game Peterson gets fouled by the freshman Matt Ael He just came into the game and Ael picks up his third foul immediately By the way you see the black eye for Ael which was inadvertent friendly fire I guess theres no such thing as friendly fire thats not inadvertent from Ben Allen Luben during a practice NC States had some harder practices Will Wade tells us in the last week plus I think he has a chance to be a star The highest ranked Snee at NC State since Dennis Smith Jr Council three Yeah stopping ball That was deflected Its going to stay with NC State Eventually music somebody stopped the ball NC State by a point I lost my uncle Chuck He passed away from leukemia Uh my aunt my other cousin conquered breast cancer Its something that touches us all And the only way we can beat it is to work together as one collective unit and the work that the V Foundation and other folks have done help work toward a cure help find life saving life affirming treatment for so many invaluable So again its vorgdonate Every bit helps The most important thing we do here at ESPN Peterson gets loose for the third time this half Hes gotten three from the NC State defense and all of a sudden hes up to 13 Well if youre late to get your hands up to contest and what I mean by contest is music not like a halfass contest Im talking about your hands are in his face deterring his vision Hes going to see the basket And if he sees the basket thats going to be a green light for a shot for him Williams too strong A lot of one and done in this game 56 missed shots only 10 offensive rebounds Bad got turned away by Luben Hes got a couple of blocks today Copeland attacking Of course the weird angle there And then he throws it away His third turnover And theres Darien Williams who landed hard First year Wolfpack man grimacing and on his feet It didnt land that hard Just seemed to land awkwardly Yeah you hope hes okay Obviously Darren Williams one of those guys that is shifty and can maneuver his body to get to different points on the floor but a lot of his power comes from those legs and its something that sustains him throughout the course of a game Hes on the bench right now 3836 Kansas Peterson has all eight JayHawk points in the second half Badunga double team stuffs it through Flory Bedonga with a ferocious finish Peterson watching from the end of the bench But the gun working on his hamstrings again as JayHawks lead by four Hollerman driving Tough finish Nearly tipped in but Dougs got the rebound Heres Council for Kansas Councel McDow White Trey White had one more kick out Copeland trying to cross his way past Badonga Tiller came over the helpside block And what an advantage it has for the team that ranks 16th in the country and block shots per game cheering Kansas is really ugly this game up Pretty ugly right now Its a 100 run on a burst through the lane by Council whos got 15 Tiller and Bodinga just being patient not biting on the ball fakes of Copeland staying defensively disciplined which allowed him to get the block You love that with your Twin Towers Usually its teams trying to ugly it up against Kansas Copelan with those long levers gets it to go Well just think about that What a shot by Copeland But the degree of difficulty is off the charts And then Kansas pushes Tempo the other way Gets an easy bucket from White and reextends the lead to six This stripe out crowd has been silenced the first seven minutes of the half This doesnt feel like the ball is moving a lot for NC State Its sticking a lot Copeland into two again trying to push off McDow Finds Abel too deep from three Arsenal the rebound Hollerman shot ready off the mark and its going to be NC State ball and they are not getting good looks and Kansas is When you think about Flory Bodunga right here a lot of times you hate when big guys bring the ball low but what agility off that move to finish with the left hand Having a breakout sophomore season averaging 15 points per game nine rebounds you know defensively hes so elite but the more you continue you see him blossom offensively it just shows you the full entire package Last year he scored double figures five out of 34 this year double figures and nine out of 10 And this is what I mean I mean the shot goes in and its a big time shot by Helman but the ball doesnt have energy like it had in the first half How much of that is something Kansas is doing defensively cheering I think thats more NC State than KU Within three Peterson back in for Kansas And White turns it over Copen looking double dribbled it He knew it He thought Hollerman was going to slip towards the basket but Hollerman flared out Had the right intent but just not the right read Just the fourth turnover committed by NC State They dont turn it over much And Kansas doesnt turn you over much but the JayHawks have just forced a lot of tough shots Threepoint lead on the road under 12 to play on this great college basketball Saturday in mid December Great triple header coming up after our games as Badunga turns it right back over Really great instance right there by Matt Able to read that skip pass Get a hand in that passing lane to get the steal Copeland to the basket Makes it a onepoint game cheering Now theres a little roar here in Raleigh cheering Able again nearly intercepted another Well look second half with eight points getting himself going getting the defensive block from the weak side and then NC State losing him in the half court hands always ready knocking down shots and then a slow closeout will translate to a green light for Darren music Peterson Hes a guy that gets the offense going by making the right reads within the offensive system and theres no doubt about it hes been finding his rhythm in the second half Self said Saturday he was trying to fit in He said I told Darren Let it come to you But I dont think hes a let it come to me type of guy Do you feel hes let the game come to him a little more today I do but Kobe Bryant told me the best line Dont ever fit in fit out Be yourself And Mountain Council Jr is being himself man I dont think he is cuz he was 27 from three coming in Hes five for 11 Hes being somebody else The Council of JayHawk threes And Melvin leads by Kansas leads by four Feels like Melvin leads by four Hes got a careerhigh five Allan Breed meanwhile thats the first field goal off the bench for an NC State player tonight cheering An unlikely answer at Kansass lead back down to one Heres Peterson Re gets into him Peterson driving jump stop and too strong Two JayHawks are there Petersons put back No Badonga with a third chance in the finish I mean how many hands and arms did you see above the rim with blue jerseys constantly keeping that ball alive Second third fourth fifth efforts is what wins games Just a second second chance basket for Kansas and Copeland gets to the line Hey we are two minutes away from the Heisman Trophy ceremony for those of you who are split screen folks 91st annual ceremony Fernando Mendoza of Indiana Diego Pavia of Vanderbilt Julian Sand of Ohio State three quarterback finalists then Notre Dame running back Jeremiah Love That is just two minutes away over on ABC and the ESPN app Who you giving it to I think its really close between the two guys in the middle Mendoza and Pavia Yep Two great football powerhouse schools Indiana and Vanderbilt Uh I would go with Mendoza Very very close I mean the fact that Indiana and Vanderbilt are on this graphic is almost unbelievable Those two have had extraordinary seasons I would slightly go Mendoza but I think Pav is a great choice too Yeah I think Ill probably go Mendoza Both my mom and my dad graduated from the Ohio State as they have properly trained me to say since birth And watching that first hit he took in that game to come back and play the way he did against Ohio State that was one heck of a performance Fowler will be hosting it for the 32nd time by the way and well find out who takes home the hardware cheering in a little bit 4948 Theres Peterson again from McDow Hes got 10 in the second half and 15 in the game Well McDow got bailed out right there He left his feet for a pass Peterson recognized that instead of cutting through came back for a little back cut Smart play by Darren Peterson Copelan C State without Darien Williams now for the last several minutes after he landed hard on his legs and has left the game Copeland nowhere to go there Council with a steal Rare transition opportunity for Kansas Council may have traveled Peterson no good on the layup Medas on the deck and its ripped away by Breed And Breed may have pushed off Jackson a little bit Able three Got it We are tied cheering cheering McDow cheering No Heres applause cheering Copelan What a pass HOW DID HE ROLL IT IN THERE cheering Go ahead Oak Tuck What a game we got here man NC State Kansas Pretty cheering good appetizer for IU Kentucky And then by the way Arizona Alabama Gonzaga UCLA after that cheering twopoint game here in Raleigh Peterson has had a monster second half with a dozen and he reties it This has been number one freshman in the country type stuff Hes in the conversation and hes got 17 and that hamstring still far from 100 Copelan behind the back and then Luben fouls Bedonga who landed hard and gets helped to his feet 5353 Oh watch the poise the patience A little head fake off the chair Hes the last one out of the chair at the end of every break Hes been applying that thera gun to his legs to his hamstrings well at every single timeout I mean the discipline the consistency You have never seen a player a gun so much as Darren Peterson does Not only every timeout when it came out before the game he the gunned and during the entire half instead of actually warming up before the second half started he the gunned and stretched trying everything in his interest to keep the mobility and to keep the rhythm of what his legs provide on the basketball court And its working out Hes got a dozen in the second half 17 in the game Trey White no good on a three Long rebound is tracked down by Badunga his eighth of the game Starting five out there for Kansas which has all but two points from its starter as Hollowan hooks Peterson Thats the third foul on NC State And thats a nice iteration for Petersons game I think catching the ball on that extended wing music clearing out of side and backing down his opponent considering he has that height advantage whenever Hollowmans on him By the way Darien Williams is back in the game He missed 7 minutes music 35 seconds of game time for NC State They just need him on the court down the stretch When its just Copeland hes the only person facilitating the offense trying to score but also being a deliberate passer cheering Now with having Williams back on the court it gives you two offensive options to run a lot of action for Williams is three of 11 in the game 0 for four from three but their leading score at 16 a game on the year Council attacking again Thats a tough shot And it will roll home to 20point game A new season high for Melvin Council Jr I told you the numbers may not say thats who he is but thats who Melvin Council believes who he is From the great city of Rochester New York Shout out to all the folks up in Rochester as council and Kansas will take it over off a travel They go over the music top of the screen He recognizes that Changes speeds Actually gets bumped right there Could make a case that was an ammo one Bill Self said earlier in the week does he know what hes doing all the time Maybe not But he plays 38 minutes He guards the other teams best player And I tell him every day gosh man Im glad we got you Feels like hes been their MVP the first 10 games Reminds him a lot of Tashan Taylor Yes Great comparison to have when youre playing KU Blue Six to shoot Theres Council again Another tough shot Tried to draw the contact and its out of bounds on the line to NC State cheering Final 607 Whats critical for NC State offensively Well I think they need to get the defense moving from side to side get some dribble kick outs and you have to think that would start with Copeland and with Williams considering theyre such great distributors but also they can be elite offensive options for themselves at the rim Copeland has scored or assisted on the last 12 NC State points Give me give them the ball right there Williams head against counsel that mismatch Didnt touch it Breed swings it Hollow man No And Luben just takes away the rebound Drives his body into council Missed it Tapped out Copelan One dribble Sets up Reed No good Rebound highpointed and one by Kansas as Jackson who may have traveled cheering High quality shots for North Carolina State Not able to knock him down 520 to go twopoint game White and no Peterson on the floor right now for Kansas White out of bounds to Wolfpack applause And with Peterson out this is the unit that struggles offensively That needs to come from council or Trey White But this is where if I were NC State I would get Copeland or Daren Williams on the block play inside out instead of settling for jumper after jumper 28 of their 59 shots have been from three Theyve only hit six So this is the post up in my opinion Right now hes got it He got to clear out John Jackson sets up Breed to tie the game He got something else out of that mismatch And its 55 all cheering Councel cut off by Breed cheering Jackson around Copelan Jackson kicks it Councel hits it His six three of the game They have dared him to shoot and he has delivered time and again 5855 Lubman wants it again Again guarded by the 63 Jackson They dont get it to him Williams now no height advantage here against Tiller Rips it through Luben squeezes it home Great job by Luben going into the body of Adena forcing him to react almost causing some shock and then lifting up quickly to get the ball over the front of the rim 14 and N for Luben Eight straight game in double figures Under four to play No Peterson right now for Kansas Tiller three That will not go Thats not his shot He hasnt hit a three in over a month Copeland spinama GOT IT screaming HE SMACKS THE floor with a onepoint lead cheering cheering Melvin Council gave Kansas the lead a couple of possessions ago It is 63 An unlikely source of threes on one end Cuadir Copeland doing everything for NC State on the other What a finish weve got Down to wire This is everything you love about college basketball Two great programs with a lot of history and it will come down to these star players Darren Peterson Padier Copelan and Darren Williams Can they make plays down the stretch for their respective units Foul against Adam Breen NC States got plenty to give coming up in college basketball Weve got 5958 Peterson inbounds to Flory Bedonga with three minutes to play A back and forth game Two teams looking for a massive nonconference win Peterson trapped lost his dribble got it to El Marco Jackson Five to shoot here Its been Councils NIGHT AND HE SHOT PUTS IT IN His 73 a career 27 threepoint shooter has gone absolutely berserk and 26 points tonight Just made of nails If anybody wants the ball down the stretch I told you earlier Council Jr does Copeland Hollowman quick release couldnt answer and Bunga with a strong rebound His ninth of the game Council Jr and Kansas not a timeout Its Peterson with an issue now Oh this is really terrible to see with 215 to go Peterson was out of the game for about four minutes working on the hamstrings and he has to take a seat in a twopoint game with 215 left music Obviously a huge loss for Kansas guy Obviously 20 points per game Whatever KU fan is worried about When you have hamstring issues those things tighten up on you You try to stay as hydrated as possible We made mention of the fact that every break he was the gunning himself Hes been getting stretched doing everything in his ability to stay on the court just not able to close it out tonight Probably in a game in which you need him as an offensive option the most down the stretch A towel over his head can only be a spectator now as White is blocked by Williams Hollerman Copelan into the paint Copelan is fouled Hell try to tie it with 202 to go at the line music Watch the right foot of Peterson A little w there Jay on the defensive possession Yeah I didnt see any contact and just seeing him looks like hes running okay and then he hobbled over to the sidelines Copeland hits the first of two applause It just really takes the air out of this game to a degree when you lose a star like Peterson Hey for Kansas they have to do what theyve done most of this year play and win without Darren Peterson which theyve done They went 30 at the players era without him They played some really high quality opponents cheering without him Duke Tennessee Yukon and now theyre going to try to beat NC State on the road without their leading scorer Councils been their leading scoreer tonight with 26 cheering Trey White cheering Council nearly had it taken away by Copeland A St Bonaventure transfer His pass is deflected Tuesday night ACC Network double header to tell you about Plenty more great college hoops coming up Two more outstanding freshman Cameron Boozer and Duke against Lipkcom Caleb Bolson and music UNCC against East Tennessee State Starts at 6 Eastern 5 Central White with a shot clock at five Council driving Councel finishes Hes tied a careerhigh with 28 He has ripped control of this game time and again and Kansas reclaims the lead Well two things from Malvin Council Jr and KU right now on ball screens You got to set it lower if theyre going to go over They jumped on the high side of it Great job kind of going against the grain and finding away with the acrobatic finish at the rim 80 seconds to play Copeland leading the way with 17 You missed the post up Heres Williams into Luben Tough bounce pass and somehow Luben catches finishes and ties the game again With a minute to go were 630 cheering Trey White counsel for three ANOTHER YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS HE HAS doubled his careerh high with eight threepointers He was five for 27 on the year And Melvin Councils out of body experience HAS PUT KANSAS BACK in the lead I tried to tell you before that boy is hotter than Cayle Pepper Im telling you he does not believe that he is not the best player on music the court He knows he is and hes shooting the ball with confidence every possession music The ball is in his hands Whether its a drive whether its making a Hell have the ball after a review for a timing issue The clock at 49 and a half with NC State now three Have to be strong with the ball I would go back inside on a quick shot at our North Carolina State Theres no need to take a rush contested three Get the ball down and extend this game Now NC State still has three timeouts Only 14 fouls a piece for both Copeland in the paint WILLIAMS FOR THE TIE YES SIR HIS FIRST THREE OF the game in the most perfect moment cheering They got that shot off early which means NC State will have their last shot in this ball game cheering Smart play by Wade Kansas with only a single timeout remaining cheering The ball has to be in the hands of Melvin Council Jr has to be with the way hes feeling tonight And were going to get that timeout Kansas will take it with 205 to go and 12 to shoot 666 Oh great Minute 40 or so Theyre fabulous freshman who limped off the court So its going to be Jamari McDow to inbound Jackson White Bedonga and Council cheering I stay home on Trey White and I blitz Council on any ball screen Allan Breed guards council Council drives puts it up too strong but with the rebound Put back wont go No whistle in there NC State has three timeouts Oh they use one Theyre not going to Williams Williams Copelan for the win No A DEVILISHLY GOOD 40 MINUTES but a 66 all game as we go to the overtime period Question for KU is where does the point production come from if its not coming from Melvin Council Jr Whats the answer Were about to find out Tip one to Williams and NC State And what a start to overtime Williams with an and one opportunity 3 seconds into the OT Williams using that 66 230 lb frame to attack the chest of music Council Junior Nothing he could do Exquisite job finishing through contact Thats the type of mentality you want Dwell to have consistently The two schools that were hardest after Darien Williams when he left Texas Tech and headed into the portal NC State got him over Kansas And right now he is looking to lead NC State over Kansas Couldnt convert the threepoint play 6866 State Jackson for Kansas Trey Whites had a tough shooting night was three for 10 Theyve really got nothing out of anybody but counts though The rims got to look like its 30 ft wide to this kid Hes hit nine threepointers I am still shocked that Melvin Councel Jr continues to find himself wide open for shots He is 34 The rest of his team has 35 And a steal for McDow If youre NC State you know where the ball is going cheering Councel theyre still not showing on the screens Theyre still giving them wide open shots if he wants it Councel rushes up to get it Instead the ball swung out to White and to Bedonga and Flory CANT FINISH WHITE extends that long right arm and tips it up and in That snaps a streak of 16 consecutive Kansas points scored by councel and gives the JayHawks a threepoint lead in OT Williams spinning Heres Hollerman Hollerman with a dribble Hollowin floats it short Rebound to council 34 points six boards three assists and a steal Councel drives it again with the left hand Hes got 36 He is putting on an absolute show Changing speeds knocking down jumpers finding ways to lay it in with the left Man what a portal was able to land the Big 12 player of the year and D will Lamir NC State Hollowman from Michigan State that took them to the Elite 8 They they have the right pieces just havent been able to get over the hump with the signature win And thats why this opportunity against Kansas at home feels like a music must win for the Wolfpack That resume is important after you get into conference You talk about a quad one win in the nonconference This is their last chance You beat Kansas its going to be a quad one win We know that about the JayHawks Williams gets a look and Williams all of a sudden has found his shooting stroke A three out of the timeout Hes got a quick eight at the end of regulation in an OT and its a twopoint game 7371 cheering Kansas by two on the road cheering Trey White little fumble there Its been council with 18 of the last 20 Hes got the ball Switched on to Luben Blows by him and leaves it short Fight for the rebound Theres a foul and its going against Kansas Thats the six on the Jay Hawks They changed it up NC State switching on everything what they typically do going back to that instead of going under those ball screens where Council was able to make the right reads forcing him to try to beat people off the dribble and take a shot over extended arms Contestant next foul puts the pack in the bonus Williams again Williams tied it at the end of regulation GIVES THEM THE LEAD IN cheering OVERTIME cheering Council cheering after the 12th lead change of the game Heres White He gets fouled White will shoot two with a minute 40 to go And Kansas down by one We talked about Williams averaging 11 points per game over his last six but this is why he is here in Raleigh North Carolina Thats why Will Wade brought him to this town for his clutch shot making and his ability to lead the Wolfpack to a place they havent gone in a while Will Wade meanwhile is still screaming about the foul call against Allen Breed cheering Looked like he may have gone straight up First free throws for Kansas since the first half and White Rims it in out and back in Heres the foul call Its on Brie Now thats a tough one cheering Looked like he was pretty parallel to me Straight up cheering And White hits both So what a big call that is 7574 Kansas back in front 13 ties 13 lead changes on the 13th of December Hollowman passes up the three Copeland around McDow slithers into the paint and he scores it NC State on the 14th lead change is back in front 19 for Copelan cheering cheering One minute to play Councel McDow cheering with no Darren Peterson for overtime Its been council show into Badonga A rib rocker returns the JayHawks to the lead And what a seal by Bunga Had the North Carolina player on the high side Kept him on that high side Sealed him And a great pass by Council over the top 40 seconds to go Copeland in no hurry Copeland backing his way down against McDow A tough angled shot was all the way down and squeezed out You have to foul now for NC State You got one to give And Breed will give it took a shot as well going in hard against council 27 seconds to go That was the foul to give And Allen Breed gave up his face Well see if the officials want to take a look at this for a possible flagrant foul on the elbow by Council and Clarence Armstrong will go to the monitor with 271 to go The previous play is under review Yeah he got him with that elbow over the top That is not a normal basketball move at all cheering I know hes trying to swing his body through but typically as a guard when you give an in and out youre keeping your hands low trying to get lower to the ground You You never see the left arm raised over the top that way So the crew of Roger Tony Padilla and Clarence Armstrong have to determine if this is going to stay a common foul on Breed or if theres a potential flagrant upgrade here Flagrant one could be an excessive or unnecessary act Violent conduct to the head And they have to determine if this is enough to upgrade what was not called a flagrant foul on the floor Well I trust this elite officiating crew but that was an unnatural basketball movement It is a common foul NC State Itll be Kansas ball on the sideline There is no flagrant foul assist Will Wades not happy about it You just got an explanation from Tony Padilla What did he tell you Yeah they they considered it a natural basketball play Um I might differ on that opinion I dont typically see swingthroughs that are coming over the top Um but was it intentional I dont think it was intentional I think it was more accidental So you know Im going to trust the refs judgment here Theyve been on top of it all night tonight So shot clock off NC State needs a takeaway or a foul White for McDow They cheering got to foul here What are they doing They have to foul down one and Copeland does with 19 A total lack of communication for NC State Let a lot of time go off Its going to be a one and one here with 19 seconds to go And itll send the guy you dont want to send to the line The guy whos hit nine threes today and scored 36 Melvin Council one for two at the line and he breaks the first NC States got three timeouts now Copelan not looking to use it on the back down Copelan gets it out to Williams for three NO ITS COUNCIL AND HES FOULED Williams misses a potential gamewinner and Council will go back to the line for a one and one with three seconds remaining Holy smokes what an ending Well Copeland had the size advantage but Dunga coming over from the weak side I dont know why Ben Allen would crash in right there bringing Bunga to Copeland If anything clear out Williams did get an open look at it I dont like these scenarios where teams are down one and they take a three and try to get a two over the top Council just missed the front end and he misses another NC State will take a timeout Council is one for four at the line and the Wolf Pack has the ball out Peterson for seven games this year Theyve played without Peterson for all of overtime today Copelands going to inbound it NC State has two timeouts remaining Copeland gets it to Abel across half court Theres the timeout with second to go Well see if the officials go to the monitor and review the clock At the moment its going to be NC State with 1 second down one point Well you give Kansas a lot of credit there They force the Wolfpack to catch the ball running back towards their own basket right Which wasted a little bit music more time on a clock And now you have a second for a catch and shoot Maybe you could add a couple of ticks to the clock there Maybe around 12 when Abel took the timeout Thats what the officials are determining Well we are 1 second plus maybe away from getting you to Lexington Dave OBrien Dick Vital and Charles Barkley together for Indiana and Kentucky You got number one Arizona in Birmingham against Alabama After that youve got Gonzaga and UCLA two top 25 games Theres so much more great college basketball tonight but this has been one of the games of the day if not the game of the day Jay Williams Kansas without Darren Peterson has showed its toughness its grit its defense and its heart And theyre one second away from closing out a road win but NC State can have the final shot Not only has it been the game of the day I think Melvin Council Jr music has been the player of the day thus far Now we still have a lot of incredible basketball left to watch but the offensive performance hes put on has been absolutely incredible to watch And now you think about end of game situation 1 second is enough for a catch and shoot scenario You would think that the ball will be in the hands of either music Copeland or Williams for this last shot but where they catch it will be critical And then on the other end if youre Kansas you know hey look we have to remain disciplined defensively Do not lean over Stay parallel contest everything stay down and lets force him into a tough shot Paulia right there big number 34 is going to come in and guard the inbound 7 foot freshman Theres an extra tenth of a second on the clock Its 11 Williams has 17 Copelan has 19 but Copelands going to inbound Williams Luben Hollowman Copelan and over in the corner its able You might see a double pin down for Ael and then a flare screen by Luben See a pass over the top Try to get the ball to D will NC State has a timeout left if they have trouble getting it in Copeling gets it in Williams for the win Its no good Kansas survives by one measly point Melvin Council Jr as the came of his
