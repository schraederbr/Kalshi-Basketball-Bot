up nightmare as the Oakland Zoo begins its bounce nice to see it in full voice a proud program in search of an ACC regular season title hurt Pittsburgh and gold the Eagles in Maroon and we are underway our Tuesday night doubleheader continues here at Pittsburgh and the Panthers start with the basketball five transfers to the starting lineup for Pittsburgh and yet you watch them play and it seems like theyve been playing together for years balanced uh four players and double digits in the starting lineup of fourth hit and I think thats what makes them so dangerous of their ability on any given night any one of those four guys can go off and have big offensive nights but theyre doing excellent job spreading the ball around Jaden Zachary back in the starting lineup for Boston College in the backcourt with Makai Ashton Langford 10 different starting lineups this season for an Eagles team thats had to mix and match all season long and when we talked to Earl Grant this afternoon he said look thats been a challenge mixing and matching all these uh lineups and hes done a pretty good job with this team as well too uh going through some challenging circumstances not having a full roster Earl Grant in year number two at the helm of Boston College Henson open three hell usually make you pay from there this is not going to be a keeper of Boston College Earl Grant said look we must defend the threepoint line against a pit team of that if you give them open threes uh they generally will make you pay miscommunication trying to get it into the posts with Quentin post highlighted him before tipoff hes going to be a matchup problem for Jeff K Pol in the Panthers tonight cant say enough of the job that Jeff Capel has done with this pit team this year and I think a big reason of this guy right here Federico Federico I think hes been The X Factor we talk about the four other guys that average double digits but what hes provided for them in that Five Spot Rim protection and then the guy that could finish around the basket but hes got a tough matchup tonight against Clinton post because of that right there that seven footer will step out and shoot threes again hes become a matchup problem for opposing teams the highlights right there would make some so dangerous Music heres Burton in attack mode contested the front rim to Applause Boston College team did is dangerous on the road in the ACC ask Virginia Tech they went in to Castle Coliseum on their last Road game in one thats a really tough place to play Second Chance opportunity for post but he traveled oh Federico Federico uh four pit this is what hes provided uh hes provided rent protection but then when hes had his opportunities around the basket he is uh definitely finished over 50 from the floor on to season four Federico Federico Music for three Miss fires hit and started this game shooting just one for six Applause Music Applause for its a league Bay into the game and he cant connect three minutes gone by only five combined points for these two teams finding their footing offensively in the early going were in a lot of contact and a block is the call against Makai Ashton Langford and thats what Pitt will do theyll break up their offense and let Burton get into post if theres a matchup they like if they think theres a smaller guard on him a lot of contact with one of the things Jeff Capel talked about and shoot around he said look BC is going to be a physical team foreign Music Applause Malcolm and they very much live and die by that three Applause posted to the Lane Miss Friars do not want to let this Panthers team get hot from Deep I think the biggest thing would hit I go back to I have their Northwestern game when they beat Northwestern a team thats at the top of the standings in the Big Ten right now for me theyre spacing they do a really good job spacing and I think its how they get their threes if its off dribble drives typically its Burton and its kicking out thats when they create a lot of problems for teams again theyre spacing and then ball movement really has been a big reason why theyve had success this year five seconds to shoot Burton right to the rack and he missed it but draws the foul of the process Applause this is just a great drive by Burton again hes Jaden Zachary pretty good Defender for Boston College thats the blowby and the help is not there for Boston College Applause makes the first nothing but that every Thursday 10 Eastern right after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will break down whats always a wild night in the ACC tell you everything you need to know and ACC womens troops Jay we talked a lot about Burton his offense defense is also an excellent free throw shooter as well too nacc play 89 from the free throw line so again a guy that really very few holds in his game Applause contested look but off the window and in for the Freshman Devin McLaughlin one of the things that come out of some of the injuries is McLaughlin and also Chaz Kelly whos out on the floor with him right now those guys getting extended minutes and he found out a lot about his freshman really excited about their future great defense from Zachary now pushing it in transition Jaden Zachary Coast to Coast rolls in doesnt drop Music Applause Pittsburgh Boston College just getting started on our Tuesday night ACC number seven in the country in the AP poll Miami number 15 I look at AP Paul Im not a net guy I dont know how Jeff capels team right now is not right to the top 20 fine it doesnt make sense to me either and again you look at their resume but then who they beat again really tough to argue uh keeping them out of the top 25 but certainly theyve continued to prove folks wrong great defense on post hes frustrated its in the trailer dangerous from Deep left that short you notice the last possession of offensively for Boston College Pits going to double post every time he gets the ball in the post theyre going to go and double theyre not going to leave him single coverage Applause aliens for free cant connect Tapped Out Hinson backs up he fires and this time it drops foreign Applause Applause Mason Matson the junior Sharps shooter with an immediate answer and thats what hes in the game for space to floor thats a nice play by Cass Kelly The Freshman dribble Drive draw The Defenders two of them and then kick it out to your shooter so candy at three rims out Chaz Kelly has given this Eagles team some big time minutes off the bench last time they played on the road he delivered a careerhigh 17 now getting into the assisting game back to back Jesus there for Kelly and were tied at 10 and thats what Earl Grant and staff are happy with they know he can score but again you see the last two possessions hes making reads playing like a point guard setting up his teammates for some open looks up ahead Zachary Applause great boys with Federico Federico bearing down at BC has taken its first lead of the night on a 70 run and theyre getting it done on both ends defensive rebounding and then theyre getting a stops forcing some turnovers and difficult shots in this last threeminute spread and Jay right now Earl Grant must be pleased with the spacing look at this right here the Freshman Jazz Kelly make a read draw two Defenders set up by the spacing of that Boston College has and then defensively being active in the passing lanes and then out right here nice little Up and Under by Jade and Zachary and thats the formula that Boston College wants slow the pace down and then Force Pitt into some difficult possessions and then try to get out and transition or get into the paint another great pass leads to two nine nothing Eagles run and theyve taken the crowd out of it here in Pittsburgh Applause Music Applause Ellie coming stolen away fifth turnover for Pitt and PCs making them pay an 11nothing run Jeff Capel told us that shoot around Boston College is probably the most physical team in the ACC he said if his guys do not theyre not strong with the ball oh theres going to be some turnovers in this game three turnovers of the last two minutes for Pittsburgh and BC has capitalized CJ Payne youre getting in on the ACT its an 11nothing shot out of a cannon right now on an 11nothing run and theyre getting it done with their defense steal being physical in the passing lanes and then theyve had some excellent spacing theyre getting high percentage shots on the offensive end all set up though by their physical defense this team has been completely different since quinted posts has come back from his foot injury missed 13 games including these losses and whats so interesting now is if they have posts for these games theyre theyre on the bubble right now certainly again you look at the first two I call that main game they were also without Prince a league Bay in that game as well too so two guys that are starters for them I think the biggest one though obviously is quick coach we talked about what hes done in the last seven games and not too many players in college basketball putting up the numbers of that he has for Boston College in that seven green stretch Applause Foster college with wins against Clemson on the road against Virginia Tech and right now playing the number one team in the ACC if the tournament started today Pitt would be a one seed in that ACC tournament in Greensboro one second left on the shot clock so what do you draw up here if youre Earl Grant its got to be some type of tip the key thing for pit though defensively you cannot foul switch and communicate all any screens just dont want to give up anything lob at the basket or foul and bail Boston College out Applause quick three Manson cant hit it good well to get it off Applause theres Nelly Cummings Jorge Diaz Graham draws a foul it is only one point in the last three minutes and 13 seconds no made field goals three turnovers for Pitt how do they get their offensive rhythm going its exactly what Jeff Capel talked about and shoot around this afternoon being strong with the ball when you go into the lane against Boston theyre going to hit you he said that look theyre going to make contact with you be strong with the ball and then go from there coming scoop to the hoop just like that right there beautiful move by Cummings coming up underneath on the up and under Boston College has made five of their last seven Cross Court pass nearly intercepted instead and you got a threeoff saves it great job following his own Miss and now a jump ball possession arrow stays with BC and this is what uh Pitt is going to need right here again individual plays break the D down this time coming scoring for himself now thats a difficult shot he made it look easy but theyre going to have to do that against this Boston College team break them down see if you can get into the gaps either draw to score for yourself or Draw the fender and then kick out for your threepoint shooters foreign so far winning out hit just four of 12 from the field a team that likes to get hot especially from three and theyve only made two tonight Zachary spinning in to a ton of contacts no call its a Bandy thats a goaltend count the bucket for Nike savandy how about the acceleration yeah he was like a jet and the Open Court great burst of speed the thing I like about Nike savandy uh hes got a great change of direction right here look at this little Inside Out throws the defender at League Bay and then hes just right by him had nothing else to do but golden uh thats just a great explosion uh by Nike sabandi and transition Applause and again a clock issue following the goaltend so just got word from the referee the issue is the shot clock is freezing so mid of possession a couple times the shot clock has this bruise Jade and Zachary you cannot leave him open limited minutes of the last two games hes battling through some injuries its that time of the Season midFebruary when youve got a couple niggles here and there Applause Music and this is key for Boston College again spacing breakdown by Pitt no communication on there really its just a rub screen not even really a screen and Zachary knocks it down now thats key for Boston College in conference play that they only average five threes made per game Pitt right now is elected to try to pack again because Boston College is a team that scores typically in the paint but theyve already made three tonight Applause that was his own Miss but then stepped on the line Applause six turnovers now for Pitt increasingly frustrated on the offensive end and a credit Boston College their defense theyre doing a nice job contesting and then closing out again when theyre getting beat off the dribble theyre helping but then theyre getting back to recover post double team cops Applause great passing for Boston College playing with a lot of confidence on the road against the number one seed of the ACC down to seven deep three and he buries it Makai Ashton Langford best offensive possession of the night for Boston College Earl Grant said part of their defenses be patient on offense uh run a lot of clock see if you can get a fit spread out run them off screens and then get a high percentage shot at the end now he Comics answers exactly what hit as needed Music inside the post hes fouled Guillermo Diaz Graham called with the foul on post but this right here again it shows the spacing that Boston College has had look at the spacing on the floor uh that all four guys out on the perimeter spread out and then right here the defense uh breaking down uh Bob Boston College nice little backdoor action that time going back to the Aston Ledford three isnt that a shot you live with if your pet it is but Jeff Capel told us to one guy who has hurt him over the last two years has been Makai Ashton Langford but he said that right off the tip after he talked about post he said the other guy they have to be aware of is Makai Aston Langford every time hes played against Pitt hes averaging close to 18 points a game in his last outings against Pitt he has been a Panthers killer you just said it hot near 18 points a game shooting better than 50 percent from the floor and from three so far that has continued tonight Burton Zachary all over has to kick it out seven seconds to shoot comics in attack mode float or nothing but the bottom of the net love his midrange game thats a beautiful little jump stop and then floater thats a difficult shot Cummings making it look easy excellent body control drilled into post wasnt ready for it hit dangerous in transition hits it calling for it thats why boykinson and Jay what wont be talked about in that play the screen that Burton set to free him up Ash and Lang for too much on it and its pit basketball hits and starting to heat up he has two threes it has made three in a row Nelly Cummings getting on the act as well and weve got a great back and forth game in the ACC Music averages nine threes made per game and any good threepoint shooting team has guys that are willing to set screens look at jamarius Burton setting a little back screen to free up The Henson right here and that little thing right there it may not show up end of in the score book but that is huge and a big reason why uh theyre shooting the three ball and they get quality looks of their guards and also bigs are willing screeners Applause first half Boston College lead down to two Eagles led by as many as seven Commons into the lane he had made three in a row before that Miss foreign Applause defensively So Physical its been a great back and forth ACC game posts thats good short Elliott given go Music Cummings has been the initiator tonight 10 on the timer feeds it in to Hinson has the height advantage and uses its done that a couple of times now this time with Henson theyve done it with Burton anytime they get a matchup that they think they can get Hinton or Burton posted up and theyre just going to it stolen away comics Applause on the follow and Jay this is just great recognition by Kent again theyre breaking off their offense put Henson down in the post they think they have an advantage in size with him over Zachary he wins out in that one right there and again because they shoot the three ball so well Boston College really reluctant to come down there and help excellent design play and then recognition by Pitt Music Burton gives Pitt back the lead eight nothing panthers run you know the break they just brought out Pittsburghs womens lacrosse team second year in the programs history weve got womens lacrosse right here on the ACC Network top 10 matchups Saturday noon eastern time the defending national champions North Carolina welcoming in Florida and if youve never watched the sport before tune into that game and you will see why it is the fastest growing sport in the country so much fun Im a huge lacrosse fan and Im happy that this is the crossover season between basketball and Lacrosse Boston College has a loud pit to grab back the lead Panthers on a nine nothing run post rattles it home to tie it at 26 hes just a matchup problem again theyll post them if you dont double uh hes got a great post game weve already talked about his threepoint shooting over 40 percent really uh the sevenfooter for Boston College doing it yeah hes a three the screens thats a beautifully designed play pinned down screen and the foot were coming off really thats something watch that tons of contact off the ball and they say its against Clinton post who then reached out and got a leg of Greg Elliott Applause weve told you all night this is a physical matchup Applause and you see tempers flaring between post and Elliott another look its been getting chippy now again Im not Applause theres a kick right there now again its been I think theyre calling the hooks and then afterwards yeah again the referees are going to clean this up they dont want this thing to get out of control we knew coming into it it was going to be a physical game Applause the Quentin post obviously frustrated with the hook call but you cant reach out and grab a leg like that but certainly not and again hes too valuable for Boston College to pick up fouls like that again uh it now I think its going to be up to the refs theyre going to clean this up Boston College and Quentin post LED this game 1610 since then Pittsburgh on a 1910 run physical play all night long to the tempers flaring and this right here this last one I think the referees are going to clean it up with that shut down and reaching pumps possibly college with 819 miles Greg Elliott talking to Nike sabandi over uh the bench what happened Huck just got word from the officiating crew what did they have to say so on sportsmanlike technical and what theyre going to do right now is is because theres two technicals on both teams it offsets and now its going to be pitball I think that the key thing out of this Jake right now is the referees have warned both coaches and both benches they are not going to allow any more physical play to go on so now the players are going to have to adjust so both posts for BC and alien for Pittsburgh call for a technical foul yes and we are back underway Pittsburgh riding a 122 run 53 with 440 left in his first half thats a moving screen against Federico Federico Music and now you can see that may have maybe play on now theyre going to call everything theyre going to clean it up any physical play any extra curriculars you better believe theyre going to call it coming off the screen James out for Mason Matson good chance to tie it kick to the corner Henson he got it three threes in this first half for Blake kidson he leads the Panthers with 11 Applause Applause Music six seconds left on the shot clock PC has to hurry Zachary hoists it up way off the mark and it is all Pittsburgh right now Hawk Panthers on a 152 run and their spacing continues to be on point right here in the lane finding Henson wide open look pit makes him pay right now theyre on a little mini run Felton Jeffrey Capel Jr Jeff told us today theyve raised over 300 thousand dollars which was enough money to do a critical trial with Duke University and in addition to the money he said nights like tonight just helped spread awareness to just what is a absolutely horrible disease yeah and hes talked about you know his time his father battling uh this disease and you take a look at Jason as well too and you know its something that hits close to home uh to both these uh men and really just a phenomenal job that theyve done not only raising money but bringing awareness to this and he said look its impacted us and were going to continue and continue to fight to try to come up with the cure for this disease missing the front end of the one and one Federico Federico largest lead of the night for Pittsburgh Panthers on a 152 run weve had four lead changes three times its been pretty back and forth in this first half against Blake kidson team foul number five for the Panthers and Jay I think the big thing look Pitt has matched of the physicality that Boston College brings theyve been tough with the ball and then theyve been able to break it down their defense and get some open looks but this guy right here and he he has been a firecracker Off the Bench for BC tonight two threes and the thing with him if youre not connected to him and theyre on the catch hes got a quick release another off the ball this time called against TJ bicker staff you can see this officiating crew is now really dialed in on all that contact off the ball and quick to whistle I said it look theyre going to call everything now in terms of the physical play so these guys are now going to have to adjust if your Boston College in this situation here you do not want to put pit on the freethrow line obviously thats their style of play but theyre now going to have to adjust to how the officials are blown the whistle Ashton Langford with three fouls post with two bicker staff now with two so some foul trouble to consider for Earl Grant hit now with the double bonus so shooting two the rest of that Applause Music Applause McLaughlin lines up with three cant connect foreign Applause thats why I call him the X Factor defensive rebound and then REM Runners one of the best ndacc thats a beautiful transition to the offensive side by Federico Federico look weve had him on the allname team for a while but hes backed it up with the way hes played in conference play take another look at this this is the dimension he brings uh to this team defensive rebound and then rim run Federico Federico hit the finish and Jay the thing I like about him 65 from the floor leads the team leads the team with 48 blocks and then his ability though to run the floor really I think has been a big reason why Pitt Im really defensively under talked about we talked about their threepoint shooting and spacing but defensively he is the anchor to that deep shades of Jerome Lane with the Thunder that he brought to the rim especially in the absence of John Huguley Federico Federico has stepped up in such a big way he does it all and hes different from what they miss with hugely offensively yes hes not a guy youre going to dump it down low to in the post all the time but Rim protection and then I think screen and roll coverage I think thats the big thing that he provides hes very mobile for a big another turnover for Pitt Baker staff in transition and he traveled missed opportunity for Boston College right there in transition but again they forced the turnover against Pitt you can look at the numbers points off a turnovers Boston College twopoint Advantage nine points to pit seven and thats going to be key that was the theme for Jeff Capel when we talked to him this afternoon he said look we can now turn the ball over against this very physical and active in the passing Lanes alley a double teamed passes out of it 10 seconds to shoot for Burton back to Elliott of three and hes fouled for Greg Elliott will get three from the line Applause Music very costly foul on Mason Manson and thats really a breakdown by Matson again Zachary has Burton contained right there so theres certain guys you cant over help off of and Burton such a smart player that time he saw Matson coming over to help a little he immediately kicks it out and thats a big reason why Burton is one of the most complete players in college right there again help yeah you got him again you have to allow the offensive player a chance to land and Elliot misses the second Applause good opportunity for Pittsburgh to create some separation here at the end of the first half its been really back and forth Applause 12 from the line of this first half and now a sixpoint lead with a minute left Applause heres Chas Kelly beat up by some Bandit dispossessed Bickerstaff trying to get it seven seconds left on the shot clock scoots out of bounds and its pinball pit doing a nice job playing that pack line D really theyre creating bodies in front of Boston College a team they know wants to get into the paint but very active with their hands and then throwing bodies in front of Boston College when they dribble drive use it or lose it time out Jeff Caple elects to use it well use it as well hit up by six Music reminder to fans to download the ACC threepoint challenge app presented by New York Life Malcolm Huckabee Jay alter with you well in this first half weve got 17 fouls 16 turnovers that shows you the type of physicality both teams have brought on a Tuesday night in the ACC and Jeff cable and staff they know look thats Boston College identity theyre going to grind you out of their team that wants to force you into difficult shots or youre going to have strong with the ball tapped out to Henson Applause is 43 of this first half Applause the contested shot goes begging pit still has time three seconds for Elliott heaves at the buzzer Applause way off the mark But Pittsburgh ends with an extremely strong finish to this first half largest lead of the game for the Panthers at nine grind it out other Henson had four of Pitts six made threes its the Panthers and start with the basketball and a nine point lead Applause son leads away with 14 but balance scoring from Elliot and Federico Federico as well under 10 to shoot double team comes in then post retreats Federico decides to pull the trigger thats not his shot Applause whats the recipe for a Boston College comeback in the second half well I think the biggest thing for them its going to start with their defense but they gave up too many uh threepointers in particular to Henson defend the threepoint line thats something Earl Grant said and then this guy right here Quentin post theyre gonna try to have to reestablish him get him some touches in the paint as well wide open look for lakaya Langford and he knocks it down nice uh head fake that time by Makai Aston Langford and again if youve hit youll live with Boston College shooting threes not sure if they want to close out like that out of control and then allow after Michael to get into his pullup game question Langford 3 000 that first half so he sat for the majority of it great defense from post ripped away Burton has it for Pittsburgh Applause pull up pop and he hits it Applause Im going to say it again uh for me jamarius Burton should be at the top of the list when you start talking about player of the year that sums him up get a steal and then lead to break that time pulling up under control he is a complete player he can get it done on both ends of the Court impact in the game Zachary seven seconds to shoot kick to the corner no good good look but McLaughlin couldnt quite knock it down Blow by everything but the Finish missed layup for Nelly Cummings both teams starting to run great tip in for Madison Langford and thats a break the Cummings normally would make that Boston College Miss picks up the Miss and then races down the other end gets a really good transition too four point swing burden loaded up there rejected the second effort doesnt go and now Zachary has it for the Eagles Applause offensive foul winter post that is his third Applause again of the heads up play jamarius Bergen realizing thats their seventh footer hes so important to Boston College leaded him into that uh charge again his basketball IQ as well too on display right there thats a great defensive play by jamaris Burton post a frustrating night three fouls and only two of six from the floor Applause offensive foul this one against Greg Elliott remembers Elliott and post who got tangled up and called for technical fouls in the first half and what theyre saying is he moved in the path of Makai Aston Langford repeated his process again I think its more he didnt come to a set all the way to the rim nobody picked up Zachary birthdays great feed Federico the answer thats a nice little dumb ball pass but by Damaris Burton right now Boston College problems on the ball screen and thats something that Jeff Capel said they wanted to do put Quentin posting a lot of ball screens see if they can wear him out the trailer Burton left alone connect passes out to Zachary and he lays it up and in unfortunate bounce to Jaden Zachary who just had to take it the whole way with nobody in front of him Applause how many times do you get the rebound if youre standing on the logo many definitely a gracious role for Boston College right now look theyve grown into a matchup Zone Cummings decides to shoot over it and he drills it and thats the problem when you go Zone against Pitt they have four guys out on the court uh that can knock down threes if you go matchup Zone you must communicate Applause Clinton post lost the handle for as good as he has been the last month for BC hosts not having his best night tonight all right Eagles battling on the road though Eagles have cut it to five that three gives it an eightpoint lead for Pitt burrow the Panthers on a fivegame win streak on Lebanon three in conference and yet still unranked not getting a ton of Love nationally for whatever reason so heres a blind resume quad one one team is five and two the other is four and six Music net 21 and 51 seems totally lopsided the conference records 11 and 3 87 so lets reveal thats Rutgers on the last pit on the right and again were not computers were humans talk me through Malcolm when you see that what do you think uh Im confused and again we talk about their when pit a verse Northwestern again a Big Ten team uh it was a I called that game now it was a clinic that Pitt put on in that game you look at what theyve done against the top 25 teams in particular uh some of those on the road uh theyve been a very good road team as well too and you look at this number right here again uh computers all this other stuff numbers dont lie and you look at what theyve done theyre right up there with some of the best teams look at that Alabama number one Purdue number three UCLA number four these are the best teams in the country and Pitt cant even get ranked theyre right amongst them yeah again look I think that in reality a lot of it has to do with a lot of people just oh they werent expecting this from pitt uh myself included again youve seen them I saw him against Northwest and I said look they look obviously um improved but nobody thought that they would be a team well thats the top of the standings right now by ndacc Hinson deep three King hits it Blake kidson buries his fifth three of the ninth they are just a dangerous team and they do a great job spacing the floor in particular in their secondary break and they have Shooters all over the floor stolen away Applause rejected at The Rim great Hustle Jay we talked about what Federico Federico means to this team elite REM protection right there denying a bucket for Boston College and then right here in their secondary break we talked about the first half that Blake Henson had really just phenomenal job facing the floor great hustle continues from Devin McLaughlin leads to a three and thats an air ball and the Oakland Zoo will let Mason Matson hear it DC in the scoring crowd of nearly two and a half minutes Pittsburgh six nothing scoring run has opened up the largest margin for either team tonight Burton oh hes so crafty can score at all three levels that time showing off the midrange hes so strong and one of the better defenders in college Applause just as we were talking about Pittsburgh not getting enough love nationally the Panthers have gone on an eightnothing run to blow this game wide open Henson thought about it gave it up to Cummings floater rolls on in 100 OMalley Cummings has shown off the floater game his midrange really in body control his ability to shoot floaters and Runners over defenders really impressive Zachary fighting through traffic draws the foul and this is something weve seen multiple times tonight by Nelly Cummings again thats a tough floater Whit McLaughlin coming up to try to block it great body control and concentration to get that up and over foreign Applause close game and made a really comfortable lead for themselves and I think the big thing they really have neutralized Clint post a couple of things Jeff Capel talked about it and theyre scouting report what they wanted to do they wanted to try to get him in foul trouble double him make somebody else for Boston College score and then they put him in a lot of pick and roll situations hes using a lot of energy hedging on ball screens and pin Downs up for the wing players of pit so Bandy Rises fires Off the Mark Applause Jazz Kelly now rims out Applause Boston College without a field goal in the last four minutes Applause new shot clock for Pitt from the corner Henson looking for what would have been six threes on the night for hitson Applause but does it drop four and a half minutes without a bucket for Boston College instant from the opposite corner plus the foul a chance for a fourpoint play and Blake Henson has six main threes and all set up by Nelly Cummings dribble drive and kick it out to one of the better threepoint Shooters in the ACC Blake Henson still needs a heat check uh hes the only player in the ACC averaging over 15 points a game six rebounds and 62 threes made uh this is what he does he creates matchup problems for opposing teams because of his ability to knock down threes and pit in this game has done a nice job finding him that time in transition dribble Drive find Blake Henson in the corner and he continues his high shooting hes already made six threes tonight now has a chance to make this a fourpoint play was fouled making a three before the break seventh game of the season that hes had 20 points or more and he completes the fourpoint play and Jay because of his frame uh they convictions but you play him at the four spot hes able to guard other fours and then also you see here switch out on ball screens and go out and guard point guards or twos hes a really one of the most versatile players uh in the ACC really does a nice job of creating flexibility for Jeff Capel and staff on both ends were talking about Henson defensively and he comes up with the Steal and Boston College trailed by nine at halftime cut it to five twice couldnt get any closer than that and now they have it made a shot at five minutes to 20 seconds hits it that was the heat check that it missed would have been a seventh seventh three on the night through contact the league Bay no good bounces out rattles in and out no good second half its been for Boston College and if they want to get back into it theyre going to have to do a better job defending the threepoint line and then right here this is a mismatch of Fort Pitt theyre just going to ISO and let sabandi go to work fails to take advantage of the mismatch trying to provide some instant offense posts cant tip it in Zachary the save but right to Elliott Outlets into Hinson Applause and he lays it up foreign this is getting ugly offensively for Boston College theyve missed 10 in a row desperately need to make a shot now 11th straight misses up ahead Center he goes Federico with a mans Jam well Federico Federico all name team but right here Rim running reward to Big Man earlier about his dad and it said that so many great memories including going back to him getting inducted on that day in 1977 yeah and he said actually Boston College football was playing pit football on that day that they inducted his father into the Hall of Fame and that pitcher is his screensaver on his computer at home so certainly has a great BC connection and certainly great memories of his band Ali has transitioned three got it Applause hit on a 212 run over the last seven minutes scoring droughts and then uh lack really defending the threepoint line uh for Boston College now that one right there again thats a contested three but on this end right here I think Boston College theyve struggled making shots and then I think Quinton post they tough to try to get him involved get him some touches that is now 13 straight misses for Boston College Jaden Zachary made a field goal at 1651 to make it 4439 since then BC has not made a basket and this right here I think defensively again of their imbalance you have Quentin post your sevenfooter trying to get out and defend a point guard on the other end Pitts doing a great job running their transition offense and getting some quick hits finally a mate for BC after 13 consecutive missed shots a field goal drought of more than seven minutes of its allowed pit to make what was a fivepoint game now a 22point game Applause he hits it again raining days the 11th of the night for Pitt and jamarius Burton again unselfish play could have easily tried to put that ball back up realizing his guy is hot get a loose ball find your shooter get him a wide open look Applause much needed three an immediate answer through Mason Manson Applause Santos first turn around jumper trading buckets right now thats not going to do it right now seven minutes to go end this game for Boston College and really it has been all pit they cannot miss Applause foreign Applause Pittsburgh well on their way to extending this win streak to six games if the ACC tournament started today your number one seed are these pit Panthers endings he ends every pregame shoot around with 10 lets go 10 by the end of the night so far tonight so good ongoing 10 and that would make them 123 atop the ACC and hes been consistent all year thats been his theme and also message to his team with focus on one game at a time it has worked oh really well for them and again they can beat you in so many different ways I think under talked about is their defense as Clinton posts misses another pretty good look by that time but the defense collapse down now hes stuck at seven points Jay hes a guy that came into this game in the last seven averaging over 20 points a game you have to give Federico Federico a lot of credit for the job hes done on Quentin post so a team that was picked 14th in the ACC preseason would be alone at the top of the ACC by the end of the night if they hang on here yet Joe lunardi only has the Panthers as a nine seed lets see Virginias a three it beat them Head to Head Miamis a five hit beat them Head to Head NC States even at eight who lost to Syracuse earlier tonight to pick beat them on the road only loss in a PNC Arena all year long yeah youre confusing me because I dont know all these like numbers what how theyre not ranked much higher and not in the top 25 to me again it makes no sense to me the way that theyre playing with another three but he has been I think one of the bright spots for Boston College tonight offensively his threepoint shooting and then defensively hes been solid but back to my point about Pitt look I think they must start getting consideration for the top 25 all the numbers are there Road wins and then top 25 wins really its again baffling that theyre not there already yeah I think theyre closer to a 45 been an a9c well see how it plays out well see what the committee says on selection Sunday the one thing that all pit fans could agree on despite the seeding is did you think in midFebruary this team would be alone at the top of the ACC it could be a one seed in Greensboro well they opened some eyes again I called the challenge game and they went and dismantled Northwestern at Northwestern again a team another team that a lot of folks didnt think was going to be at the top and contending uh in the Big Ten but they went down there and put our Clinic offensively with this facing and threepoint shooting to go along with excellent defense but youre right I dont think anybody thought that they would be in this position right now and once again taking care of business tonight five minutes away from another 10 the Mantra all season long for Jeff Capel prove the Panthers to 123 in the ACC you mentioned the road wins hawk in conference play Pitt is six in one on the road thats an offensive foul theyre going to call Ashton Langford for kicking his legs out he cant believe it and hes fouled out of this game this is Ashley langfords fifth foul thats a tough one now again from that angle right there again his legs are out but a lot of times you see guys come off dreams I dont like that but its been that type of night frustrating now you get credit for taking the two key pieces offensively really out of their game and Clinton post and Makai Aston Langford theyve only got seven points a piece post and Ashton Langford and thats just not enough for Boston College who rely so heavily on those two offensively and now frustration setting in for the Eagles Applause that foul against CJ Pena 18 fouls tonight for Boston College won one here Applause Music Applause you know for Boston College rough few days a 30point home loss to NC State now you come on the road and keep it close for 30 minutes the Pitt has really established themselves and itll be a tough trip home for Earl Grant and Company Applause Jay I think you point back to this game uh their inability to defend the threepoint line right now Pitt over 40 percent from the threepoint line theyve made 11 of them and its I think how they got those threes they were wide open looks uh really pit did a good job breaking them down off the bounce and particular though in transition they were able uh to get their secondary accents hard foul underneath Guillermo Diaz Graham The Freshman packed by post thats his fourth foul more personal team number eight cameras Music the Diaz Graham Applause Guillermo one of two freshmen twins from Spain for Jeff Capel theyve gotten more minutes in the absence of John Hughley you know weve seen them sparringly throughout the year you can see those are two really big building blocks for this pit program going forward yeah and again they have great length they provide Rim protection like Federico Federico but I think the other thing they have theyre very skilled offensively they can shoot the ball and their guys also that are very good and ball screen covered so theyre mobile where they can get out heads hard on those ball screens Anderson another BC turnover thats 14 on the night Applause Applause 25point Panthers lead with under four minutes to play on their way to another comfortable win in the ACC Graham left alone trying to add to already 11 made threes on tonight come on Applause and Quentin post has just fouled out of this game rough night for Boston College on the road not long and for good reason pit leading by 25 well on their way to improving to 123 in conference play that would leave them alone at the top of the ACC and what is going to be an extremely fun finish to this regular season who will be the ACC Champions this is the remaining schedule for Pittsburgh what stands out well I think obviously a Virginia Tech Syracuse those two games obviously that game on March 4th with Miami that could decide the ACC it could obviously Virginia is going to have a lot to say about that as well too but a certainly of the way those two teams are playing right now really as you said its going to be an exciting finish to the end of this ACC regular season four of those five games right here on acc Network tries to mount their ACC title race would you say three teams are in a Virginia Miami pit or do you still put Clemson in the race I wouldnt count uh Clemson out of this one the way this season has gone I wouldnt be surprised with anything foreign Applause Applause Music Applause Music Applause fish the hometown hero Murrysville PA started as a student manager now has worked himself to a scholarship player and his energy you can see it and shoot around again he is a guy that any coach would want on their team energetic he goes through all the scouting report for the opposing teams and again he is always capped up with energy has the ball here hes yet to score in ACC play in his career the Oakland Zoo surely rooting for it in the final two minutes the game is in hand Applause what has impressed you most about Pittsburgh tonight yes Blake Henson was on fire right uh jamarius Burton with jamarius Burton but for me and I think a lot of folks are going to raise their eyebrows when they look at this stat line Federico Federico to me was The X Factor in this game yes he had 10 points though yes he had seven rebounds but the defensive job he did on Clinton post yeah the guy that again we came in talked about it Jeff keeper mentioned it at the top of his Scouting Report when we said keys he said look Quentin post has really been a matchup problem and the job that Federico Federico did on him tonight while holding Clinton post the guy that came into this game averaging 21 points a game over his last seven games really to me that was the key in the game and both posts in Ashton Langford fouled out of this game you know its funny Jeff Campbell said we know Boston College is going to be so physical and yet it was pit that out physical BC tonight they did and I I you know you look at these numbers for them points in the paint a pit dominated that as well to a 22 to Boston Colleges 12 everybody in the building wishing for aided fish to get into the score sheet Music yeah youll see him and shoot around lead huddles and do so much behind the scenes that youll never see getting some welldeserved playing time in an ACC matchup delivery Applause Music D3 from Kelly and it goes Chase Kelly The Freshman hes been a bright spot tonight alongside of Mason Manson he really has again theyre really high on him shared the Freshman of the week honors uh this past week and he continues to get better under Earl Kelly excuse me Earl Grant for Boston College back to back big losses where did he go from here if youre BC well I think look a couple of things Chaz Kelly just talked about him but hes getting more minutes uh now I think the biggest issue theyve had is theyve gone through these scoring droughts again theyre not a team thats going to be Marchman from the threepoint line I think defensively they cannot have breakdowns because of their lack I think a threepoint shooting so again defensive breakdowns tonight against a team Mike Pitt they really struggled defending the threepoint line and then points off the turnovers go ahead again pit 16 points off of turnovers thats difficult to do on the road against a team like Pitt thats really a so efficient offensively Applause Music Music thank you take a look at jamarius Burton on the bench hes the leader of this team hes the guy again to me that should be at the top of the list when you start talking about players of the year and the ACC Applause you look at his stat line tonight 10 points perfect six or six from the free throw line five rebounds and three assists Music and we set it at the top of the show an ACC Player of the Year Canada that you dont hear his name in that conversation nearly enough foreign Applause ERS in the ACC as well it was a gritty performance by this pit team Jeff Capel spread it out shot the three ball Blake Henson but for me Federico Federico to me was the guy that set the tone defensively shutting down Boston Colleges best offensive threat and its a program Record 12 ACC wins for a team that was picked preseason number 14
