Last year was a Mustangs 34 point win Carlton committed 23 turnovers in that one and we are underway Happy opening night to you and yours Charlton gets first possession and McDow wearing number 11 tonight Normally wearing number 55 for the Texans Heres the rest of the starting lineup which also features Freddy Hicks Well hear more about him in just a moment from Bree Sorenson who is roaming courtside inside and he walks with it A nice pick a little action They get it down to Impaca who generally can face up and go to work but that time he caught it a little bit too tall but the pressure from the Mustangs caught him off guard Thats the one thing that youll notice this year about the Mustangs They really want to focus on defense Its one of the reasons why Cory Washington was brought on board Poopy Miller working it inside to Cory Washington Theres the Mustangs starting that features BJ Edwards Rims out on his first attempt of the season Its usually very difficult to get a paint touch especially early against Charltons defense but that one really helped him McDow off the mark the second leading scorer in NCAA Division 2 last year Leroy Kelly the fourth misses and we are still scoreless through one minute of play Edwards doesnt get it to go Hell go to the free throw line in an attempt to get the Mustangs first points Thats where the strength really helps out BJ Edwards And you notice he took a straight line and didnt go around the defender He goes through him Dan Dens talked about that earlier in the week and about how thats what great attacking guards do And thats one of the things that Edwards brings to this team Hes tough He can play great defense but also offensively he can drive and draw fouls and thats really improved from his offseason strength SMU has its first point of the season thanks to Edwards at the line Has his mind set this year Scott on winning ACC defensive player of the year Well he can do it And this is a guy Edwards that you know not only works hard but hes worked on his offensive game too He wants to be a better threepoint shooter Uh this SMU team hasnt really shot it like they want them to shoot it the first two exhibitions but uh theyll get better Shormu throwing one up from the left side wing Its good And we take a look at our keys to the game Scott got to win the turnover battle for Charleton State No question They cant come in here and turn it over 23 times against SU like they did a season ago Heres Edwards firing from left side Punch and counter punch from distance Thats the three ball that BJ has been working on day in and day out since the start of June Hell be better this year from beyond the arc Mustangs lead five to three And McDow an exciting addition to this Charleton State roster taking it outside to DJ Dormu Now in to Freddy Hicks rejoined the roster on Thursday And you watch Sam Walters here And I love how he defends making Freddy Hicks fade from the basket as he turns and goes paint rather than going baseline right there Made it a tough shot and ensured that Hicks had no chance at a threepoint play Freddy Hicks the senior in cheering Cersei Arkansas off the mark on his first attempt Hes quite a story This is a guy that was Billy Gillespys prized recruit Freddy Hicks who left went to Arkansas State where his dad played and now here he is back at Charlton and he just got eligible yesterday and more on that in a moment from Brie Hicks hitting on the back end Carlton within one Rookie Miller 132 points per game last year for the Mustangs Inside to Sam Walters working hard in the paint No good That might not go in game one but in game seven or eight hes going to be muddy Heres Hicks driving in the lane No good But hell cheering go to the line Fouled by Walters And thats why this is a guy that Billy Gillespie said we got to have We got to get this guy back somehow He returns to the program last year Notice how he draws the foul and had a chance to finish And for Walters thats two personals already And were only 2 minutes and 20 seconds deep And 5 years ago he was named all wager of the year He is just fantastic makes him go 55 Texans and Mustangs as Geron Pierre Jr checks in as a Mustang for the first time The Conference USA player of the year last season at Jacksonville State only shot 36 against the Mustangs in Moody last year That has to improve for them to have a chance but theyre hanging two and a half minutes in Hicks hits both Texans lead by one Miller to Cory Washington and on to BJ Edwards Edwards inside to Cement Iollu Kicks it out in and out The Mustangs get it done First points for Pierre Jeron Pierre can create his own shot But he didnt need to because when you dump it down inside to the big man and hes got that kind of space and draws the double somebodys going to be open on the perimeter and the Mustangs knock it down SMU retakes the lead Its 86 now three minutes deep in the first half But those are the shots that the Mustangs are going to have repeatedly adnauseium perhaps if they can play with the kind of spacing theyre playing with here and the kind of spacing we saw against Oklahoma State short on his attempt Charlton State one of four trying to get it up to Igolu unsuccessful on the alley and weve seen two plays now by cement and Sam Walters previously that will start to fall as this team gets games under its belt Theyre a little rusty right now They havent played much when the lights have been on but this is going to be a much different SNU team this year knocked away and Kelly back over to Dormu on the S for the SMU midcourt logo inside to Hicks trying to work it to Andy Sigaskar No good Edwards all alone finally get some company but does roll it in One of the problems that Charlton had against TCU and why they lost by 30 plus about two weeks ago was getting back in transition Its very odd for a Billy Gillespie coach team to not sprint back but this is what SNU is trying to do They want to run first and then set up that pick and roll motion second They want a high percentage of plays with a broken floor Texans havent scored in over 2 and 12 minutes trying to break that skid Cant do it there with McDow Look at Pierre get up there for that basketball and highpointed and gets it to Miller kicking it back outside Now Edwards into Yugu The Turkish tower unsuccessful Well go to our first timeout at Moody Coliseum SMU leads 10 to6 Yiku will be at the line when we return from the Hilltop Thats right He missed 25 games last season but because the NCAA bans red shirts after the seasons midpoint and Freddy played a few games after that date his eligibility was denied Hicks and his attorney took the case to court arguing that his surgery complications made the rule unfair Now under this temporary injunction hes cleared to play while the NCAA reviews Tarltons appeal When talking to coach Gillespie he said that Hicks is the best player at Charlton in the D1 area And he deserves to play on this team this season And Bri the big question coming in would would Billy Gillespie choose to ease picks in Scott or let him into the starting lineup immediately chose the ladder and it only makes sense since hes only guaranteed two weeks of play No doubt And hes good enough to where it doesnt make any difference how much time hes missed or practice Hes going to be able to fit right in Here he is with the ball Freddy Hicks in the lane getting it to Siguscar and he moves around to throw it down Thats why Billy Gillespie says the sky is the limit for Andy Siguscar What great footwork Caught himself under the basket A very simple adjustment Great spacing that time for the Texan offense MU adds three to the scoreboard Theres Boopy Miller His first points of the season This is what Boopy brings to you Not only can he get a paint touch and get two feet in the paint to suck that defense in and kick it out he can also score but his defense has really impressed the first two games Thats really what theyve emphasized for her coming into the season 148 SMU in front Sigasar againu Well thats going to be a really good match up Sigar sits 69 giving three inches to submit Pierre gets hit hard by Kaia Isaac and hell have attempts from the charity stripe Take a look at the footwork here Its so impressive Nice step through move by Sigashkar You just dont see guys that are 69 230 able to do stuff like that And then the Mustangs retaliate and they knock down the long range bomb Heres Pierre 216 points per game last year That ranked him fourth in the NCAA second best returning player this season And Ill say this when you look at the big men going to the foul line here cemented and now Pierre at 65 66 and these bigs that are able to draw fouls get to the line and then knock down foul shots at an 80 clip Uh if youre Andy Infield and this coaching staff you got to like what youre seeing here 1610 SMU after a pair of good free throws by Pierre And I just love how the Mustangs have worked on their halfcourt offense to the extent where their spacing looks so refined in game one But I really think thats where the exhibitions come in with the NCAA allowing teams to play not one but two and have them open under the lights I think it just helps you going in to game number one when traditionally its been such a beating to watch teams try to function at the half court previously Dior Johnson a headliner among the newcomers for Charleston State Thats a tough shot Thats a shot that youre okay with at your handy infield Charlton State taking But uh thats a tough make The air driving baseline slapped away Charlton State on the run gets out of the hands of Impaca Well thats what Talton States got to do Theyve got to be able to run the floor against these guys Floats one up Swatted away but its a goend It is but the undersized in pocket 66 making a culture play that time Mitchell Holmes has his first two points as a Mustang And great teams like Billys team they dont want to give up layups They dont want to give up any easy buckets Even if its a goalend you dont want to let the opponent see it go through especially on their home court 18 to 12 SMU 1320 to go Heres Dormu Quick work He got down that left lane in a hurry Hes quick He knows what to do with the ball What court vision great decision making Thats the athleticism that Gillespie has not had in his time with Stevenville and Dalton State Washington drives to the hole SMU increases its lead to six Thats a nice job And again uh this the floor spacing getting state spread out Theyre generally extremely tough in allowing opponents to get inside And Paka looking for a man Its Dior Johnson the junior transfer from Clarendon Started his career at Pittsburgh Did Dior Johnson one of the best players music in that class of 22 worked his way back going down to the Jo level where he was the best in the nation in scoring Billy Gillespie leads Tarlton State his sixth season at the helm of the Texans last year 12 and 20 mark finished sixth in the whack Obviously a storyried career for Gillespie won wack coach of the year at UTF Big 12 coach of the year at Texas AM led Kentucky to the NCA tournament then a short short stint at Texas Tech and later made his way to Stevenville You mentioned the name Billy Gillespie and his tentacles are so far extending that theres not a person in college basketball that doesnt know this guy Hes built his programs on toughness Its not necessarily the scoring Its about doing the dirty work and he builds his roster to where hes got like 20 guys he can choose from and hell pick the top seven or eight that week in practice that will play in his 200th career win in January And he has done such a great job You know every season hes been at Charlton theyve gotten better and better They started with 10 wins 5 years ago then they went to 14 wins then Charlton knocked down 17 Ws And how about two years ago when Billy actually was having some health issues and Joe Jones took over and got whack coach of the year with Billys players 25 wins Charlton was able to notch Struggled last year through the injuries only 112 Texans down by four on the road Heres Pierre Goes back outside the threepoint line First look at Nigel Walls into the SMU lineup Boopy Miller throwing it up for the Turkish tower throws it down I was impressed with the first step quickness by Duffy Then he almost lost it and somehow was able to push it to cement to convert Second chance opportunity coming for the Texans This is what the Texans are known for They dont usually get just one shot Sometimes its two And you better not let him have a third Sixpoint advantage for SMU Look at SNU turn up defensively Isaac falls to the hardwood Kicks it outside to Dormu who switches it home with a shot clock winding down An absolute prayer by DJ Dormu But thats why he played 40 minutes against Texas AM in their final exhibition Charleton State trims the deficit to three Under 12 minutes to go in the opening half Hand it off to Miller Gollu goes back inside Miller with a fake and a good shot off the glass An incredible shot right there Great poise great patience a great step through move and a really nice finish there by Boofy Miller We didnt see that very often from Boofy Hes become more crafty than even where he finished last season with those 24 wins SMU lead is now five points Heres Isaac with the whistle coming No shot by Isaac away from the ball and Tarlton State hanging in there down by five with music under 12 to go Yiku making his presence felt on opening night music Enfield told me that BJ Edwards has taken major strides this off season especially on music the offensive end Last year Edwards was one of the best defenders in the country setting an SMU record with 83 steals But this season Enfield wants him to be more of an offensive threat He said hes improved his shooting his decision making and the team needs him to score a little more after losing three double figure scorers last season Edwards told me hes been working closely with coach Enfield on speeding up his threepoint shot and working this summer on his conditioning And coach said he expects him to be a more confident and consistent scorer not just for himself but for his teammates too And we can see him doing that right now leading the Mustangs with seven points And Bri another thing that coach Enfield pointed out is that BJ now has the most swagger of anybody on this team Also the leadership this season Edwards firing from distance Straight on No good That space right there Nice shot in rhythm by BJ Just could not quite knock it down But you know you and I were talking during the break about the turnovers and about how Tarlton State has only uh you know forced a few in the exhibition games and none so far tonight The Mustangs have really taken care of the basketball Mustangs nearly forcing another There they do SMU gets possession Well this Mustang team on pace for over aundred points tonight and they had five games where they scored over a 100 last year That one bounces off of the chest of the freshman Nigel Walls Theres an Andy Enfield the secondyear head coach of the Mustangs Last year SMU 241 number one seed in the NIT His arrival in Dallas came after 11 years at Southern Cal 220 wins there the third most for head coach in Trojanss history And those 24 wins matching the largest win total since 30 wins a school record making the NCAA tournament in 2017 a place where they really feel like they can challenge for this year stoppage of play and Lee Cassell music talking it over with Andy Enfield on the SMU side and now hell go to the scorers table Previous possession by SMU is under review Chase Shaw Chandler Burton making up the rest of our threeman crew tonight with SMU leading by five 249 Think somebody might have gotten hit in the face I think thats what theyre reviewing Check and see I think that I think Owens might have taken the bump there Well go back and take a look on the DV Sport music replay system But regardless you know Tarlton came in here last year and gave up a whole bunch of points Lets take a look at this again Well you got to like the hustle right there Everybody diving for that loose basketball And thats Archie on the floor Isaac excuse me on the floor diving for it for Charlton State Isaac the former professional in New Zealand actually played in an exhibition game and scored six points against the Oklahoma Thunder in eight minutes So its a guy that can get after it Another addition to Charlton State but yeah a long look here But I mentioned you know the Mustangs scored 100 points five times last year but it wasnt against Charlton Charlton gave up 96 against him But if theyre going to have a chance to come back in this one theyve got to start turning these guys over music They dont have one turnover yet I think they officially might have given them a second That would have been the first one right there Scott Right there It went off of walls and out of bounds And again heres Edwards from the threepoint line Look inside Hikus right arm gets in Miselles face Jordan Miselle the sophomore from just down the road in Plano Texas Yeah a guy that helped Plano East High School win the state championship after they went 40 and0 Hes one of their main stays at the Garden Spot Theyve got to have him lengthy review and Lee Cassell will now explain to Billy Gillespie what the officials found and well get Chase Shaw over here to tell us not possession that just happened previous so it wasnt that possession It was the previous one Will be 30 second timeout will be erased from their total and Tarleton State will lose a timeout after challenging them But nothing doing and Charlton State will retain music possession after the turnover The SMUs first turnover of the night Some fullourt pressure right here after the timeout You know great coaches always change the defense after a lengthy timeout and generally after any timeout Andy Infield putting some token fullcourt pressure on right there and looked pretty good doing it Pretty good rotation out of it 10 minutes to go in the opening half Kate Douglas the transfer from UT Arlington fresh into the game throwing it up from distance hits Isaac But they made Tarlton work for that Isaac The exro knocking that thing down How about Jermaine ONeal denying the straight line drive earlier in the possession Nice job by the freshman from Dynamic Prep Isaac with his first points as a Charlton State Texan Pierre gets it to roll in He has seven now Boy the kind roll right there by Geron Pierre A guy that again can create his own shot 65 210 What a nice addition to the SNU lineup Jordan Miselle just past midcourt Hicks gets it back And Pierre by the way he took some tough contested shots against Oklahoma State A tough 20footer but man is he strong off the bounce And right there you take a look at Freddy Hicks Hicks has been on the floor a lot so far in this game Hes the heartbeat of this Charlton team Hes played now 10 of the 11 minutes SMU has three players who have nine plus minutes of PT Edwards IU and Miller DJ Dormu he has eight points to lead the Texans Oh great pressure right here by top of the key hits One second on the shot clock Hicks at the buzzer off the rim Boy they get the offensive rebound but how about Boopy making Charlton go deep into the possession The Texans could even start off till eight on the shot clock Dormu behind his back to Hicks Followed it for a moment regains possession gets it to roll in And Hicks now has seven points Just incredible toughness right there Hicks not deterred by the 72 Turkish post cement Yigu he was still able to finishu falling to the ground tripped over Dormu How about Charlton also ratcheting up the pressure here on the perimeter Pierre trying to go between a pair of Texans draws contact Yeah and thats just a simple mistake by the senior Cam McDow just did not get over in time He wasnt in legal guarding position Youve got to be straight in front Instead Pierre forces the defensive split Timeout on the floor SMU leading by two target But hey the difference is last year SMU own the paint 382 in terms of paint scoring Right now absolutely deadlocked at eight Thats the diff and thats the difference in this Tarleton lineup from last year Theyve added some length Theyve added some size and obviously theyre able to compete Billy feels like this is the best lineup if hes been able to roll out in the division one era Mustangs had a 323 run to pull away early last season in this matchup Now were midway more than midway through the first half Mustangs lead only three But remember Billy had four starters that were out due to injury and they were out for most of the year Problems throughout the season last year for the Texans wound up 12 and 20 on the year sixth place in the whack And how about the Mustangs going into a zone defense right here forcing the Texans to hit shots from the perimeter 5 seconds on the shot clock McDow leftwing triple Only nylon on that one Im thinking he didnt have his entire hand on the ball to shoot a knuckle ball up there Pierre gets hit by Cam McDow McDow still looking for his first points as a Texan Last year the second best scoreer in NCAA Division 2 at Northwest Oklahoma State But playing an ACC opponent a little bit different than playing East Texas AM 7 days ago when he had 18 points on seven of 12 shooting two of five from deep One of two exhibition games that the Texans played at their new arena in Stevenville Miller rattles out Yugu gets the board and another Theyll have to go to the charity stripe to get his points but a great offensive rebound and a nice job by the 72 center for the Mustangs to stay with it He didnt get impatient He kept the ball high when he got that second chance and he forced Charlton to double down on him Those are the bunnies that Chris Capco and Andy Infield and the entire coaching staff want to see him start making consistently Igatou confident and comfortable this year Battle tested now after a season in the ACC Coaches want to see him be a true rim protector Hes made a bunch of adjustments with the new country culture the school and style of play And how about the footwork The footwork for cement has improved considerably Hes worked so hard with Eric Mobley the assistant coach who works with the the big men for the Mustangs and he is so much better now than he was last year and hes able to get himself in position to finish at the rim And he just really struggled with that last year Mustangs lead 2824 Dormu baseline pass but gets hit before he sends it away One of the things that you notice about Charlton State is that all of their guards not just their point guard but their ones twos and threes are not afraid even though theyre undersized to go right at defenders here and try to go through them to draw the fouls Shor move from underneath the Texans basket knocked around regained by Isaac and he gets the triple to fall Thats two threepointers for him in the early going And for him to shoot in rhythm after all of that chaos at the deflection is a credit to him Hes a senior Its his only year of eligibility Hes out of New Zealand Hes already played in the professional ranks overseas And he has the Texans within a single point of SMU in Dallas music Scott we said off the top of the broadcast that Impacua would have to be locked in for the Texans to stand a chance Its shocking the basketball world tonight Well he is yet to take a single shot No points for Impaca just a single rebound And they were really focused on him They did not want Impaca to beat him They were also concerned about the dirty word that all of these guys play with with Talton State They will get after you and they will force you to get sped up And the Mustangs were kind of leaning on their experience of BJ Edwards and Goofy Miller to keep their head on their shoulders Its Dior Johnson Welcome back to D1 basketball And Dior Johnson and company hitting on the road And that was going to be a key to success Can they shoot well They wanted to shoot well because Charlton only shot 36 against SMU last year Only shot 32 from deep But here they are right now They are five of 10 And this is very unusual for an opponent to come into Moody Coliseum and be able to knock down these shots particularly late in the shot clock And weve seen three of them already nailed with the shot clock under five Fifth lead change of the night A 6 run for the Texans And Charlton State leads by two Rupy Miller good and will have another attempt Now Boopy Miller again hes been the best guard on the floor of either team either SMU or its opponent Texas Oklahoma State so far scoring getting into the paint being crafty Hes got all the tricks that you want out of a little guy He is much improved from last year I thought he was really good last year Tied at 30 after Miller hits both Coming up on six minutes left in the first half This is the timeline Texan team out of the wag picked second Johnson a little too strong Well Charlton State runs their domino Their 212 press They got a good look out of it And Scott you look through I think every preseason magazine that there is on the news stands You found one that said Tarleton should be sec second music place in the WAC The official preseason poll has them a little bit lower Pick the fifth Theyve got him fifth but Im not sure about that because remember theyve lost Grand Canyon They dont have them a part of the conference anymore a part of the WAG Seattles gone I cant imagine that Charlton State would not compete for the WAC J especially given what were seeing here Were 15 minutes into this game Were tied at 30 against a team thats picked sixth or seventh in the ACC Are you kidding me They got them fifth I I want to check that They really do look like championship contenders in the Western Athletic Conference on this opening night Only seven teams in the WAC for this years alignment and its the last year as the WAC Next year the United Athletic Conference will incorporate basketball and all of their sports Right now the UAC only has football but the WAC will rebrand They will score more on the eastern side of the United States So the whack doesnt fit anymore It doesnt re regionally but do any of these teams fit anymore regionally I mean I dont understand why you would lose that branding You know how hard it is when you change a businesss name That branding is so key Im shocked theyre doing that Dormu off the front iron When you add in West Georgia to the league I suppose they thought were no longer Western So now the United Athletic Conference will be the branding in future years but one more year under that historic whack banner for Charleton State and the other 16 Boy how about Freddy Hicks finishing at the rim here Didnt quite get it to go but draws another foul Charlton will have a chance to retake the lead with Hicks at the free throw line and the clock stopped at 529 as SMU has gone on a long drought here 4 minutes and 6 seconds without a field goal And while the Texans have brrawn fouls Freddys the only one thats been able to get to the rim and doing it Tied at 31 And you know Charlton its the same team Theyre more talented They score better Gleski is getting to play hard Its the one thing that Andy Infield was so concerned about coming in because they want this game unorganized They want it dirty Charleton State fouls a whole lot defensively Weve already seen that But I like how cement Yigutou and the other bigs for the Mustangs are not deterred Theyre knocking down foul shots Texans retake the lead 3231 Knocked away by Kelly And I love how the Mustangs are really applying pressure to that Charlton defense They music beat them down the floor a few times You look at the fast break points Charltons minus five in that department The Mustangs seven fast break points of their 31 But I guarantee you the fast breaking has allowed them to get paint touches and kickouts that dont necessarily go in Feeding to Pierre hanging on the rim It does not fall but SMU will have a chance to go back ahead at the free throw line And no one was wearing the crown that time for Charlton State meaning guarding the basket They were trying to match up manto man It was very difficult for them to defend there Brie Sorenson has more on Pierre Yeah coach Andy Enfield told me that transfer Jeron Pierre Jr gives this SMU team an experienced scorer and playmaker with next level potential Pierre comes from Jacksonville State where he was the Conference USA player of the year averaging almost 22 points per game fourth in the entire NCAA in scoring along with nearly six rebounds He shot 38 from three and Enfield said they recruited him because hes a proven scorer who can really create for others Luffy Miller also stressed how he can drive it and kick it out which will take a lot of pressure off of him and help his game as well But you know they also recruited him to create his own shot They need him to take the right shot though And he took some tough shots A long 20footer that was ill advised against Oklahoma State So hes still learning 3332 SMU with the lead 515 to go in the first half Dormu trying to find a seam does and gets it off glass Well some of these guards like Dormu are able to attack going away from the bucket yet still finish off the window That is a really tough shot for a righthander left to the paint Texans back in front 34 music 33 That is nine lead changes today You know getting back to Dormu hes small but hes really tough And you look at Tarleton State there he is Dorm music Hes quick Knows what to do with a basketball but he is tough to defend because he is so deadly from 12 ft and in So the lead has changed nine times Scott But Charlton State has not been able to hold on to that lead for very long They only have the lead for one minute of this opening half SMU has led for 12 minutes and 46 seconds But for a team that came in here last year and gave up 96 points to be able to keep the scoring down when shots were falling all over the map on the shot chart the first five minutes of this game This is an absolute win for Billy Gillespies team Mustangs 35 Texans 34 Still a lot of basketball left to be played but Charlton State certainly forcing a lot of people to click over here to ACC Network Extra and see whats going on on the hilltop Boy Kristen Pac and Cemetu continue to go at it from the top of the key No good Iu kicks it out and Kelly able to get the board Owens off of Impaka and out of bounds I thought the close out by Malik Archie music really sped up the shot right there That was just fantastic by the Mustangs Chance Purer will take the ball out of bounds The red shirt freshman from right here in Dallas Former Carter Cowboy Miselle up close on Miller Miller takes it himself falling away SMUs first field goal in nearly 5 and 12 minutes Absolutely incredible play Taking the bump able to finish 15 ft from the basket We didnt see that last year from Duby Watch this Takes the bump initiates contact falling away and somehow got it to go Incredible SMUs lead is three Miller can make it four That was a really nice play by Boopy And again hes righthanded but his game has come so far He wants to be a pro He wants to play in the NBA And as they talked about he knows what hes got to do For a guy his size to get drafted to have a career in the NBA hes got to work toward the little things and do it on a daily basis and you see the little things really surfacing as being a difference in his game from this year to last Miller missed some time last season with an injury He did hurt the Mustangs a lot I think most people were convinced that this team could have made a run to the NCAA tournament if Miller was available more often I agree And of the five games he missed during the regular season during the ACC schedule the Mustangs lost three of those Also in the NIT he wasnt available He didnt play because of a hand injury so the injuries uh cost him seven games Thats almost a third of your schedule Whistle away from the ball SMU leads by four A tight one on the Hilltop Happy opening day to you and yours Cam McDow a huge addition Second best scoreer in D2 Dior Johnson top scorer in JO last year SMU revamping its roster as well but they do return three starters from last season They add the nations fourth ranked high school recruiting class Scott they do And when youve got your point guard back thats so starstudded like Booby Miller and youve got the 72 See Gatu back and you add Germaine ONeal BJ Ray Davis Jaden Tombs who we havent talked much about tonight and Billy White What a lineup for Andy Infield and this SMU coaching staff They have just uh theyve been so excited just to get on the floor and this is a big night for the Mustangs Tombs is unavailable tonight with a wrist injury expected to be reevaluated in a few weeks from long range Theres Pierre Its Pierre and its the Mustangs rattling off now Eight in a row and doing a really good job over the last one minute and 20 seconds Charlton State going to try to stop the bleeding here cheering and applause foul on Tarlton and theyll whistle Osipher Owens Now this is a big moment of the game and Billy Gillespie that you just saw talked about how in every game theres a 4minute stretch that decides it and you wonder if this might not be it because remember Charlton had the lead by one just about a minute and a half two minutes ago but things have changed in a hurry Miller picking it outside and thats out of bounds just in front of the Tarlton State bench And Chris you talked about how Tarltons got some new additions but the one thing we did not mention is that they lost WAC freshman of the year Katon Bristo who went to Alabama Hes a guy that as a freshman averaged 113 points per game And they also dont have Boo Boo Benjamin who was a 14 points per game guy who went to George Washington So theyve also lost some players Blue taps that one out of bounds Ball will stay with the Texans Ka Isaac will inbounds from just in front of our broadcast position Mustangs of course losing Chuck Harris losing Matt Cross who by the way just about a week and a half two weeks ago Just got cut by the Mavericks I thought they were going to be able to add him to the roster but you lose Matt Cross you lose Kerry Aquendo you lose Johan Trey But the two big names there were Harris and Matt Cross that they really feel like Cory Washingtons a guy that can do the dirty work thats a little bit longer more athletic that can take Crosss plays Charlton has a chance to end its scoring drought thats at 2 minutes and 11 seconds right now as the Mustangs are out to a 4134 lead Off the mark on the free throw Charlton State now seven of 10 from the free throw line Mustangs are 15 of 20 Boy thats a big miss when youre seeing an opponent going on an eight nothing run at their place to open the season and you dont hit bounce shots Boy Billy Gillespie not happy about it Edwards outside to Boopy It rims out Boy and that could have been a huge three as cement trying to go over the back of Andy Siguscar and tap it to a teammate Accidentally tapped it out of bounds Check the turnover battle there Scott We mentioned that being a big issue tonight Carlton State has given the ball away seven times SMU just twice Marzelle cant end the drought Now over two and a half minutes for the Texans And now the Texans have to go back to work defensively Youd really like to see a good take right here by the Mustangs Is ONeal too strong Not right there Thats a tough baseline jumper Thats Thats a shot that Billy Gillespie would like to see SMU take only every time down the floor Kate Douglas the UT Arlington transfer his first points as a Charlton State player Well thats a tough running jumper right there Charltons made a number of those tonight Theyre 12 of 23 from the floor and thats why theyre shooting at 52 Fivepoint advantage for SMU Turning around its Pierre He has a game high 15 points Most guys cant attack that deep on the baseline against that kind of pressure Pierre can do it Hes got the handles And thats why he led Conference USA in scoring last year at 22 a game Pierre making his fourth collegiate stop here at SMU under Andy Infield began at Southern Miss then two years at Witchaw State before one season at Jacksonville State And just so impressed with his shot making ability You look at Pierre thats why they recruited him but they needed him to take the right takes but they really feel like playing with Boopy Miller is going to help his game He plays hard Boopy plays hard These two guys should really help each other K Douglas at the line from nearby Lancaster Texas scored in double figures in four consecutive conference games for UTA last year Stays in the whack and moves to the rival Texans And this guys shooting right now for Talton Probably their best shooter He was just fantastic this last summer for Charlton Douglas hits both Charlton State within five Under 90 seconds remaining in the first half Edwards looked like he walked with it there but they dont whistle Yeah he gathered He got to the rim He just couldnt quite get the extension on that shot Nice move by BJ But those are the moves and those are the attacks we did not see from him consistently last year but they like how hes put on some strength BJs work to improve his threepoint shooting Hes releasing it quicker as Bri had talked about earlier in the broadcast but his ability to get to the basket has improved too able to keep it from going out of bounds Edwards now gives it away Heres Douglas moving quickly Washington able to catch up from behind Nice job by Washington to get there And thats the dirty work Thats the Matt Cross type Theyre going to see number three right there If youre worried about losing Matt Cross which I hated after last season to have this guy as a pickup the Witchah State transfer a high motor guy he is just fantastic He was a 148 guy a 66 swing man but he brings an element of toughness that we havent seen around here in a long time Gazelle out to Owens now on the SMU logo with Isaac Under 10 seconds left on the shot clock 52 seconds left on the game clock Fading away off the side of the backboard No good When Isaac got to his spot you dont see that lefty shooting off the side of the glass very often insideu Hell head to the line battling with Siguscar down low But what about the decision by Edwards to dump it to the big man Rather than shoot a tough runner he says Ill get it to my 72 guy and let him go to work Edwards wont get credit in the stat sheet for that That was a fantastic play by BJ IU telling us that last year was all about adjusting new country new culture but now finally feels at home in Dallas You and he had great decision after great decision against Oklahoma State Great footwork great balance great free throw shooting Are you serious You know he was in the 50s last year with his free throw shooting 72 center If they can get him in the 60s they will really feel like theyve made a step with cement And tonight you look at his free throw shooting How about three of five Thats really good to start in game number one Five points on the night Make it six Nice for Iu the sophomore from Turkey 67 tonight from the line for cement That you hell take that every night for the big man and hes going to go to the line a lot because his footwork has improved Hes learned how to draw fouls 25 seconds left in the first half Battling and Sigasar loses that one tool And how about the ability to contest without fouling right there when did a great job to reverse the ball and get him oneonone in the post 132 Two seconds music remaining in the opening half of 15 SMU 45 Charlton State 38 SMU has been able to force seven turnovers and score seven points off of those tonight music That is the difference it is And you cannot come into Moody Coliseum and give up music 40 plus points and a half and expect to win a game But thats what Charlton has done here Only six times all year last year did Charlton give up more than music 40 in the first half Pierre inbounds to the back court to Miller 10 seconds left Screen set by Igolu 5 seconds Pierre from long range hits with two seconds left on the clock Douglas unable to get the shot off before the buzzer and Billy Gillespies really push the ball and putting pressure and playing while music the defense is in transition and also just the fact that theyre just playing so hard They got to really like the effort SMU has been really good on opening day 13 straight victories to start the season You have to go all the way back to the 2011 2012 season to find the last time the Mustangs lost on opening night It was against Little Rock A 10point loss here on this floor at Moody Coliseum Sam Yuto gets the first two points of the second half for SMU And thats what youre going to start seeing as the Mustangs are knocking down perimeter jumpers Five threes the first 20 minutes You see defenders getting out on shooters That leaves cement oneonone He will absolutely eat your lunch Hes much improved from last season 12point lead for SMU Biggest advantage of the night Freddy Hicks against Sam Walters And Hicks will head to the free throw line where he is seven of eight tonight Thats why Freddy is so crafty Walters very frustrated but boy thats what Freddy Hicks does He really had no no sights on trying to finish that shot He was just trying to dig in to Walters and he was able to draw the foul Hes been going to the foul line consistently This will be foul shots nine and 10 already for Freddy Hicks Reed told us the story at the start of our broadcast picks granted a temporary restraining order on Thursday that allows him to play at least the first two weeks of the season hoping its a step to regain full eligibility And he played at Charlton his first three years then decided to transfer out to Arkansas State Thats where his dad played And he said I dont like this I really like Coach Gillespie and his program And now here he is back in his second stint second year of his second stint down low to Washington off the glass and down Boy the transition game for the Mustangs has been really really good tonight Youve got to like the fast break points and you know officially nine but the reality is theyve probably gotten half of their points off of press uh the fast breaks and fast break possessions just being able to reverse the ball and play while Tarlton is not able to set up their defense going down the right side of the lane and kicking it back out Its Miselle to Hicks faking to get Walters out of the way Rolls out Nearly had a chance at a fourpoint play Instead hell have three shots Well you never want to foul a jump shooter And Boopy Miller made such a great play early in the possession forcing the drive off the straight line And then he closes out hard on Hicks And as soon as he left his feet you could see the reaction of Boopy He knew he got himself in trouble And Hicks again able to go back to the foul line Hicks leads Tarlton State with 12 points We didnt know for sure in the hours leading up to this one Scott whether Hicks would be eased into the lineup or whether he would play as much as possible He started hes played for over 15 minutes and hes the leading scorer This is a guy that hardly ever comes off the floor for Billy Gillespie Remember two years ago at Arkansas State this is a guy that was Sunbell Conference all tournament team at Charlton all whack player three seasons ago He is fantastic And uh what a coup for Billy Gillespie to be able to get him back for another season Theyre hoping for a full one more season at least two weeks for now We will certainly be watching that story after this evening is complete Well it was a difficult last four minutes for Billy Gillespie to stomach because they played so well and then they just went cold and Paka rolls it off Look at that Is there for the board back outside another chance for the Texans driving baseline back outside picked off by Edwards Edwards one on two without numbers still able to get the ball to go in It was the right pass by Freddy Hicks to kick it out He just couldnt put enough on it Great awareness by BJ to cut in front and pick that ball off and then to take it the length of the floor That is a fantastic play and a winning play that hopefully well see consistently come ACC time 11 point SMU advantage 54 43 17 and 12 minutes to go in the second half Offensive foul called on Tarlton State trying to drive around the SMU defender Pierre Well when youre setting the ball screen youve got to let the guard do the work And you saw Chris and Paka just squeakaked that hip out He just nudged that hip out And when he did that you knew that the offensive foul was coming But youve got to credit SMU for going over the top of that ball screen Thats why youve got to go over the top of it consistently because youll force those offensive fouls at the timeline An unnecessary foul there from Kaia Isaac Thats his third Not a good foul right there And Billy Gillespie kind of scratching his head He knows his team is in it but you just cant make mistakes like that And Billy may wastes no time pulling him out saying Hey what are we doing here Im not a great lip reader Mhm I dont think coach Blesby was happy I think youre right about that It was something along the lines of what are you doing laughter Driving to the rack Follow no good Youu got it Another chance at the free throw line coming for cement Thats what the lane by Cory Washington will afford the Mustangs to do When you can get a second chance a third chance and when sometimes your best offense is a miss shot like it was right there you know youve got the opponent right where you want him But this guy Cory Washington talk about doing the dirty work Matt Cross a guy that made a jump with his shooting Theyre hoping that Cory Washington can do that as well But even if he just gives you what you just saw hell be a really valuable member to this SMU team But I want to look at the shot form right here by Ceette Uh this is the best Ive ever seen him shoot Uh he would rarely finish high When you shoot foul shots youve got to get your elbow into the ball and youve got to finish with your hand in the cookie jar with a high release We did not see him with this kind of high release at all last season He was short on it You get to stay at nine points He averaged 10 per game last year Might have short on that last one Under 17 minutes to go Hicks gets the screen from Impaca instead of going to him goes across to Johnson and Johnson gets whacked as he goes baseline But is it was really the ball screen action that allowed that play to happen 60 of ball screens in the NBA result in an opposite corner pass which is what we just saw But I really like how Johnson takes advantage of it He attacks the close out draws the foul Really good offense by the Texans Johnson again has the ball in his hands Now its Dormu at the top of the key trying to find a seam Back door to Hicks Knocked away Hicks trying to improvise It was a great cut just not a great pass Walters from distance off the front of the iron Boy brought down by Dormoot Look at that effort by Washington I thought he almost had that ball Foul called on Edwards Boy how about the entire Charlton bench bouncing up applauding that play It doesnt matter what the score is They dont play to the scoreboard The very next possession is the most important for the Texans Its what Billy Gillespie and Grains in this team And you see them playing with that now Thats the one thing that uh Chris Capco and Andy Infield talked about coming in It doesnt matter what the score is Theyre going to keep playing hard Theyre going to force us to be good mentally from start to finish And more than anything tonight Coach Gillespie told us he wanted to see that effort and pride He said that was not something that showed up in their initial exhibition game against TCU It didnt There was a loose ball Nobody do for it Billy Gillespie couldnt believe it And they only forced one turnover in in a half in that ball game How How can you win a game doing that Horn Frogs made a visit to Stevenville to open up the new building on Charlton State University campus Played an additional exhibition against East Texas AM Theyll play their first regular season game there on Saturday against TexasM Corpus Christie reaching up and getting it in Its Chris Empaka Thats his first point of the night Scott you wont see a ball spun like that on an alley very often but somehow that thing goes I thought Hicks was going to try to shoot that thing No he was throwing the alley pass Great decision by Hicks Great communication by Hicks and Invaka has it knocked away by Hicks SMU leads by eight points music Its opening day in Dallas SMU looking for its 14th straight win to begin a season But the focus is on getting a little better every single day Coach emphasized toughness and togetherness And their identity has to come from doing the dirty work rebounding diving for loose balls and playing with a ton of physicality inside He told me Thats the way we like to play tough and connected And you can see this teams toughness here tonight Hanging in this game Chris Absolutely This is a big challenge for Charleston State tonight but theyre going to get a lot of them Scott This is the first of four opponents the Texans will play from the power four They are And you know they theyve got a tough game with Cincinnati Theyve got a tough game with Baylor coming up They know what theyre doing Billy Gillespie not afraid to schedule the Gonzagas the Michigan They play all of those teams He thinks going into a conference schedule that theyll have this year it will really help them and really toughen them up Next for Charleston State is LSU just two days from now in Baton Rouge Boy watch how they double down on cement They triple teamed him last time Edwards off the mark Last trip down and Walters gets called for the offensive foul This Sam Walters has gotten an absolute earful from Freddy Hicks who has forced him into two fouls Thats the second time tonight thats happened Walters is trying to contain his frustration Four personals on Walters the only player on either side with that many One thing thats dangerous here is the Mustangs kind of letting Charlton hang around Only a ninepoint advantage for SMU Tarlton nearly cut into it by two more Well have a chance to do it at the line with your Johnson But one thing you dont like is the disposition on Johnson and the guards Theyre kind of playing loose and theyre playing downhill Theyre playing confident A lot of teams that come in here in nonconference action in Moody Coliseum They dont play this loose They dont play this fast They kind of play tight They kind of play scared Charlton not playing like that tonight Thats foul number five for Walters He is done for the night Germaine ONeal checks in for him The freshman from South Lake Texas One of seven freshman on this roster Five are true freshman Two are red shirts And Freddy Hicks doing to Walters What cement Yigolu did against the fiveman for Texas in the exhibition Cement played so well that it didnt take but five minutes for cement to foul out the big post But the University of Texas sevenpoint lead for SMU after a pair of good free throws by Johnson Yeah And after an SMU 12point lead to get this thing down to seven A huge win And theres still a lot of time to go in this game the Mustangs have got to get busy to try to put this Texan team away Edwards with the skin goes with a right hand A nifty move for the senior Incredible You didnt see that very often last year from BJ Edwards This is where the work comes in Watch this attack with the left hand through the contact Takes the hit from Hicks and still manages to finish Edwards averaged 99 points per game last year He now has 14 on opening night Well that is fantastic work and cant tell you how hard that is to do with your nondominant hand with a left hand dribble left of the paint and then to finish through that contact You dont see that very often from BJ although maybe that will become something that we see consistently from him Boy would that be a step forward for BJ Stretches the lead to 10 points with the free throw BJs a guy thats known for his defense An elite defender 11th nationally in steals last year ACCs all defensive team he made last year And to see him do that offensively man York Johnson stops unable to draw iron basketball Its amazing how good these officials are at this level I thought initially they got the call right but theyre going to change it here After a brief discussion between Chase Shaw and Chandler Burton possession goes to SMU Lee Cassell makes up the third member of our officiating crew this evening Well I like the pressure that Washington puts on him right there making him pay for showing that fullcourt press Miller from just above the free throw line Hes up to 14 points And thats a tough take right there from Boofy You dont make that and youre saying Man thats not a good take Thats not a good shot But he knocks it down 12point lead for SMU cheering Johnson inside Chris and Paka and Paka only four points tonight Those last two are powerful but thats the difference and thats what the Clarendon College transfer brings to this team The awareness the court presence and the ability to get it to Impaca on time cheering He pulls the Texans within 10 Weve had 10 lead changes tonight Texans have a long way to go to catch the Mustangs Well they are making some items on the highlight reel for us And that was a highlight reel play He just threw that thing down highf flying And thats why I think theyve got to be one of the top two teams in the league Whoever had to fifth in the wag Im not sure they know what theyre doing That is the coaches poll result Cal Baptist is the favorite in the Western Athletic Conference Look at that hustle Look at that awareness to pull Charlton State within seven And then the shot making Hustle awareness shot making The whole bench is up This things getting tight 63 56 Mustangs A whistle Believe it came No came on the shot Two coming Sat Yugu will check back in Increasing the SMU size advantage over this next stanza And I love how he was described in the offseason This 72 center aircraft carrier big man Man is that not right That is right on the muddy and BJ Davis BJ Davis Ray will also enter for the Mustangs freshman from St Lewis just three minutes of PT thus far Hell give another go And this freshman class for the Mustangs incredible Germaine ONeal Billy White You mentioned BJ Davis Ray and Jaden Tombs whos out for a few weeks with a wrist injury This is a lineup that will absolutely have Andy Infield competing you would think for a conference championship or at least in the mix Mustangs are picked sixth in the ACC preseason poll Duke is the favorite and remember the Mustangs were picked 13th last year and finished in a tie for fourth and was in second and third place there for a long time Exceeded expectations in that first year in the ACC for sure Just shy of reaching the NCAA tournament Yes But you have to think that if Boopy Miller would have been available more down the stretch that SMU would have punched its ticket to the big dance instead SMU the number one seed in the NIT Number one seed in the NIT and lost to Oklahoma State in round number two which was a little bit disheartening but again Boopy wasnt available for that either And when you dont have your point guard it changes things dramatically Its like not having your your quarterback in football I dont care what anybody says but thats why this SMU team is looked at as being a contender for the league because youve got Goofy back You now have cement back playing at a very high level the 72 center and youve also got BJ Edwards who made the all defensive team in the ACC You got a full package to go along with those starstudded freshman And you talk about Charlton State perhaps being underrated in the WAC coaches poll Its hard to judge given all the movement these days Those preseason polls are absolutely impossible as far as accuracy is concerned When you look at the additions the Texans have made including Dior Johnson he was just at the free throw line It looks like a really strong team So do the Mustangs Cory Washington the transfer from Wah State He was second team all conference last year with the Shockers He was he was a 14 points per game guy but hes a guy that does the dirty work If they can get him scoring like that consistently man is looking to be dangerous 10point SMU lead Under 12 minutes to go in the second half turning cheering and hitting as AJ Dent with his first shot of the night That is a big time play A community college transfer He is outstanding What a job staying in rhythm with that shot Davis Ray too strong Second chance opportunity for the Mustangs Cory Washington Its the best play of the game so far with Washington coming up with it and then the presence to put that thing back music Absolutely incredible Mustangs lead by 10 music He plays multiple positions gets deflection steals rebounds He just impacts winning He added that Washingtons the kind of player who doesnt have to score to make a difference His effort and physicality set the tone for this SMU lineup And you can see his physicality right there with this and one Scott and Chris It was incredible And I thought the play of the game so far He just took the ball away from Chris Impaca their biggest strongest toughest guy And then scored after the shot fake An incredible play by Washington whos known for the dirty work as you talked about And now for the scoring Yeah that intensity is going to get your attention last year with the Witchaw State Shockers 137 points per game second on the team Boy I just love watching this 221 34 pressure as both of these two coaches have changed defenses consistently out of timeouts trying to throw a wrinkle into it trying to get the shot clock down before Charlton can even think about getting into its offense Charlton trails by 11 Hicks with the left hand no good gets his own rebound Impaca well off the rim Boy Impaca got absolutely hammered Billy Gillespie came unglued If youve got anybody but Freddy Hicks in the middle of that zone defense I dont think they even get a look but they got two And I thought there was one if not two fouls on that offensive possession against SMU Mustangs will go to the foul line themselves And Paca all he could do there force one up Well to the right of the rim and off the glass Go all the way down to the other side for Samu The sophomore from Turkey Yeah And points for him They would like to see him really improve that free throw shooting We talked about the percentage coming in Misses it here but he was five of eight at the line before that Thats a big miss in a an 11point ball game here But the way these two get the freebies down the stretch Yeah The way these two teams are playing it feels like its a tighter game than 11 10 and a half minutes to go Dormu feeds it to Dior Johnson Johnson with a team leading 19 points Boy thats unfortunate because I thought it was a great defensive possession by SMU They got everything they wanted They sped tall enough Johnson even shot a little bit out of rhythm and he still knocked it down focused on Johnson earlier as the headliner in this class of transfers for Tarlton State He looks every bit that role tonight 19 points three of four from long distance Dormu trying to add a threepointer of his own Before that he was two for two from beyond the arc Yeah and Dormu letting that thing go from deep I dont think thats the shot Billy wanted although it wasnt a terrible take SMU leads by eight make it 10 The shot making tonight by both of these two teams has been fantastic Charlton a team that shot less than 40 last year at 49 right now The Mustangs music at 58 from the floor And that last make right there that was a tough take music You can you can count up 10 times I think where the Mustangs have taken a shot like that and been able to get it to go That is a tough shot 17 points for Edwards Six of 10 from the field two of five from threepoint land and four of five from the charity strike SMUs lead stretched out to 11 Their largest lead tonight was 12 Mustangs ran two possessions where they really get out there and they press Now theyre going back into their manto man Good hands Well up in the air Johnson picks it back out Chance for Hicks Good fake driving Two seconds on the shot clock No good Whistle comes against the Mustangs And Boopy Miller insensed Thats a great possession right there by Tarleton Dean Smith the former North Carolina coach always said If you can get the ball to start on one side of the floor swing it to the other side of the floor and then get it back on the other side of the floor with a possession started youll always get a good look And that time Hicks caught it had plenty of space on the attack and he draws the foul And as you could probably pick up context clues here Scott the replay was just shown on the overhead video board and Mustang fans just as unhappy as Boop No doubt about it I I thought it was a questionable call myself The one thing that I did notice too is that Freddy Hicks kind of faded away at the foul line Its very unlike him Great foul shooters lean in just a little bit at the foul line with their shot Lets see if he makes an adjustment here Four fouls on Boopy Miller and he heads to the bench with 9 minutes and 14 seconds left His Mustangs leading by 10 Oh my And the Texans will have a chance to cut that deficit to single digits music What careless mistake right there an unforced error and you look at the the turnovers Thats the the eighth that the Mustangs have been forced into music Perier off the leg of Edwards and then back to Perier while he was still out of bounds Johnson coming in for the ball as Empaka hits the floor And not a smart foul right there Thats a foul music 25 ft from the basket away from the ball You know you want to pressure and you want to cut cutters and you want to be disruptive but you cant be careless especially down the stretch of a game like this Thats why these games are so important Even these nonconference games against teams like Charlton State a lower level team out of the whack its still important You could look at the tape and you can learn so much about your team and learn how to make adjustments going into conference play And Paca four points just two of three from the field has had very little opportunity Five rebounds contributed though and hes sitting at four personal fouls He will remain in the game despite that figure Boopy Miller on the other hand on the bench with his four personals And Impaka not able to do what Cementu has done tonight and knocked down five at the line Cement over 50 here while Impaca is just one for three Edwards wing triple try No good Well thats a great rebound right there by Bu Johnson Impaca gets the lead from Johnson and the Texans will go back to the line again You know Impaca is a little bit different big Hes not the 72 guy that the Mustangs have but you watch this He has the ability to put it on the floor and lean in music through contact and finish like that Drawing the foul from BJ Edwards Haka is one of three from the line tonight Hes got a little bit more dexterity He is 66 The Frank Phillips junior college transfer applause Shot 59 from the free throw line last season His most impactful numbers were on defense in blocks He had 51 of those last year third in the Western Athletic Conference And on the boards he had 169 rebounds But Impanka had a fantastic summer One of the better athletes in the wack in the interior high motor guy hard worker but a win first guy Hes a guy thats always there in practice always going 100 and really helps the other players get better SMUs lead has shrunk to just seven points with under nine minutes left in regulation SMUs lead has been as large as 12 This is the second time Carltons been able to cut it down to seven Under 10 on the shot clock for Pierre Look at that battle inside Pierre spins and fires short Yugu trying to get the board Cant do it And I thought I impa won that possession not allowing the entry pass inside the very quick whistle against BJ Edwards It is And the whistles have gotten tight The game is still close Were less than 9 minutes to go Uh but these guards you got to give each team credit music They are forcing the defense to really function Theyre forcing the defenders to play defense Johnson now at 20 points in his Tarlton State debut and hes got the ability to score Ive been impressed with how he can keep his shot rhythm in line even amidst chaos tonight Something that only an upper classman can do Johnson the Jo national leader in scoring clarin college nearly 30 points per game but he does have big time power four experience at Pittsburgh and UCF you know and Charltons often had trouble scoring no question about it but they really think that Dior Johnson is a guy that can make something out of nothing and help them down the road picks up a foul going down the floor again and student athletes now on both sides Scott are expressing their dismay about how quickly that whistle is being blown Yeah and Billy really thought that Pierre pushed off that time Id like to get a second look at it music Its been a six nothing run for Charlton State over the last minute music And the the disposition on the Charlton side has completely changed from where it was when they went through that big scoring drought at the end of the first half Five points is the SMU advantage right now It was 10 at halftime Heres Geron Pierre Jr Good on his first attempt SMU adding him to the roster after Conference USA player of the year efforts last season for the Jacksonville State Gamecooxs Well hes versatile He replaces Chuck Harris in this lineup Last year he had 23 games of at least 20 points Thats what hes going to bring to the Mustangs this year Pushes the Mustang lead to seven points Mustangs extending their defense here putting some pressure on the Charleton offense Miselle to Dormu Dormu in the lane trying to get into that very small window to Impaca Yeah and theyre lucky because Impaca wasnt ready for that pass and the pace they had to play Impacas got to get his hands music ready Under eight minutes to go SMUs lead is seventh to double figures Two of them returners and Edwards on that list them best among the players who are back for SMU While Pierre making his SMU debut has 20 music points a well balanced attack Its what he does Jeron Pierre remember led Conference USA for Jacksonville State last year at 22 per game And theyre going to need it down the stretch Billy Gillespys team holding their own Washington the other new face in double figures Why Iu back for his second season on the Hilltop just one point away from joining them in double digits Thats the kind of length that they will not face in the wag Thats an ACC paint He was having to drive into They were there were about 90 arms looking right at him and and getting in the way there And the size we knew would be an issue Not a lot of depth and size for Charlton but surprisingly theyre still winning in the rebounding battle tonight by five Thats so impressive to see because Charlton State got absolutely annihilated on the glass and on the boards last week to ONeal The freshman throws it down That is fantastic A highflying play Plays that you need down the stretch to put games away Welcome to the Hilltop Germaine ONeal the freshman from South Lake Boy and the Mustangs have switched back into that zone after the timeout Its really giving Tarlton some problems You got to be quick and you got to really try to outmaneuver these guys with length That is a nice alleyoop right there And a fantastic highflying finish by Germaine ONeal The senior Edwards feeding the rookie ONeal the fourstar prospect from Dynamic Prep here in Dallas Fort Worth Athleticism that as they talked about is already at an NBA level Their jaw drops every day in practice watching this guy make plays like you just saw Part of an SMU high school signing class ranked as high as fourth nationally building blocks for a great present and future for SMU in the ACC Christian Pa the last five minutes of this game has consistently found himself at the line He only shot a couple of foul shots the first 30 minutes of this game And here he is now with some crucial takes Timeout on the floor SMU leads by seven Crunch time on opening night Basketball like Gonzaga like Michigan We talked about Gonzaga earlier Hey they were they gave him a scare at halftime It was like a twopoint game the last time they played on the road against Gonzaga Violation Unable to get it across the timeline SMU turns the ball over How about that That is something that is vintage Billy Gillespie And you see Andy Infield a little bit frustrated This is what Billy does to teams He will break out of press at a moments notice They work on this day in and day out They hang their hat on pressure defense Ninth turnover for SMU Charlton State has given the ball away 11 times SNU leads by seven Boy they are staying in this tough zone defense The Mustangs are really making things problematic 2 seconds on the shot clock Johnson throws up a prayer No good And it does not draw iron So a backcourt violation excuse me a 10second violation Unable to get across midcourt for the Mustangs followed by a shot clock violation by the Texans Its interesting because until Billy Gillespie and the Texans break this uh I suspect that Andy Infield will stay in it Its been very effective the last four times in the half court against Carlton Quickly able to get it across here on the Mustangs Washington turns and fires nothing But net he has 12 And thats not an easy shot right there Thats a 10ft floater but Washington has made a living in his career on being able to hit those things 15 ft SMU leads by nine with 620 to go in regulation and they are staying in this defense I dont suspect SMU to go back to their base man until Billy Gillespie and the Texans figure this out Theyre over the last four 5 seconds on the shot clock Kicked away Texans retain possession And they got fortunate there because theyre going to reset the shot clock to 20 But you see and Billy Gillespie just trying to figure this out Theyre trying to flash somebody middle They cant seem to get a paint touch amidst this zone defense and it takes a team thats skilled and quick and thats played together for a long time Its hard to do that in the first game of the season in the NIL era Dormu gets it to Hicks Knocked away from behind by Pierre Itll stay with Charleton State Great job by Pierre and cement to swarm without fouling right there Hicks is so good at drawing those fouls in the post box Freddy Hicks with the ball in his hands now Miselle 10 seconds on the shot clock Great job by BJ to deny that drive He thought about it cheering Johnson trying to go baseline around Washington He said throws it away into the back court Carlton State cannot figure out this zone pressure that the Mustangs have come out here with and Andy Infield doing a great job of staying in it right here until Charlton forces them out of it Boy this is why Andy is so good Hes known for his offensive coaching but he has really become a great defensive coach too Mattu to Pierre Pierre stops and pops from just below the free throw line Youu down low trying to grab that board Yeah he got called for the push off there Yeah second personal on Ilu Boopy Miller the only Mustang with four fouls presently Holmes and Edwards both have three a piece Nobody else in any kind of foul trouble for Charlton State Impaca has four personals Dormu Miselle and Isaac each have three But we saw a flurry of fouls that Tarlton was able to draw midway through this second half And what its done is its allowed the Texans to get into the double bonus here to go to the line with each successive foul from this point And Paka good on his first attempt And the foul actually came before what we just saw there And Andy Infields going where was the foul at Which Texan did he touch Exactly Exactly I didnt see it But regardless its up to Impaca to go to the line Hes six of eight tonight I think a foul was called right there on Charlton is it not Hey and this should this this is going to put SMU into the double bonus Thats a bad foul Thats 94 ft from the basket So the Mustangs catch a break Fourth foul on Hicks Opening night for these players for us Yes And for the referees And theyve had a hard night This is a hard game to call the the style of play that the Texans come in here They want the game muddied up They dont want a clean game Iu off to the left Five of 10 from the free throw line tonight I mean thats what we talked about Its the same Charlton team Theyre a little bit more talented They want it unorganized The Texans do They want it dirty But the Mustangs said Hey we cant lose our composure because Charlton fouls a lot You cant get frustrated We have older guards to kind of guard against losing our composure Its the back end and Mustangs are up by nine Boy Im surprised that they didnt attack baseline that day I thought Dormu made a bad decision right there Now you got to play against this tough defense that the Mustangs have gone into this tough zone and youre down to 14 seconds and you havent even really started running offense Miselle over to Hicks whos playing with four fouls If that goes against him hes done music And it does Hicks is disqualified Gillespies not happy with Hicks because he forced that drive Against an overloaded defense youve got to be able to get that thing into the soft spot at the elbow or the short corner And the Mustangs not allowing any kind of entry pass against this tough zone defense this pressurized zone defense Really nice job by Andy Infield the last three minutes to stay in it Tltons been able to get nothing against it Freddy Hicks added back to the roster yesterday after a temporary restraining order was granted on Thursday Starts in this game plays 26 minutes scores 15 points but he is done Boy and this is where the tech the uh the Mustangs can really take the air out of it right here Theyve got him right where they want him Theyre doing it with defense here And you know with a shot clock you cant go four corners or anything like that but you want to take nothing but good takes from this point forward The pressure is on music Tarleton fourth personal against Jordan Miselle the sophomore from nearby Plano Texas And Boopy Miller who is being driven this season by being named to the ACC second team in the preseason thought he should have been on the first team Now hes hungrier Hes hungrier He And hes doing it by putting in the work I dont know that theres ever been a time in Buffys career where hes put in more work on his own to improve his game individually But you know the clock is short for a lot of these guys particularly a senior like Buffy This is his last year This is his last chance for him to have a chance at playing in the league Hes got to be able to do the little things and he has certainly improved in so many areas Under five minutes to go on opening night in Dallas Boy look at this 131 defense that this SNU team has gone into Billy Gillespie and company cannot figure out this matchup 10 seconds on the shot clock Carlton trailing by nine Isaac has it knocked away by Igolu then off of Washington out of bounds And right there right when Isaac caught the ball Johnson should have cut baseline on the backside but he didnt and it really muddied up the waters for Talton Threepoint try A little too strong And Booby Miller pulls down the board Edwards to Washington Back out to Edwards When you look at the Mustangs theyre being very careful about what shots theyre taking Edwards nearly had that one going the other direction The ball into Empakas hands but a whistle against Carlton music State You know and this is really a point in the game where you know youve got four and a half left Youre trying to milk this lead and the Mustangs right here with an 11point lead Got to be very careful about the shots that theyre not playing quite as downhill Five on Impaca Wow And Charlton State has lost two of its most impactful players Hicks and Impaca Both done Youve still got Sigar you can go to Hes the 69 Frenchman But hes not nearly as impactful as a guy like Impaka Sigiscar played the 2023 24 season in music the French equivalent of the GLeague Has some great seasoning against tough competition should serve him well this season as Charlton State goes up against four power four opponents And Ill tell you one of the bright spots of this game is seeing cement go to the line shoot 12 foul shots hit seven of them so far make it eight Good on both this trip down the floor Charleston State has not scored a field goal in over 6 minutes They trail 8572 Time is running out on the Texans who have not hit a field goal in over six minutes against this zone Isaac no good The streak continues SMU on the run Cory Washington up to 14 Billy Gillespie needs a timeout Hes got the media here But man the wheels have come off and the Mustangs putting this game away and doing it with defense 15point lead Douglas takes it away all alone now in the corner Cant take advantage of it Under 10 seconds to go Oh Im shocked he didnt take that three He should have Isaac from the free throw line extended right No good Board brought down by Sigiscar Another chance for Charleton State The shot clock reset to 20 Sigar with the flush Its the first good offensive possession for Charlton in literally 6 minutes of game play Finally hitting a field goal but SMU immediately counters does really good job of continuing to apply pressure in transition for the Mustangs cheering Got to get quick shots off at your Charleston State and you cant catch and hold Isaac not finding anybody decides to take it himself and it rims out When Isaac catches that at the high post hes got to immediately face up and do something Taking the charge Texans will have the basketball when we return But Charlton State has gone cold in the late moments music of this one One of the last eight cross man his prowess was so fantastic He and Cory Washingtons game uh very similar met very close to making the Dallas Mavericks roster a couple of weeks ago More inducted into the SMU Athletics Hall of Fame last year Boopy Miller certainly will be under consideration in future years especially if he can get himself to all ACC honors this season And coach Enfield said in the preseason he is playing like an NBA type point guard right now He is just the decision making making players around him better Hes been the best guard on the floor in the last three games Hes been fantastic tonight Billy Gillespie going in with that three out two in high low zone offense That traditional zone offense Took him a while to do it Kate Douglas well off the mark Boy not a great take by Douglas at all Thats being impatient against the zone You can always get that shot You got to work to get it inside Heres Boopy from the baseline Short Sigasar comes down with the board And this is where as an offense you got to hurry up and push the action You dont want to let that zone set up against you again Charleston State winning the rebounding battle by five right now your Johnson short and Edwards pulls SMU within four in that boards category Backto back bad takes by Tarlton SMU doing a great job of the zone rolling out and Pierre will head to the charity stripe already with 20 points on the night He averaged 216 per game last year That was good for fourth in the NCAA Only one returning player in the nation has more points than him coming back this season You know that was PJ Hagerty who pulled himself out of the NBA draft came back this season Marcus Burton also he was fifth on that list Hes back at Notre Dame this season So two music of the top five scorers from last year are in the ACC this season you know and this is going to be an improved ACC no doubt And you and I kind of talked before this broadcast about how tough uh the ACC will be You know Duke became the first team in ACC history last year to lead the conference in scoring and defense Uh but you know Cooper Flag obviously taken number one by by Dallas second youngest player to ever be selected first overall behind LeBron James Uh but you know this ACC much much different look much better look from top to bottom but they they got some new faces too You lose Tony Bennett you lose Jim Larenega over at Miami and Florida States Leonard Hamilton uh ends up retiring But youve got new coaches too like Ryan ODM at Virginia John Lucas at at Miami um Will Wade at NC State So a different look in the conference and a much tougher ACC this year Three SMU players have now scored 20 points or more It has been two decades since the Mustangs have done that cheering But what a play right there Thats a nice move Great touch by Mitchell Holmes with his back to the basket 20point lead for SMU Biggest lead of the night with 108 to go Dormu off to the side Boy a high percentage of bad takes forced by this SMU defense Man the zone defense for the last seven to eight minutes in this half has been such a difference maker Knocked away Tarlton on the run Heres Johnson laying it in off the glass Texans within 18 47 seconds left SMU with the finishing touches on this opening night win Itll be two straight victories over Charlton State on opening night but the Texans played the Mustangs a lot tougher this year than they did last Washington with one final exclamation point Incredible night We see some highf flying plays And thats another one Johnson backing off No good 20 seconds left The shot clock is off and SMU can dribble out these final seconds SMU winds up with a 20point win They led by 10 at halftime but early on we had 10 lead changes and five ties 14 straight wins on opening day for SMU
