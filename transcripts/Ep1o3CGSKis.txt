people in the seats but just as hostile North Carolina comes in on a four game winning streak Stanford sits at 11 six on the year and their outstanding performer will be calling his name frequently Maxim Reno wears number 42 the leading scorer and rebounder in the Atlanta Coast Conference he controls the opening tip youre going to see a lot of North Carolina double teaming him down there trying to get the ball out of his hands like they did on that play shot clock down to eight and the jumper is knocked down now this is a young man whos not overwhelmed by this environment a transfer from duke Jaylen Blakes didnt get a lot of playing time while he was at Duke but uh boy he really blossomed at Stanford and a little bit of a Reclamation project for Kyle Smith while he was there but his confidence is just growing good to see him Blossom there Drake pal The Freshman trying to go along the Baseline and how about that shot banking it in I dont know about that from jayen Washington no you know any kind of offense that they get from him is a is a bonus averaging just over six a game and that that possession going nowhere and the clock running down on their back too saw the starting lineups here Stanford the only School in the Atlantic coast confidence man its still weird to be saying there in the ACC but they have three of the top eight 18 scores in the league and Bang from the corner is Donovan Young The Freshman who miss the first 11 games of the season and now all of a sudden is playing in just his sixth game of the year but he makes his third straight start in our visit yesterday with Kyle Smith they believe he is going to be a good one and hes one of those guys you know how do you prepare for a guy like that hes not on the you know you dont have a lot of film to watch on him to get a scouting report and uh very athletic guy you know you were talking about I mean this Stanford team can score the ball its on the other end of the floor that theyve had issues as far as stopping people yeah both of these teams in fact can score Carolina averages 83 a game Stanford 77 first Miss of the night for the Cardinal nearly two minutes gone by Ian Jackson number 11 you know Cooper flag gets most of the pub and rightfully so as the incredible freshman at Duke but Ian Jackson is averaging was 23 per game over the last seven theres Reno from downtown and a good box out there by Powell well and if youre Hubert Davis uh you want him taking that shot as opposed to being in the paint drawing a double team you know getting your defense spread out RJ Davis a feed to Pal and he knocks in the three to tie the game and uh you know its another freshman who maybe has been overshadowed by Jackson and really Hubert Davis was singing his Praises yesterday hes been very steady for North Carolina good defense there by jayen Washington then Here Comes RJ Davis great feed and a block underneath wow by The Freshman Donovan young well we talked about athleticism just great timing on that play and good hustle they are very aware of how quickly Carolina gets the ball up the floor thats Josiah sers a transfer Jor from USC take a look at this block thats this is a great delivery a great pass but just better defense pitching beating the hitting on that play time yeah every time I know your I know your passion for baseball well I tell you Carolina and Stanford here today is good stuff but make no mistake the the great pitching will shut down the Great did it Im a hitters Applause guy way outside in and out on the tray by Ryan a arwal and here comes D how about that move oh my goodness Koo hes even smiling about that one and there was nobody back at The Rim that time he knew if he could get back by that first line of defense that uh it was clear sailing well Elliot could is an entirely different player than the one we saw when we were here and theres that left hand you talked about earlier on from the big man well and its folks hes a righthanded player okay but he is very Adept with either hand hes got that little jump hook either side uh really skilled in the paint Applause area Washington kicks it out to Ian Jackson and that is going to be an offensive foul on Jackson fist pump for Kyle Smith the head man of the Applause Cardinal and this is not just in the ACC this is division rank this is across the country y 20 points 11 rebounds 14 double doubles leads the country only two games that he hasnt had a double double um really just consistent consistently a high effort got his own rebound and this is the same you know when they lost the Wake Forest this past week 14 and 11 which sounds like you know its a good game but probably below his average and uh they limited his offensive rebounding which was a big key and uh but hes gotten off to a quick start here look like there was some contact there agar Wald on the shooter Ian Jackson no call and Stanford with a twopoint lead five minutes a pass from the dean dome in Chapel Hill North Carolina early happy Martin Luther King weekend each and every one of you hope youre enjoying it stepped out of bounds yep thats sers this is another thing that Renault is good at he hes good on on the double team passing out of it he got good Vision um they want him to have more direct line passes he tends to float it a little bit but um yeah youve got to be aware of where you are on the court when youre receiving Applause well he Luben is out there theyre not even guarding him out at the threepoint line RJ Davis short on the jumper and thats a problem I mean you know Renault is just camped out in the lane basically a oneman Zone there what a job Kyle Smith has done wherever hes been as a head coach in college basketball was at Colombia for seven years fantastic job there San Francisco where he had three straight 2 win seasons and then LED Washington State to the NCAA tournament theres Reno and hes fouled hell go to the line now one of the drawbacks of North Carolina playing four smaller players if you will right and only one true big man is when you go up against something or someone like this well and you know with the speed that North Carolina plays sometimes they take people off the offensive glass but Reno is right there now typically North Carolina is a big team Tom this year they are in the 300s as far as average height in the country and thats in the bottom third in the country theyre playing against the team theyre the 22nd tallest team in the country so you know maybe problematic in this game and a you know and and Hubert Davis knows that I mean thats not going to change this year and he talked with us about it he said just because were shorter doesnt mean we have to give up any sort of rebounding Advantage well he made the point to his team that you know as far as size goes Texas SM is quite similar to them in the SEC yet is averaging 17 offensive rebounds a game so r no hits him both he has six early on and a fourpoint cardinal lead Davis has not scored Ian Jackson is not scored Stanfords done a nice job on that duo thats a nice feed right there in the finished by Van Allen Luben a transfer from Vander bille well see at least there he makes them pay for the lack of defensive attention which is you know that thats a thats a positive you know the one thing about the Carolina big man and were primarily talking Washington and Luben you know you combine their numbers theyre averaging right around 13 points and right around 910 rebounds a game so its not Armando Bott stuff but its not bad great head fake and going to the free throw line Schism oara croud wanted to travel You be the judge yeah I mean early on he he did keep that left leg down once once he got in the if there was a travel it was early on when he got established in and out for o if youre looking for a Cable News Network that respects all Americans and you have a new home with news Nation see why news nation is Americas most trusted Cable News Network to find news Nation on your screen go to news Nation nowcom and this was the thing ridiculous time this team Stanford almost 89 as a team from the free throw line in conference its not bad not bad 78 overall in the year thats thats going to win you a lot of games rebound by pow kicks it out to Davis into the right corner Bang from Seth tremble well the thing you like about tremble is that he had some injury issues missed three games but his last game out he had he got double figures and it looked like hes getting healthy at the right time he had 12 points six rebounds at three steals in just 25 minutes against C thats excellent the defense by treble and here comes Davis the other way pulls up from three and Kyle Smith says hang on a minute backto back threes from tremble and the first of the game by the second leading got beat there by a RedHot Demon Deacons team and then jumped on a bus traveled from Winston sailem the Chapel Hill very late after the game and a practice here the last couple of days before going home later Applause tonight but boy if you want to hear a rant uh you know we talked about Stalin call and Stanford coming into the ACC of course in the Big 10 they have UCLA USC Washington and Oregon and I mean to tell you Mick Cronin went on one of the alltime rants the other day the coach at UCL thats osiah sers for a three well and that was you know really a good timeout at a a good time in the game too by Kyle Smith kind of calm the crowd down a little bit and then you get a positive result coming out of the timeout knock down to three tie things up this guy is just an outstanding basketball coach and hes been out west and lets be honest with it you know back in this part of the country you know we go to bed when a lot of the schools where hes coached uh would be playing their games but the three straight 21 Seasons at San Francisco he goes to Washington State in uh the last four years and U you know won 20 or more three times took him to their first tournament 16 years was the Pack 12 Coach of the Year last season Washington States lost some good coaches first Dick Bennett then Tony Bennett then this Kyle Smith theyve had some good guys come through there and thats off the mark and hes the only and and we talked about Jackson hes the only tar hadnt scored in this game to this point yeah they have six different players with a bucket already oo thats a hard screen by raino and then he has an open look for three not going to be there coming away with a rebound is Luben Here Comes Davis oh great pass and great Hustle by Luben thats all set up Renault had to pick up the ball coming up the floor and thats just Luben running right to the rim he recognized his mans occupied hes wide open great basketball 1715 in favor of the Tar Heels their second lead of the game Reno walk you know its its funny talk about I I was like you know well take a look at this last play heres what hes hes got to step up and take Davis here and then Luben just running right to the rim the helps late getting there you know I look at that play the travel that guards get away with that big guys never get away with that come on come on here is Kad and hes hacked by giler on the way up thats a second foul on Benny geler the walk on out of Palos FES California just turned to scholarship good for him he was recruited by a number of smaller division one schools and uh turned him down and wanted to give it a go at Stanford and here he is in his third year playing gdo a 72 free throw shooter tomorrow on CW women suits Virginia goes to Raleigh to try and slow down number 21 NC State thats tomorrow at two Eastern 11 Pacific only on the CW Carolinas largest lead of the game it stands at 4 1915 and Reno to get a breather theyll bring in the red shirt freshman out of vover Massachusetts Aiden camman who wears number 52 he just set the Applause screen this may be a time for Blake to get a little bit more aggressive with Renault out of the game well he just went right by what a beautiful move went right by Luben thats going left finishing right heres the look at great little crossover thats a its a tough guard for Luen but uh you know you have to you recognize an offensive player who you have in front of you and uh boy Blake just understood it and took him right to the rim you I you know I like when the portal works out it seems for both teams you know and for you know for BL for him and his career where he was this has been a positive move obviously a Duke he wasnt you know he wasnt that wasnt a good fit for him he wasnt going to play there um you know so for both schools it was a positive yeah with all the criticism about uh you know some of the negatives and there are negatives but this was a good one and youre right there are a number of those that we so infrequently talk about winwin for Applause everybody threepoint lead for North Carolina 941 to play until halftime its been a competitive game and it was funny that Kyle Smith likened this to uh he said this is like playing Arizona from the Pack 12 you know this game this atmosphere this Applause pace the old pack 12 they had some great basketball and he may he alluded to that but you know there are so many schools in that League where where nobody goes to the games I mean I used to live out there for years and years and um Arizona is about it y Oregon know you and UCLA is good obviously theyll draw well thats a offensive foul on camon hes picked up two and hes going to go right back to the bench in favor of Reno thats the only guy they really have to spell R now yeah I mean both of these teams you look at uh well for Stanford they get only 23 of their minutes from the bench which is almost last in division one I mean they really play a short bench and you look at where the the timeouts are and thats where they try to substitute great finish only Tyler hansbro has scored more points as a North Carolina Tar Heel than RJ Davis and only Armando Bott has played in more games as a tar heel today the 157th for Davis Bott played in Music 169 North Carolina led by Davis going to dump it down low thats a nice move there in the lane by Washington theyve gotten some really solid production from their big guys running the floor whether it been Luen or Washington received it in the paint done some good things good answer there by Jaylen Blakes and he has Applause six Washington for three Brick City yeah I dont know about that shot he was 0 of eight yeah on the season yeah and I coach Davis might have been scratching his head a little on that Applause one thatll be a bump by Elliot kdo and thats his second foul 2419 time out on the floor from the I need to get up to speed thats coming up Tuesday 8 EAS 7 Central only on the CW all right here we go 721 to play until halftime Stanford with the basketball they dump it down into Rayo their big man and he pitches it back outside and into the corner for an even better shot and able to Rattle it in as that Donovan young his second three of the game The Freshman out of Pasco Washington and Washington thought better of launching another three so Im sure he heard about that in the timeout but uh you know it really Carolina has kept Reno under wraps for the most part and boy but knocking down the midrange jump shot Washington is off to a nice start he has six points in this game which is his season average and five assists now in the game for RJ Davis rebound comes off to Carolina Davis pushing it the other way you know Daviss numbers are down this year and some people are making a big deal out of it but you see five assists so far in the game today will fade away jumper and hell get the gentle roll you know you you you look at his threepointers through 18 games a year ago he had 54 of through 18 games this year he has 35 so you know yeah some of the numbers are down he hasnt shot it as well but its a matter of time right Gman but yeah and but he also doesnt have a lot of other friends at the top top of the Scouting Report like he had last year and also you know Tom I I mean I was there your senior year theres a lot going on in your head I mean the real world is right there in front of you and that for people dont think that makes a difference it does and um you know youre you know you think schools going to go on forever and its not and youre thinking about whats going to happen in the next part of your life sure and theres the pressure all right I got to keep playing like I did play um so you know theres theres more to it but um you know the guy hes hes going to play and hes a big time player and you know hes hes going to be fine and I think as the more you know Davis has got to get involved in this game or um Im Im sorry Jackson yeah but um you know to have him playing well its been a huge bonus and then and I think this is a good thing right here for him to get maybe to the free throw line you know see a couple baskets go in and and get him into rhythm okay r no off to a big time start Mike gave his numbers a moment ago uh in the game you know 14 Points 11 rebounds in the loss to Wake Forest earlier in the week but boy thats not slowing him down now hes got five rebounds so far in the game right now to go along with nine points and heres Jackson whos scoreless so far and you can change out youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands and and so far I I think you North Carolina is willing to you know theyre going to have you know theyre going to make a choice theyre going to get the ball out of Renos hands and double team him but his teammates have picked him up and hit shots out of that double team and lets see going forward you know that Jackson now you see and sometimes thats what it takes get to the freee throw line knock a couple shots sh down see the ball go through the hoop and see if the things relax for him a little bit we mentioned he had average 23 points per game over this winning streak and his first two in the game come with five minutes left to play in the opening half Applause today thats an offensive foul on Agarwal he just threw a forearm shiver right in the jaw Davis Applause yeah anytime you get up above the Applause shoulder they may upgrade this to a flavor one is under review for a potential flagrant foul thats Tommy morrisy joined on This Crew by Brent Hampton and Justin Porterfield I mean what do you think G man I mean I flagrant I I would guess that theyd upgrade it to a flagrant one right elbow right well as the play unfolded it was more of a hand yeah the call is confirmed it is a common foul wow all right thatll give the basketball to North Carolina leading 30 25 T heels have wins this season over UCLA Dayton SMU theyve been off to a good start first year in the ACC NC State last weekend theyve had losses to some of the juggernauts in college basketball Alabama Auburn you know if if you look look at it the one I think the one if they really wanted to flip would have been the Alabama game here you know that that really would have been a good one to you know cuz then they beat you know with with the UCLA gives them two nonconference really good you know really good wins lost in overtime to Kansas theyve lost to the Florida Gators lost in overtime to Michigan State and their only loss in the league came against whats looking to be a potent Louisville Cardinal team Davis for three not there and here comes Blakes the other way for the Cardinal hell slow it Applause down crossport pass good ball movement Ager W not going to fall in that have been a big one Applause bounce pass and unable to handle it is Luben ALU too oh my goodness and hell go to the line how about the big Applause fella oh my goodness and boy and he just got into trans transition mode Yama has done pretty well in that was his teammate yeah how about him how about him hes hes the big forward on that team maybe the small forward on that team yeah well they won the gold medal together uh in the under 20 European championships so now Reno looking for his 12th point of this game hes two for two from the line and he can really shoot free throws 72 free throw shooter well and thats the thing in in the weight game they he did not attempt a free throw they they kept him off the line which really hurt his production theyve been theyve been changing defenses the last couple of possessions going some Zone which they did there de and Jackson just appears to be a little bit off and thats a strong move to the basket there by Blakes taking it right up against Kade Tyson well he had Tyson in full recreat and knew he there was no way to stop him ripped out of the hands five and Allen Luben and he has six so 12 from the combination of Washington and Luben and L and had Rena pushed underneath the rim and again talk about the combination of production from Luben and Washington theyre really doing a nice job heres Davis in Music Applause transition Jackson still without a field goal in this game great defense great defense by Donovan young Scramble for the ball it belongs to North Carolina 12 on the shot clock 204 on the game clock see its Donovan young you can see why theyre excited about him hes very long hes 68 goes 25 only a freshman he had uh a knee injury he had a hip injury then he came down with a flu they just couldnt get him on the court well that the thing that was really frustrating was he was ready to go and then he got the flu and go with he was just shaking his head what next tremble into the lane and not going to go raino rips away a sixth rebound of the game to go along with 12 points he might get a double double before the half Blakes working on RJ Davis no double team Blakes is a strong young man well there wasnt anybody in sight and that was great recognition by Blakes Blakes has a Blakes has an NBA body he is really put together and then right back the other end its Luben who has Applause eight all right Luben Washington youve got 14 points seven rebounds at the half bettering what Rena has done in the middle and you have seven points from Davis but everybody else really quiet and raino drains another three wow his second three of the game and he has 15 points in his first half I amend my last statement and now Stanford in front run by one and rejected by Reno and here comes Blakes the other way doesnt have the numbers and were under 30 seconds to go in the opening half about a 5sec differential with a shot clock and Tom this is about the pace that Stanford wanted to play in the 70s in this game they didnt want to get out of control this is theyre right about where they want to be tried to lob it too tall and here comes Davis game clock at 87 Davis just wildly throws it up but hell go to the free throw line well see who theyre going to get on the foul I think they get sers which will be his first yep and RJ Davis to the free throw line 86 free throw shooter is Davis well and the one thing that both teams have done which they really concentrate on turnovers only five for North Carolina or only two for North Carolina only five for Stanford so game has been very clean up for in the first half stay tuned for todays halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru tie game here and Davis hits his first free throw attempt uh Stanford in fact is on Pace to set an alltime single season record for fewest number number of turnovers per game and that has been a staple of Kyle Smith coach teams they just dont give it away they average 10 per game all right you got time now to get off a shot theyll give it right back to Blakes I would think yep here he goes three two and hes fouled but they had a foul to give yeah smart Play Good awareness but thats their sixth so they wont foul again and 23 plenty of time watch the guy taking the ball in bounds Reno lets it Fly and it should but this has been a good game got to avoid those pick sixes the easy points and for North Carolina minimize Maxim they werent able to do that much in the first half uh lets see if they can do that in the second half take away maybe the threes and take him off the free throw line Carolina had a sevenpoint lead before the the Cardinal came storming back r no short on his first attempt to begin the second half weve had five lead changes eight times weve been tied so far and Ian Jackson whos been averaging 23 points per game over the last seven does not have a single field goal Davis Off the Mark and the rebound ripped out of there by sers and heres Blakes who had an excellent first half with 10 points and the thing to watch with Jackson is a freshman on that type of role lets see if he starts to try to force the issue Tom and you get used to scoring that much you may try to start looking for your own offense RJ Davis Rings it in he just he he looks really confident today uh you know in in his shot um just coming in coming down pulling up in Rhythm Davis has 12 and Reno tried the tip tried to get the rebound and was fouled you know Hubert Davis talked about theyve been really double teaming him guarding him with bigs but if youre taking threes in transition you eliminate all of that and you spot up get it in Rhythm get your shot up well thats a beautifully designed under the basket set play sellers with a jumper and then he commits a foul yeah its just uh its way too easy to you know direct pass for a 10 foot jump shot twopoint game minute and a half is passed here in this second half kadot to the rack and that will be a foul yep no goal tending there Elliot kadoo you know when you and I were here back when Wasau was in town right back in second week of December kadoo was on a stretch of five games where he had 23 turnovers well you come back a month later and now he has more than two to one assist to turnovers as he misses a free throw and dont forget the CW becomes the exclusive home to NASCAR Infinity Series high octane action 33 races right here on the CW it begins at historic Daytona that starts Saturday February 15th only on the CW he hits one and two Tom dont dont say yourself sure youre almost as good looking as no not even close guy sounds better for k i I mean the good news today no turnovers uh you know its you know Davis has been the playmaker with five assists but yeah I mean ideally youre a coach you like two to one one assist turnover oh my to the rack the big fella Reno throws it down so athletic and you know to talk about scoring it at three levels and thats a beautiful feed for the Slam at the other end by Washington great production out of their big guys well youre not lying 16 points in the game and were 2 and A2 minutes into the second half from The Duo of Washington and lubben rejected by pow rebound to Stanford young had it ripped away by Kad Jackson and thats a block hell go to the free throw line you know if if youre Washington you cant go try to block that go for the pump fake you know you could just let him go to the rim and then on the other end you get the show theres and Rau is saying wheres my help on the back side he gets caught out helping on that screen Applause roll Ian Jackson out of the Bronx New York his only points have come from the free thr line where hes three of three the last seven games he scored 159 points the only Carolina freshman to ever score more than that in a seven game stretch their alltime leading scorer Tyler hansbro he had three more well and the thing that that Hubert Davis is he comes out of the game after those free throws the coaching staff has said the thing thats kept him on the floor yeah the you know the the scor is great but he really has improved defense Applause defensively and the jumper is good thats a big answer there by sers he has four in the second half every time it looks like North Carolina may start to pull away Stanford is had they come back and hit a jump shot well he tried it earlier hes still low for the season omage to to Mr uker jly departed absolutely ball four ball eight ball 12 and its now its over Applause 10 well he thinks he can make it one of these days hes going to be right they swing across Court wide openen three is missed by cers I think Im going to live forever so far so good thats right Davis a little floater and raino altered that shot Stanford down by Applause three sitting on a television timeout next dead ball Ros sets a screen sers passes up the three picks up his dribble underneath the basket but then was bailed out but a takeway and here comes tremble hell give it up to the big man who tried to make one pass too many and Carolina caught a break did agar wall knock that one out of bounds a yes right behind the glass 17 points and 10 it was the 18th of January 1986 when undefeated in number one North Carolina hosted undefeated in number three duke and North Carolina in a wild one 9692 came away with a win great block by rno and a brenaman was sitting in that seat yes youre exactly right my father Marty brenaman along with Billy Cunningham you are here big Applause boy with the old car Michael Auditorium which is still by the way standing and Reno goes to the rack and lays it in hes having a monster game how do you guard him and you know theyve got to respect that threepoint shot now youve got to chip in on him as a Applause driver hes got 19 points to go along with his 10 rebounds Stanford single season record for double doubles in a season as heres a beautiful pass from Kad and the easy lay for Luben who has 10 well the one thing I mean his teammates have been picking up offensively but they have not given him a lot of help defensively when hes helped on you know on screens with the bigs for Carolina well thats an excellent pass and very good offensive positioning there by agar wall his first bucket its a onepoint game another nice feed by kadoo the only the only other close game they it was a twopoint game against Georgia Tech here at home the only other league game theyve had issues with here but tell you its its dangerous to let this Stanford team hang around moving short on the free throw a 65 free throw shooter on the season his first attempt today Applause Stanford got kicked around after playing well in the first half at wake earlier in the week before falling 70 or 80 67 and raino another three and this one is short and here comes kadu the other way for the Tar Heels lays it off for Trimble and theyre going inside banging down there thats great defense boy well and theyre figuring you know the best way we can do is try to attack him maybe pick up some fouls and the corner and its good and that puts a cardinal in front boy if Donovan young can continue to come on its going to be a big lift for this team at the end of the season and that was just really a solid find by Blakes wow after the rejection kadu comes away and cleans it up and Carolina back up by one on the Block Youve got to come up with the missed shot oh boy I mean thats right if I dont know why Ager Walls even arguing yeah youre youre exposed right out front you thats an automatic whistle that was brutal just a straight out Applause sh you know why theres theres nothing to be gained by that youre going to be able to receive the Applause ball thats three on Agra wal he has to lead the game under 13 minutes to go and the Tar Heels with a onepoint lead R J Davis cannot get it and the rebound to Sellers and the Cardinal will slow it down yeah unless theyve got outright numbers theyre theyre going to try to take some clock Applause time theres Blakes swings it cross court and young will draw the foul young has three three pointers in this game Applause second team foul for North Carolina so not in real trouble there second individual foul on set tremble as Luben will go have a seat Washington comes back in pal also back in for North Carolina T they run really nice plays along that basine and sers was the second guy coming off the screen and uh Jackson just a little late coming to him say Kyle Smith has brought his team to play to Chapel Hill today you know just watching Stanford through this year really solid in their execution this guy is just such an outstanding coach and has been for a long time thats a clean block right there by geler but Kyle Smith 55y old from El Paso Texas hes got it going strike and you know as I said sometimes especially a freshman can really start to you know feel and start to hunt his offense and I dont get the sense that hes doing that here in the second half hes really not trying to force things a lot to his credit shot clock at six here and geler with a takeaway plays it off the Blakes who will go to the basket and lay it in its its such a dangerous play on The Underneath out of bounds and you get if that pass doesnt connect its the first pass to a fast break Davis boy he has answered the Bell today has he yes he has and shooting it very confidently thats his third threepointer of the game and were tied with 1120 to go his team really needed that lift as well shot clock down to 11 giler looking for help they have both of their big men in the game somebody better put it up its going to be Reno and he draws a foul with two seconds on the shot clock and boy Washington would like to have that as a do Music over somehow if and you know if youre a big guy youre not used to guarding out there but youve got to take a youve got to take take a peek down at the other shot clock and know how much time is left and just get your hands up but youre putting this guy at the line with three free throws we know a 72 free throw shooter three for three from the line in todays game CW Courtside Saturday double header next weekend SMU goes to NC you and Ill be right back here at the dean dome for Boston College in North Carolina that starts next week at High Noon Eastern 9 Pacific only on the CW Reno with 21 points in the game well thats going to be you know theres really no way in uh Huber Davis is not going to answer Stanford size at all the only way he can do is Luben back in the game hes going to stay small 22 points and 12 rebounds and we still have 11 minutes left in this game for rno theyre going to go a big Zone tell that geler gets after it on defense now that young man is a walk on wears number five Trimble for three Off the Mark and Blakes will walk it up for the Cardinal theyre looking for Rayo hes working for position now hell come back out beyond the threepoint line and we set a screen here for Blakes and then they kick it back out to Reno that didnt even catch iron Jackson still looking for his free he passed up an open three there well I think its he also could have taken it on the drive if he really wanted to be aggressive there with this lineup too theres not going to be many offensive rebounding opportunities for North Carolina his crowd 21000 plus trying to will the Tar Heels to get it into gear were under 10 minutes left in Stanford with a threepoint lead and thats another silly foul 25 ft away from the basket by Washington and that is going to be his second fourth Music foul I mean you dont pay the price now but you certainly might pay it later as Washingtons going to go to the bench in favor once more of Van Allen Luben the junior out of Orlando Applause this is where Stanford has been excellent as Reno is going to leave and thats on out of bounds plays got three easy baskets on that exact play the second man coming through three times in a row has been Sellers and I liken those to like special teams play or set pieces in soccer you know that you youre fishing on those Davis passed up the three gets bumped by young but this is the exact same play theyve run every time first guy through second guy through he gets hung up on the screen wellrun play you tell me I mean you know you forgot more than I Ive never understood manto man under the basket on inbounds plays for that reason well and also just if you if you know where thats going shade the passer that way you know you try to if youre going to redirect the pass you know shade him on pressure him on that side how about that first bucket of the game lets see if that gets him going at the 9 Minute Mark for Ian Jackson and the crowd has been waiting for that and they understand too what that means Big Time Reno on the bench as well time opportunity here for Carolina to make a little bit of a move they got wide open in a corner down here but they dont find Young his sellers misses a jumper tremble with a left hand and midair lays it in and K Smith says hang on a minute all of a sudden that lead is down to one it once was Applause five here it is another good timeout but this is what Carolina does best out in the open floor score you will and hes coming right back in into the game a year ago he was the most improved player in the Pack 12 from the season prior and now here he is in this his senior year and he thought about the portal too with the coaching change and uh actually and Kyle Kyle Smith was very honest he said it was Stanford that brought him back not so much the coaching change he he lik Stanford foul underneath is going to go against Van Allen Luben Luben has had an outstanding game he has 11 points to go with four rebounds in fact the Carolina Duo of Washington and Luben have combined for 19 points and eight rebounds thats not neck and neck quite yet with rno but its not far behind well and you know the the added bonus is you get 10 fouls you can work with that as well you if you get working with two bodies tough shot and it goes in for agarol now if he can just keep his head under control out there and stay away from the unnecessary fouls this is a threepoint lead were under eight minutes and a foul will go against geler as kadoo goes to the basket hell shoot two and we come back time out on the floor dont go away this is and uh I was I I dont think Id been traded to the 76 Sixers then Im I was probably still with the Nets at that point so I dont know if I had a game on that day or not but I was certainly following with interest oh for sure it was Johnny Dawkins and Jay bis mark allery on that team back when Jay had hair Im sure he appreciates that well its is what it is I know all about it North Carolina wins that inaugural imagine the pressure of that game oh man the the first game here and two undefeated teams yep run number one and number three in the country good offensive rebound there and that is Luben who will go to the free throw line hes fouled by Y and hes been terrific and the reason he gets that is cu Reno goes for the block he gets taken off the glass and Luben is right there for the second chance Applause yeah but I mean talk about with Billy Cunningham hold that thought were all aware of the tragic fires in California the devastation and heres how you can help people please go to redcrossorg or text the word C A wildfires to 909 99 and and look I want to say one thing right now we havent forgotten about the people in North Carolina either cuz a lot of people have forgotten about the people in North Carolina yeah Western North Carolina is still suffering we need to remember them as well absolutely all right we got a game here Carolina up by one Stanford it opened a fivepoint lead they triple team right no and then a foul on Jackson as hes helped up or the try attempting to help up Jackson from the floor was blaked still still not in the bonus right there Applause ow thats a scary thing you get caught up in the air like that with your back to the floor seven fouls on Stanford six on North Carol Olina so the next Carolina foul both teams will be in the bonus sers pulls up short and a rebound ripped out of there by Trimble North Carolina trying to add to the lead to the basket its Cano great aggressive move by Kau Blakes really kind of opened up and left him a a ding Lane R know another three nope not going to be there I mean hes hit a couple but thats not his game yeah I think with six minutes to go he needs to be in the paint area youre going to get three points to it uh with the n one closing in on 6 minutes to go from the Smith CER RJ Davis takes it himself Reno blocks it tips it twice and then got it back shot clock violation and the ball belongs to the Applause Cardinal ear theres a look there boy just real that was a just a great crossover he just got by Blakes I thought on that possession that uh Davis just dominated the ball a little bit too much bump underneath and this will put Stanford in the free throw line Davis got tangled up with blinks and we will have a Timeout on the Applause floor I dont know if Davis is bleeding or or whether Carolina took a timeout Applause here oh theres going to be a review previous play is under review for a potential hook and hold well and this is the issue when uh when a guard goes into post like Blakes is Applause it looks like theyre both locked up pretty good I mean you know that that could be called both ways and this is what you I talk about guarding where youre not used to guarding we saw a situation earlier with Washington out of the threepoint lineis and this is guards are not used to guarding in the post and and theyve done a nice job Stanford of running Applause you know of running Blakes into the low block and you talk about hes got a pro bot yeah he say he is a load inside so one and one for Blakes we mentioned how good the Cardinal is at the line hes an 80 free throw shooter and nothing but net so you would you numbers you would think uh Edge Stanford going out here if it turns into a bit of a free throw shooting contest Sanford AED nine at the free throw line make it nine of 10 tar Hills are 15 out of 18 Blakes has 14 in a game and a lead down to one with 527 to Applause go RJ Davis so patient that time it looks like me like he wants to put this team on his back and win this game and he he has just been very dominant with the ball Davis now a 17 shot clock at 15 they try and isolate Reno but Trimble drifted down there no double team that far away from the basket and another late double team shot clock at three Im not sure they know it sers lets it Fly and the rebound to tremble not a good offensive possession for Stamford its that late double team I think that threw the timing Applause off Carolina with the ball and a threepoint lead 427 left and thats going to be a foul from behind that is such such a Savvy move by Davis he knew where the defender was well and its not just a Defender its a big Defender and hes you know hes not used to guarding a guard out there he gets caught up and uh Davis Davis just Waits on him he just start stops his dribble and get Wass to get run over one and one though its two of two at the line RJ with 17 points if he stays healthy I mean he have to put some serious serious scoring together right now hes number two all time behind Tyler hansbro for a career scoring at North Carolina I hated to shoot in a quiet Id want to watch somebody making some noise even at home did the Cameron crazies listen to you on that a little bit I guess I guess all right here we go fivepoint game stand stanf for needs a bucket in a worst sort of way and Blakes will go to the line he knew he had the smaller and certainly leaner kdo well and if anything youve got to try to make him go left you know with Blakes he did a nice job getting to his strong hand and he knew if he can get his hip onto him at least draw the foul thats when you know youre a good free throw shooter you get breaks like that three for three from the Music line and four out of four and the lead is down to three back to his zone for Stamford Carolina hasnt done real well against this Applause Zone heres Jackson only one field goal the entire game for Ian Jackson 340 to go that is a vicious screen set by raino he said a couple of them I cant believe they didnt give him the ball on that penetration left hand is short and hes been quiet during this stretch we have not heard a lot from him crowd a little apprehensive right now Tom well understandably so Stanfords had a nice here Davison air ball and that is off of oh and Blakes cant believe it he thought that theyre going to review this I think theyre going to take a look at this because Blake thought this ball was off of Luben scoring inside and you know for him like we said it all during the game him and Washington have done a nice job together Carolinas largest lead is seven Stanfords five weve had nine lead changes and 10 ties three minutes exactly to Applause go step back three attempt by kdo you know thats the second time that theyve had a a guard on Kau and theyve settled for step back three instead of trying to drive him kadoo watches as R misses he only has seven points in the second half and hes just settling as he is whistled for a foul and K went crashing into one of our cameramen under the basket hopefully the cameraman and Kido are both okay well here heres the heres the thing Tom we we talk about numbers and kads had a a terrific game today but if youre if youre Hubert Davis you know hes got 22 points but K is seven of 22 and half of those are threepoint attempts I I think thats a line that Hubert Davis could live with if you make him a high volume shooter with half of his shots behind the threepoint line thats not bad um you know you better than him being seven of 12 and you know six of eight the three play Kau hits one of two yeah Reno had 15 points in the first half and just seven and Stanford has not hit a field goal in over five minutes yet still Trails by just four r no again and this time he knocks it in and a timeout by Kyle Smith raino two nights later played weight got beat and here they are before flying back to poo Alto tonight thatll be a long night yep and uh its a onepoint game 25 points 13 rebounds and four blocks and lets see this Zone has been really good for him oh great play by Young well young Im surprised he didnt go straight to the basket there he had a player at the other end that would have defended him its 63 and he goes 68 and heres Blakes and no call there its blocked by Jackson out of bounds shot clock 16 under two to go you know what Tom with young with more Court time this year maybe he might have reacted differently in that play I mean he just hadnt been on the floor that much I mean he actually passed the ball backwards after stealing all here we go theyve been so good on out of bounds plays and they do it again and agalar lays it home and Stanford leads by one that was just they pull everybody out they get a straight line cut with a pass for a layup I mean that that again thats a thing that should never happen agar wall watches his tremble lays it in and Carolina back in front 130 to go and a onepoint game good aggressive take they had ROV the weak side Rim opened up Young The Freshman passes up the three Reno coming out to set a screen and they cross courted to sellers shot clock at seven Reno with the ball he says get out of the way steps back and no good thats a tough shot and a jump ball possession North Carolina with 103 to go all right North Carolinas sit in good shape three timeouts for Hubert Davis Stanford with one neither team in the double bonus yet well Stanford next foul puts North Carolina there under a minute to play North Carolina lead Stanford by one kadoo to RJ Davis and its not there rebound for the Cardinal it was knocked out of bounds by tremble but its Stanford ball with 42 seconds left and a Timeout on the floor or are they going to review this a there they can review it with under two to Music go question is did it hit Blakes his hip after tremble after tremble swed the ball out of his Applause hands my my first reaction as I was looking at is I did did were they calling a foul on the play Lets Take a Look cuz we you know from from this angle here and from that from that angle from this angle it doesnt look like it hits anything but I dont know this the best angle I thought that first angle was a better look because yeah its you know its either going to have to be from behind or from the opposite side and I dont know if there if that one exists its hard to believe theres enough to overturn this call yeah andan all the stars are out here in Chapel Hill today saw Phil Ford earlier saw Roy Williams confirmed Stamford ball yep Stanford ball bill bellich is here well either either way um North Carolina will get will get the ball therell be another possession for them 427 on the on the game clock well how great was that guy he I got a chance to compete against him was a teammate of his actually up in New Jersey for a little bit dear dear man all right hes sitting on the edge of his seats go about 21000 of his buddies yeah coach Smith would have four fingers up in the air right now with him Reno Stanford down one and losing the handle Crown wanting a travel and heres Blakes and hell go to the free throw line bumped on the way up that was acrobatic by agar wal Applause Music Two Shots now for the 80 free throw shooter Blakes who is now five out of five from the line and that ties the Applause Music game by who you looking for if your Carolina coming back down to the other end trailing by one well I mean its its been RJ Davis I mean hes been the one whos you put the ball in his hands get something going to the rim Carolina has three play Im having an offensive play you know they score okay lets get it back in now Im I you know from your North Carolina youre taking a shot and giving yourself enough time to get an offensive rebound and get the ball back up youre not this isnt last last shot all right here we go thats RJ Davis with the ball in hand gives it off to tremble were down to 11 down to 10 tremble to the basket and hell go to the free throw line 77 seconds left Trimble has not been to the free throw line today he is an outstanding free throw shooter well and thats you know thats what what you want to do 84 send him may put the pressure on the referee drive it to the basket give yourself a chance for either a foul call he hits the first one to tie of the game 83 on the year I Jackson will leave in favor of the tall Drake Powell on defense for North Carolina this is for the lead got it all right Stanford will have to wait a second as H Davis calls a timeout beginning it back pretty quickly um I would you know North Carolina maybe put two guys in front of uh Blakes just try to outright deny him the ball getting it back at all cost are they full court pressure North Carolina and they give it right back to Blakes and here he comes cross over straight to the basket pull up fade away for the win with 09 if its stands well see if they reset the clock but Blakes we thought he would be the guy and and man oh man does he deliver and he hit a game winner against Santa CLA earlier in the despite the game that hes had Im not letting Jackson touch it either Blakes has 20 points and seven assists to go with four rebounds and you got to you know youve got now you got to go full court as well I mean this is all right lets see remember now you dont want a foul Rena on the ball and they changed the clock we thought they would thats why we we made the call that it was not for the game there there would be more time put back on 15 left here and it looks like its going to be kdo to try and catch it a step well is he going to go out of bounds and then throw it yep you have tremble at midcourt you have RJ Davis all the way at the other end of the Court under the basket theyre going to throw it the length in the floor and thats a game the Stanford Cardinal the biggest win in years in their program and thats not an exaggeration Blakes the former Duke Blue Devil with the fade away Baseline
