Road Orange Clemson in the home white Ron Grover Pratt Pat Driscoll Gregory Nixon are officials and here we go from Clemson South Carolina 2 Applause 2 inside to Victor lockin he struggled against the physicality of pit in the front court on Saturday how much phys ality will we see from this Syracuse starting five theyve used seven different starting lineups this year you mention it at the top of the show they are without Donnie Freeman for the fifth consecutive game well Lin has his he has his hand fulled inside the a Eddie lanin has great feet has a lot of physicality to play with and a really good passer as you can see both teams are trying to establish their bigs get these guys going in their first possession one team that is well established in this league this Clemson team so many from this starting five with great continuity including Ian sheflin whos Off the Mark and what a warrior he has been Rand off battling through the calf through the back and still playing at an elite level hes a walking double double just count it right now we wont even count his points to his rebounds until he get to 10 just book it right now well you know whos a walking 20 bucket Its JJ Starling he scored 20 or more in three of the last four for the qes and we talked about it hes a reason why this team is starting to come around what a guard matchup thats going to be tonight Hunter and Starling so many good matchups Starling and Hunter and we just saw earlier the Davis and sheflin as well as lamin and Lin its just a lot of critical matchups here and having JJ Starling back you just see a difference in his cuse team hes just making the game easy for himself they struggle they know they can go to him to get them a good Applause look under 10 to shoot five to shoot The Freshman Elijah Moore with two d three Davis puts it in and the Delaware transfer has been in the starting lineup over the last four games plus due to that injury to Freeman and what happens is when a player gets injured and you get you know get in the game you know youre going to get consistent minutes theres no rotation right now hes know hes going to play you know at least 20 25 minutes and so more opportunities come with that and so his production has increased Music five to shoot for Wiggins man he has become a revelation for this Clemson team they are N9 and0 when he scores in double figures as he did in the win against pit on Saturday hes the X Factor to how far Clemson can go I think this team is capable of beating anyone hes playing as that three four spot I think hes at his most dangerous when he asked the four because its a matchup problem but even as the three his versatility and what he brings on both ends of the floor posting up smaller guards as you saw there elevating over him Starling from downtown Syracuse has not been a great threepoint shooting team this season towards the bottom of the conference but tonight two quick ones well some of that is because again when youre missing your best player he makes the shots easier the field go attempts are easier for everyone else because of the coverage he draws hes gotten off to a fast start here five early points for Starling to feed to Taylor wide openen three and those are the looks you get when he gets back back in the game no one else can create draw the attention that he has and when you play that way youre going to get those type of looks Jaden Zachary in the foul speaking of toughness Jaden Zach just exemplifies that I mean hes always been a really good twoway player but he just settles his team down he both ends of the floor hes a really good shooter doesnt take a lot of Threes but hes really crafty strong gets to the rim he plays with a level of physicality with a chance here for an that one young man who has relished the opportunity to play for one of the elite programs in the ACC in his sixth and final season of college basketball which started at Chipola Community College see him there picking up accept him she got unofficial inverted horn there Jaden Zacharys like man Im pressuring the basketball well you mentioned something a moment ago about the tighter rotation with Syracuse Adrien red ay told us he feels like the title rotation has actually helped his team guys know theyre going to get more minutes they can play a little bit more freely they have and and thats what happens with your front Court guys in particular you know youre missing Donnie Freeman for fifth consecutive game he hadnt had a chance to have his full compliment of rosters and weve talked about that you know in games in the past I think thats been something thats been underlooked in the ACC in general the amount of injuries and key players missing games and this team has the ability to score when you get a guy back like a you know JJ Starling hes an all conference caliber guard I mean he hes not eligible enough at 18 points a game to be ranked in his scoring but hed be top five and he will be as he accumulates enough games meanwhile on the other side Brad brownells team just keeps finding ways to win they were up as many as 14 in the second half before pit went on that Big Run forced overtime found a way to gut that one out theyve won seven of eight in ACC play uh hes one of my favorite coaches in this league I mean because hes just so hes been good for so long uh I think people now with the elite eight run is just starting to accept and acknowledge how good he is but if you played against any of his teams theyve always been tough and difficult to play against he runs excellent offense and defensively theyve always been really good threeonone after the steal by Zachary shein with the jam Id say the back is looking pretty good tonight for Ian she yeah I think hes doesnt hurt his bounce he grabs his back there he might have hurt it jumping too Applause high Starling defended by Hyde Breer thats mismatch for Starling and he takes advantage great job there by JJ Starling screening so he can get the guard to guard switch Hunter thought about it inside to lock in left it short early concerted effort to go inside the Locking after he was held to just three points against pit locking there I thought got lampin in the air and avoided the contact as JJ Starling is on a heater nine points four of four from the floor to start at a threepoint lead for cuse Music Applause okay Zachary tried to flip it up and in and well be headed to the line for Two Shots when we return you cant understand the impact of having your best player back as jarier Davis lines up one as we got a great one here early Music oh you just G Music care Applause Music Applause Music woo when your best player returns from injury scores 20 or more in three the last four you win all three of those games you hope he comes out with a game like this on the road at Clemson man what a start for JJ Starling and this is what you want to see from when your player and this is what you missed I mean some of those earlier games when Syracuse is struggling on the offensive end of the floor hes the guy that can put the team on his back that can get them going and youre seeing him so far this first half I mean just coming off here to dribble hand off lockin L step stepping out take those two and now I switch I got Wiggins on your back up no you can have that one too and here just ball screens gets the switch H bready too small comes off again that time Ling didnt want to lock it didnt want to come out knock down another one then well coming up next jir Watkins Florida State square off against Cal on the west coast 900 pm Eastern fsus one backtoback games against pit and Georgia Tech thats a big one against the Cal Bears yes but for JJ Starling you know hes had career highs across the board this season except threepoint shooting which has been probably the Bugaboo for this Syracuse team offensively tonight though theyve hit a couple of quick ones early well whatll happen is Eddie L is a really good passer in the post so youre going to try to see lock and guard him one onone but having a guy like JJ out there everyone will get open look so youll start to see percentages come up because hes such a dynamic offensive player Baseline out of bounds 33 on the shot clock for Syracuse who is four for eight as a team from the floor hanging on to a onepoint lead early Kyle cuff just into the game Davis will have to heave and does not get it up in time well defended by Ian shefflin and its Clemson basketball red s laughing at him now thats thats a vet move like like man I dont want to mess my shoot percentage up you take this grenade and shoot it hot potato Kyle cuff when he comes in the game he usually takes the harder assignment takes pride in guarding the basketball and as he guards Chase Hunter here to start when he gets in the game Applause oh here is cuff with 10 oh went for the oneand jam and off the back of the Applause cup lockin open Music three theyre going to live with lockin taking that shot and JJ Starling takes the bump from hide breeder his first Christian Reed checks in and I thought he had a really good practice yesterday he was active you can see coach Brad brell is starting to try to get him going and he played him a lot in five on five yesterday and played him a lot with the starting group to get him in in the groove lets see the type of impact he has hes massive player you take for granted hes a 7 foot2 and he has great length and you need somebody to keep that length and Body on Lin hasnt played a ton of minutes this year last five games 8 minutes against Cal was his high lampin with a chance at the n one you got to help on Eddie lamin big physical post and he dribbles its almost like hes a Barkley and hes once he feels your body he spins he comes you put your body in your weight he feels that resistance he spins Baseline and thats going to be difficult for locking or for Reed they have to give some help the guards got to come in and dig and help get the ball out of Eddie Lins hand but youre really scared of his passing hes such a really big time passer rebound Del Jones who just checked in for Clemson no field goals in nearly three minutes for the Tigers they dont force anything they run their stuff I mean they have great they really good stuff in a half court theyre not going to force anything right on Q theres Jaden Zachary getting to his spot I think thats one thing that makes him so difficult to guard they they play the game at their own pace they theyre disruptive on the defensive end of the floor but on offense they got so many counters to what they run and make the game so difficult for you you cant speed them up with many ball HS picked off by Chase Hunter hammer time lets go lets go zero I know you you miss that first lead of the night for Clemson and Starling ends that he remains perfect from the floor five for five and his size coming to that ball screen is Ian sheins a really good player but he can Elevate right over him and hes just picking his matchups whoever he wants to attack right now Baseline kick to Zachary deep to no in the rebound Lucas Taylor one of four transfers getting regular minutes this year for red arrey and then you factor in three to four freshman when you get Freeman back its four a lot of newness this year hunter from downtown Chase Hunter reminding you dont forget about me as he snatches Taylor on that crossover pull up three there Starling defended by Zachary five to shoot and its jred loose by Applause Reeves Zachary hesi and off the window and a timeout taken by Syracuse Applause the tigers are really good on the defensive end at the floor here and their All Conference guard catches it and takes off as Clemsons up four e e of te e Music well Sunday weve got a womens Hoops triple header for you right here on the ACC Network North Carolina ranked in the top 15 looking for their fifth straight Victory followed by Boston College at Wake Forest and then NC State who has climbed into the top 25 takes on Virginia Tech in the night cap 6 Eastern on the ACC Network and the ESPN out Matt schacher Randolph chis with you as we welcome you back to Little John Coliseum Chase Hunter certainly headlines the night one of the leading scores in the conference but not to be outdone JJ Starling with 11 points on five of five shooting the start and a fourpoint deficit early for Syracuse Music kick out to Cuff thats a three and the third of the first half for the orange and we talked about this this is a different team like throw away what you saw on film in Syracuse before they they needed JJ Starling to get them going early and then now guys like Gyer Davis are starting to settle down and get more touches and we see them take advantage of them chase Hunter back down behind the play cuff maybe a little wild on the tap oh no you can see Syracuse is trying to push Tempo a little bit and score so they dont have to settle in against this thatp defense way downt 10 points for Chase Hunter he is its fun to watch right now the game is slowed down for him so much you and I talked about this before he preseason second team I dont think theres any question hes elevated that and hes first team All Conference J come down you dig cuff steps in and knocks one down and you cannot go under a dribble handoff against Chase hun hes shooting 46 from behind the line youve got to chase him off the line Hunter coming off his fifth 20o performance of the season in the overtime win against pit had that huge three to really put the game on ice at the end of OT Music inside to shefflin working on Davis great touch with the left hand goes over both shoulder prefers to go with that left but if you take that away he will p with with his good footwork he will go over that right shoulder you saw there Clemson plus 12 in the paint in the first half and theres a whistle in the paint against Dell Jones just great patience on the offensive end of the floor here with Clemson again theyre going to stay in character theyre not going to force anything and take bad shots you can see the threat Baseline Jer Davis goes and Ian Shin shoots the Lefty hook like I told you hes 10 and 10 Im not even count his stat until he gets to 10 well the thing is hes been battling that back for the last few weeks and I dont think folks outside the program and outside the club fan base know just how much it has bothered him Brad Brownell calling him a warrior and hes played like it hes always played like it hes the guy that forced coach to play him and hes just got better and better every year Jones fighting for the rebound and they will count it as a shooting foul and so Dell Jones will go to the line for Two Shots youve got to box out the guards when youre playing against Clemson Dale Jones and even Dylan Hunter when hes in the game those guys go to the offensive glass you dont pay attention you you you know as a guard youre not always thinking that youre not used to boxing out you got to against this group well our next gymnastics meet right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN half Sunday afternoon top 15 showdown at Stanford and pit at the historic Fitzgerald fieldhouse in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania coverage begins at 4 Eastern Applause largest lead of the game for Clemson and switching out the shoes for Kyle cuff he man if you dont have the right kicks on thats going to be a problem the rest of the game speaking of kicks you got Eddie lamin here with the one blue and one Orange Shoe making a statement yeah making a fashion statement go along with his game Chris Bell tough shot over two Defenders rattles it home stops a 70 Clemson run hes a guy that coach alre would love to see get going can really shoot the basketball behind the threepoint line but at 67 68 he has the ability to shoot over smaller guards Del Jones cans a three Dale Jones already over his season average of three Music points getting his opportunity and hes taking advantage of it an early five to go along with three boards for the freshman Commando over Applause Music Maryland picked off by Applause Hyer you cant have the pick sixes you cant just turn it over and give up the easy layup and its had two already here in the first half got to make him earn Applause it lampin reverse is sent Away by lockin second effort good with the left Music Applause hand Jones give him seven in the first half both of these guards as a guard you know when youre in a matchup and you got it big on the other side they thats not going to switch gives you a chance to when a half court just pick that mat up whenever you want once you get in the rhythm of how theyre guarding it and it looks like both teams are the shot clock gets low no they can run into a ball screen have their way Davis to Starling his first Miss of the night saved by Jones and wow tiptoeing the Baseline zipped it to chase Hunter like a quarterback fading away from the pressure yeah he really impressive he was able to get that much on it step through Hunter oh yeah rad arre calls time out 13point tiger lead theyve made their last four and theyre shooting 64 from the Music floor e Comm l Applause Applause right Music Music look think its time for family all right Clemson Tigers with their largest lead of the night at 13 coming into this game seven and one in League Play Joe lonardi right now Randolph chers has them as a seven seed but if they keep winning the way theyre winning right now no reason they cant improve that come March and I think they will and youre seeing here this is a really good team good guard play good balance inside as lck as lockin gets more comfortable and gives them more balanced inside he and Ian shu is able to hold things down interiorly and then you add Reeds and this team is only going to get better and better as I said before as chony Wiggins gets more comfortable himself I mean youll see this team as theyre seating theyll continue to improve this is the this is the only place I told you I I think Duke yeah is the only game I I think Duke has the most difficult win of the year or could lose I think is here coming up down the stretch Clemson Duke thatll be a tough stretch for Clemson because they also play North Carolina its Duke and North Carolina back to back five to shoot here for Syracuse Starling with two step back three got it wow and they had to have it you got that feeling Clemson was starting to create a wave and Starling stops the momentum he just gives you the ability when you need a bucket just ability to to deliver and the team is struggling and he you give him the ball late and he knocks in a three contact on the perimeter by jquan Carlos his first foul I mean Carlos gives him this one dribble left Rhythm shot and again tlor just got to find someone else to step up here I think Carlos and other guys got to find their Niche and they got to be more aggressive when Lin has the ball maybe cut some strong side or weak side to get involved in this game Zachary no lockin with a put back thats something I think lockin can do more of with the guard play that he has and the penetration that they provide dont always Pop Roll in and clean up the Music glass first point to the night for the Cincinnati transfer back to Starling for three everything working tonight for Syracuses leading score Bron just looked at him as he ran down to court like you got to be kidding me he has 17 in the first half hes averaging 17 a game in League Play great feed shefflin to lock in Clemson is just controlling the paint everything is at The Rim either by turnovers or in the half court execution Carlos to lampin and again he is stuffed by lockin i iing showing you why hes the leading shot Blocker in the ACC with his second block shot here in the first half hyater driving floats it in off the window what a take by the former Air Force Academy star and hes known as a threepoint shooter not putting it on the floor getting to the rim great job there driving to his left and kissing it off the glass def def Applause and this is the issue with Syracuse now its a l you worry about JJ wearing down against this Clemson defense splits the double shakes and goes down but I believe theyre going to call a goal 10 on my stovic and he did not need to touch it I believe that was going to find its way to the bottom of the cup regardless what everything else JJ starting his shot is gone and why would you think that one would be would be any different Music the tigers are coming out and theyre playing well I mean everythings working here the cut the bucket the Finish Clemsons playing strong here Music early e e e Music Music Music yeah thanks Taylor and youre exactly right you know when you look at the way JJ Starling has shot the basketball seven for eight hes tied his season average per game in the first half and yet youre down 13 where do you go from here Randolph if youre Syracuse well you got to get someone else involved I mean he this is what you expect when youre struggling on the offensive end of the floor youre gu to be able to keep you in the game hes done his part now who else is going to step up and get going but they got to figure out a way to get stops I think theyre going to extend their defense here coming out of this timeout other guys got to get involved but more important they got to get stops before they start worrying about who else is going to score youre not going to win a game when an opponent shooting 65 right now and its efficient is JJ Starling is Chase Hunter on the other side is hes only missed one Music shot finally got to see the The two3 Zone here hi H braider Off the Mark locking Tapout hunter from downtown theres your stop yeah well I think they they had that in his pocket and talking to coach arrey hes willing to mix that zone in they been so much manto man in his transition from coach beheim and he wont go too far away from that that two3 zone Lin left it short Here Comes Chase Applause Hunter Zachary at three locking nobody boxed him out Hunter goes back inside Hy Raider from downtown couple of really good looks there on that possession for the Tigers Great Looks the balls moving guys are getting open looks thats why you shoot a high percentage just unselfish play every bodys looking for the extra pass you know you got a good team when thats happening meanwhile for Syracuse theyve gotten backtoback stops but theyre in the midst of a 2 and 1 half minute scoring drought we referenced Starling with 17 the rest of the team 12 points on five of 15 well the zone is an adjustment the ball doesnt move as much against the zone so great job by coach alry going to the Zone theyve gotten two stops and lets see if they can get anything going in the offensive end Music Applause Hunter attacking ran into lockin and I believe they caught a 3 second violation on Victor lockin so its going back to the orange lockin thought the shot was going up he turned around to box out he didnt know Chase Hunter had turned the shot down right into his gut yeah thats almost when youre getting a little too unselfish at that point but those are those are great problems to Applause have Bell trying to shake hiy breeder lost it Starling coughs it up and here comes Zachary Hunter Bang from downtown talk about unselfish play there creating a steal Chase Hunter runs runs their wing and knows Jaden Zacharys going to find him he walks into Applause one 70 Clemson run Starling with five hounded by Zachary lockin steps out over the double team and did not draw Iron really good defense there by the Clemson Tigers here just turning defense again weve seen it and this to me falls under that category to pick six get the turnover and if youre going to give Chase Hunter an open three you can count Music that Syracuse trailed by 17 in the first half against Notre Dame came back to win that game hunter is on a hater 10 tiger run 18 for the Clemson leading score he shot that right in our line of sight and it never left the rim it looked good the entire time and it was good now you coach arre youre searching for answers theyre starting to knock down shots against your Zone theyre carving up your man and now youre struggling on the offensive end of the floor because your star is starting to fatigue late in the timer again its Bell locken picked his pocket Bell with one basically a halfcourt heave and thats the ninth turnover of the first half for the orange as the tiger defense is clamped down and now Brad Brownell calls a timeout and a perplexed look by Red arery we will step aside for 30 seconds back for the conclusion of the first half after this two two Clemson on a 100 run over the last four and a half minutes theyve forced four turnovers over that stretch they lead 14 zip in that points off turnovers category what weve seen from them since the 4minute timeout defensively has completely shifted this game they have theyve extended their pressure and if its not been for the heroics of JJ Starling in his start I mean this game would be really bad and I mean for for the orange and plenty of time here to get to the rim and Starling uses a foul they had one to give and they have another one to give if they really want to use it with 31 left in the first half first foul on Starling so now theyre going to bring him off the floor red autrey doesnt want to risk that n you dont want to save him just three seconds here you got a foul but if you youre going to foul you got to do it early Hunter did get fouled by Movic good thing he did the way hes shooting it right now and I dont think he was trying to foul there it looked almost like he was he was caught between the decision between fouling and not fouling yes you know its one of those if that was a half just a half court play that they werent you know and the shot clock wasnt so low I dont know if they would have called iton officials know that they have time lock in deep three what a first half for the Clemson Tigers shot nearly 60 meanwhile Saturday five to shoot Taylor pullup was fouled in the act of shooting it will go against Chase Hunter and two shots coming for the orange first take a look at Donnie Freeman there a Five Star freshman Washington DC missing his fifth consecutive game and he they get JJ Starling back and he and Donnie Freeman play together one game and then he gets out and hes injured now and its just been that type of season for the orange and its frustrating when you lose your best player and then you lose your five star on top of that and I know theres a lot of disappointing Orange fan but none more than coach altering and not having his full complimented players in particular his two best playing together and during that seven game stretch without JJ Starling they went two and five right you obviously we see the impact that he makes on his team and it makes for everyone else but where this team has to get back is defending and and they have done that at times and weve seen that no matter the balls gone through the basket or not theyve struggled with that today inside the lockin going to work and just misses out on a chance at the n one against lampin and that is the first on the Colorado a transfer Lin had an opportunity in the first half he got lampin off his feet in the first half and he shot a fade away missed a couple shots early and he started settling for threes now hes back working himself inside that time taking a contact and giving himself a chance to get get some free throws locking certainly a capable scorer though he makes an impact regardless of whether or not hes scoring seven rebounds in the first half big pickup for Brad Brown Allen the transfer portal this off season well his number one job is to protect the rim and and anchor this defense and he hes mobile enough to help on hedging screens and hes done a good job of that but hes leading the ACC and shot blocking and hes got enough guys on the perimeter defend his job is protect the paint 18point deficit for the orange Davis fade away and rims out Applause deep Post Feed sent back by Davis its a great battle there by those two guys C have won three of their last four including a 17point comeback Victory against Notre Dame on Saturday their largest comeback victory of the season you cant come back in the game taking quick shots like that thats just a freshman making a taking an Elvis shot trying to make an 18point lead and one shot just continue to run your offense trust it cuz thats what Clemson does thats what youre youre dealing with when you play Clemson theyre not going to get sped up theyre going to execute their offense theyre going to share the basketball what a lot lockin cant finish and here comes Starling who had 17 in the first half on Seven of Nine starlings looking for some help I think hes also a little fatigued and hes trying to find get someone else going picked off by Hunter watch out shefflin tracks it down unabated and a second opportunity here for the Applause Music Tigers under 10 to shoot Wiggins at Deep three wow just a really good fade screen there no communication at the top of the key for the orange defense and just another open look lamin takes it to the cup Elijah Moore tried his best to win it back draws a foul sending lockin to the floor and that is the third on the Freshman from the Bronx see this Face Screen coming and you go under against Clemson and the ability they have to shoot the basketball from behind the threepoint line youre asking for trouble weve seen that happen on dribble handoffs on the fade screens and tigers made them pay every time oh thats what red ay told us before the game we have to run Clemson off the three off the threepoint line one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the conference havent been able to do it so far in this game no because they gave up so many point uh paint points earlier they were getting to the rim so almost like the body punches from Clemson just took over they started sinking in the defense to protect themselves in the paint and then you giving up Music threes but you got to take something away and thats right now theyre not doing that as theyre struggling here on the offensive end of the floor as well Taylor on the feed from Movic and thats something you can do with just cutting you know the tendency is to chase the basketball and over dribble sometimes cutting away from the ball the ball will find you great job there for Taylor catching and Music finishing Wiggins off the screen from shefflin shefflin to easy getting around Starling for two and thats just and playing thats not them running any sets theyre just playing basketball so after they a team that that defends you well they have great execution in their off con set theyre just playing at that point just concept based and you have to have your defensive principles against this group and you got to be died in when youre playing them Lampkin Starling Corner three my stovic short on the put back and Wiggins comes away with Applause it sh his laboring a little bit coming down the court steps into a three lampin nicely done to track that into the hands of Starling pushing the pace Starling Coast to Coast rims it down as he falls into the first row of seats you can see that time he got the ball he was had one thing on his mind is getting to the rim and hes grimacing a little bit gripping that right hand as he gets back into the defensive stance Applause look at look at the high low action Music there five to shoot for Applause Hunter sheflin behind the back save to lockin got to rebound the basketball and the number one job on the off in the offensive glass or defensive position in this you got to block sou Ian sheff bang shefflin downtown Second Chance points with this group hes been a really effective and really good offensive rebound since hes since hes been been able to crack the lineup and thats the number one job when you defending him is you got to box him out and keep him off the glass and that time hes the beneficiary of his own offensive Applause rebound lamin goes with the hook and a timeout taken by Red a will take it with them Syracuse trying to dig themselves out of a deep hole on the road Music w e what I mat shoe marker right off children with you case Hunters been in his bag tonight four for six from downtown hes just doing what hes been doing all year long and we talked about interesting statting hes playing this season at a 50 40 90 Cliff the last time that was done was by a guy named Kyrie Irving give you the kind type of company that hes in right now and Kyrie only played 11 games hes just having an incredible season in his sixth year his best year and his head coach Brad Brownell says hes an old soul in bed every Night by 930 part of that might be that hes got a near oneyearold daughter Milani celebrating her first birthday in just a couple of days his brother Dylan who is at home right now feeling ill comes over a lot they call him Uncle Dill its a family affair with the hunter brothers and Milani who turns one on January 24th thats a great story and great family as well and its amazing he went on that run with the with an infant at home can you imagine a lack of sleep that he got I know he loved the road trips something I know you can relate to a little bit having some young kids at home I know you enjoy being home but you got you got some babies at home let wait for my wife to go to bed no no no no no she knows Im telling her but youre right I mean he had an infinite home and led this team to an Elite 8 run last year really impressive his locket hits a three and you get him going and his ability to knock down that shot will stretch the floor and open up the paint when they play against a shot blocker that they want to move away from the rim and theres so many weapons here for Clemson step back Starling man he has been terrific tonight another 20 plus Point performance night for the leading score for Syracuse thats four in the last five games Music Lockett going to work on lampin and he is headed to the foul line F everyones knocking down shots here Victor lockin says let me get one of those as well Clinton having their Music way e a e e e Music Music all right lets turn up the heat a little bit at Little John Coliseum and let Randolph chis talk about his top tiers in the ACC I think you start with Duke I dont think anyone argues that Clemson I think is mean Louisville has elevated themselves I think Clemson is right there behind them and the deakes are sitting there seven and one and and they got a a stretch coming here that can that they can push themselves into the NCAA tournament talk and I think that next tier guys the SMU the pitch Carolinas and those guys are just trying to play themselves in the tournament what do you think about where Joe lonardi has the league right now mid January I I think its been a narrative thats been there again I I feel comfortable seeing Duke Louisville and Clemson are definitely in and pit dropped four straight Carolina right now is 12 and8 just lost to the deakes and SMU is right there but theyve had some bad losses when theyve lost and I think that the net ranking just it affects the net one team thats not in there but plays later on tonight right here on the ACC Network Florida State yes and you and I had them against Georgia Tech over the weekend theyve won back toback including beating pit one of Pits four straight losses their net is more favorable than Wake Forest yes you keep winning if youre Florida State you have a chance to play yourself into that March Madness conversation everything that Florida States wants to achieve is right in front of him with all the adversity and the negativity thats been around him the last couple years this team is healthy theyre good everyone knows about jir Watkins but I tell you what Malik Yuan and the rest of those guys are just stepping up their play theyre defending at a high level I love that freshman Davis theyre defending theyre making shots its just a typical Leonard Hamilton team and they havent been in a couple of years to the NCAA tournament they dont have the high level NBA guys that he had when he had that incredible run that we all know in the ACC tournament I thought that was a final four team that they had right before the pandemic cuff hits a three Syracuse hanging around a little bit here now can they string together some stops I love cuff story hes just forced coach to play him hes he comes in hes with the defensive mentality Applause now Clemsons in their half court execution theyre going to their high low and theyll automatically get into that when you start switching ball screens with Ian shefflin hell roll right inside locking a flash if hes knocking down threes then again they were already difficult to defend he just makes him that much more difficult to guard theyve hit nine in the game lampin good offensive rebound lockin is shaken up and grimacing as he hobbles up the floor gripping his left thigh Brad Brownell keeps him in for now blocking shuffling saves and knocked out itll stay here and boy locking is in some severe discomfort under the Clemson basket we will step aside and come back with more unlocking after Music this e e all Music time see Applause Music Music welcome back to Little John Coliseum where Victor lockin continues to be tended to on the Clemson sideline he does appear like he will return in this game good news for the Tigers more good news for Tigers fans this is Don from Hampton County South Carolina

too many weapons just operating at a high level right now and theyve tried Zone they tried man and just not many answers and to be and the orange have found some production themselves but that right there there has been the ailles hill tonight its just been their turnovers and theyve just been able to finish it Hunter stripped Davis kept it alive Wiggins through contact puts it in seven points for Chanty Wiggins its been that type of night for the Tigers theyre 190 in points off turnovers for the orange cuff fouled on the three by Chase Hunter and he is headed to the foul line f is theyre just carving them up here you do a great job you steal it and then you throw it away again and thats just been indicative of how the nights gone the score for the Orange is not as bad as this team was shooting they still over 50 from the floor right now but defensively they just had no answer well tomorrow at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header nothing but net will break down the night in the ACC with highlights analysis of every womens game and look ahead to the best matchups weve got on our air this weekend right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app now you talked about Kyle cuffs story you cant complete the story without talking about all the injury adversity that hes been through this is a young man that was highly recruited goes to Kansas tears his MCL and his PCL the year that Kansas wins the national championship comes to Syracuse injes himself again in the summer this is the first year Rand off that hes been fully healthy and he plays the game with the level of confidence and appreciation he just comes in he doesnt care about any of that he just wants to win and hes one of the story I love his story because hes forced coach Archer to PLS you know he wasnt in the rotation but hes coming in hes hes taking on the role of being the defender pressuring the basketball guarding the teams best perimeter P player I dont know how you guard Dell Jones any better than that thats just the night the Tigers have had offensively making tough shot after tough shot yeah theyve never been uncomfortable thats part of the problem that they had its a lot easier to shoot those kind of shots when youre up 20 and on the other end of the floor you youre trying to struggle to find offense a lot of dribbling not enough cutting and Applause passing Syracuse needs to do what the what Clemson is doing and thats making plays for other for other players theyre sharing the basketball turning down good shots for better Applause Music shots Dell Jones is taking advantage of his minutes here nice drive lows his shoulder kisses it off the glass Chase Hunters younger brother Dylan Hunter usually gets that gets those minutes and hes out sick and next man up mentality and Dale Jones have stepped up and take advantage of those minutes showing coach Brad Bron that hey you can try to find a couple more minutes for me when he comes Applause back well Monday the Huddle crew will reveal this seasons ACC football schedule yes folks were already talking about next season National Championship games over time to turn the page to the 2025 college football season well have the reveal Simo cast for the first hour ESPN 2 and the ACC Network on Monday Im still stuck going the guy won 100000 man are you kidding me A lots happened since the last commercial break it was and I still cant get past it hes from South Carolina Hampton County I dont even know where that is I know 100000 is going to take him a long way Ill tell you what Dons going to be a local Legend oh God after tonight maybe hell share something with you on your way out the door I wish the way his wife ran past me I dont know how much could be left for me she see that out of Applause screen I dare Applause you Taylor quick three rebound Wiggins and Jaden Zachary slows the pace for the Tigers in control on top by 22 tight game early in the first half thanks to JJ Starling but it has been all tiger sense Chase Hunter has Carlos just chasing him hes just Kanan Carlos is just having his hands full guarding Music him Carlos deep pull up give him two every time I watch Syracuse play hes really unselfish I think he can be more aggressive on the offensive end of the floor and if hes aggressive looking to score hell create more opportunities thats an offensive foul on Dell Jones drawn by jquan Carlos 20po Clemson lead when we return a special visit to a local legendary spot here in Clemson South Carolina Music Ang NE you Applause well it is Military Appreciation Night here at Little John Coliseum the student section getting purple camouflage bucket hats and you know what we thought we should partake in the fun here built by grit Matt Schumacher Randolph chis with you its been a weekend of partaking in Clemson tradition earlier today we got a chance to go to the legendary Max DriveIn spot and the owner had an old ESPN flag in his closet which we got to pull out and take a picture with thats the Burman days there leading that I mean look at that sign I was afraid not to rip it when we had it would be remiss if I did not mention that we flipped Randolph chers today at the lunch counter this is a burger yes and steak burger spot and you almost ordered a grilled chicken sandwich but we made you feel so guilty did that you had to get the double cheese I hadnt had a cheeseburger in 10 years and luckily my stomach agreed with it for one but it was really really good thats how you know its quality at driving I highly recommend it started back in the 60s and it has been a legendary spot ever since one of those places with the wall littered with pictures and autographs and just a really cool local spot here in Clemson South Carolina great place youre running everyone there and just a crowd coming in and out it was just uh great lunch today tiger have won six of their last seven games their only loss over that stretch was to Louisville and those two teams right now you know you had them earlier in the night when we showed your sort of Tears in the ACC those are two teams that are right there with Duke Louisville and Clemson both have one LW in League Play both to the Duke Blue Devils and I beg your pardon Clemsons losses to pit they play Duke in a little bit here at Little John Coliseum if they can win that game watch out theyre in contention to win the league well they are and they should be considered for that I mean Duke has been so dominant you know you you never want to think about a team possibly going undefeated and but defensively you when you watch Duke you historically youre hearing coaches say this team is the best defensive team that theyve seen in the ACC and its hard to argue against that type of length right now and and and Duke is just such playing such at a high level which JJ Starling knocks down another jumper there hes just hes hadnt had much help today 25 points for Starling three onone here lockin will pull it back out yeah thatll be a huge game here in Clemson South Carolina February 8th 6 pm Eastern on ESPN Duke against Clemson and if these two teams continue to play the way they have been playing Duke winners of their last 12 that is a major matchup in early February and lets not forget Lille who is I I think playing as well as any of these guys with all the adversity that they faced I think the biggest thing you see with those top three teams is they have an identity and how they play and I think weight from a defensive standpoint belongs in that conversation and again we talked about the deak having a gauntlet of a schedule coming up where they can play themselves into the NCAA tournament got a great win last night K Carolina whos at 12 and 8 are fighting for their tournament lives right now and its just its a lot of basketball left to be played and I think everyone has a reason to be optimistic but I dont think theres much debate about who the top three teams are I think theyre in no matter what its Duke Louisville and Clemson provided they stay healthy but the way both of those all three of those teams are on both sides of the basketball would you give Louisville the upper hand because they have the head to head yes with Clemson won that game back at the Young Center and I the step that Clemson has to take I think theyre really good in this building I think theyve got to do a better job when theyre on the road I think thats the one thing that I think to take another step is what I think Clemson Tigers need to do but right now theyre having their way here Music tonight 30 second break well be right back from from Little John Coliseum Music Clemson Tigers 455 away from moving to 8 and one in League Play theyre only lost to a surging Louisville team that has won nine in a row and you look at the top of this league you know we were chatting about it before that last commercial break Duke has won 12 in a row Louisville has won nine in a row Clemson is about to win their seventh in the last eight games the top three in this league very very strong as we get near the end of January and they are I think they separated themselves and theres no question about who they are and where they are but its going to be difficult for even for those guys I think theyve separated themselves and well see if teams like Syracuse as they can get healthy can make a comeback and can a de Step Up SMU this were approach in February now its its its time to step up one of the interesting things that R ay told us is because of what NC State did last year there is still hope for a team like them to make a run all is not lost because of the way their season has started and I think one thing to consider is is as we get into the ACC Play Its unlike years in the past youre going to have three teams that that does not make it to Charlotte for the ACC tournament to have that opportunity and youre going to be fighting for that so theres an equal opportunity at the bottom of the roster mean of the league well tonight was an opportunity to get their first quad one victory of the Season that will continue to elude them but they have four q1 Q2 opportunities in a row beginning again right after this game you dont always get punished for playing them or losing them but eventually you got to win them and you got to get someone on your resume to win but right now just got to cons find some consistency in what youre doing right now Ill tell you what that that game against pit which is Syracuses next opponent at home on Saturday that is a game with some real urgency for both teams pits drop four straight coming in and they have to find a way to figure things out but right now when you teams are finding a level of desperation and this the orange are equally as desperate need to get a win theyre starting to play better and meanwhile the Tigers upcoming schedule you know weve talked a lot about that game on February 8th against Duke right behind that Carolina the good news for Clemson is that that is the end of a threegame home stand which begins with George attack on February 4th yeah but I dont think youre going to look that far you got to go to blackburg which is always tough Mike young has a young group but theyre always theyre well coached and never easy place to go win and then we talked about NC State with the way they defend as well so winning on the road is what separates the good teams and the average teams or the or the bottom teams in the leag five to shoot Carlos no rebound attempt lampin somehow snatched it away from two tigers and lays it in with the right hand the offensive end of the floor has not been the problem they found enough offense when theyve taken care of the basketball its just the turnovers an ability to get back to set their defense when theyve had a chance to execute on the offensive end the floor theyve been theyve been really solid had nine turnovers in the first half only four so far in the second half as Zachary will go back to the foul line our final timeout here at Little John Coliseum back after this e e e 16point Clemson lead on the verge of winning their seventh in the last eight games thanks to chase Hunter who is our player of the game tonight brought to you by into it what a night hes had what a year hes having as we talked about it hes having a great year nothing no fall off from the historic Pace that hes on and weve talked about it playing in obviously hes playing a win but hes playing elev his Tigers but statistically hes on Pace for a 50 40 90 season and and that is Elite numbers and Elite play cuz the like we mentioned before the last one to do that was Kyrie Irving but he only did it in 11 games chase Hunter is on the verge of doing it for a season and shout out to the student section behind us man theyve been theyve been theyve been loud and rocking going after a little bit even though they should weve given them cookies and everything else weve been able to give them the ones that you didnt eat already easy partner theyve influenced you heavily tonight you are still wearing the built by gret they bought me over man they won me over I mean what can I say its one of those cool venues where the students are literally on the floor you know its its its got that Cameron Indoor feel a little bit with the students so close to the action Matt the hardest place to play for me was here really yes often said that back in those days when Wayne Buckingham and all those former Clemson Tigers I paid the price for cutting down the paint against those guys but they uh this was by far the most difficult place to play for me always loud always loud students always on top of you and they were always just a big physical team with Cliff Ellis and his team what was it like when you were inbounding the basketball on the student section side of Cameron indor and everybodys got their hands in your face uh Ive always won games there so it never bother me you know shade thrown at this I will always that no Im kidding those guys I I give all their players I give Jeff crap when I play against Jeff and all the former they have so much success this D yeah you got it got to balance itself out and I mean look at what the year that theyre having right now with Cooper flag and those guys just unbelievable the season there having it and doing it with three freshman in the starting lineup now all three freshman are NBA draft picks so theres that to consider but thats always the case with duke it doesnt change anything but whats different about this group of freshman is Cooper flag is what he is on both ends of the floor and usually freshman struggle on the defensive end of the floor hes coming in day one hes a hes aite and Kam on malat R protection and what he brings is like I I mean when I say thats the best defensive team that Ive seen in college basketball and again you have multiple coaches in the ACC saying its the best that theyve seen and theyve experienced in their career in the league and thats before we begin to talk about what they are on the offensive end and what they have with the transfers as well and Mason Gillis and cion James and Malik Brown and what they bring to that team as well well coming up next more ACC hoops Florida State tries to win three in a row theyll have to do it on the West Coast against Cal 9 Eastern right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app as Chase Hunter goes to the line backto back 20po games for Syracuses four Clemsons leading score he now has seven 20po games this year he did miss a free throw so hes got to make sure he knocks in and makes his free throws to keep the 90 going thats pretty darn good company him and Kyrie Irving and as you mentioned Irving did it in 11 games games yeah obviously Hunters already played more than that this season was still more to go that three is Good from Davis little spurt here at the end of the game from Syracuse but a little too too little too late for the orange who were down as many as 24 with 850 to go in the game look at those numbers that is Elite playing and and I often say you can judge a player what you can tell from a player in his percentages is if he knows what he is you know and and sometimes youll find guys that are not Shooters theyre more scorers and theyll take a high volume of threes and theyll have a low percentage thats just not a strength there but hes in efficient at all three levels and doesnt take a ton of bad shots he lets the game come to him his teammates find him Music and you wouldnt be upset with him shooting with those kind of numbers if he forced a couple of shots and he doesnt do Music Applause it well Clemson will move to 8 one in League Play and they will next pH Virginia Tech right back here on the ACC Network 500 pm Eastern on Saturday in blackburg and on the other side Syracuse in a game that feels mustwin for both teams they will take on the pit Panthers whose net ranking is still quite good but they have lost four in a row big game coming up in New York on Saturday for the orange but it was all t Tigers tonight as Elijah Moore steals it at the buzzer and catches in from downtown
