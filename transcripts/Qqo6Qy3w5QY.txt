applying some pressure trying to force the tempo creating turnovers just like that as Adrien Woolly scoops to the basket I know hes happy to see the ball going in Struggled the last couple of games and its kind of like to see the ball going through the net getting easy with the air ball three Rogers the long pass to McNeely in the corner for a triple and he got it Thats what he do Coming off a five for11 game against South Carolina State knocking down five triples from behind the ark On a 152 run to take a 176 lead here in the early going against Jackson State Ruffin gets to the basket A

blast by the way He came over to talk to us Hes loving life as a Louisville basketball player He checks in Z is the definition of relentless He was showing off the little floater in the warmups I asked about that He said Thats my shot It is You watch highlights and clips of him when he played in Greece That is his That is his shot Short roll to a nice floater Basketball Tatum with the highlighter yellow shoes Cant get the three to go You better be in a shoot Youre going to wear shoes like that Larry Yeah youre going to youre going to wear those You got to have some game to back it up laughter But coach Mo Williams has got some fancy shoes on there Hes got the game to back it up Yeah but he could play cheering Kobe for Zugris Drives in got that paint touch then the pass out to Roots who misses the three They want to get 50 paint touches And we see theyre really moving the ball Weve seen that early in the early going into the season That was one thing that that really improved upon their game from the first three games that they played to South Carolina State They really reverse the ball They do the extra pass Go from good shots to a better shot as Woolly finds Z there for the layin I think from Woolly like there are big expectations obviously coming for the C USA freshman of the year But its just a matter of getting out there and playing it reacting not thinking so much cuz he can he can clearly do it Thats it Hes just got to find his way OF OH MY GOODNESS applause Can trying to catch a body on the rim Little pick and roll Woolly The nice pocket pass to Zugris who gathers himself in the lane and then goes up and finishes with the left And he doing a good job of keeping the defender on his back on the roll and being strong and finishing around the rim If it was one person I would want to set the pick and pick a role on the team it would be Zugris Thats a significant pick laughter That is a wide frame there I mean Otis George couldnt set a P Ellis Miles got me open Ellis Miles got me open Jackson could also get a triple double He could man He was he he was uh a triple threat man Tigers one of their last 11 from the field Cards on an 182 run right now as theyve extended this lead to 206 And Roots knocks in that free throw as well Kenny with four points off of the line after his careerhigh 20 point effort the other night If youre just tuning in Javon Hadley not available for Louisville tonight due to concussion protocol took a hit the other night in their win over South Carolina State but Tase Prior is back He saw a few minutes of action already his first action since last November Mike Williams the coachs son with the three from the top of the key Cant get it to go And were going to get a foul underneath on that rebound You talked to coach before the game Hes he says his son can play a little bit He can His Mike Williamss son is a ball He said he had opportunities to go elsewhere and play but you know chose to stay home and play for his dad at Jackson State And hes got some game Hes got some game Hes young Big time recruit coming out of high school Won a couple of championships down in Mississippi Hes going to be a player for his coach Williams comes up with the loose ball Heres Russ again Goes is quick man Ruff and scrambled Z and like some eggs right there You see the Cards leading scores on Monday 20 points for Roots McNeely with 17 hit five triples The freshman Mike Brown on Q for three Cant get it to go but he had 11 points and six assists the other night Time is out on the floor Cards lead it 218 in the early going on a 122 run right now for the game He uses that as a recruiting tool He loves to give these guys the experience of playing on the big stage and his main focus is wanting to prepare these guys for conference play around January so his guys will be ready when it comes to swack play Tatum drives in and I thought we might get a charge but looked like he was there Were going to get a block and Jaylen Tatum with his highlighter shoes and a chance to go to the line Well see What do you think Oh its a bang bang play Sand kind of jumped off I think Sandanda leaving his feet Sort of a sort of a blocking call but it could have went either way Looked like he was set I think he just has to keep his feet planted on the ground cheering cheering T the line for a pair of free throws That was uh just the second foul on the cards Tatum a 71 free throw shooter last season Knocks in the second one and its 219 Jackson State applying a little bit of pressure here trying to get Louisville out of rhythm Fouls on number 24 Thats his first 17 foul First foul on Ruffin but the seventh on the Tigers The Cards already in the bonus here You mentioned how quick that was going Might slow down here now 1141 laughter left Louisvilles headed the line for one on a bonus for Conwell who is one for two from the line so far tonight Four points cheering Its great for Louisville You want to attack every chance you get in transition opportunities on closeouts Jackson State obviously not wanting a foul being in the bonus Great opportunity to attack the rim Kyle knocks in the front end Isaac McNeely Mike Brown Conwell Fu and Roots on the court for the Cards Another free throw for Conwell and the Cards lead 239 with six assists on their seven baskets Maybe one of the more impressive things for this team early in the season is their passing It is And like I said before each game theyve gotten better and it was really noticeable in the South Carolina State game with 23 assists where they had good shots but they made the extra pass for better shots I was waiting they want to hunt great Thats thats what coach Kelsey says hunt great And the way these guys shoot the ball the percentages will go up even higher with that mentality Million with a little fadeaway jumper on the baseline Conwells got a little path in the lane but he is rejected by Kobe Butler The Tigers have a chance to cut into this 12point deficit Jackson State looking a lot more comfortable in this game than they did in the Illinois game on Monday Well Illinois hit like 10 threes Yeah it was Plus theyre all 7 FT TALL OH ROUGH AND GOODNESS I dont know how he got that up but Luke saves it on the basket for comes up with the loose ball cheering Panel says Did you say three Three ball He can fill it up quick He can fill it up quick That is his second triple of the night Prior and Woolly set to check into the next dead ball for the Cards Shot clock under 10 seconds Jamie Mitchell on the baseline deflected and stolen by Brown cheering Maybe quick with that one Yeah it could have could have had an opportunity to attack there as you see him here getting in the paint kicking it out to Ryan Conwell for the easy three Thats what coach Kelsey loves the paint touch the dish for the three 2611 Louisville leads it as roots and McNeely head to the bench Right now we have Woolly Prior Brown Conwell and Fu on the court for the Cards Heres Mitchell whos trapped Thats one thing youre going to get out of Prior was so active cheering That was one thing he was really good at last year was jumping pick and roll traps trapping in full throw Hes got great hands getting his hands on a lot of deflections getting a lot of ball create easy opportunities cheering to get in transition applause and also a big guy like this who can guard as Ruffin goes by him but hes relatively well Hes better but I mean that thats about as quick as guys Roughing is a blur Hes out there just having his way on those islands What do you think it cheering does for Prior though just to see the ball go through the hoop Oh tremendous amount of confidence And its good to see him out here playing It doesnt look like hes thinking or laboring on that leg Hes having fun Yeah you can see him breathing a little heavy though Hes got to get that cardio back up McMillian for three Out of balance That was a good shot though It was number 11 Jason Prior back on the court for the Cards for the first time in over 11 months Look at this The double team He gets the deflection the steel and then he glides in for the little finger roll layup Giving it to the crowd 2813 Louisville shooting 47 from the field Just three for 10 from three so far Were going to get a foul up front on Woolly guarding Mike Williams Adrien Woolly Thats his first 13 foul Its the third 13th foul on the card so far Not sure whats going on with Kobes arm there Hes got a pretty good take Kobe Rogers guarding the inbound Million with another three He was bound to get one to go Preseason second team ball swag player trying to find his range Hes got nine quick points in this one and now 2816 Willie inside the basket and the foul Great pass from Ali Khalifa set the nice rub screen Got Adrien Woolly open on the curl to the basket Adrian able to finish through contact giving himself an opportunity to go to the line to complete the threepoint play Its a great rub screen there Adrian finishing through the contact and one Hes just the scorer He and Conwell are both you know both lefties both very comfortable in the paint I think thats the strength of his game Hes a great shooter but the strength of his game is attacking the basket getting to the foul line Sort of reminds me of a uh the kid that played for Duke RJ RJ Barrett RJ Conwell steps into the three and hits it And just like that the Cards are up 346 as they apply some pressure now and trap in the corner McMillian pulls up with a three and dives it on the back of the rim Hes two for two on these last few possessions and all you need to do is see it go through the rim Hes had 12 points Pace of the game is picking up here a little bit OH GOODNESS ALI KHALIFA WITH A BEAUTIFUL DISH AND Prior rises up and it down with the wizardry and the block on the defensive end Gloville with the momentum cheering Rogers almost kept that one alive Jackson State not slowing it down McMillion to Mike Williams and he hits the triple Williams for three up 362 Conwell and McMillian each with 12 points so far Another nice pass from Khalifa to Prior Hes fouled and the big fell get a chance to go to the line as he gets into a triple But this crowd in full throw for Kase Prior He is back T game It was the second game of the year last year and the Balls came in here and punched the cards right in the mouth and it was kind of an eye opener It was but it was a good lesson learned for that team and they were able to take it forward for the next games when you play at Kentucky and you play other big SEC ACC opponents Take that learning experience and take it and prepare yourself to become a better team and get ready for March Prior misses the first free throw Hes two for two from the field in his first game since November of last year He comes up short on the second one as well but Zugris with the rebound misses and then Prior comes in there Almost got the tip but Zuggers got fouled and now hell go to the line Fouls on number four Devin Reed Thats his third 10th team foul Third foul already on former guard Devin Reed Zugris you shoot two Was one for two the other night from the line Im sorry Prior to Zugris coming into the game we saw Ali Khalifa made a series of great passes And it just goes to show you his IQ He was able to make eye contact with a couple of players where the defender couldnt see him but as long as you you and your teammate are on the same page you know youre considered open Its almost like in football the quarterback throwing the back shoulder throw to his receiver like Ellis Browns back in the day Best pass I played with you know the key for you you guys you all move so well you move with the ball but without the ball does that makes you know what I mean I mean it it it does and when you play with a guy like Ali whos a willing passer whos a great passer it makes you want to cut harder move faster and really try to get open cuz you know if you get open hes going to find you with the opportunity to score with a pull up three and he gets that to go he can score in bunches had a 37point game last here Willie gets to the basket and draws yet another foul Hell go to the line for two Fouls for 24 his second Its a second foul on Ruffing Really got three fouls Adrien W doing a good job of attacking the paint putting pressure on Jackson State forcing these guys to commit fouls Woolly one for the one from the line so far tonight and the Kennesaw State transfer knocks in the first free throw By the end of the year I feel hes going to be a a key piece for this team because a lot of potential in Michigan He is Hes going to be a key piece Hes the motor to that second unit Hes coming in providing a spark scoring spark and just lift these guys up when they need a you know just when they need a momentum boost coming off and uh the starting five sometime may not be playing well Hes going to provide that spark for the team up by 15 Ruffin guarded by Woolly Mike Williams and Ruffin He was extremely difficult to stay in front of and got a quick first step and able to get in that paint Second foul on Woolly with 617 left here in the first half but just the fourth team foul on the Cards Theyre already in the double bonus but itll just be a baseline out of bounds here for the Tigers trailing 4025 Theyre shooting 40 for the field UL shooting 52 Cards 4 for 12 from three The Tigers 4 for 11 from three so far And they got a couple double figure scorers Conwell and McMillion each with 12 so far Ruffin gets that one to go over Woolly Ruffins getting in his bag and scored a backto back possessions there and starting to feel good You see him with a smile on his face You scored over 2300 points in high school Larry you thats doing something I think you got the confidence I had just under I just had under 2000 I played with some good players I played with a guy named Chris Schumate who was really good player Kobe Rogers with a corner three And then the deflection from Ward Shoe Pretty good coach too He is He is number 12 Williams in for Jackson State Theres the paint touch for Roots and then the pass through a corner three for Kobe Rogers and he gets that to go Again we talked about earlier these guys playing for your teammate As you see Kennai weaving the baseline there finding Kobe Rogers in the corner for the knock down three with a 204 advantage in bench points Nice South Carolina State but it was a while before their starters ever scored It was such a strange game but this Jackson State team theyve got some scores This is a team that will compete for the swack title Theyre going to be right there They are They you see Ruffin you see McMillan the two guys that lead the charge for those uh for these team And you know those two guys get hot They can carry they can carry a team to a victory But Kent as you get into January February March you know your second unit becomes more and more important because guys start to wear down and when you take your starters out you dont want to have any sort of drop off and thats where separation comes between good teams and great teams So in some way these guys are more important than your starter starting lineup Roots was doubled on the baseline Tried to onehanded pass out of that Didnt quite work takes it away from Willie Something tells me this is going out No she had McMillan wide open in the corner He missed him roots the long pass to Louis and a turnover Of the 10 cards whove played Larry nine of them have scored You know who the one who hasnt so far Male Brown Yeah Brown the freshman still scoreless 0 for four from the field 0 for three from three but not not in any way forcing anything when hes out there Louisville with three turnovers in their last three possessions Right now its Conwell McNeely Fu Brown and Kase Prior back on the court for the first time since November of last year Prior with four points in six minutes so far Well hes letting it come to him Hes missed a couple of couple of threes but just got to work it and get himself a easy one Get to the foul line especially being in the bonus Great opportunity to attack the paint He does a great job of using his athleticism getting in there So it be good to see him use his athleticism get to the paint get himself to the foul music line and get himself athletic finish at the rim That foul was on at McNeely but just the fifth team foul on the card So another baseline out of bounds for the Tigers 20 seconds on the shot clock A little over four minutes to play here in the first half Louisville leads it 4327 Step back jumper A big fell can shoot Deon Deon Kv cant get that one to go Brown the nice dish to Fru with the catch underneath but blocked by Tatum from behind and McMillions going to push it up and Im not sure what that shot was Fus got to go stronger to the basket Biggest man on the court Hes got to be able to finish Cards are going to need him to finish around the basket Cards lead it 4327 and Ryan Conwell headed back to the line to extend it 340 left in the first half Some threes here in the KFC Young Center Mcmillion Robin Williams Three different Tigers have had triples Theyre 4 for 12 from three They trail Louisville 43 to 27 McMillion has hit a pair and has a team high 12 points There you see Ruffin the preseason swap player of the year And if you talk to Coach Williams one thing he really encourages his guys to do is play basketball If youre open shoot the ball If you got confidence in your game and your ability let it fly You can see these guys theyre shooting four out of 12 from three But if theyre open theyre taking the shot Much improved efforts for them from the other night where they fell behind 243 I mentioned Illinois hit eight threes in the first 10 minutes of that game but they also outrebounded Jackson State in the early going there 151 And right now the Cards with an 1813 rebounding advantage So probably doesnt hurt that Illinois has about 15 sevenfooters right Every player on their roster So all they have every six they get 69 small forward and they all shoot threes Conwell one for two there from the line The lead is 45 Hes 14 points now A game high Mitchell out front drives on Prior got by him and got the lefthanded shot to go up off the glass Its a good move there by Jamie Mitchell attacking Case and Prior off the bounce Brown with a great back from McNeely whos almost automatic there especially when hes that wide open Was a great play by Brown coming off the pick and roll and a great find hit McNeely on the lift out of the corner for the wide open three McNs taking two shots Williams gets inside Male cant get it to go The rebound for Brown Cards with an advantage here as they push it up and theyll get another triple drive for Maley And that one comes up short Prior with the rebound and the follow Doing a great job just being active Got a little rest on the bench And now hes energized Hes aggressive from the getgo on his return He is And and thats what the University of Louisville basketball team needs Well the number zero Michael Brown Thats his first six You see Ryan McNeely taking the shot there Kase music and following it up finishing through contact Give him credit for running to the rim there when you know you would normally think thats almost automatic laughter Really you know what else Prior does though Larry Im not sure theres another player on the roster He he gets the crowd involved I mean it he does Hes the emotional leader of this team and brings a sense of energy I think you know we talk about Javon Hadley Javon being the leader of the team he brings a sense of confidence but hes kind of the glue Prior Yeah Prior brings the emotional energy to the team Mike Williams with another triple The coachs son with his second three of the night and theyre back within 18 That kid is a player If youre just joining us Brown with a turnover in the corner Here comes Mitchell for the Tigers scramble and are they going to call a jump ball or they just going to let him wrestle I guess not Ruffin Ruffin comes up with it 16 on the shot clock for Jackson State Down by 18 points with just over a minute and a half left to play here in the first half and hes a little tough to stay in front of Switching there on the pick and roll liked his matchup Cant go Williams is active though got that deflection out there and might have twisted his ankle a little bit We see if Brown can hit his first shot with a pull up three finally Yeah it was a good shot in transition Good rhythm shot He was wide open Nobody stopped the ball He was able to knock it down Looked at himself like finally able to knock it down Answer from Mitchell from the corner and well get a quick time out Now every card who has played it is with enthusiasm You know you just got to love a guy that just boosts energy not only into the fan base but into the coaching staff the players everybody that he comes in contact with man Just you know they walk away saying the same thing like great guy great energy about him Saw him at a speaking engagement for Simmons College We talked about holding Dewan Wheat to 37 when he was a when coach Kelsey was a freshman at Wyoming and the Cards went out there and beat the Cowboys of Joby Wright Im sure hes not alone on that list Dwan was a little quick too It was as Jackson State comes out in an aggressive two3 rotating the ball cheering Drive on the baseline just as the shot clocks expiring Brown gets it off Worley with the offensive rebound and McNeely will get a three again And now he goes halfway down and rims out And Potter says off the deflection its going to be Jackson State ball Conwell Brown Woolly McNeely and Khalifa on the court right now for UVL Roots was trying to check in but hes not going to They Jackson State can hold it here for the final shot if they so choose Down by 18 And much improved performance from them from their opener here in the first half Ruffin guarded aggressively by Conwell And thats going to be the 17th team foul So Ruffins going to get a chance to shoot some free throws At least one with 147 seconds left here in the first half The first personal foul on Conwell at the line Hell shoot the one And again just the seventh on the team Dean Ruffin the preseason swack player of the year has a chance to get himself into double figures here if we can with this front end Really getting into the paint at will Nobody from Louisvilles team really able to keep him in front of him Thats one thing that this where youre going to miss Chucky He cuz he was as good of a defender cheering on the ball as weve had here as world has had here in Atlanta arguably the best defensive guard in the country last year Miss on the front of the one Pat Kelsey with a quick timeout at 113 seconds left Hell get it Its up to the doctors to determine that He looked okay though when we saw him on the bench He and he is in the arena which is encouraging All right one final shot here for Louisville Out of that timeout they get it into Khalifa in the post and the big fella with the pass the ROOF FOR THE JAM Going up high young fella You saw Louisa trying to run ament to be in Whether you were playing here in Louisville whether you were playing in Lexington it was just a great game to be a part of and have that experience Right out of the halftime break Mike El Brown with another assist and free goes high for the slam In true pack in true Patelson fashion opening up the half with a back screen to get his big man involved in the game Easy dunk for San Die Deon Reed the former card for Jackson State had three fouls in that first half as Mitchell gets the drive to go That was impressive Sand is like the Wy Brown of this you know Wy Brown the 1980 championship team Now hes got WY the first shot of the game They get Sand the first shot of each half Usually a dunk And and thats what you want to get him Get him energized Get him engaged And now he becomes a defensive presence Now he gets every rebound He gets involved Hes running Take us through this Larry because he gets the screen there from McNeely As you see Isaac McNeilly set that back screen Isaac McNs man cant help because hes such a shooter but even if he did hes being guarded by Desan Ruffin And I think a live contest I think is going to win over Desan Ruffin every time Well you were a bit of a shooter if Im not mistaken 163 threes in your career here at Well you can check that Is that right You probably sounds a little short but 48 49th all time leading scoreer Uh Mike El Brown though to go to the line here hes just one for six from the field one for five from three But when you go to the line and you see a couple shots go in that can really do something for your confidence for the rest of the night can it It does As a person who loves to shoot the ball anytime you see the ball go through the basket its almost like striking a match right Im always on fire I just got to strike that match to catch fire Thats thats and thats the mentality you have to play with when you have the confidence and ability to shoot like he does Its just a matter of catching the fire Thats all Im always on it I just got to catch it Kada might have walked but its not called McMillian goes baseline Got away with a little push off there Then another rebound for Roots and then How about that A quick basket for Michael Brown after his two free throws on the drive And that happens because hes been pushing the pace all game finding teammates and now no one wants to help And the lane opens up for him Kyroo got his first college start tonight He has six points and eight rebounds coming off his careerhigh 20point effort in the opener He started because Javon Hadley is not playing tonight in concussion protocol after taking the hit the other night in the win over South Carolina State had started all 36 of his games at UVAL as Brown turns it over and as hell learn playing the point guard those turnovers are the turnovers you got to stay away from The unforced turnovers You shoot the ball extremely too well as a team to not have a possession where you dont get a shot up roots you know a guy a lot of people thought you know he he didnt play a ton last year but so much potential and you know in this day and age and that you never know if a kids going to hang around He said you know what the grass isnt always greener He stayed around He not but he also went to work Went to work in the weight room and obviously went to work with his game as well because hes having a great start to the season as Ruffin gets to the basket Hes fouled by Conwell Thats a second foul on Conwell but Cards first team foul of the half with 1750 left here as we see a little scramble on the floor Ruffin not only gets the ball but gets right back up and then goes to the basket and rough it in the line Hes fearless going into that paint He has not Hell get another shot He had the front end of the one at the end of the half that could have got him to double figures Hell get another shot at the line and he gets this one to go So now one for two from the line and 10 points for Dean Ruffin the preseason swack player of the year A McDonalds All they got a couple McDonalds AllAmericans on that bench their coach and Ruffin return the leading scoreer in the slack conference So you know hes able to put up numbers in a hurry and back to your point seeing it go through the rim a couple of times you know gets you confidence gets you rhythm Wow Sander Fu finishes above the rim Fu with the screen and Brown with a beautiful pocket pass Great read great pick and roll action That was the sixth assist tonight so far for Mikel Brown Jr 10 seconds on the shot clock Corner three off the back of the rim by Koliv And here comes Conwell pushing it up Oh the big fell I think it was right under the basket when he got that Larry It was But Sandanda look how engaged Sonu is All because he got the dunk to start the half the back door which is what Pat Kelsey wanted Now hes engaged defensively getting offensive rebounds getting guys easy shots to see Muel Brown come off the pick and roll and Sand Fru send it at home That was the fourth personal foul on Deon Kv And then after he foul Mike Brown I dont think it was intentional but he almost threw the ball at him and Cards uh took offense to that a little bit We almost had a little skirmish under the basket but Culmer heads prevailed as Brown knocks in another free throw And just like that hes up to eight points six assists four rebounds Doing a good job of attacking the pain getting in there using athleticism drawing fouls finishing above the rim Its almost a cat and mouse game You put pressure you touch the paint If they stop you you kick it out for a wide open three If they dont stop you you go in for athletic finish This team a good threepoint shooting team They shoot a lot of threes but coach Kelsey makes a point He said Were not We want the best shot We dont count the number of threes we shoot Get a foul on Roots over there on the sideline Foul number nine Kai Roots Thats his first second team Jackson first personal on Roots The second team foul on the cards here early in the second half They lead it 6539 All that Pat Kelsey did last year as can I roots check some prior backs game of all that they did last year Larry 27 wins 18 ACC wins theyre already going to they may well do something here tonight that they didnt do last year start 2 and 0 Russ with it out front there from through but step back three over Brown thats not the easiest shot cuz Mikes got some length to him He does He did an awesome job of challenging the shot there Roughing Made him arching a little higher than he wanted to But you really see Mel engage now after getting a few easy buckets Jamie Mitchell with a big time block Now cheering with another offensive rebound Great pass again and the foul there on Kobe Butler So similar Uh both able to shoot the three but also able to get in the lane take some contact and and and score as well in the paint as Fu misses the first free throw Uh hes having a heck of a game as well Hes got eight points Hes got four rebounds Louisville with an 80 advantage on the board so far here in the second half as F misses the second free throw 315 now that advantage on the boards Woolly Rogers through Prior Yes Prior and McNeely in the game for the Cards Kase playing for the first time since last November The steal by Woolly Send it in young fella Send it in And that all started with Kobe Rogers doing a great job of oneonone defense with Desawn Ruffin The Cars come up with another steel Showtime THIS TIME ITS F WHO throws it down and then Prior immediately turns to the crowd and get them going 6939 the lead up to 30 An 8 run for Louisville cheering Well thats it As you see here everything start with great oneonone defense And you see Adrien Woolen exploding on the ramp And then how about the big fella running the floor active all because of a back door dunk to start the half and hes just controlled the paint this half Adrien Willie with nine points and four rebounds Al Khalifa with the rebound to McNeely A little stutter step He gets to the basket and scores and hell have a chance for an oldfashioned threepoint play McNeely with a great job with the hesitation You have to respect him in transition You have to respect that threepoint line Its able to put Mike Williams on his hip put him in the basket with a chance for the and one from Pa West Virginia a polka dot in high school by the way Did you know that Larry I did The polka dots But he says You know what Im not just a shooter As he misses the free throw Could have converted to a threepoint play but hes athletic as well Got to the basket and scored He has eight points here Just under 15 minutes to play The lead is 7139 The turnover by Mike Williams Cards again on a 100 run Theyve hit their last three shots and Jackson State has three turnovers in the last three minutes and has missed their last five Kobe Rogers with it out front Rogers Khalifa McNeely Prior and Woolly on the court for Louisville And thats what made Grayson Prior so valuable last year He always provided a spark He seemed to come up with the steal at the right time He did everything to help make easier shots for his teammates on the defensive end Jackson State in the two3 zone There you see Kase Prior who is obvious a fan favorite Theyve been going crazy with just about everything he does Kobe Rogers though nice driving into the gap of that zone and the dish to Khifa who is going to go to the line Yes Kobe Rogers is what you call a twoway player now Hes probably the best defensive perimeter guy that Louisville has on the team but also has elite athleticism on the offensive end of being able to not only get in the paint but finish above the rim as well Louisville have been shooting really well from the line Couple of misses here Hits one of two 7239 Louisville now 19 of 26 from the line Ruffen with a great dish down low Prior with the block He wants he wants a jump ball I dont believe Pat Kelsey will use his challenge here That by the way is one of one laughter of the new one of the new rules in in college basketball The coaches do have a challenge See Ruck with the match up getting into the paint dropping it off to Jaylen Tatum whos gets fouled going to the line for two See cheering you might have hit him on the hand Is that what you saw Thats what I saw too Jaylen Tatum a 64 junior from Pineel Bluff Arkansas with the brightest shoes in the building This is the second free throw And Prior with another rebound And here come the Cards Mike Williams knocked it away from Kobe Rodney The Cards ball out front 25 seconds on the shot clock Just over 14 minutes to play Louisville by 32 on their way here to a 2 and 0 record as they get ready for the latest version of the dream game here on Tuesday night Jackson State dropping into a half court two3 zone Wow Rogers to the corner A nice screen in the paint from Prior and Khalifa the wide open layup Wolver running a similar set that they ran in the first half with a side screen to a back screen underneath the basket Finding the big Ali Khalifa wide open for a layup to the basket with a block on Williams but he hit him on the arm according to Tony Chiaza That was a good call Walk us through this Larry You see the side screen attacking Case Prior setting a screen on the middleman forcing the back guy to make a decision Obviously he stayed outside because Isaac McNeely is a great shooter which left Ali Khalifa wide open underneath the basket Number three Codwell back in for the guards replacing And so the design of that play is to make the backside forward choose a position Either take the guy into the basket or leave Isaac McNeely wide open in the corner for three And theyre never going to leave McNeely wide open laughter Maybe they picked the right option because that only counts for two right Conwell back in for the Cards Oh back cut there by Rogers and Khalifa tried to hit him but it was actually a good thought Kobe Rogers wasnt looking for the ball He had a wide open layup which is maybe rule number one when Ali Khalifa was on the floor with you Definitely rule number one Thats why you see Kobe Rogers pat his chest and saying My bad I should have been looking cheering Butler cant get that to go in the lane Heres Rogers Prior will try to dial up a three off the back of the rim Kobe with the offensive rebound Back to Prior He says You know what Ill drive in Cant get it to go This is good for him though probably just to work through as he gets the deflection on the ball just to work through because we you talked about it earlier but the physical thing is one thing but also mentally to get back out there and and make those cuts full speed in a game Yes hes been working out by himself Hes been integrated into practice here and there but its nothing like getting hurt playing in front of 15 16000 people full speed You cant simulate that So its good conditioning for him Push through knock some of the rust off get him ready for the big game on Tuesday So far hes played 11 minutes six points three rebounds Mikel Brown Jr Ryan Conwell Zubrit Roots and McNeely on the court for the Cards McNeely to Roots who may well throw this down if he doesnt get fouled And he is fouled Jaylen Tatum grabs him to prevent roots from bringing the house down again But can I root in his first college start here tonight Larry And six points eight rebounds a second straight Impressive game for the sophomore He is just being active and really coming into his own believing in his ability really being you know one of the better players and key factors that coach Kelsey is going to depend on this year for this team to make a big run as they under review for potential player one He didnt Did he go for the ball My initial thought was that it you know was just a hard foul Looked like he swiped for the ball I didnt see anything malicious about it Heres another look at tell You know he was a clear path and just kind of swiped Yeah it looked like he swiped for the ball Just a common two packing a slap on the arm little extra love tap but setting the expectation and the standard at an even higher level in year two We went to that timeout They were reviewing that foul on Jaylen Tatum and they just called it a common foul So roots to the line for two free throws gets the first and cannot get the second to go But Zubris with the offensive rebound He kept it alive Larry and then went and got it and then Conwell right to the basket for his 15th and 16th points on the night Just a score We talk about his shooting ability all the time But you see him right there being able to put it on the ground get to the basket and finish Again Brown and Conwell both preseason first team all ACC selections but it add another C ACC McNeely misses and then its ticked out of bounds by the Tigers So Deards ball baseline out of bounds And this is Pat Kelsey relishes these moments cuz hes got so many plays out of these situations to get either open threes or maybe even an open layup or dunk He does Lets see if we see an action here where it get miguel coming in off of a screen for a shot Brown come from out of bounds That was well defended by McMillion though He stayed with him Great close out Bar three from Roots 7741 Cards leaded 11 and 12 minutes left to play here Oh Williams calling out a play over there Mitchell gets the screen The hedge from Zubris Two on the shot clock and I dont think they know Oh just did he get it Barely got it off and then he had McMillian at the last second fires up the triple and hits what was his third three of the night He now has 15 points Tough shot Miller played great defense for 29 seconds McMillan with a better offensive move A paint touch there for Brown and he hits the cutting roots who now has nine points to go with his eight rebounds in his first college start Adrien Wy set to check in for Louis with the next bed ball as they lead by 35 McMillian will pull again and he is feeling it He check a little banter going back and forth with MueL cheering Brown Brown hits the basket in a lefthanded He might have woke MueL up there Hes fully engaged Yeah Brown now with 11 points seven assists and four rebounds Zubris almost with HIS STEAL HE DIVES OUT OF BOUNDS to save it Tough finish Mitchell went up and I thought there was a huge collision down there Clear foul It should have been a foul It looked like Roots was going to block the shot and then he there was definitely a collision down there but no foul called Just a made basket But Mitchell obviously hit in the face a little bit and shaking up Lets take a look at this replay applause Ooh he took an elbow to the nose after the and you see those stats going across there And that that goes back to the last game when you know you have balance going five guys in double figures in the previous game But that goes to just showing you guys buying in buying into the culture side step You couldnt do that back in your day That that would have been called a walk Yeah That seems like laughter the game now today it seems like all the travel from the NBA has sort of trickled down to the to the amateur game and the referees have just kind of was that amateur with quotes Yeah right laughter Mitchell with the corner three So hes not too injured He seems fine No hes not 8152 now Hes a 38 threepoint shooter last year so hes more than capable of knocking down the threepoint shot 17 yards in the bonus Already in the bonus here with 916 left to play here and hell be shooting some free throws here for the final nine minutes of this one Itll be Mikel Brown stepping in the line Hes four for four from the line so far 11 points seven assists and four rebounds for the freshman Jackson State started 0 for six from three Theyve hit nine of their last 13 Brown knocks that one in One of the great things about MueL Brown is that he plays with great pace stop and start Hes able but not out of control like in control the whole Hes able to go from slow to fast and it gives him time to be able to read the game and make good passes on what the defense is doing taking a shot or finding an open teammate And thats something that sometimes takes young guys you know a little bit of experience and a little bit of time to learn how to do but hes seems to already have that into his game Listen so long as Kobe Rogers gets the steal do you I mean when you think of the talented freshman that have been here now no offense Larry cuz you improve quite a bit during your career here but I mean you think of the Pervis Ellisons the Le Bradford Smiths um Dwan Wheats Dwan Wheat but from what weve seen from this kid so far hes right up there He is man When you talk about wasnt bad as a freshman Not bad at all Not Not bad Wes ready for Wes couldnt play as a freshman Oh okay Okay But but Griff averaged I think 12 and a half as a freshman so he he was a pretty fair player But just his overall ability and knowledge and IQ and just knowing how to play the game He already has the athleticism But you know when you talk about guys that have put on this uniform and being freshman then hes right up there in the conversation as far as just being good just as any of them cheering I I was talking to Mo Williams before the game He said I said Yeah hes like a fivemon renter Was that you being next year I hope hes just renting here cuz uh hes not going to be here for long But you can you can definitely see it And we saw it this summer I think it was eye opening to watch him play for the uh US9 team in that Feeble World Cup because with the guys you know the AJ De Jansa who was the MVP of that tournament but really it should have been Mike Brown I think a lot of people thought he played the best and helped lead those guys to the gold medal And I think thats what has helped propel the the hype the the expectations of him coming in to help lead this program to you know a big time run at the end of the year Hell shoot the one Kobe Rogers to the line now for one and one Kobe with three points Knocks in the first free throw Transfer from the College of Charleston scored 16 against Mo Williams alma moater Alabama in the NCAA tournament for the College of Charleston before suffering his own knee injury and uh he red shirted last year here and will be a very valuable contributor for this team as he knocks in both free throws guys like Kobe and obviously Jamon Hadley had hasnt been with Kelsey as long just the one year but those kind of guys you get the sense that coach Kelsey just trusts them He knows that theyre going to do the right thing going to make the right play Yes Because these are what you call your your your great glue role guys that not necessarily looking for shots not necessarily looking for stats but these guys want to play winning basketball What are the little things What are the impactful things that I could do to help this team win You have your Ryan Conwells You have your Isaac McNeely Those are guys that youre going to depend on to put points on the board But whos going to be the guys thats going to take charges Whos going to be diving on the floor Whos going to take the assignment of guarding the teams opposing best player Thats whats going to set these guys apart and help lift the team as a whole Another dunk for Fu Hes got 12 points and five rebounds the good catch and finish in the paint for the big fella whos hit six of his eight shots so far here tonight They theyve done a pretty good job on Roughing dont you think Larry Cuz this they have Hes a jitter bug Hes tough to stay in front of Hes got 11 points but hes only four for 13 from the field Cut from Mitchell in the throw down cheering That kind of woke him up when he took out hit the took the hit to the face He hit the triple from the corner and then the big twohanded slam It woke him up cheering Kobe with a nice pass to a cutting roots but he cant finish Mitchell is completely engaged now as he gets fouled in the lane Foul number 14 Thats his score Cards up 8754 as we see Sandanda Defu controlling the paint throwing it down Jamie Mitchell finishing high Cards up 8754 One of the best in the league man So so hats off to him man for his career and what hes doing now with Jackson State That was one of his seven sons whos on his roster this year There you see him Mike Williams one of his seven sons They range in age from 26 to three cheering Mikes dad Mo the 47th pick in the 2003 NBA draft by Utah Came out early from Alabama Played for Mark Gotfried at Alabama and then coach Gotfried is thats how he got involved in coaching Went back on started with him at Cal State Northridge Hes been the head coach at Alabama State for a couple years and now in his fourth season at Jackson State Jackson Mississippi By the way have we mentioned the home of the great Larry Do you know Lancaster Gordon Jim Hill High School in Jackson Mississippi Oh Kobe baseline Thought about puts it up in those hard layups Mississippi was good at the Louisville program in the 80s though Not just Lancaster from Jackson but also the Jones brothers Charles and Kent from Scuba Mississippi on those final four teams as well Seven sons Thats a lot of rebounding you got to do Thats a from 26 to three And I I did I asked him I said Coach I said You still trying for a daughter Your wife He goes Oh yeah laughter Its incredible man Brown and Khalifa check back in for the guards replacing Woolly and Crew Mike with seven points so far here tonight Hit a couple of threepointers Seven points three rebounds for the freshman Heres the Swack preseason player of the year Dean Ruffin Misses the free throw He has 11 points here so far tonight 18 now for McMillion and 18 for Mitchell as well to lead the Tigers Much improved effort from them I think from their opener wouldnt you say Much improved Much improved When these guys played against Illinois they just kind of looked lost and looked like deers in the headlights on the big stage But today even though its a 30point game the guys look comfortable playing with confidence Just overmatched and overwhelmed today playing against a better University of Louisville basketball team Larry just something you cant coach there with Khalifa just with a nice little tip Two roots right under the basket for for the hoop Now Kana with nine points and eight rebounds 11 points and eight rebounds in his first college start and double figures in the first two games for Louisville as Brown gets the deflection number 21 and number 12 But just kind of a subtle play Larry but watch it Yeah as you see this Ali cant control the rebound but one thing he can do is control the tap to his teammate as you see him there Just another high IQ play and one of the examples of the things coach Kelsey talks about when he raves so much about the smarts of Ali Khalifa As you see Jamie Mitchell getting up for another jam now 20 points for Mitchell as he has caught fire after he got hit in the face by Roots and Roots answers with a quarter triple of his own and he now has 14 points But another great pass from Muel Brown Pushing the pace head up finding open teammates up the court for wide open shots That was his eighth assist Larry 13 points eight assists Roughing everything but the finish Conwell with the rebound Rogers rely to Brown I thought for a second he was going to throw it down but he settled it and got it up and off the glass Yeah he secured it and put it in Still counts the same Two points Mitchell out to Ruffing for the three Cant get it to go Rogers the rebound And the Cards are not letting up Still pushing it Kobe kind of lost control with the high dribble and then had to shoot that Were going to get a jump ball Itll be Jackson State ball Number 10 How about this pass Larry Great pass Kobe Rogers keeping his head up to the athletic male Brown with the athletic finish above the rim Just the old lob to the point guard on the fast break Different breed of point guards these days 65 athletic guys out there getting above the rims 12 points and four assists in the second half for the freshman and just one turnover Hes got all six of his free throws in the second 20 minutes 15 points so far tonight as Ruffin gets one to go on the baseline He now has 13 points for the Tigers Conwell with the Cards ninth triple Now both teams have hit nine threes here tonight Its good defense Jamie Mitchell And if youre Louisville when Muel gets the Brown I mean you got to love hitting the wings wanting to run Hes great at advancing the ball pushing the ball finding if youre open What a run for layups Run for wide open threes when Mels got the cheering ball The rebound cards one point from the century mark for the second straight game Ruffin settles it Hits the triple and well get a quick timeout for Mo Williams 9963 cards cheering cheering two free throws go through the net hit nothing but net and then since then he hes uh hes had it rolling 15 points nine assists and four rebounds for the freshman And we mentioned that U19 FIFA World Cup team one of his teammates on that team Jasper Johnson the freshman at Kentucky The theyll face off on Tuesday night We had a beat UK champ coming from the student section during that last timeout Zukris the offensive rebound kicks it out to Brown who knows were talking about it and adds to that point total And thats his specialty The best time to shoot a threepointer is off his offensive rebound Zoo doing a good job of securing the rebound kicking it out finding Muel with a wide open three Four points and four rebounds for Zugris Were headed to one more timeout 245 to play Cards are over the century mark for the second straight game Mike Kell Brown puts him there with a triple from the top of the key Second game last year This a little different result there Yeah Looking for one I did about that Yeah I did I did You all won there didnt you We did We did We did Little lane violation So Kobe Butler will get another chance after missing those two free throws Lets talk about that Kentucky game coming up on Tuesday night What do you both teams have obviously had some injury issues Kasem Prior who just came back for Louisville and then you have Jam Hadley who didnt play tonight because of the concussion They have Jaylen Moler their point guard expected to play tomorrow night as they host Valo Trent Noah out uh with an ankle injury Um Jay Acquaintus obviously hasnt played for them yet but uh two of the top teams in the country and its just strange to see that game so early in the year It is Its always been a Christmas staple and I think you have two teams that are fairly built similar right Great guards athletic bigs Its going to be a very very physical game obviously in a rivalry Its going to be a lot of tension a lot of energy Um what are your memories from playing in the rivalry Uh I remember beating Kentucky in Ref Arena I remember losing at home in Thats Patrick Spark in Sparks Gate in Sparks Gate So youre not over it yet No Im not So I finished up two and two What were you up 326 if memory serves me correct I think you all were up 3216 Yeah we were up 16 last time We were up 16 They went small ball and was putting Rondo and Chuck Hayes in a pick and roll man And they just got hot man And we were missing and we had opportunities to win it but you know we put ourselves in a bad position to foul and obviously Pat Sparks Were still working through it You want to lay down You laughter traumatized me here You traumatized me man R with the baseline drives He had 18 points 10266 is our score And now were going to get some of the walkons in Cole Sherman the other night came in and actually put the cards over the century mark with the triple The St A grad Zubris Rogers Tase Prior back on the court Kai Ruth still out there 14 points nine rebounds Its the first time Louisvilles had two straight games with 100 since 2010 Well have to really go back to find out they open a season with two straight 100point games if its ever happened Its a question for Kelly Dicki the true stat man for Louisville In the paint with the lefthanded jump hook gets it to go and how about his improved play Larry early in the season A good strong finish able to go up finish through the contact As you watch here nice crosscript pass from Kobe Rogers taking a foul finishing with the left hand giving himself an opportunity to go to the line and complete the threepoint play Roots with one three tonight but hes five of nine from the floor 16 points nine rebounds Come off a 207 rebound effort in the opener And here comes Will Hanky another Saint X grad and a walkon Mom and dad in the front row down here in the Hollywood seats and theyre going crazy now as their son checks in the game with 109 left to play But you talk about Canai you talk about Kasem Prior you talk about Kobe Rogers Three key guys coming off the bench for the Cards who are just as good to be able to start any place else cheering Hanky Dean up Mitchell See if they can get one of the walkons a shot here This might be the last possession we see Louisville take a shot as special leg is set to check in at the next dead ball Sherman to Zer cheering just everybodys working to set screens to get one up Ball deflected 9 seconds on the shot clock Spencer Le a 67 senior from Washington DC checks in And listen to this as Kase Prior heads to the bench cheering Much anticipated debut for Case and a welldeserved standing ovation Five on the shot clock and Spencer Le is going to get chance to shoot some free throws Well zone number nine Gore Thats his fifth personal team Always happy to see you know the walkons get in and get a chance to get their name in the score book These guys work so hard They work just as hard as the rest of the team And you know they know their role is to prepare these other guys to play But you know to see them get out here and have an opportunity to play in front of the crowd And as Spencer leg puts it in see these guys you know get their name in the scorebook is something that theyll be able to you know talk about from years on out and have so many memories when they get back together and talk about these moments that they had on the court What does that do for team morale I mean you were one of the guys youd be on the bench right now cheering on Who would have been Who would have who would who were the walkons back in your day who came in Chris Curr Brad Brad Gianini Oh Brad Gianini Yeah but Brad Gianini didnt carry himself like a walk on cheering Cole Sherman on the kick out What Now that you know what Wonder if Pat Kelsey use his laughter challenger with 182 left cuz it kind of looked like Ruffin kicked it out Lets take a look at it What do you think Larry Sean Ruff Yeah it was definitely a kick out Not sure its the right place to use the challenge but laughter but he might have won it had he used it Had had the score been a little different he might have put it out of pocket here But I think Coach Kelsey is just trying to get everybody to the locker room safe and healthy to get ready for Tuesdays matchup Ruffin with 22 points Hell finish as the leading scorer for Jackson State The Cards led by Conwell with 19 Brown Jr with 18 points cheering nine assists and five rebounds in the beat UK champ In full force here the Cards are 2 and 0 for the first time since the 202021 season A 10670 win over Jackson State And
