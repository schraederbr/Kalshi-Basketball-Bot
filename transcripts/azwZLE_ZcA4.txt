Coliseum The in their old gold the Sooners in their Crimson And we are underway Oklahoma with the screaming basketball First Xavier Brown the Philadelphia native at the point for OU screaming Here is Nigel P in his sixth year in college And as Terrence mentioned he seems to be an allconerence guy wherever he goes 1800 career points and counting Great ball fake by Darion Reed Out of bounds Itll stay at this end Darion Reed this is a big time athlete Transferred from Alabama Wanted a little bit more opportunity to be on the floor uh last year Got hurt a little bit Struggled getting back in the Crimson Tide rotation This is a guy though that was a McDonalds AllAmerican coming out of high school And cheering you see it in the frame You see it in the frame what hes able to do as far as a wingspan all those things But now with the Oklahoma Sooners making a bigger impact that foul was on Juke Harris for Reed His last couple of games for the Sooners his two highest point totals of his career 16 points against Alorn State and then 15 in the win over Marquette on Friday These two teams both have the same starting five again tonight for their eighth and ninth games respectively Wake is six and two has won three in a row with that starting screaming five Youll notice Nate Calmese at the point wearing a face mask He broke his nose against Texas Tech playing through it despite the surgery Shot missed by Mai Mason Fight for the basketball Sooners have it and give it away Good hustle to start this game You could tell the importance of a contest playing at an ACC venue Oklahoma getting ready to go But you talked about Nate Cal Thats the guy Hes the engine that makes this Wake Forest team go Averaging big assist numbers Fast is what Steve Forbes likes to describe him as Thats pretty much the only word he used Hes just a big fan of this young man and his ability to score when needed sure but get his teammates involved He scored 15 points a game at Washington State a year ago Starting back court for the Beats Both from Gilbert Arizona Driving dish Great ball movement inside Spillers missed from in close Now the rebound tracked down by Mohamd Wag Heres Brown He had a steam into the lane Ball knocked loose Here come the Demon Deakons Tomise screaming leaves it for Juke Harris screaming Youll see a lot of this straight on Spillers out on the perimeter cheering as the hub of this Wake Forest offense A lot of DHOss dribble handoffs switching sides of the floor Turned into a really nice player after transferring from State a couple of seasons ago Nearly 2 minutes in still looking for our first field goal for a couple of teams averaging 87 points per game Tom little long on that corner three Theres that size of Reed pulling down that rebound Mads cheering are now 0 for four from the floor screaming For two guys that just hyped up the offense of this game were sputtering out to this start And Oklahomas been screaming so good this year and not turning the basketball over among the screaming top 10 in the country in that category Down to the ground WGE able to get it to his teammate who was fouled screaming McGees hustle on both sides of the floor has really paid dividends so far Now I will say Wake Forests collective size is pretty good But at the five spot Spillers about 67 maybe 68 They got to put a body on somebody and they have to gang rebound Oklahoma screaming with Davis big time cheering athletes at that 345 to throw in Darien Reed there too Uh you got to take care of business You got to finish possessions then you can take off a run and play fast which is where the Demon Deacons flourish That foul on Trey Spillers sends Tay Davis to the line Twotime transfer freshman year at Satan Hall and then the last couple of years for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish And he took a big jump in his game from sophomore year to junior year last season Really good for the Fighting Irish Yeah Michael Shbury raved about his talent when he had him there last season This is a guy some inside out to his game but really good putting it on the deck and getting past the first line of defense Omaha Beloo got it Kevin Deakons are on the board Omaha Belaloo We talk about McDonalds AllAmericans He was one too but this is the first this past summer was the first summer hes been healthy to be able to work out with a team dealt with a lot of injuries over the course of his career but you see the natural talent the size he could really defend He was a fivestar McDonalds allAmerican who was the number 11 cheering player in his recruiting class highest rated recruit in the history of Iowa State basketball Didnt work out with the Cyclones and last year because of the foot injury never got going But this year he looks like he could live up to some of that billing High rays replace action Omaha Valoo if hes able to knock down a shot he opens up a whole another facet to this Wake Forest offense is what he can do spacing the floor theyre going to need that today with an Oklahoma team long rangy athletic only now six out of 20 from beyond the threepoint line through the first eight plus games of the season for Wake and our first substitutions Kai Rogers checks in for Oklahoma a 610 freshman from Wawaossa Wisconsin And then we will see Miles Cvin the nations leader in points per game off the bench 12 a half per game cheering Finally getting a roll to where hes asked to score and be more assertive The guy played at Purdue last season Ill be honest with you Doug didnt touch the ball all that much When you played with Braden Smith youre going to have to wait your turn Here at Wake Forest hes come off the bench Hes found a role here for coach Steve Forbes He could be himself an athlete finding shots an offensive force Hes hit some big ones this season too No doubt about it Beat Memphis with a buzzer beater That foul by the way on Nigel Pack So he has one Nice little shuffle cut Youre going to have a stagger coming on the backside Calm me Good job Xavier Brown being physical off that cut Coven lost it off the bounce picked up by Brown Sooners with the basketball tied at three pack driving screaming dish Brown with a good look from the right side applause and a foul on the rebound as a demon Deacon hit the deck Thats just really good help to helper Contesting late by Juke Harris Omaha Belaloo coming over helping on the drive Balls kicked out Got to have your mans back especially on that second rotation Juke Harris Im telling you saw him last year His body has completely changed from one year to the next And we talked about it in the open Six points a game last season You could see where his frame has started to broaden out His chest has gotten bigger The confidence has really taken off Hes going to be in the conversation be able to play at the NBA level cuz he has all those intangions He was another big recruit for Steve Forbes and his staff And on Q he loses it out of bounds Im not going to hold that against him though But he has grown three inches from the time he committed as a high school junior to Steve Forbes Then worked on his body as a freshman and in the offseason and boom You know those numbers from freshman to sophomore year remind me of John Collins The same kind of jump he made here at Wake between his first and second year Yeah the numbers are identical Thats a great call by you but obviously a little bit different game Juke a little obviously much more of a guard type of player but John Collins hes made a great living for himself at the next level But this is where I think its improved the most The off thebounce game the ability to use screaming a ball screen really improved this time on Q There it is Juke Harris buries the shot His first three points of the night and the DeS take a onepoint lead cheering But again I I mean Nate call me keep an eye on him Not going to do the bulk of the scoring but unselfish When you have this many scores got to have somebody share the sugar Dalton Foresight is fouled by Omaha Belaloo And that takes us to our first media timeout as the Vegas I mean my goodness beat everybody by 40 points Wake right there in the mix with them I think this is a really nice Wake Forest team and as this season continues to evolve uh theyre going to start collecting some of these wins I think theyre going to get in the NCAA tournament I want to throw that out there I feel like Oklahomas in that conversation as well They should be Meanwhile for Oklahoma their lack of turnovers has been a big deal so far this year Friendly bounce from the corner for Darion Reed Somewhere Darion Reeds continues to improve over his last three games shooting just above 41 from three You look at the size the frame at 68 long wingspan Juke Harris playing off at two feet draws the foul and hell shoot a pair You know I always find it interesting guys that grow late Like Mikel Brown Jr at Louisville is another example of this He was small and then grows up into four 64 able to manage the game Juke Harris kind of in that same vein He was 63 64 grew four inches over the last couple of seasons or two three years and and this guy his game has really taken off Sometimes it takes these guys a little bit longer to grow into their frame but they keep those smaller guard skills right Exhibit A comes off a ball screen They able to snake around create an easy look for himself get the foul And as you know part of his growth this year is a greater opportunity cheering as well last years veteran laden team He was playing behind some guys who had earned their minutes and now Juke has stepped into that more veteran role this year But Doug I think one big point Nice shot Not one big point about that is you have to earn that opportunity too I mean he wasnt ready And a lot of times especially in todays age we feel like the freshman have to be ready on day one This guys developed into this big time game Here he is with the basketball one of only three players in the country averaging 197 rebounds and at least two made threes per game and has only happened twice this century in the ACC for an entire season applause Omaha Beloo with his second from downtown That ball comes off his hand nice doesnt it We said it Hes dealt with injuries but you look at the size the defensive ability he needs to shoot it No its not You cant do that over the back foul going to be called against Kai Rogers No check that Its on Belaloo Yeah So he turned around and pushed face boxed him out I think he stepped on Kai Rogers ankle right there You might be able to take another look at it So look at him at number zero at the bottom Doesnt bother to box out I dont know what happened man There was no twist at the angle I thought maybe his left foot slipped just a bit but hes got two fouls now and so Omaha will take a seat Wears the zero like an O on his uniform cheering Harris poked it away Oklahoma will keep it Look at the guy number seven Dayton Foresight led Dale High School in Oklahoma to three state championships Im going to be honest too You see him out here This guys got some shake off the bounce Nice player Can really shoot it They need him to be that backup point though He was a high school scorer Kind of in the same ilk as you were back in the day 2200 points at Dale High School How many Is it 2200 on the nose No Who was it Uh lets see You have it I think I do 2243 See I have 2257 My man uh my man my mans a little behind He needed 14 more I didnt realize Dayton Foresight was not keeping up with the great Terrence Oglesby Well he got me in the state championships Hows that How about that Nice set I love how aggressive Miles Cvin has been this year Here is Calvin Turns and goes over his left shoulder for two Its a 103 Wake Forest run Nice move Patient on the interior Shot fake Bucket First two points for the junior from Indianapolis And this is Weights largest lead of the night Davis to the left hand and he lays it in The senior from Indianapolis averaging 13 per game Thats his first bucket of the night I think this is what were going to see more and more A couple teams starting to make shots The pace is picking up Not just getting up and down the floor but passcourt pace so important to both of these offenses On a switch Cooper Swagger inside had a huge height advantage Couldnt get the ball Its an empty trip for Wake Forest Here comes Davis down the lane and he is fouled applause Culvin gets the personal Taye Davis at 69 210 lbs on the possession Nice job coming over WGE not giving up on the play How do you respond after you get beat on defense One of the character traits for Mo talked about today Got to hustle back Absolutely How do you respond when you turn the basketball over How do you respond when you get beat in the defensive end of the court You continue getting in the play Terrific example of WGE who talk about an athlete My man lives at the rim I love one thing coach Moser told us this morning at shootaround Talk it touch it switch it Its his mantra defensively as they continue to try to grow their defensive chemistry with this entirely new group of players Mosers team back to within two after the free throw by Davis Calvin looking for his screaming own shot again flying under control Makes a bad pass taken away by Xavier Brown and he is tripped on his way to the basket The foul against Sebastian Akens is his first Will step away with the Deaks on top by music two Those two Dan Im okay with coach Im not so shy I mean together Together Its an awful lot of basketball experience between those two guys Absolutely Hey Boston College got their hands full LSU a surprise 70 They got a young point guard named Dion Thomas Jr whos fantastic Dad played at UNLV way back in the day but Larry Johnson all those guys he is superb at the lead guard spot Should be fun to see LSU on the ACC Network tomorrow night At the free throw line Xavier Brown out of Roman Catholic High School in Philly cheering a St Josephs transfer who with the Hawks the last couple of years was the A10 rookie of the year and then last year first team all conference when he averaged over 17 per game There was curiosity around the Oklahoma program Would he be a prototypical point guard a scoring point guard Would he involve others or would he just be a volume shooter Certainly seemed through the first seven games he has fit very nicely into that point guard role Absolutely right Didnt play well against Marquette He was dealing with an ankle injury applause Now feeling much better but went 0 for9 against Marquette Prior to that I mean hes been outstanding Expect for him to get back on the horse today Averaging almost 14 points per game in his Oklahoma career so far 32 from distance Tough pass on the sideline Out of bounds Here comes Nigel Pac Fakes the pass Has it taken away Mai Mason says Give me that And here comes Coleman at the other end looked like he might have traveled and got away with it Wake keeps possession Mason to the corner misses the three Here comes Oklahoma back the other way Tay Davis again attacks the basket unable to finish Neither of these teams with hot high octane offenses have been able to get it going so far tonight Akens strong to the bucket Brown pulls up well short cheering Long rebound by Marcus Mary Its not for a lack of finding decent looks though I think thats first and foremost I mean Xavier Brown very capable of not making that shot Tay Davis missing cheering a layup on the possession prior Wake Forest has had their selection too But its almost as if both teams think the ball theres too much air in the ball right now struggling to hang on to it Nice play Spillers off the feed 42 First two points for the senior from Charleston Theres Trayvon Spillers I love his story Couple of different junior college stops Went to Appalachin State Not until he got there was he on division one teams radar at least at the power conference level And he has enjoyed a really good couple of years averaging 15 point 6 and 12 rebounds more than a block a game one and a half steals a game He impacts both ends for the deep He just plays so incredibly hard and he attacks the offensive glass Last year 88 offensive boards Cant let that guy get loose He leads the country Nigel Pap does and made threes per game at over four per night His first make gives Oklahoma the onepoint lead cheering Sooners down a man play four on five Pack doesnt care and a foul on the rebound I thought Pack might have pulled it a split second too early Probably could have engaged the defense a little bit more I actually thought Kai Rogers like that was kind of within the flow Well top 100 recruit picks up his first personal foul and Omaha Omaha comes back in Hell play with those two fouls Excuse me Try to stem the 82 Oklahoma run Sometimes you got to take that risk is the guy that was helping out on the defensive end of the floor Oklahoma starting to figure some some things out on the offensive end Wake on the other hand I mean finding some things in the half court running some good offensive sets just an illtimed pass or a little bit misplaced He kind of throws the rhythm off Steve Forbes has his starting five back out there This is the point guard Cal me little floater in the lane for two Hey this is a guy who could score When he was a freshman three seasons ago at Lamar he was the second leading freshman scorer in the country Best scorer in the country Brandon Miller Pretty good now with the Charlotte Hornets man Yeah he was the 2023 Southland Conference player of the year averaging over 17 per game Nate Ces just good quickness understands leverage Can I get this shot over 610 Yes I can pretty easily Just a really nice player Plays within himself too And I always find it intriguing to see a player whos a high volume scorer cheering whos able to adapt his game because he has that ability Hes done that so far this season for Steve Forbes and Wake Forest And thats putting your ego aside right 100 I could have never done that No I teed that one up for you Yeah you did Hey nice Hey Mai Masons been aggressive And this is a guy transfers over from Washington Good size Was a terrific shooter last year Mason like known as a good shooter hasnt really found a flow playing alongside Harris playing alongside Kovvin Belaloo Like if he can take that next step he was good against Campbell sure but if he could take that next step adds another piece of offense for this talented Wake Forest team Well after picking up his second foul Tay Davis is replaced in the lineup by Mohamd McGee Guy Mason a senior from Gilbert Arizona And again what are the odds that the starting back court for the Demon Deacons both are from Gilbert Arizona Theyve known each other for years and years Played AAU together played against each other in middle school didnt talk to each other before signing at Wake Forest Happy coincidence Played to different high schools Mosqu High School for Cal Compass prep for Mason and foresight number seven in Crimson back into the game as is Darion Reed with the basketball now trying to find Nigel Pack who is being pounded by Calmese Shot clock down to six Pack to the line Lucky bounce for Oklahoma and the foul is called against the Demon Deakons How about the playmaking ability by Nigel Pack Always been able to shoot You had to play up on his jumper Pack able to get right to left Gets downhill Really nice helpside defense by Mason Just ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time Hopefully that foul was not called on Bel It was called on Mason Wrong place wrong time Half second late That little cracked back help when your guy slides over You get there a half second sooner No foul The under eight media timeout screaming Porter Moser with it pending Gets Nigel back out of the game for a little extra break Sixth lead change of the night on this opening night of the ACC SEC mens challenge here in Winston Salem North Carolina Hold left alone way off the mark He hopped into that shot I didnt like that one coming off A little bit rushed Wasnt all the way square before he fired Foresight able to get it up then over the long arms of Spillers Just couldnt get it to fall Aaron pass Here comes Foresight Going to try again with Spillers in pursuit I think he got a piece of that one Couple of looks for Oklahoma They still cheering possess it now Brown for three and the foul called cheering against Oklahomas Jeff Wanquo That one and one coming down now Been a physical ball game Both teams struggling to get going offensively Locked in on the defensive end of the floor Get our first look at Isaac coming into the game for Wake Forest Young freshman from Oregon Came cross country There he is Hell get a possession in or two young man who committed to Oregon first before changing his mind forest over Washington C San Diego State along with Jaylen Cross were pointed out by Steve Forbes that shoot around this afternoon as true freshman who he is very high on their future They have three freshman coming in next year too I mean with so many people focused on the transfer portal some really good freshman available that are getting overlooked Not Steve Forbes in his career Although coach Forbes has done very well in the portal Absolutely Yes And about the talent he has brought in the conference players of the year Future NBA players No question Hunter Salis now with Philadelphia Jake Labraia Indianapolis guy Second round pick now with Lakers Foresight tries to set the screen but didnt do it very well He has called for the offensive foul and thatll take us to break with the demon Deakons up by one Guys we start looking at Wake Forest says Hey I can get there and really improve my game Brown on the back Missed the reverse Theres a lid on it And oh by the way of course Alis Williams left Oklahoma Im here to wait The Sooners have cooled off Just their last six shots cheering and screaming from the floor Couple of ball players get on hard and both have helped their feet appear to be okay Mohamed Wig how about that athleticism coming over He knows his role I got to protect the rim Talked about him being a chin at the rim type of athlete Excellent helping on Jaydon Jones the red shirt senior from Long Beach Did you ever play with a face mask I was never in the paint So Doug I never got myself in a position to break anything in my facial area So no Although I would have thought you might have gotten the attention of rival defenders who might have wanted to you know that part probably true And I probably talked enough to where they wanted to break something in my facial area but no never did And I cant imagine it being all that comfortable but I would think it would be so cheering disconcerting And I know Rick Hamilton made a terrier of it but I would think for most folks you couldnt wait to get it on Oklahoma back in the scoring column on the three ball from Reed Darren Reed finally knocks one down Oklahoma hadnt made a bucket in almost three minutes of playing time Well able to take the lid off Theres G Paris right there Thats what hes capable of He gets his shoulders on your shoulder He controls where the defense is at and he has the length to be able to get so far off the bounce because of his long steps Long arms able to try to finish Second foul on Dayton Foresight where gets the first Well the third annual ACC SEC womens basketball challenge begins tomorrow 81 Auburn squares off against 61 Syracuse at 5 Eastern And Thursday night SMU host Arkansas 7 Eastern right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app The SEC won last years womens challenge 10 to 6 So just like on the mens side the ACC has some work to do tense Absolutely And people think well its just bragging rights No I mean these are massive games Thats a really nice pass and look alike My goodness My man Dayton Foresight with floor vision screaming for does a good job with cut off Calm me Harris screaming is fouled on the floor before the shot There is continuation in college basketball now but not that much continuation Well they get that extra step They dont get the extra two to gather on top of that But look at this pass right here by Dayton Forsight Looks to the corner to get J Carris to go out and WGE able to finish Thats big time But heres a foul on the other end Juke Harris gets to that left hand Takes a lot of contact You get one extra step this season not the two extra steps Note this Nigel Pack with his second personal foul He stays on the floor for now for Porter Moser Forbes not happy But Ill be honest with you unless you catch Steve Forbes at shootound hes not often happy And even that oh hes one of the best He has an iffy proposition He said today he has turned a new leaf but he doesnt get irritated at shoot rounds screaming because hes got enough aggravation at night during the game I hear that So he is a new Steve Forbes apparently screaming James Span thats Steve Forbes We always enjoy a timely coach Great block Terrific storyteller I Ill say this Oklahomas running some good action up top swinging the ball getting it into the middle of the floor and then you have a cutter on the backside but Wake Forest not giving up on the play Trayon Spillers sees the cutter coming Hes able to contest at the rim Thats two big athletic dudes meeting at the summit This round goes to wait Brown nearly turned it over Still with the dribble screaming Good Theyre always going to blitz defensively It comes with a takeaway cheering and a run out The steel by Juke and the layup by Nate Calise 2723 the Knicks back in front Wake Forest starting to play really good defense Doug That guy right there J Caris Terrific length Knows the spins coming Comes in for help and then youre off to the races Terrific bounce pass that gets under the hands of Oklahoma and Nate Calmese running the floor able to find a nice opportunity Thats just good awareness knowing what the opposing team scouting report is Lein loves to turn his back and once you see that spin coming you can get in there and get a steal A blitz A blitz Thats what Wake does defensively whenever a ball handler turns his back to you Go get the ball Pat fouled on the three Its Cal Nice the guilty pardon Cal Nice with his hands up Hes got his hands full Hes chasing Nigel Pac coming off the screen And for him look how aggressive hes coming Pat understands I just have to go straight up He didnt cheering touch him a lot but he did get him across the shoulder And Pat that veteran guy whos averaging more than four cheering threes a game hes going to get that call Well I asked Pack at Shootaround today what he remembered about coming into this building two years ago the only time hes played here for the Miami Hurricanes and he said Rolled my ankle He said But I continued to play Miami lost the game to the Deaks in overtime He still played 41 minutes made his shots and loves screaming and cheering shooting in here I should have asked him is there a building in the SEC or the ACC you dont love shooting in You should have I wish the answer would have been no Boy the Big 12 did the same thing at Kansas State Hes been outstanding his entire career And I remember he was like the first guy to get a big NIL deal with life wallet down at Miami I dont know what a life wallet is but I think I bought two Traveling violation No bucket Yeah When Nigel left Kansas State for Miami and got a 2year 800000 deal Jaws from Coral Gables to the little apple were on the floor You thought how is that the new world were living in and now thats just pocket change relatively speaking Thats absolutely right Hes underpaid if thats the case now I mean its just changed so much But thats kind of the thing that set off all the NIL understanding its a new world You can thank Nigel pack cheering Darion Reed bottled up gets away from it and banks it in Hey thats what he does Hell dribble guys out Hell post up do the Barkley triple all the way from the threepoint line and find an opportunity Reed really talented Weve had eight ties seven lead changes The Sooners trying to retake the lead The lefty shot by Jaydon Jones And once again the Demon Deakons have fouled a threepoint shooter Steve Forb saying that Jaydon Jones jumped forward Were going to be able to take a look another look at it right here And not a lot of contact either way Jaydon Jones though lefty Those guys are a little tougher to defend Not a lot of contact though Isaac Kong nonetheless gets the foul So after four years at Long Beach State in his hometown in Long Beach California Jaydon Jones in his second year at Oklahoma sat out last year as a red shirt That would have been six points per game off the bench this year for Porter Moser He has a sister named Chrissy thats a professional volleyball player that also played at Long Beach State Really You know his mom Stephanie played basketball at Boyce Look at you How about that You got the Jones family cover Yeah we do We got the whole tree on the ACC network cheering Now he just solid Hes not a guy thats going to overdo it Hes going to play his role Hes got pretty good size on the wing 65 about 90 gets two out of three from the line Its a six nothing Oklahoma run to retake that lead Sebastian Akens with the pass Juke Harris with the triple You got to get on his outside shoulder make him put it on the deck because whenever he gets comfortable that three ball really starts to go through and thats when youre in trouble Offensively though both teams finally started to gain a little rhythm Green steps into a three Hes already got a couple tonight Couldnt make that one And a jump ball a held ball will give the basketball that Wake Forest when we come back And this first was wow 27 points 87 boards or 87 assists excuse me One of the alltime great individual seasons of college basketball history in the building tonight here in Winston Salem now for his Sooners Foul off the ball as Jones and Carr were battling Its going to go against Jaydon Jones You know turnovers have been a real strength for Oklahoma especially lately Eight or fewer turnovers in each of their last three games Theyve turned those into a lot of points but so far tonight the Sooners have coughed up seven turnovers and counter That was the point of emphasis for Porter Moser too Got to be careful with the ball and whenever you have a game like tonight when things are sputtering a little bit in the half court Cant give Quick Forest those extra opportunities to get out and run Moser besides himself with that last foul too Second foul on Jones Car makes a couple of free throws 3229 Wake Forest cheering with the lead Oklahoma with A BASKETBALL I MEAN THAT WAS A TERRIFIC PASS Darion Lee needs to be ready to shoot Reed gives it back to Brown Brown was ready Jones flies in for the rebound And with three minutes to go in the half now Brown thought about it Got the defender in the air on the turnaround Beautifully done for Xavier Brown And thats really good recognition by Darion Reeds knowing whos guarding him That boomerang pass right back to the guard Xavier Brown Hes able to do something with it I really like that offensive awareness by Reed Brown draws the foul line on Aens Two free throws upcoming to give the Sooners a chance to retake the lead This game has really lacked any kind of real flow Both teams playing extremely hard on the defensive end Ironically enough puts them on the foul line Struggling to get going Sunday night the huddle crew will have the annual selection music Sunday special a twohour show that includes full breakdowns of the ACCs bowl and playoffbound teams Our coverage starts at 6 Eastern right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app One out of two from his trip to the line for Brown He goes out after tying the ball game at 32 a piece so far 23 total fouls between the two teams Thats a lot Ive seen more so far this season Akens know Carr does a great job to get his hands on the ball cant secure it on the run out Jones has to come back to get the pass screaming and he will hold it up cheering Reed though will not lost it on the way up Wake Forest basketball Hang on to it Dion Reed getting out in transition Cant hang on to it Wake Forest gets the ball Needs somebody to inbound it Its amazing both teams have 32 the way this games been played Nothing about it has been especially pretty Weve got 33 free throws between the two teams Really you know the offenses out It hasnt been pretty in the half court Its not what we expected coming in Absolutely not Both teams averaging about 87 points per game screaming Harris behind the screen off the mark I like the defense by Jayon Jones I would prefer he go over that second one when youre guarding a shooter like J Harris Thats tough Foresight telling you hes got some wiggle He comes off a pick and roll You better close those gaps He snakes it Gets all the way to the cup Hes got some craftiness to his game I looked over after that bucket by Foresight Trey Young was smiling He recognizes that kind of ball Spillers commits the foul His second So nobody has three yet Terrence but four different Demon Deacons have two and five different Sooners also have two fouls cheering Been a free throw shooting contest so far Hey but screaming most of which have been fouls I mean both teams playing really aggressive it because both teams play with pace in the half court When I mean with by pace in the half court the ball changes sides of the floor quickly Theres not a whole lot of catching and standing Youre going to get cheering the defense a half second late coming over to rotate Thats when fouls happen If youre not on cheering your PCs and then keeping it on one side of the floor its another 6 run for the Sooners as Mohhamd made the second 3532 Oklahoma Just over a minute to go in the first half cheering Coven off the front rim and now the Sooners will walk it up Under a minute to go in the half tough indeed it was Brown makes the shot Timeout called by Wake Forest and well take it with him back in 30 seconds to the Lawrence Joel Coliseum Doing a lot of foul calls Coming up at halftime Taylor Joel and Luke will have all the scores and highlights from around this first night out of the ACC SEC challenge Theyve gone to halftime at the dome Syracuse with a twopoint lead over Tennessee That would be a big upset for the ACC if that were to happen Tennessee always tough Jacobe Gillespie Native Amen Those two guys bucket getting dudes for Rick Barnes in a Tennessee culture thats really physical cheering out of the timeout Deaks fighting to get a shot They find one with Cal Me He delivers 3735 Just really good offense Ball changes sides of the floor three times and you get an open three Cali is able to knock it through off a nice pass from Paul cheering 5 seconds Xavier Brown pulls Little strong no foul And that undersized player who he thinks hes getting a scoop on It was Alan Iverson Everybody in the country knew about it But he spent two days ooing and on in this building over AI as a high school junior Well the good news is he didnt miss on that on that one On that evaluation but he went to Georgetown He did not go to Texas AM and then he came back and actually interviewed for a job on Dave ODMs staff And apparently when coach ODM does interviews or did cheering interviews he had to jog with him for five miles Well the Sooners draw first blood in transition Tate Davis throws it down off a turnover nonetheless Excellent pass Nigel Pack getting out in transition and Tay Davis Ive raved about his talent enough Nice move by Nate Calvin Finally some offense starting to happen in this contest Just needed a little bit of a break to get it going But nice play Oklahoma out in transition Tay Davis This is a guy who catches it Hes going to be able to try to finish here Talented Satan Hall first then goes to Notre Dame Continues to develop his game Hes turned into a nice player and he was the first to say yes to Porter Moser in the transfer portal followed immediately thereafter by his old friend from Indianapolis Nigel Pack and that kind of opened the floodgates to then get Xavier Brown and Darion Reed Just the third shot attempt of the night for Nigel Pack Moser telling us the importance of getting that first player in the portal You get a good one first the other ones follow Exhibit A Wake got a or Oklahoma got a good one Mason buries the three Need it Wake has to find a way to open up the floor on offense Struggling so far to knock down shots from the perimeter If theyre able to get that going youre going to give me some more room Youre going to give Juke Harris some more room Like it though Now you look for us a little bit more aggressive on the ball Oh come on cheering Were going to take another look at this one I I dont like it Tay Davis getting downhill Maybe the off arm but the official who called that foul didnt have an angle at that off arm screaming I dont know Doug I can tell I would like for it to loosen up a little bit I mean it seems like every time the game starts to get a little bit of rhythm weve got a whistle Well we had nine in the first half to commit two fouls Beloo is the first with three so he goes to the bench Good me From the corner for three Hes got eight points How quick does he get that shot Feet set Fire away No dip in that threepoint shot Its going up Ball knocked around Comes to Pack Young man who has nearly 1900 career points as a collegiate basketball player Drive and dish Reed No Blake needs a push Get into a quick drag Let Juke Harris go to work a little bit Spillers dumps it off Beautiful reverse by Mason And thats just good patience Juke Harris probably had that first shot Gets rid of it Finally some cutting off the ball finding the gaps in the defense Brown draws two defenders gets rid of the basketball to Reed Score up on Spillers Now you need to go Youre starting to get rhythm Youre starting to get stops How quick can you get to your next action Coach Forbes wants to play fast Here is Harris Ball on the floor on the rebounding action Davis got tangled up with Marcus Marian Marcus Marian also known as the Great Dane Great head of hair Im jealous Good effort This is a guy red shirt when he came over last year When he came over to the States lot of natural talent Played in Danish top league over there had some good numbers Starting to adjust to life in the ACC First foul on Taye Davis from the corner Harris tracks it down Contact applause cheering and he will shoot too I love it Youre crashing the offensive glass from the wings And whenever you have Juke Harris in the mix you have some of these bigger guys crashing from the perimeter It puts so much pressure on some of these smaller guards Nigel Pack took one to the chops And I always found it you know Nigels about hes a little smaller than me but not much But whenever youre having to box out a bigger player you have to meet him further away towards that threepoint line Juke Harris aggressive on the offensive glass just running down and he goes up just takes one right underneath the chin That is not comfortable And for his trouble he gets his third personal foul joining Tay Davis Porter Moser displeased cheering He thinks he hit elbowed him in the face screaming Now theyre going to go take a look at it in Oklahoma Theyre starting to find some things to do Get out in the passing lanes create some opportunities Nigel Pack do me a favor Throw it music up to Tay Davis Thats two Even though he took the shot to the chops he gets his third personal foul and now he sits early in the second half Much more eloquently put by you than me thats for sure But Ron Guber in my opinion if hes not the best in the business hes top two because he so many Final Four has done an excellent job settling down Porter Moser over there on the other side And we do appreciate the officials when they come over to help us to help you the audience know what happened Drew Harris gets one out of two from the line 13 points to lead all scorers Now we have a challenge Wake Forest is going to be able to challenge the out of bounds call clearance plays and restricted area plays around that charge circle on the bottom So block charges from that Marcus Marians making his presence felt on the offensive glass He is and he has drawn another foul going for a rebound as Jeff Wanquo tried to hold him down That is his third So he joins Tay Davis and Nigel Pack with three So the former twolane football player will take a seat on the Oklahoma bench Kai Mason tough shot off the glass Had just enough of an angle to get down that seam and be able to finish And that all stems from being able to knock down a three on the other 45 just a few minutes ago Has that respect to pull the defense out cheering been impressed so far with Wake Forest defense Theyre trapping cheering Theyre getting the spots Swarming to the basketball And Reed was fouled with three defenders around him cheering Well if youre Oklahoma three of your top six players are on the bench with three fouls Youve got to find offense somewhere else I like this spin anytime Oklahoma spins Juke Harris getting the across the arm Good foul call from the baseline there screaming Theyre calling it on the baseline Darien Reed wanted a Darien Reed wanting two free throws I happen to disagree with Porter Moser right here Those hands never went up towards the rim for a shot attempt Good call by the officials Heres Reed with the basketball after the settling foul on Harris Reed gets it back Jones with a step on the defender screaming Shuffle pass inside and the foul will send McGee to the line Duke Harris needs to be careful Be curious Thats two times in a row getting his hand stuck in the cookie jaw He comes over late screaming right across the wrist Not sure what hes arguing about So hes cheering the first demon Deacon with three personal fouls The block thickens cheering I thought he got him across the wrist Im not sure what he was so upset about cheering That beg Omaha Paloo was the first Wake Forest player cheering to three times We havent seen much Omaha ball but Marcus Marion come in has come in given good minutes attacked the offensive glass given a spark that Wake Force need on the offensive end They got to find a way to get stops without foul Has a little bit more flow here in the second half screaming Kesh turned the corner and laid it in Brown lost him Its an easy two for the point guard for Wake Forest The help side just didnt stay over long enough on that hedge K cheering has good burst with the basketball in his hands Able to finish screaming Five minutes gone here in the second half on this opening night of the ACC SEC challenge Crowd lined up walk on ground and they got it Finally starting to get some stops cheering Wake Forest the fans starting to get into it too Its been a little bit sleepy A lot of free throws will take the crowd out of the game here in the second half starting to move a little bit They are fully engaged here at the Jordanise Mason Marian Spillers and Harris stays out there for weight flag with those three fouls Drew Parish leads all scorers so far tonight Tough shot Almost made it go cheering Lost his balance You attack the rim and he attacks the rim going right Play off two feet Played lower Calise thought he got off far Instead Darien Reed will shoot two Its a tough matchup for the 62 181 lb senior Hes got his second foul Were going to take a look Nate Cal hes in the post Swipes down Thats a lot of ball cheering Even so Nate Calse you have to know that helps coming over the top Stay physical cheering Not really sure you can do much more than what he did right there That looked pretty clean to me screaming cheering Again giving up about 40 lbs He did not back down stuck his chest out and stayed between Reed and the basket but on the reach cheering he was called for the personal Foresight out screaming for Oklahoma back in Brees been very good at the line so far this year He gets one out of two and hes got the Sooners back in front by one Not for nothing here Every time theres a stoppage in play screaming Porto are subbing somebody in And since theres been so many foul calls it further takes the air out of the game So watch him manipulate this pace a little bit Its not nothing Hes trying to slow down the tempo of this ball game Kami Smith fires Spillers tips it up Wake cheering keeps Harris cheering Weve got a blocking foul out on the perimeter and thats the fourth against Wanquo Won a little bit late getting out That was on Im going to let that one go Okay laughter Well the official called it Hes a great one He is He is So if he saw something Im just going to take his word for it I didnt see much I dont have a great angle here Courtside cheering Mason looking for the shot Little strong long rebound to the corner He tracks it down Falling out of bounds Tries to get the timeout cheering I think he tried to call a timeout The referee did not grant the timeout Said he stepped out of bounds prior to trying to call it Apparently a good look because Steve Forbes had the chance to challenge Decided not to do so Nigel pass back into the game Hes been held in check so far Brown Good fight for the ball The Sooners keep it screaming And again Sooners can slow the game down Get back screaming out cheering Clock resets Man this has been ugly screaming Sooners without a bucket in nearly four and a half minutes Jones tries to change that and div Hes got an unorthodox shot but hes able to knock it in An absolute killer A good defensive possession cheering Good offense Beats good defense seven days a week Im not even sure Im willing to call that good offense It goes in Thats right Its good offense Thats what I screaming used to tell Oliver Fernel all the time Can you buy it Not at all Heres the thing though I I mean Wake is having some good defensive possessions They get to their spots What a block Spillers The rejection screaming Pack misses The possession continues as a Demon Deacon winds up on the floor holding his head Miles Coleman took a shot Theyre going to take a look at it And Im curious too because somebody from Wake Forest needs to take some initiative They need a defensive rebound The official came over to tell us Jabelle Spearman There was some blood in the mouth of Miles Culvin who makes the first Miles Coven so far today one of five from the field You get a guy whos a scorer for a couple of looks at the basket to see it go in Sometimes thats all a guy like that needs Again he leads the nation in bench score excuse me leads the ACC in bench scoring at over 12 per cheering game for a team that trails only Clemson and Virginia in that category So two free throws and the basketball Wake Forest with it Nate Caliss at the point The Deaks back within two I got to give Jayon Jones credit man That guy is guarding his rear end off the entire game Is he getting caught outside of position sometime Sure But his effort has been elite Spillers No Heres Tay Davis into the paint Out to Jones screaming Another offensive rebound for Oklahomas Rogers Davis back outside Jones will try again And he is fouled For the third time tonight the Demon Deacons have cheering fouled a threepoint shooter And Colise and Coven both arguing We had the angle right behind Coven fouled him And heres the deal Its Its a pretty clear foul call He gets out there late You have to be more controlled here And you have to be able to give the guy room to land Jones jumps forward about 3 ft on his jump shot That didnt matter in this case Culvin getting out a little bit too late You got to be smarter with your contest especially from beyond the three Cant foul a threepoint shooter against an Oklahoma team that struggled to generate some offense Second foul on Culver cheering Got to applaud Jones though I mean hes getting some free throw opportunities here sure But on the defensive end of the floor my man is bringing it and hes got his hands full Miles Coven Juke Harris hes being pinpointed with the other teams best player on the floor Hes done a really nice job and they knew what they were getting whenever he signed Hes never been this guy that averaged 20 points a game He does all the other things Big time athlete athletic family and Long Beach State really defended Now at Oklahoma really defending Yeah he was the Big West Conference defensive player of the year Yes at Long Beach Its easy to see why And hes big enough and long enough to be able to defend a variety of opponents Calmise short tracked down by Pat Foresight at the point splits the double team Finds the open man in the corner Its Jones Got it Jaydon Jones is the man of the hour But what a move by Sebastian Akins brings the ball up Kid from outside of Charlotte played in the Summit League screaming last year Is terrific A little bit closer to home Gets the opportunity He was at Denver a school that your family is familiar with Thats right Coven got it Bingo Get my man from the free throw line Let him see one go in Thank goodness Wake Forest needing some offense One of the last seven from the field cheering Coen able to take the lid off First made field goal for the Deaks in about 5 minutes Pack answers with the turnaround And hes so good at that Nigel Packs got to be all at 511 six feet But that little turnaround jump shot after he creates the leverage hes gotten really good at Jaydon Jones man hes all over the place Hes a walking deflection Yeah he is The thing you like about Nigel Path you know hes making better than 50 of his threepoint shots but that is only part of his game Its not like hes just set up out there He can initiate offense and he can get shots anywhere on the floor Hes so disciplined in the fact that he doesnt force the issue Like hell take an errant three in transition but it doesnt happen all that often Better find a way for this guy to get going again A whistle that I think came before the shot Its on the floor Foright for gets his third There was pretty good hand fighting both ways on that play Sure Im not really sure what more hes supposed to do right there Hes in the right spot Really physical play 62 190 sophomore sits down Just past the midpoint of the second half here at Lawrence Joel Coliseum in Winston Salem Kovvin trying for two in a row Cant get the roll Seems like Ws half a second off 6 in too short Got to screaming find a way here over the last nine and a half minutes to find some offense Offensive foul against Oklahoma be Waggys cheering third moving screen trying to get his man Nigel Pack open Portoa not happy about it but hell take some of those moving screen fouls to get Nigel Pack a look Good gosh Akens denied by Wigg And here comes Oklahoma Pack uses the screen gives it back takes the contact and WGI gives Oklahoma its largest lead of the night screaming What a finish Mohamed WG Nice little pick and roll action Catches the roll Able to finish but how about the block on one end This guy has been all over the place defensively Then on the other little drag screen quick roll man just went with bad intentions Needs to be careful there at the end A nice finish by big time athlete Nine points 11 rebounds for Lee Hes screaming a know your role guy former mountaineer former Crimson Tide cheering secondyear Sooner from the Bronx Black is waiting for Culvin makes him get rid of the basketball Omaha Belaloo back cheering in the game for three I feel like this Wake Forest team when Belaloo got his second foul in the first half lost some rhythm Needs to stay out of foul trouble but if hes shooting the ball at a high cliff Im telling you it opens up the game to a different level for this Steven Deacon squad Wigg Jones gathers puts it up screaming Long rebound He continues his monster night on the glass screaming Pack skip past Davis Davis spins draws the whistle and will shoot two Omaha Belaloo just out of position Tay Davis that mans a handful He gets going Quick spoon spin move Go left quick right I mean thats a block Thats not legal guarding position Nice job Taye Davis maintaining his quickness getting some leverage Gets the foul call to lose an important piece Got to find a way to keep him in the ball game I mean defensively hes only averaging about 18 minutes a game this year This guy hes starting to come along Hes been healthy for an elongated period for the first time in three years You see he shoots a pretty ball and he defends pretty well got to do a better job Hey if youre Wake Forest you need to hit and get Dont forget the hit part What I mean by that is you got to box out early You play Mohamd McGee some of these bigger athletes for Oklahoma if you dont hit them first theyre going to out jump you because WGE standing right at 7 ft You got to meet him out a little bit further away from the rim to give yourself a chance to get the rebound Its been a killer for Wake Forest so far Great balance for the Sooners Four different players in double figures Brown and WGE both have nine Coven missed the layup Everything but the finish Jay Davis end to end and he lays it in And now this is the largest lead of the night and a research Terrence Ogres beyond Doug Sherman here in the later stages Oklahoma pulling away just a bit from Wake Forest This is the largest lead of the night at 6655 And another foul This is the first on Xavier Brown Wake Forest now in the bonus If if Im Wade Forest and Im Steve Forbes I Im telling my players we need to take a little bit better angles coming off screens away from the ball Theyre theyre running really wide And because of that Oklahoma and Xavier Brown Niger Pack some of these guys theyve been able to blow up these off ball screens and youre not getting any advantage coming off the pin downs Do a better job setting up your cuts to get open You have scores Doesnt make it any use to set on the screen if they cant get open take better angles to go get that ball Wake Forest showing a little bit of pressure Fullourt 131 cheering Its nice to have somebody like Tay Davis be able to handle the pressure Yeah Marcus Marion at the head of it He stays out front The long arms of the 69 red shirt sophomore from Denmark as they stay in a 131 This is something that Oklahoma struggled with when they played Marquette in their last contest Zone offense Nice defensive possession by Wade but they had trouble finishing the possession applause They do get the basketball as Spillers went to the floor Got to try to change the rhythm up of this game I I like that call coming out of a timeout Were going to go full court 131 just to mix up the look a little bit Oklahoma starting to get a little bit too comfortable Has an advantage Set up your cuts right here If youre Wake Forest youre running pretty good stuff Set up your cuts and take care of the pass Nearly comes up with it Wake Forest will keep Nigel Packs not showing his age today laughter Hey hes playing well on the defensive end pestering the basketball Callm me cant get lazy Cant turn your back Nigel Packs in the mix on every single play Just a veteran guy cheering Understands how to get underneath a point guard Oh nice set Harris screaming brings it back cheering out Four to shoot Calvin lost it puts it up around and out And now Oklahoma in no hurry And Oklahoma you know averaging what 87 points a game coming into this contest Very comfortable in this game against Wake Forest playing at this pace Were going to come down Were going to set up an offense Were going to find easy looks Just really good offense Just really good offense Xavier Brown terrific pass to the opposite corner Look at in the gaps Need this one Long rebound off the Spiller miss And again elongated offense playing a little bit slower than Wake Forest would prefer And here we are with Oklahoma slow methodical and getting in their sets controlling the tempo of this game Brown wraparound pass for the dump Got to delay a game on WGE Kicked the ball after it went down But but the three the the pass by Xavier Brown opposite corner reading Marcus Mary number 11 on that bottom side comes too far over just a really good play managing to pick and roll Next play down Mohamd its about as easy as a two as youre going to get Cant punt the ball after you dunk it From our angle I did not see him kick it like that It took off It wasnt by accident may or may not have made it to the red zone I I mean just a really good play Xavier Brown guy coming over from St Joes Dads an assistant coach on the staff This is a kid that understands how to manipulate a defense Two really good plays Spillers off the lob from Harris screaming Really good play Harris after the ball changes sides of the floor I like it Jones look away pass Reed lays it in Culvin back the other way quickly Missed everything Hes slow to get up So the Sooners are playing five on four Brown underneath Finds the cutter and Reed with another layup cheering and applause I wonder if youre Steve Forbes you call a timeout right now down 16 Got to find a way to stop the bleeding They just have not been able to hit open jump shots today even when theyve been able to create them Wake Forest has been stuck offensively You see eight for 26 in the second half shooting And again cheering a wide open basket for Reed And now the timeout comes cheering and applause from Steve Forbes Brown And what makes him special at the point guard spot Little fist fist Two ball screens up top He comes across Hes reading number 11 at the bottom of your screen Lazy helpside defense Terrific pass the opposite corner And Tay Davis wide open for the three If youre Marcus Marion you have got to get over further and be in a stance knowing that youre the MIG the MIG the most important guy You you have to be better away from the ball there in order to be able to recover And Oklahoma has had one open look after another How many times have they gotten right to the basket in the second half with very little resistance Thats exactly right Its because youre not in a stance away from the basketball and and over the last three or four minutes where Oklahoma has taken off five for five of their last five all off of well orchestrated offense because guys who are not guarding the basketball dont have their butts down and ready to play That can happen Since the 15minute mark of the second half Wake Forest has scored three baskets Its been tough Its not like they havent found good shots either I I mean Nick Freriedman who runs the offense for Wake Forest hes putting them in position to score but you cant make it for eventually The players have to knock shots down And the balance at this end for Oklahoma has been tremendous as has Tay Davis screaming He has 18 to lead all scorers Just a cheering really impressive performance Five guys for Oklahoma in double figures Darion Reed 16 Tay Davis has been a dude an efficient dude with 18 points Jones and WGE with 11 Pack with 10 I mean this has been a wellbalanced attack especially here over the last five or six minutes Offensively Oklahoma has really found their rhythm Brown is fouled by Mason Well weve been keeping track of the other first night games that got underway in the 700 hour in this ACC SEC challenge And Cameron Indoor a good one over on ESPN Duke 48 Florida 45 cheering nearing the midpoint of the second half Bunch of old dudes for Florida bunch of young guys for Duke Cam Boozer been about as good as advertised but guy that I really like for Duke Patrick cheering Gunbut has shown a different side of his game as a perimeter passer That Duke teams a handful screaming Hey how about Xavier Brown make it six different Sooners in double figures Hes got 11 points Really just a nice allaround performance They finally started to find their rhythm tough to stop Oklahomas going to be tough to beat in the SEC especially if they figure it out on the defensive end consistently Nice drive Isaac Carr Theyll take the trip to the line You like what youve seen from the freshman out of Portland North Yeah and its going to take time I think in this day and age you know freshman want to come in and make an impact And to be honest with you Doug Im speaking out of both sides of my mouth because thats how I was when I was little I or not little When I was younger I wanted to come in play a lot right away Isaac Carr he buys in and hangs around here at Wake Forest Hes going to be a really really nice player for Steve Forbes Sometimes you got some older guys in front of you but he shoots screaming a good ball He was the highest rated player out of Oregon last year Comes all the way cross country By the way MoGee has a new careerh high with his 13 rebounds to go along with his 11 points Just an impressive performance on both ends for the Sooners Well balanced made some toughness plays here on the road that she needs cheering to win this game They got out of hand in a hurry Oklahoma led only by two at halftime and the Demon Deacons have not been able to keep up here in the second screaming Davis to Pat Nothing but net for Nigel Pass Man he moved so well without the ball and WGE with a terrific hammer screen on the backside that I dont think was called Just a veteran player understanding I can get my shooter open Nice ball cheering fake to Harris Well Terren Oklahoma has made its last seven shots from the floor They have been really impressive in the second half and in putting the ball game away Well you know what the thing is too Doug is like Wake Forest is finding decent looks They just tonight havent hit them I mean the ball has moved pretty well There just comes a point where its like you know Mai Mason needs to hit shots Juke Harris needs to hit shots Call me came off a lot of ball screens today naked Thats just another way to say open but came off the ball screen naked You got to be able to knock down that look and really you know Oklahoma finally took the lid off and it happened quickly I did feel at times today Wake Force on the offensive end of the floor got really sped up They just took him out of the rhythm Its amazing what a couple made shots will do for your team as your teams collective confidence Look at Pat just battling through guarding bigger players cheering Theyre going to count that bucket I actually thought it was close to staying in front right there Hes having to switch The worst thing in the world is being stuck on the top of the key and having to switch on the ball handler after blind I actually thought he did a pretty good job Gets underneath the screen Its pretty good positioning but turns his body Doesnt take it to the chest But at least this time he didnt take it to the chin like he did earlier The price you pay as a small guard Yeah youre going to stick your chin in there where other guys elbows are Look out Duke Harris today I mean only three of eight from the field but hes found ways to get to the free throw line 12 of 14 from the foul line with 20 points But this just hasnt been Wake Forest night on offense You know you look at the fan base of Wake Forest you look at Steve Forbes theres a lot of positive to take away from this There were times when like youre finding good shots with consistency You had periods of really good defensive play but it was like when Oklahomas able to knock down a couple of threes Oklahomas able to knock down a couple of threes They really found some rhythm screaming How about you Caris You want to talk about a guy whos improved in the weight room Look how strong Hes talking a lot of trash to be down 16 points You might just want to put that one in Drew Cars been frustrated Last time out they all went over where we have double technical fouls being called but last time out over in their huddle Juke Harris is getting after his teammates It didnt seem like it was in a negative way but like trying to show some leadership and it happened right after that crosscourt pass by Xavier Brown to the corner where there was lazy help And the thing is when your best player is that committed he has to do it a certain way He has to do it a certain way but you have to show some leadership if youre going to be your teams best player Hes gotten to the line Hes scored and take your the rest of your guys with you on the double technicals against Harris and Davis Davis as you saw fouled out Tell you what Porter Moser Ive been watching him the entire game My man has lost no juice in how hes coaching My man is bringing it every possession Had a long really good run at Lyola Chicago Hes been doing it for a long time He has not lost any passion for this game No And he almost looks like hes in such great shape he could play like he did at Kraton back in the 80s and 90s Do you think he could still run the five miles with Dave ODM My question No I dont know He probably might be able to get five miles Yeah hed give it a shot Well he has walked five miles tonight Thats for sure No theres no question about that Porter told us earlier today that hes only been to Winston Salem a couple of times in his life before tonight The second time was to interview for a job on Dave Odens staff He wound up getting his first head coaching job instead a couple of weeks later So never joined the Deacon Demons the Demon Deacons family Spillers Heres the idea Oklahoma just been so good in this this run Seven out of their last eight field goals over the last six minutes of this game I mean they just executed with precision Wake Forest tried to change some things up go some zone They figured it out immediately I think they got one stop They got one stop and they go back to just executing and executing I thought they did a really nice job Team to move the ball at a high level huh Especially in the second half screaming Got such better looks to break screaming second half shot 45 from three and thats without Nigel Pat cheering being the catalyst He did his part Sure But it wasnt him going off It was everybody the guy Jaydon Jones for Oklahoma knocking down some shots getting to the free throw line playing spectacular defense That seemed to be the guy that cut it all through Hey look a lot of positive to take away from Wake Forest but Oklahoma tonight executed in the second half to blow that lead open I thought Porter Mosers squad did a really nice job Wake Forest have some work to do Got to make shots
