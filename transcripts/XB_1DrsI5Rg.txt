e Applause Applause Applause Applause k Applause Applause up to the line number Applause Music Applause trying to bully ball against kdo in the lane holding that pivot somehow finds Davis can handle out of bounds it almost looked like that possession was sped up a bit Michael Shrewsberry wants some Independence freedom and movement in his offense he does and he wants to take advantage of the smaller guards of Carolina if he can Alo had an opportunity there but good defense by kadoo just walled up and forced the turnover heres Kad second in the ACC over six dim a game were going to back off and try to bait Carolina in the settling for perimeter shots is what Notre Dames defensive game plan will be t on the timer G the probing dribble kick Corner pow rainbow Miss weak side foul on North Carolina yeah I think its Jaylen Washington little wrestling going on on that weak side board that backside glass he is the leading rebounder for Hubert Davis who spoke with us about their need to get back to their brand which is offensive rebounding its been way below normal standards yeah theyre only averaging about 10 offensive rebounds a game and typically Carolina teams have been in that 13 14 rebound per game average but this is a different roster and rebounding has been an issue two turnovers and three trips down the floor for the Irish Davis given brief isolation rer explodes off the front lit Miss he tricked that layup he thought he got fouled but thats one you should even finish through contact oh hard contact cupping his eye could brought his hand up to right above that right Applause eye physical early well both teams are hungry for a w and realize its going to take physicality and execution here you see the collision and kdo got the worst of it there yeah I think Roper just kind of Rak him across the face a bit just called a jump ball so tarel possession how a lot of touches early hasnt been much for Davis you see the hand signal there from Shrewsberry playing with a foul out of the corner lot of outside shots and thats exactly the game plan for Notre Dame keep it out of the paint and make uncomfortable threepoint Shooters shoot shots Davis unable to finish Shrewsberry five on Applause four ke tell you what Carolinas defense has been pretty solid and stout here in the early going John Davis the rainbow hits heel tie up rips it away this is what he does best oh Euro up and in and one big time effort that time by Tay Davis who has been on a tear of late 24 points a game eight rebounds a game in his last three and he just took his lunch money right there Ian Jackson The Freshman had it and then he didnt then the step through concentration while drawing contact and Davis at the line yeah his um breakout season hes really made a nice jump from last year attributed to simply being more comfortable with how Notre Dame wants to play in our conversation with Micah Shrewsberry and leaves that free throw a tad short but hes made tremendous progress from last year fou to Jackson his first step back Jackson for three this guys got a game in his bag confident smooth explosive 24 game in his last three Alo does a little bit of everything for this Notre Dame Squad hes kind of one of those Valu ility guys John just brings value in a lot of useful ways for your club and he can shoot in and out Welly we teed him up nice there didnt we 47 on the year well good job by Notre Dame to get back here thats one of the keys as well transition defense animated coaching from Hubert Davis throughout oh th the needle what a cut what a pass and pow pounds home the dunk again with all eyes fixed on RJ Davis youre prone to being back cut if everybodys not on in sync defensively excellent work by the tar Hills there kick Corner Shrewsberry low Rings it down well thats backto back quality execution by both teams now were starting to feel a little bit of Rhythm in this game between both teams Jackson defended by Alo swing it to Kad the primary Point man his scoring has been cut dramatically over the last seven games at a brilliant November fairly silent since nearly coughed it up the hell pal the jab step four to shoot Jackson has to put it up pal does it the Applause horn tipped and Shrewsberry has it now five minutes gone dead bull means a media you can feel each team kind of taking a breath here oh a locko nice Cut double CS bad grain of the lane pass Ian Jackson natural score got Applause bumped good action both ends of the floor Davis the pow and then Notre Dame at the they in Shrewsberry take all three of those Carina guards are not physically imposing and therefore you want to try to get size and physicality on them as Jackson knocks down his first free throw attempt you know this young man has been terrific All Season he certainly turned it up a notch here of late 24 game his last three but hes also taken 26 free throws in those three games John thats um almost nine free throw attempts a game and thats why he scores so easily because he does it from every level he makes threes he gets in the paint he also gets to the foul line Jr Ki also giving some time to shine he lurks in the left corner sundra off the B lead for Shrewsberry brief window closes quickly sundra extra give kzne timer ticket but this is not where Notre Dame wants to be fighting the shot clock Shrewsberry Flo yeah hes added that to his game you know he was designated as a catch and shoe guy a year ago to his credit hes added that nice little floater to his repertoire and got knowre Dame a bucket late in the clock Davis Cuts extra give rattles down thats why you dont want them in the lane John because they can draw fouls or they can create easy opportunities and keep an eye on the four and five men for North Carolina they have struggled to get consistent production from those guys Washington van Luben pal Withers those guys have to produce for him at the table Marcus Burton ready to sub in and Im sure this building ready to explode when he does so alako on high rattles away ripped down clean by Ben Allen Luben yeah he played his freshman year here at Notre Dame did Allan Luben and theres RJ Davis he really has allowed things hes really really struggled with his shooting percentage John and I like the fact that he just took his first shot mhm with seven minutes gone and got a quality look and with that he has tied Armando Bott for second most points in Carolina lore his teammate a season ago T Davis High kiss miss pal on the push Davis feeling it now on high no call loose ball Shrewsberry extra pass kesn for three got it I really think hes a key guy for Notre Dame going forward hes got a lot in his game hes been a little up and down although he scored 11 a game in the two ACC matchups and typically plays better at home but he can defend he can score in transition he can make threes grimaces a bit here I think Powell brushed him in the face a bit on the way up Tay Davis great feed the cut kesn extra step he gives it away yeah he didnt catch cleanly there John and here comes for the first time since November 26th Marcus Burton when he got hurt he was the only man in America averaging 20 points 20 board five five boards and five dimes per game stat sheet stuffing is what he was doing and making everybody elses job easier for the fight Irish he had been practicing with physicality since the Georgia Tech loss Applause MH Davis ball stagnating six to shoot P at by Burton J free Iris ball and heres Burton going at Davis foul on the floor Oh Marcus Burton is back and he draws the foul against Carolina and last year 577 total points breaking Troy Murphys freshman program record active hands tar Hills on the Run Jackson puts it down well I tell you what the North Carolina defense has been really solid here John this first8 minutes or so locked in everybody tied together good ball pressure and theyve been able to score a couple of buckets off turnovers sir Mohamed off one and done Ian Jackson the board Davis going at truberry playing with a foul K Tyson the Belmont transfer at the table for Hubert Applause Davis po extra pass Jackson closed out quickly the sub in Roper knocks it out of bounds good activity defensively on the Baseline out of bounds play deflection leads to the Jackson throw down Jackson 23 plus points in three straight games only the third Carolina freshman to do that the persons Phil forward what a pass he had the bucket as soon as he had the ball jayen witherss biggest lead for the Tar Heels youre exactly right John thats what we call a room service dime that means all youve got to do is Catch and you can eat and that was a beautiful pass by RJ Davis Alo who shot has been off stepped into that one and that was flat and short Jackson other end he is getting hot timeout in Notre Dame its an 80 Applause run all tar Hills on the road here beautiful bounce pass and all Withers had to do was catch and finish tar Hills plus eight aing the ball beautifully yeah no theyve been on top of their game no doubt about it John exactly what Hubert Davis wanted to see now it needs to be sustained Notre Dame on the other hand has to be a little more assertive offensively theyve been on their heels a bit because of this Carolina defense you got to catch that ball and be ready to make a move right away get into something offensively J trying to create space puns it up and in nice to work for that time by kabaji RJ Davis boy I love the way hes just been very composed and there is that young man again Ian Jackson hes got a dozen already oh he can get it in the basket he can really get it in the basket up top Roper extra give Alo a little Applause shy Burton hasnt quite been Rhythm off the jab step contested three rattles away yeah good look the Carolinas defense has been Rock Solid and RJ has been really good orchestrating and distributing here in the half court for North Carolina and this is a bit abnormal Clark because North Carolina season has seen some wful first halves and some Stellar second halves turn around Withers Burton transition extra pass loo Dame just not able to get anything early in the clock and that puts a lot of pressure on your offense travel yeah when youre going against a set defense late in the clock perhaps the best finisher in transition so they missed those elements of his game not to mention the scoring but so far here today off to an outstanding start primarily at the defensive end the off def has been excellent but the defense has been superb as well and theres Ian Jackson again fully in his bag goes by Captain Jack on his podcast and his videos and he has been sailing right to the rack against Notre Dame M will hes a hes got decent size good strength deceptive strength explosive first step and again hes on the rip here of late 24 game in his last three and hes on his way to another 20 plus outing fou to Alo his first a 142 run Notre Dame six field goal makes six giveaways its been disjointed and at times ugly and you got to give some of that credit to this North Carolina defense Shrewsberry contested rejected theres Jackson theyve been everywhere nothing easy for Notre Dame theyre going to have to pick up the pace set stronger screens and move that ball be ready to take shots when theyre available theyre going to have to start making basketball plays here John youve got something youve called and you want to run but theres going to be more read react and go get it for Notre Dame against this kind of Defense from North Carolina Shrewsberry forced to take the jumper hits heel onehanded by the Irish they maintain AO steps into it his first m Applause thats an effort basket off the offensive rebound thats what its going to take now theyre trying to mix it up defensively here Jackson over AO bit of a heat check moment and a good boxing board for Kevin Applause J there you go thats the kind of Rhythm you got to play with against a team thats been stifling defensively in the half court you cant try to get all the way to the door at the park lot against good defense sometimes you got to take the parking spot thats a little farther away and go ahead and get that shot up and we could all use the steps from time to time yeah every now and then Koo what a pass and the dump missed Luben could not put home the hammer wow that is deflating for the tar Hills now the Irish could be a bucket away from making it a one possession game a tilt thats been largely dominated by the Tar Heels the last s eight minutes of game time deliberate offense quick Music load weak side what a box out there by Kad sure was will step aside a sixpoint difference this sold out he does and sometimes he has to because they need him to go after his bass after his points but here today hes done a nice job setting up teammates and the execution at both ends so far so good for North Carolina a tarel team thats trying to find a little more depth at the big spot James Brown getting some minutes here he only plays about two and a half minutes a game yeah again these teams we talked about it at the top both are kind of looking for consistent winning identities what players are going to be able to be consistently counted on to help us win games RJ Davis said feed me a little short Alo had it pinned against his face chin and spin they call a jump Arrow will go to the Irish he was outsized dramatically by the 610 brown it showed plenty of fight and he had the inside position but good work by Brown getting his hands on that ball cleanly now brown his cousin Cory Brewer twotime national champ in Florida 13 years in the NBA yeah he had an outstanding career and was mop of I think that second Championship that Florida won most outstanding player in that final four jayen Washington ready to sub and Tay Davis has his pocket picked and then a frustration foul backs down kadoo playoff football is in the air as the races come down to the wire you can stream every NFL on CBS playoff game from the wild card through the AFC Championship live on Paramount Music plus the foul to Tay Davis his first Tay Davis has been a critical part of filling in while Burton has been out but it feels like his rhythm has been off today been a little bit off yeah again Carolina defense has been solid theyve bodied him up pretty good and they forced a couple of turnovers when hes had the ball with his back to the basket Notre D trying to use length to disrupt in the lane yeah they want to play with long arms is how they phrase it and thats one theyll live with because kadoo had gone three of his last 22 from behind The Arc in his last seven ball game so thats one Notre Dame will test him on Burton trying to find his rhythm cuts to the cup and puts it in oh nice job getting back by locko pal denied of the dribble Drive Davis the by Alo thats been a matchup thats a foul on the floor thats two on a Applause Music loo good look here Rhythm three for Elliot CAD and then at the other end heres Marcus Burton doing what he can do explosive step and a nice finish the Irish have missed that ability of his to go solo and make it happen Jackson what a move Fall Away a little short so how does that second foul for AO impact the rotation granted what are the minutes possibilities for Burton well you look at the score and time you oh theres a nice look oh my Marcus Burton showing you that explosiveness but I think if youre Micah Shrewsberry obviously you could trust AO with two fouls but the situation of the game good take and nice roll that time by Washington so you try to hang on here and feel the sense of the game as long as you maintain reasonable contact I dont think you risk the third foul for a lock off Tay Davis picks up the pound and Burton he might be getting hot here good look better block timer ticks Shrewsberry five to shoot Roper isolated up fake trying to hold the pivot rejected as the timer hit zero its a shot clock violation I thought there were a couple of shots that should have been taken earlier he had a little jump hook before he got into this trick bag and that just played right into the hands of Washington and I think Jackson was in the picture as well for Carolina but the defense again has been really tight airtight by Carolina Hubert Davis has to be pleased with that thats what he talked to us about prior to the game that we got to defend rebound and take care of the ball and if we do those things at a decent level we give ourselves a great chance to win Notre Dame averages 10 and 1 12 giveaways a game already eight with four to go in the first half yeah thats the problem thats been a huge part of the issue pal wide open well thats by Design John well get a foul on the floor well sort it out when were back most to their best yeah Kansas City fan here plenty of those folks all over the country another nice pass by Davis and Washington got his feet tangled up there but the difference has been the points in the paint 16 to8 so far in favor of Carolina it was one of the highlighted bullet points for Micah Shrewsberry for his team to keep that ball out of the have been unsuccessful in doing so foul before the break by the way went on sundra his first team sixth so the Tar Heels will a bonus the rest of this half shuberry floats it up and back Taps it out to rer good play Burton off the bounce and whistle foul the Applause floor well you can see the element that Notre Dame was missing the last several games Marcus Burton had backto back buets and he can get into the paint easier than any other Notre Dame player off the dribble and that helps a lot you had mentioned the number earlier when he plays a full game Irish four and one Applause y Burton the J screen oh what a pick sure Applause was kesn Shrewsberry begging for it weak side Burton steps into it in and out oh and a physical bite for the ball J well get his first this got tangled up here and there you see it yeah wasnt as much a foul as that J just got tangled up and when thats the case the benefit of the doubt goes to the offense so one and one here for jayid Washington just 58 this year last year was in the mid60s North Carolina lives at the line of the year four five as a team today coming up ATT at the half Adam Wally and Jay willll have their first half analysis preview of game two of our triple header number 25 Baler number three Iowa State get you caught up on scores and highlights a busy Saturday of college hoops ATT at the half and today marks the first day the entire ACC is playing exactly and I think there are four ranked versus ranked games where both teams are ranked three of those games are in the SEC another indication of that Leagues dominance having a supreme year only one ranked ACC team right now in Duke last couple of weeks yeah youve got Clemson and pit that have both flirted with the rankings BT nearly stumbles now he does they maintain possession Shrewsberry top window three and Tippy toeing the in line saved by Washington well Notre Dame just trying to hang on here try to keep this lead from ballooning the double digits Matt alako has been out for a couple of minutes hes a secondary ball handler and a really outstanding threepoint shooter Burton has been smothering Davis Jackson kick ball move the timer back to 20 after it had wilted to five yeah and he can just feel a bit of that wear down effect from Hubert Daviss team mhm good call John youre right he was upbeat both coaches were really when we talked to him this morning Jackson Baseline K what a half well thats a Scouting Report very down right there cuz he was far too open thats a play they looked at shoot around and just a defensive breakdown that time T Davis thats probably his first aggressive drive and hit it is John the other times hes patted it a little too much put it on the floor and lost it but that time it was pretty straight line and efficient how kick Kad steps into it and Js got it under two minutes Burton has a big put it up and in love that offensive attack that quick thrust John its get it up as quick as you can and then see if you can get a quality look early and that time they did effectively Burton now with six oh what beautiful passing and a travel Tay Davis launched and he pined jayen Washington into the steps wow well that was well executed on the little pick and pop here you see quick thrust nice little brush screen hes got the big guy back pedling right into his midrange stroke well done by the Fighting Irish there a chance now to shave a little more off this deficit its shocking the games as close as it is with how its felt yeah good point really good point just enough timely baskets by Notre Dame to maintain some Applause contact kzne Applause driving on kadoo to shoot Bo you cant leave it you cant be loose with it around K boy he almost snatched it you got to be tight with your handle around him now Baseline trigger here eight on the timer five to shoot Burton open three side K excuse me John but he dodged one there I was watching had the isolated cam on RJ and Burton shook him free and had a quality look great pass tank Davis fouled hell go to the line and thats what he does best right yeah exactly yeah good work here in the twom man pick and roll nice little pocket pass and then Davis lamenting the fact that wasnt an and one you get one like that with his ability to finish youre hoping to convert that one his second free throw try of the game is first make stream CBS Sports HQ your free 247 snapshot of all the sports that matter to you catch highlights indepth analysis and breaking news anywhere you are download the CBS Sports app to watch today now Davis has been living at the line of leate mhm I think seven attempts a game in his last few take a peek at my sheet here yeah thats what he was averaging seven free throw attempts per game oh they didnt track Ian Jackson down and got lucky follow and a foul I tell you both both teams have dodged some defensive breakdown bullets here in the last couple of possessions now the foul goes on tay Davis so he has two with 44 seconds before halftime and it looks like kzn will go to the table presumably for Davis yeah I agree I think youre exactly right John well good work that time by Allan Luben he Luben he mentioned his ties having played for Notre Dame also time with former Carolina star Jerry stack house as his head coach at vanderville yeah averaged 12 points a game and six boards at Vandy last year as a starter hasnt played to that level but giving them some nice minutes here today how not that So Tay Davis stays in its roer who subed out yeah you know you know 44 seconds to go youve got an offensive possession maybe a second one depending I think theyre just going to try to get a quality shot here oh no it looks like theyre going two two for one well done well done well not as much differential as I thought only about 2 and 12 seconds but a good play that time by Marcus Burton until the break quality finish thats all theyll play maybe pick and roll theyve had great success spreading the floor along the Baseline and getting nice bounce passes on cuts from the wing to the goal so theyll look to have kadoo create something they may come up and give him a screen maybe a guard to guard screen inv involving RJ Davis oh the Roper just body blocked Tyson that would have been great on the grid iron but you cant do that in hoops thats going to be his second and its also bonus time sending Tyson to the line thats a bad bad mistake there now Tyson who hasnt quite found Rhythm as a shooter with North Carolina is only five of 10 in a tarel uni at the line but lifetime hes an 84 free throw shooter and a Dynamo from Deep from his Belmont T yeah eventually you would think think hed revert back to the Norms I mean hes a 45 threepoint shooter at Belmont the last two years and as you mentioned 80 plus from the line front end and North Carolina with five fouls do you consider that oh yeah I think you dont want to not use them youve got guys nobody really in foul trouble yeah I would think you strategically using the foul to give dont just foul him because you have it to give let some time elapse so that they have a shorter clock when you do commit the foul so lets see how they play this out Withers comes in for the shooter and Tyson at least thats how I would play it a little pressure here once you get him over half court then maybe you try but it looks like theyre not going to give it there it is thats nicely done and theyre going to call it on the ground second on Kau but a deed on the floor non shooting so now 36 yep so they shadeed what 4 seconds off the clock there still plenty of time for Notre Dame to get a quality look you got to set solid screens here without fouling and then the pass has to be clean and cleanly caught and you got a chance to get into a shot Alo playing with two fouls calls the break Shrewsberry spinning out of the corner hoist near the horn a missfire got a good look though and so shrew stifling that defense was and I thought the same thing I mean they were tied together guys in their gaps eyes on the ball physical is this a different defense to begin the second yeah it looks like a Zone being displayed by Notre Dame again in an effort to try to keep that ball out of the paint and offer a little confusion to the tar Hills as they were clearly expecting man and now have to reset and recalibrate Powell Davis Kau shap it up Davis on the drive rattles in and he passes Armando Bott the outright second leading scorer in North Carolina history and he did it with a nice shot that hes added to his game a little floater although hes had that for the last couple of years he and Badu still chat regularly Im sure they do theres of course a little bit of talking back and forth but they both talk about just being in the presence of great so what a rejection there by Powell the other names on the list to be in that company exactly you just like to be in the conversation when youre a player doing something special and there you see it 2349 and Counting for RJ Davis of course the leading scorer Tyler hbor Shrewsberry out of the corner a little flat hansboro the leading scorer in ACC history and his brother Ben a big part of the the Irish team for years as well one of the tethers between the programs Davis for three its heel the Applause board Tay Davis one of several Irish players had some foul issue in the first draws the foul Applause here hansboro number one RJ Davis now outright number two passing his teammate from as recently as a year ago at acott and the legendary Phil Ford the first freshman to start for Dean Smith back in the day and the smooth shooting Lefty Sam Perkins on that list as well I think hbor is in Comfort Zone I cant see RJ being able to track him down over the remaining portion of his career for the first freshman to start in his Collegiate debut was a critical part of four tournament teams yep one of the alltime college great had a good NBA career as well so Notre Dame only had three free throw attempts to makes in the entire first half already a couple here to begin the second we did see Micah Shrewsberry speaking with lead official Brian oconnell at Great length at the end of the first half good look there by Jackson whos got 19 Jay W hes going north of 20 today you dont even have to worry about that it just looks so smooth I mean almost easy at times oh man hes a bucket getter and hes got a unique ability because he gets it at all three levels and hes got a composure to his game that belies his Youth and thats a good looking shot there by Shrewsberry can Notre Dame string together consecutive stops North Carolina has really done a nice job executing offensively and I give this guy a lot of credit RJ Davis hes been patient hes been on target with his passes that was a bit of a force by Applause kadoo Alo hard screen thats a foul on J thatll be his second heres Ian Jackson and this is just going to work folks pretty good defensive possession positioned by Alo and there Shrewsberry taking advantage of his size on the smaller Eliot Kad there got to a spot and then created the space he Applause Music needed oh what a feed right down the grand of the lane seal and sing Jaylen Washington thats big time well executed beautiful hook pass and in a nice roll good sealing roll sometimes guys roll and just roll to a spot that time jayen Washington rolled into a Defender and put him on his back so he could finish on the catch I usually go seated with cream cheese myself yeah I can handle that too in line drive with a foul you saw the foul concern that has mounted some for a thinner Notre Dame team and here comes the return of Burton you know was interesting talking to michah Shrewsberry we wondered why Burton wouldnt start if he was coming back warm up and then start he actually was thinking more about the second half of the game in terms of having Burton who hasnt played in several weeks be in a position to see if he can act in fact finish the game as the minutes and intensity pickup in the second half perhaps bad pass misfire to Alo Carolina has maintained this multi possession lead as a matter of fact there only been a single possession game it hasnt been one since way back at 1412 in terms of the score yeah the lead is ballooned to a dozen and theres just been a a calmness about the execution of this star heel team well one of the things Notre Dame doesnt do is disrupt you defensively theyre not going to get out and pressure you and force turnovers and get into you theyve got to do it a little differently and as a result you can find a comfort level if youre the opposing team this time good activity though I think Davis got a hand on that ball and was able to force the held ball there and Nota Dame comes the other way with it heres Burton Burton gets fed against Kad screen from sunro slips through nice Spin and a kick timer back to Applause 20 so what kind of actions work best for the Irish to to get some Rhythm well weve seen when theyve thrusted quickly theyve gotten some quality shots fighting this halfcourt defense because Carolina is so locked in and playing a physical brand of Defense too bumping Cutters and pressuring the ball and attacking the the screens see everybodys in solid position here Shrewsberry contested hit the top of the backboard and the iron somehow sundra got it pocket picked Kad funnel to Davis right at a lock go Mr Jacksons for real plus 14 without scoring all that much hes only taking five shots been an excellent fourth floor game from RJ Davis thus far but this is the end of the floor where Carolina has really asserted itself defensively and Hubert Davis talked about that when they defend at a high level is Marcus Burton doing what he can do gets isolated and hell have an an one CH and does it with a composure and Poise that is um fun to watch he never seems to be out of sort certainly today hes been fully within himself nothing Force no strain a foul before the break went to RJ Davis as his second teams third so Burton caps off the end one hes got nine Burton look good considering he hasnt played live game action and several weeks Jackson giving the isolation oh the creativity kiss miss but hell go to the line thats the ground level Bronx Boogie yeah that was all of that its been three years at Cardinal Hayes and then Our Savior Lutheran in the good old Boogie Down boul here charged to sundra that gives him two so now Jackson at the stripe he already has 21 his young season and career high as 26 that was a couple of games ago against Campbell its only his third straight start it was the injury to Trimble that opened that door I I have to think hell be starting the rest of the way well itll be interesting to see what happens once Treno comes back I mean the strength of this team is clearly his perimeter as he misses two free throws but yeah thatll be an interesting situation to watch Once Trumble is back Hubert Davis you had asked him and he said he hopes hell be back soon he was optimistic but no specific timeline exactly Burton oh just right down the grain of the lane hell shoot a Applause couple well with him back in the lineup his ability to do just what he did there get into the paint with some force and draw fouls gives Notre Dame a chance to kind of re establish a different Rhythm one of the ways you can break up an opposing teams Rhythm Is by getting to the foul you make them have to stop you knock down free throws and you can chip away at the Applause lead F to CAU his third at the Irish this year at home six and one they score over 80 points a game in this building they shoot 50 from the field they are well off both Paces so far thanks to the tarel defense all credit to North Carolina in that regard the entire Notre Dame bench is up as active as its been all game again this is close as close as the Irish have been for a little while as well tarel spread the floor Davis been more of a Creator today opposite wide open pow rolls around the miss Alo snaap to Shrewsberry double close out Alo cut kick Corner Davis upake to the two Hand k seven unanswered in less than a minute and a half Jackson bumped stepping back long two and an offensive foul I thought a couple of shots should have been taken before this dunk by Tay Davis but ball movement penetration Drive the close out Withers came out off balance and Tay Davis got all the way to the rack its hard to chase that ball when its moving that fast if youre on defense fou to Pal his third so both and K each have Applause three Carolina already with five CH fouls and Notre Dame only two that was kind of flipped in the first half as North Carolina enjoyed an eightpoint difference at the free throw line good off he gets a third on Davis and a chance at a threepoint play to make it a onepoint game Applause beautiful work footwork balance tight handle got Davis to join the paratroopers club and then drew the contact well he looks really good considering again hes missed several weeks but you can see the competitor fire and spirit in him too the throwing foul concerned the lead whittel to one kick Corner K Tyson a Locka Burton down low sundra Music and a foul and Burton to the line with a chance to give the Irish their first lead since it was 98 yeah his ability to get into the paint by himself Michael Shrewsberry talked to us about that he can get in there without any help he can go isolation you can sometimes set a screen for him but he doesnt need it this quickness and ball skills allow him to get to the paint and hes a oneman wrecking crew right now deadlocked and its bonus rest of the way for the Irish thats a big deal that is a big deal to flip that script because it was all Carolina at the line Notre Dame only took a couple of free throws in that first half actually only made a couple two out of three Carolina was 10 of 11 and with the situation being what it is John and with his ability to put pressure on you defensively attacking the paint Carolinas going to have to do a bang up job defending without fouling the rest of the way Burton is back he has the Irish on his back he gets a breather in a 120 run yeah good use of a the pending media timeout Jackson fouled as the ball was coughed up here by Shrewsberry hes looking to get Marcus Burton significant rest time although only limited time will go off the clock here boy that looked fairly clean fou to sundra his third Jackson surrounded and hounded Davis Jackson flat the Comfort level that Carolina was playing with a little bit ago you can see its starting to dissipate because of Notre Dame picking it up offensively now playing with a little more Edge than bite defensively Tay Davis and a blocking foul jayen Withers trying to step up his first Notre Dameon excellent free throw shooting team 75 on the season and Tay Davis is 77 himself and he normally draws a lot of fouls hes third in the ACC in free throw attempts that hadnt been as much a part of the puzzle today yeah not not yet but again with Carolina being over the limit and Notre Dame with only three team fouls back Tapped Out of Applause Bounds Seth tribl getting active on the Notre Dame uh the North Carolina bench Notre Dame bench has been up pretty much since the half it was Trimble by himself who was standing a moment ago and this this is a case where you want to come down and execute something really solid here if youre Carolina you dont have RJ Davis on the floor nice little fade screen good take beautiful just what you needed its your best score something going to the Applause rim now hes got 23 points in four consecutive games that snapped a 120 run Shrewsberry flies to the ball hey Applause Alo has been a little shy to shoot after the sluggish start TR that Kell throws it Applause up out of the corner ground and down Withers puts it home now as you mentioned dead ball means IM media you can feel that I think each team needs a breather right now yeah typically theyre geared to go four minutes maybe four and a half or five but after that both teams start looking for oxygen Tay Davis giving the isolation on Tyson goes in line Cuts in and puts it home five Applause out Gau picks up the Applause pound single digits on the timer Canó fouled thatll be four on sundra oh this thing is picked up the last several minutes partner back and forth we go as tight as one could have it alako knocking down that three for the Irish and Tay Davis to the rack we got a snug one here players big men that have played at North Carolina and this has totally been a script flip from the first half to the second as we look at the foul trouble the only one in danger with at Notre Dame but you see Carolina with four guys in foul trouble and the number of free throws taken and made this half has totally flipped and the rebounding story has flipped and typically John defense rebounding free throws turnovers are what you look at his barometers as whos going to win and right now Notre Dame has been able to get back in this game in this second half because theyve gotten to the foul line more in part because of this guy here Marcus Burton has been terrific and theyve also rebound Ed it better and thats led to better defense too heres Burton grief switch had a big touch to Tay Davis approach the Midway point of the half Burton could feel kads presence he almost welcomes it J couldnt handle out of bounds and Burton got the shot he wanted to he got that defender on his backside and thats one hes expecting to knock down sold out building just over 9000 strong tied at 53 healthy amount of Tar Hill or Carolina blue in the building as well Jackson tip ball Burton wins it against a big snap to Shrewsberry transition triple got it boy good job to get back nice transition bucket by Shrewsberry and then a good job by the Irish to get back defensively alyo but they didnt match up John what a find by Kad has a high arching rainbow to Applause Withers and there was a disjointed jumble to the early phase of this game but now it feels like they are throwing punches they really are back and forth Tay Davis good up fake leans Miss follow out of bounds its getting physical Music kadoo great vision and the backside cut and nobody had Jaylen Withers defended for Notre Dame there you see AO coming up to stop the rle man Jaylen Washington and that left Withers all alone on the backside great find by Kad Burton off the bounce right through a double rejected good defense Applause oh great give RJ Davis stride inside explodes to the rim fouled by ji got him to just hack down thatll be his Applause third good penetration by Burton but there you see good break of the contact that time by Jaylen Washington he didnt allow the guard to get that body into him stayed away and then was able to use the length to get a piece first free throw try of the day for RJ Davis last years ACC Player of the Year numbers decidedly down this year he does have that wrap on his right hand whats the difference for Davis I think part of it is the role that he has to play with this group you know last year he was with some more experienced and boisterous guys too hes more of a quiet reserved personality terrific competitor and player so hes had to kind of adjust to figuring out how he can best impact this group oddly enough when we chatted with Hubert Davis he pointed at Parallels for his own career in that way exactly yeah he had a period this junior year where he had certain guys that were part of oh wow terrific use of the glass and the hard drive and pullup but yeah there were pray parallels in terms of who youre with from your Junior to senior year the personalities and the games of those guys can make a difference Washington with a fury this is shades of how the tarel started the game yeah Applause well these teams have played some close ones recently I think the last five games what decided by 15 points or so in this building yeah yeah and North Carolina has swatted seven shots in this game look at that ball pressure by Applause Kad T Davis kick Corner Shrewsberry angled shot got it he is feeling it heres a lot of time left in this game Davis Jackson first shot in the while R them off a bit Washington wins Applause it Kau driving on Burton ji has it foul Jaylen Washington over the back boy thats one Kad wants back he made a great move to get himself clear for that layup and just didnt finish it Jaylen Washington off the pick and roll and then step back three for Shrewsberry oo strapping in John our energy turn since halftime yes yes back and forth and that foul situation still very much in favor of Notre Dame the next Carolina foul is the double bonus Notre Dame still with a foul to give and last foul to jayid Washington is his second thats off the heel and Washingtons got the Applause board but now I mean this tight game and both teams doing a good job defensively its execution taking care of the ball quality shots Burton Jed free 16 to shoot loose balls all the winning stuff now is Amplified five Micah Shrewsberry team six one at home the Tar Heels 12 in True Road games losses at Kansas and recently at Louisville RJ Davis steps into it well thats a great shot for a good shooter whos just struggled with his field goal percentage both inside the arc and Beyond it thats one youll take every time you get it if youre Carolina Burton hold of the pivot tough match up here for Withers did a nice job Tay Davis K make over Canó this is the largest Notre Dame lead of the game they seven down at halftime to plus four theyve done it by getting to the free throw line oh what a run by Ian Jackson Young fella as I see you and I like what I see man can he score hes got 25 one off his blossoming career high oh great give out of Applause bounds excellent take here by Tay Davis he got the smaller Defender Jack Washington not able to get it denied and then here you see just a quick burst by Ian Applause Jackson that was a relatively rare giveaway there for Notre Dame Clark they had cut down a turnovers dramatically since the break they have theres one Loose by Ian Applause Jackson Burton lurks in that left corner matched up with RJ Davis Michael Shrewsberry calls the play Led Penn State to the big dance at a tournament win now in year two with the Irish theres his son in and Applause Music out Withers double comes Burton Applause fouled double bonus time now for Notre Dame thats an unfortunate bounce there not a clean catch Lets see we catch the tail end of it there that ball got loose I dont know if Notre Dame deflected initially on the attempt to throw it inside or if it was just a sloppy catch he let go but either way Notre Dame gets free throws thats now three on Jay Washington so five tar Hills with three fouls hes more than just a doctor hes a detective Morris Chestnut stars in the new CBS original series Watson his Mystery Begins CBS Sunday January 2 six after the AFC Championship Notre Dame at three free throw attempts in the first half they now have 12 since the break but Burton short and Z missed the front end of one and one just a couple of possessions ago but theyve still made good use of the advantage at the free throw line all day rainbow make pow pops it in Burton showing the shake off the bounce and a whistle that was Kad the primary Defender talk it over here yes itll be Kad with his fourth foul love the fact that Powell just steps into that with confidence no hesitation at all two on the ball somebodys open it was Drake pow and he sprayed it well po been coming on 26 points the last couple of games yeah thats right and hes made 42 of his thre so hes capable from out there doesnt have a huge number of threepoint attempts but that was a big one boy John I think were going to expect a steady diet good job here Micah Shrewsberry again knowing that mik Marcus Burton hasnt played a lot trying to milk his stamina for the remainder of this game youre looking at a media timeout under the 4minute mark So plus two give him a chance to get additional rest as you head towards the final stretch and hope that hes able to carry you to the Finish Line po up the up fake he stepped out of play out of bounds and each moment heightened now Hubert Davis and North Carolina have had trouble finishing in games this year that really showed up spectacularly at Louisville on New Years Day yeah and you can clearly see that PO looked like both feet may have been out of bounds there you know I didnt play with the threepoint line in college but I still it still baffles me that you would be on the floor and step out of bounds as much as you see it happen in games across the country you got to recognize where you are and stay inside the court Shrewsberry got hit no call no shot Jackson on the Sprint Powell surveys Applause arj Davis Irish Ball yeah so often its those Shooters hunting for that corner three oh I know exactly what leads to it but thats why you practice yeah and you think possession probably dominates everything else alako give the isolation on Jackson look short Jacksons got it and the end Coast to Coast its a career day from a Tar Hill freshman oh man Applause woo special T Davis Applause fouled he was determined to go rack to rack with pumpkin and nobody was going to stop Ian Jackson hes had some kind of day six boards and 26 points a game shes a joy to watch Ive caught her a couple of times this season and her and her teammates doing major work two shots for Tay Davis you saw that Burton back in for Micah Shrewsberry very much is a parallel to adalo in his efforts with the mens team here Music y one of two at the Line Washington the board Iris have left a little cheese on that stripe here the last few minutes John they have missed four of their 16 at the line including as you mentioned a Miss on the front end of a one and one two I like the ball in his hands Ian Jackson and he turns it over yeah he tried to do a little too much maybe should have given it up and gotten it back that time dance with it just a tad long so heres Notre Dame with the lead Irish havent hit a field goal in the nearly four minutes theyve been living at the line mhm theyve got decent shots though Burton Applause off RJ Davis all want a seal pave the pack Washington open the door good call youre exactly right escorted RJ right to the Applause thre Tay Davis Shrewsberry in that right corner contested rejected and he stays with it you know hes such a hard cover because of B smaller guy he can overpower a bigger guy he can go around Davis wi side Applause alaka Burton contested rattles in Burtons back T up Applause Carolina when I was younger my calling was to play football but As I Grew Older I grew wiser I realized life isnt about how many people you can knock down its about how many people you can lift up at Ram our calling is to build gamechanging trucks so when you find your

refreshment things back on C life choose chill 111 to go in regulation Tar Heels have the ball the arrow a double bonus for the Irish staying with it persistence pays thats Davis after being denied on his initial shot this is good defense and just a tough shot put it up there soft on the goal did Marcus Burton and michah Shrewsberry strategy didnt start Marcus in his first return after being out with an injury for several weeks elected to try to milk and massage his minutes in the first half so that he could be ready for this stretch run and its playing out exactly as coach Shrewsberry had hoped and now Carolina theyve had a couple of turnovers and missed a couple of good shots I mean thats been the difference between them being 8 and six and 10 and four and here we go again out of the Tar Hill timeout Jackson Kad gives it away now Notre Dame could work clock oh yeah and theyre going to leave it in his hands until hes ready to make a decision Marcus Burton Yep this is the right play up three holding that pivot loses handle off his own leg its tarhill ball timer off 291 great defense by North Carolina there terrific Washington stayed disciplined even though he left his feet momentarily and then had the deflection right off of Marcus Burtons leg so now you got to go for a quality quick look here if youre Carolina based on the clock here and the score being what it is yeah thats a nice take Kad right to the rim puts it in timeout exactly the way to do that dont settle for a three lay up a quick score is what youre trying to get there now defensively Jay R and ey when we sit next to each other in the studio I let him Coach so he would say here is a situation where you basically are going to try to trap one time really hard no foul and then ultimately if you if they get out of that trap then you you foul immediately so you give yourself one time the Trap oh they went more than that okay now youve got a foul yeah there you go okay not bad so you lose seven s thats thats well done I dont know if you could do it much better than that but its still not yet bonus you got to foul one more time to send him to the line oh no this is this is shooting for sure yeah you were looking at I think the Notre Dame side there John yeah there theres double double here for these guys Soo 91 last year at Princeton second best of the country Kad comes back in as North Carolina goes noticeably smaller and able to drive a bit better if he makes this then its another quick attack of the rim if you happen to be able to kick it for a three maybe you do but I think you quickly attack the rim and try to get something in the first five to six seconds at the bucket they looking for a three yeah theyre looking for a three now k 4 three hes f F he has a chance at a fourpoint play hes tied 22 in his last seven games thats right he not going down earlier today for the lead timeout North Carolina well take one as well Burton a strong shooter has not hit a three in the game his first action since late November North Carolina has no timeouts Tay Davis can run in line entry to Burton Burton up and a miss the follow wav off it came late the tar Hills take down Notre Dame in South Bend 7473 Applause
